Polaris is a good this, sweet thing, especially if it locked in different way. So we can't to jump to it directly. So we should jump to it using something. Some tunnel. High wake? Black Hole? Yes, I know BHs is a old thing and was investigated from all sides by many people. Did some tried to scan it using wake scanner?.. Probably yes. So if this system lock isn't bug, then there must be a game mechanics. My minds about Guru's messages? He found something what give him absolute happy or absolute unhappy. It may be Raxxla or maybe nothing. And he try to save the miracle or legend. For our hopes. Sorry friends, I don't know right words. Also this thing (even "nothing") is hard linked (tied?) to his way.
