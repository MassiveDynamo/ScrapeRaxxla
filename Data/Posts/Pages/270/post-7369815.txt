Let's further assume he has given us hints he assumes will guide one or the other to the destination. This is what I deduct:

a) Go to Mars/ read text:

The Mars text is a brief paragraph about that non-human artifact found on Mars. He quoted it in his post announcing the finding of Raxxla. The only thing of note was that the ships coming into the tourist spot were mostly Orcas with typical tourist names, and one Hauler named Red Planet Taxi belonging to Pirigen Guardians of Tradition that flew around for a while and waked out when I followed it for a while. I did not have a manifest scanner or wake scanner, unfort.


b) Kore/Demeter/Persephone:

Persephone is the last planet (system map, not orrery) in the Sol system, a landable 2G ice world, 400k LS from the Sun. Has a government installation in orbit named Primary Transport Authority. T7 named WayFinder piloted by Neil Horsburgh flew around for a while. Scanning the installation starts a scenario where it gets attacked by ships with names like Dark Aspirant or similar. The installation asks for help defending, but I had to run away as I wasn't in a combat ship.

c) Concerning Eleusis: getting near a Demeter Class ship

The following systems exist: Athena, Demeter, Persephone, Hecate, Zeus, Tartarus, Styx, Eleu.

"A series of scenarios" at certain locations related to Greek mythology seems plausible. Bring a combat ship (he suggests a Cobra, heh).

EDIT: Unrelated: Pirigen is near Kappa Doradus (K Doradus, I guess, comes before L Doradus / Eldorado, and, rofl, Lambda Doradus does exist, as do Alpha - Nu (half the alphabet)).
