From what he posted I suspect he’s either trolling the thread or having a nervous breakdown. This thread requires proof, i.e. a photo (& video) of a significant find. The photo he supplied as “evidence” was of a mission target to kill a FDL named Vicious Hades piloted by Alexander Macdonald flying in a wing whose faction was Hand Gang of LP102-320. He implied the mission was found by decoding the Eleusinian Mysteries mythology with a rambling discourse which contained no facts as to how this was supposed to reveal Raxxla. He was in a wing of 3 but his wingmates (clearly named on-screen as Markodan & Markospliff) have not come forward to support his ramblings in this thread.

I really don’t know why there is so much ongoing discussion, have the participants never encountered trolling before? Ignore it unless there is real revelation with evidence!

You spelled my name wrong
