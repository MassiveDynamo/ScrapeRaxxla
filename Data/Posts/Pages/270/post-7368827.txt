I'm thankful you clarified this. Especially, because at Canonn, it created sorts of a sect. Believers, throwing their blatant faith around without being able to accept facts. Not only that, but even labelling everyone, criticizing either Guru or his theory, as trolls.

Sad to see Canonn ended up being rather a church to non-evident based bull.

I've been in that discord for weeks now - that never happened. If it did - i would've been the first to receive the flak from "sect" since i was sh#tting on guru the hardest.
