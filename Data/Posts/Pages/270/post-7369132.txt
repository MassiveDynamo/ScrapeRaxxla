Hmm, which INRA base did you check? The Hermitage one worked fine for me when I checked it, and I also found one of the other ones completely randomly while flying a new alt out to the Pleiades. (Wasn’t looking for INRA bases at that point, Hermitage is the one I know off the top of my head, and I haven’t got any of the other systems memorised, so didn’t realise where I was until I actually reached the base.)

Think it was Taylor Keep on 12 Trianguli. Purposefuly hadn’t been there. Human (actually showed as Guardian) signal showed in fss scan. Expected that the base would show when I got within 1000ls but didn’t. Did a planet probe but that didn’t localise it. Had to get down to about 60km away for it to show, thereafter shows up fine. May have been a bug ....
