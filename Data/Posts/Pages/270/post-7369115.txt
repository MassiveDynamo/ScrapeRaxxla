I think mouse is better than either joystick or controller. I use my HOTAS for IL2 BoX as well, and joysticks don't last forever. I can't bring myself to use a joystick for what is, essentially, a turret. I wouldn't use the joystick in a rear gunner position in a WW2 plane either. It's unnecessary wear on the equipment, and doesn't feel right either. Most other FSS controls are mapped to my throttle, and the combination does work pretty quickly.

Mouse & keyboard are out for me, desk too high & hotas is in the way. Not a big fan of the mouse at all, tends to trigger off my arthritis. Thinking about splashing out on either a Virpil or VKB all-metal joystick
