From what CMDRGuru951 has posted thus far, it sounds like there's basically a (long) series of quests missions given by various NPCs, triggered by various factors (mostly finding the right stations, possibly having specific names for your ship, etc.), that we can decode and follow to find Raxxla. All very confusing and convoluted, Braben-style. And it's all about the journey, rather than the destination, possibly because the destination is a big whoop. Like, what you guys are guessing, Polaris. "Epic mission arc" with the rewards being a permit and possibly access to a Dark Wheel station with all ships discounted 40% or whatever.

So, basically, he COULD post a step-by-step guide for all the missions, like they have for MMO's or single-player RPG's, but such a spoiler would basically ruin the experience for everyone interested in trying to figure out this mystery. And the reward at the end is basically not much.

That's my take on it.

Now, whether or not I feel like unraveling the whole thing anymore, not really. Because it doesn't sound like he had a fun experience.

But, I guess, it's one epic mission arc, in a game that's otherwise a sandbox. Might be fun for someone.
