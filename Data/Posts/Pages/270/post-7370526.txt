I have been playing with keyboard and mouse for a month now, and I'm really starting to like it. Controlling ship trajectory and velocity is slowly beginning to feel stable. Combat is fun again, now it makes sense, and there are things to achieve. I have been bounty hunting close to the Omega Mining Operation lately, this used to be such a quiet place before. I have no idea what happened. I wonder if I should ask if these expedition people would let me go along. Jorki, have you ever listened to the Elite Dangerous soundtrack? Such nice background music, and fancy pictures too.

I got to Combat Elite back in ‘84 with mouse & keyboard; nowadays I’m too old for combat, I don’t enjoy it & only do it when necessary. I do like hotas, it requires less movement, less spreading of the fingers/bending of wrists & is more immersive (no plane ever came with a mouse & kbd, you couldn’t control it in even a low g manoeuvre).

There is a secondary DW2 roster open for a short while for late signups, though the Fleetcom PG is currently not accepting new entrants due to the backlog but will reopen shortly. Mobius or other PGs can be used (not Open, gankers are following the fleet!). Not sure if Fleetcom Discord is open to new entrants at the moment, I gather everyone was caught out by the huge rush following FD newsletter & livestreams-fleet membership currently around 13 thousand! But you don’t even need to join the roster or PG or Discord to tag along, the itinerary is published in a forum thread.

which soundtrack do you mean?
