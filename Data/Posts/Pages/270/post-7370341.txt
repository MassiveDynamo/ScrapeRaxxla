Mouse & keyboard are out for me, desk too high & hotas is in the way. Not a big fan of the mouse at all, tends to trigger off my arthritis. Thinking about splashing out on either a Virpil or VKB all-metal joystick

I have been playing with keyboard and mouse for a month now, and I'm really starting to like it. Controlling ship trajectory and velocity is slowly beginning to feel stable. Combat is fun again, now it makes sense, and there are things to achieve. I have been bounty hunting close to the Omega Mining Operation lately, this used to be such a quiet place before. I have no idea what happened. I wonder if I should ask if these expedition people would let me go along. Jorki, have you ever listened to the Elite Dangerous soundtrack? Such nice background music, and fancy pictures too.
