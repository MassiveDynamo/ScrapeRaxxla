Just tried the galmap search bar with 36031831136536939, Pareco Comet 2, and Pareco comet, nothing worked
but Halley's comet does highlight SOl, weird!

and how come the two Imgur image links Ive posted above worked when I pasted them in, and now don't???
edit: repasted the links!

Edit2: checked system Siren but it’s well off the path Sol-Sirius-Ejagham. Ministry is perhaps close enough to that path, but don’t really see a fit to “parent’s grief”
I think only the named comets are searchable in the galmap.
