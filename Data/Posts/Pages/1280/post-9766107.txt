Mmmm, since the start menu pic is clearly heavily manipulated (depicts impossible orbital dynamics?) it might be just hinting that the TDW station is hidden somewhere within Ejagham not just around planet 4. And IIRC Rochester had some indication that "TDW station is not in-game at the current time" (not got the reference for this mate!), HOWEVER that would be quite true if conditions haven't yet been made to instantiate it from the server!
