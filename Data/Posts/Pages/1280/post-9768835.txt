Now, whether we are searching for something physical? Probably. Though, I think there is something to the "cosmic enlightenment" mentioned in the Codex. I have some ideas on this based on the earliest colonization efforts which were largely detailed in Frontiers gazette. I also believe there is more than one stargate (or Faraway network node). In the images from "Tour of the Universe" there are three so one probably one per superpower but that's just a guess. I believe the old lore is there if one only pays attention. I think the artificial structures and artificial power sources aren't human built but humans are trying to understand them. Faraway network very much sounds like it may possibly be the same network mentioned in "Alien World: A complete Illustrated Guide". If anything, Raxxla was lost because we forgot where we came from. It just doesn't make sense that we had independent navigation then suddenly we don't. No, we found artifacts of a long dead civilization and that became Faraway network. But, if we want to find this we need to seek out what happened in the earliest of colonies. If there's a place we need to start looking, it's at those systems and reconnect the missing pieces.
I can't help myself of think that a generation ship were se close from Raxxla during its journey: THETIS!
When you read the creepy logs, they tell us the comms got a message from a planet in a system they visited 15ly ago at a point between Sol (start? or another old world) and Nefertem (where the generation currently is).
People searched for it but never find it.
Bug? "Intended gameplay"? or something else...
