Thread '[Canonn Science Report] Generation Ship Thetis investigation.'

It is suspicious, and this is another area Im keen to explore (one of many), now granted there are no direct links towards Raxxla, but it does occurr within the sphere of influence set out by the date from Tau Ceti, and itâ€™s pretty peculiar.

We have no concrete evidence to state otherwise, but if it were on a direct line of sight trajectory from Sol, then we need to look for a system (at that time uninhabited) 15lyrs away, in line with Sol. And then apply a 15lyr bubble around it to search.

If relevant it could provide a temporal hotspot within the sphere of influence - if relevant.
