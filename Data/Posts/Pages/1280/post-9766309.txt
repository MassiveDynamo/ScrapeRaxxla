Mmmm, since the start menu pic is clearly heavily manipulated (depicts impossible orbital dynamics?) it might be just hinting that the TDW station is hidden somewhere within Ejagham not just around planet 4. And IIRC Rochester had some indication that "TDW station is not in-game at the current time" (not got the reference for this mate!), HOWEVER that would be quite true if conditions haven't yet been made to instantiate it from the server!

My indication of the real DW not being present currently, was an assumption, based upon the FD feedback to a loaded question about the DW invite in the Codex and invite in the game manual, compared against the logic outlined in the codex - ergo that that the real DW faction is technically never visible in game, so can only ever be found via the supposed invite or finding the station, so technically FD are indicating by reference in the codex and manual these elements are active!

I followed on that if this was not the case then FD are technically advising consumers to waste their time tilting at windmills (not in so many words… but the intent was loaded).

It’s true their response was arbitrary but my initial question was loaded, so to answer with any response other than ‘it’s a bug, working, or lore; indicates (to me at least) affirmation of a positive response.

FD response was that: ‘there are certain factions and invites’ (namely the real DW) that are not currently active’.

This of course doesn’t mean the station isnt accessible currently, just the faction and invite (but why)?

Again it was an assumption only, I hope I am wrong.
