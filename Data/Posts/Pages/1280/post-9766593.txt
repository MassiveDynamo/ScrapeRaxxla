Regarding Shinrarta's logs, i have this:

SPOILER: SHINRARTA DEZHRA'S LOGS

The crash at ID 68 doesn't only happen in this system, but even to others (i still doesn't figure out why, it's not related to station type)
Hope it can help

Edit: Once you done all stations, the next ID to search crash the galmap, so stations are the last 'objects' to be detected.

I notice the comets only seem to be associated with event "SupercruiseExit". Perhaps that's why they dont show up on scans. Must check Halley's & Grey's for event type!

Edit: mm, also â€œSupercruiseExit"
