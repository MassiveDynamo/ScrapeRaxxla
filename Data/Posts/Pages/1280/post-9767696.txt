I notice the comets only seem to be associated with event "SupercruiseExit". Perhaps that's why they dont show up on scans. Must check Halley's & Grey's for event type!

Edit: mm, also â€œSupercruiseExit"
Don't waste your time with that.
Even if you exit supercruise anywhere, you will drop at the nearest body (could be main star, the planet in front of you,...).
The nav beacon/honk give us the bodies but not installations/stations at first and don't show at all comets BEFORE you target them with galmap.
Comets are associated with SupercruiseExit event because it's the only way to come closer to them.

For this:
"Mmm, yes-Grey's comet tracks to Lave. But then how does the search know what is searchable and what is not??
e.g. I assume both Pareco comet 1 and Grey's Comet are "SmallBody" type, not visible in game"

=> I think that if the comet has a different name than its system, it shows in the search.
