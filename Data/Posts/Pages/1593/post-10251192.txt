That's why Ross 54 / HIP 34104 has interested me for some years and I keep coming back to it as it just seems wrong.....

I can search for them both and they appear as their own system in the galaxy map (Ross 54 being the main name), but you can't plot a route to them however you can try and jump to them but the game crashes for me.... and they both (Ross 54 & HIP 34104) are LFT 509 anyway......

Post from earlier in this thread "The System's stars are so far apart, many times longer distance than hutton orbital, that it appears to pointing at empty space."

Why Ross 54/HIP 34104 are noticeably not in LFT 509 (or why they exist at all on the galaxy map!) I don't know, but I agree it would be about .92 LY out from LFT 509 and somewhere good to hide a dark station or Raxxla?


When I raised a ticket about HIP 34104 not appearing in the galaxy map but still being searchable () the response was:



Could this be...
- "A certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place"?
- "door that is also the key."?




The only other mention of LFT 509 in the game that I know of are in the release notes for the 1.2 Wings release where it mentions LFT 509 and two other systems.



1.2 Wings Release Notes: "Adding valuable salvage convoys to three permitted systems: , Isinor, Witch's Reach"

Why add in valuable salvage convoys to a system you can't enter?

Outside of in game official FD LFT 509 references there was the turning the wheel exercise to get the Dark Wheel faction to expand in to LFT 509 (or grant a permit to the system by being within 20 LY) .... Which was admirable and failed to spawn anything..... (Which I thought needed the Pilots' Federation to be pushed out there myself )


It's also a bit weird you can buy the market data for it... Which i did


Then there's EDSM... Did CMDR IRREGULAR HUMAN honk and leave?
(going by the 1 celestial body recorded on there he went to the 7th Moon of an un-named gas giant! LMAO)






Finally I have raised a ticket for not being able to plot a route to Ross 54 (and it not loading the star types in the info), feel free to try it and confirm it and it may get a response and whether it's by design or not! :

Just some thoughts!




"Baddest Jerk Face's" posts that are mentioned in the podcast
