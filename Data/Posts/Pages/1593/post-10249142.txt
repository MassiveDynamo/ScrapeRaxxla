I've given myself a few days to think on it and, after my most recent exploration through the Lost Realms region (mostly spent around the triangle of Epona, Dana and Idunn) I have decided to share a couple of minor details that can very easily be dismissed as down to the procedural generation, yet could be intentional. Better to be safe, in case anything strikes a chord with someone...

1) There is an outpost called Brooks Orbital in orbit of Koknan A 6. (I mapped A 6 and there are just the usual Odyssey POI on the surface).
2) Col 285 Sector ZU-G c10-14 5 is a rare example of an Earth-like World in an uninhabited star system within the Bubble. It is only 237.91 LY from Sol.
3) In HIP 1742 (at Davies Vision iirc), I found a mission-giver on the concourse called Persephone Key (she's the first person on the left when leaving the elevators, before the stairs up to Apex). She was offering an illegal Odyssey mission for the HIP 1742 Purple Posse. I've never done any Odyssey missions and wasn't sure how to complete it so I did not take it.

Additionally, the system Tocorii has three tourist beacons - two ice geysers and a third around a regular high-metal content world with an atmosphere, although there is also an Earth-like World in the system. The text of the beacon (Tourist Spot 0474) around the hmc world (I did not visit the ice geysers as it was close to the end of my play session) says that visitors to the system often overlook the hmc world in favour of the other treasures on offer and that the locals don't mind that too much.
Suggestion: Check atmospheric composition on the Earth-like and the HMC. A seemingly natural Earth that isn't populated might indicate something off with atmosphere. Also, closer to Achenar there are several terraformed ones that ended badly or may have been done by another intelligent species. The devil is in the details.
