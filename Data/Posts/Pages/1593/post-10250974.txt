Wrt LFF 509,

I wonder if wake scans from systems near LFT 509 from ships departing to LFT 509 could give any hints?
That's something we can try. I've not done much wake scanning but am I right in thinking that if you scan it you can then jump to the same location? If so... does that work if you don't have the right permits??
