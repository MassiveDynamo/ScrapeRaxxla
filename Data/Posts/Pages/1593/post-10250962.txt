Thanks for this info Interesting indeed. I searched my old notes and found this post from reddit, which includes the "honest not hacked guv" LFT 509 system map, does that match what people got from the carrier bug?

Your support reply is very strange. In the past have they been pretty clear about what is and isn't possible to get? I've seen several times references to Fdev outright saying when a permit isn't yet accessible.

LFT 509 is only 53ly from Sol - within the conceptual radius for an "early days" station, and on the leaks there's a gas giant with 8 moons (ish) - is there anything else to suggest the system is significant?

Just playing devil's advocate: There are 15 systems within 30ly of Sol which have Gas Giants with 8 moons. Beyond that radius I didn't look, but 8th moons aren't uncommon. (Lacaille 8760 7 H , LHS 380 B 7 H, LP 816-60 4 H & 5 H, Struve 1321 A 4 h, LHS 3531 4 h , Carener AB 1 h, LAWD 96 2 h, LHS 417 6 h, NLTT 55164 1 h, Arangorii A 2 h, Minmar 9 h, CPD-28 332 ABC 1 h, V374 Pegasi A 3 h & A 4 h, Wolf 1329 3 h, Kappa-1 Ceti 1 h.)

But, I am in the bubble currently and I'm always up for getting permits to places, so if you've got any ideas I'm happy to give it a go

the most important part is the system status on the galaxy map.
the system has no station on the map, but in the galaxy map it has an allegiance and population.
