Why that system, do you have a theory?

There are a lot of permit locked systems, even in the bubble, just curious as to why that one caught your attention

From what i've read when fleet carriers launched, you could buy astronomical data from systems. even the permit locked ones.
a survey was concluded on all the systems and the only system of all the permit locked ones that met all the criteria for the existance of a hidden station was lft 509.

Furthermore different from polaris in witch i was told that is not acessible a this time due to the permit not existing, i received a rather cryptic response from fdev thru the support channels in regards to LFT 509 permit



Now. if this system was just some random system like any other there would be no reason not to inform the permit holder and "requisites".
thus my idea that one canno simply stumble into raxxla itself but has to rather make ther journey thru the dark wheel
