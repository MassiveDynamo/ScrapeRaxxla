Edit so as not to make another reply: Just checked more notes: around the 8th moon of a gas giant in Shinrarta there's a "tourist beacon" that says this:

In many ways, Shinrarta better matches the location of the Dark Wheel. It's 64ly from Sol (reachable in the early days, but very far). It's got (a/the) Dark Wheel faction origin there, you can only get there if you're Elite, there's a bunch of "secret" info there about the PF and the Dark Wheel...

Assuming the Dark Wheel has really existed (as it says in the codex) since the early days to interstellar travel, then a system like Shinararta might be what you get after a thousand years.

I guess that's what I mean when I asked what else about LFT 509 is suggestive of the Dark Wheel location?
Sol, Shinrarta, Polaris and LFT 509/Ross 54 are my main candidates for progressing the search for the DW and/or Raxxla... Sol is a bit broken and has lots of possible links/hints, Shin Rez has a DW faction and locked until you are Elite, etc, Polaris is locked and has been part of the lore before...... but LFT 509/Ross 54 is broken in many ways and wrong for many weird reasons... ;-)
