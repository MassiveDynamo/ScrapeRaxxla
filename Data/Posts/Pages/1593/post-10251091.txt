"1.2 Wings Release Notes: "Adding valuable salvage convoys to three permitted systems: LFT 509, Isinor, Witch's Reach"

Could this have been a hint to start off in Isinor which would unlock the permit for one of the two systems.....Funny enough Witch's Reach also has an 8th moon of a gas giant

on that note Isinor would have had no accessibles stations pre horizons


Had it a while ;-)
