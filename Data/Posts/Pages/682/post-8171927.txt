Still digging, but wanted to write this down.

Using this tool;
The Planets Today : A live view of the solar system
The planets today shows you where the planets are now as a live display - a free online orrery. In this solar system map you can see the planetary positions from 3000 BCE to 3000 CE, and also see when each planet is in retrograde.

I have found an alignment on the 8th of the January 2018, but that tool doesn’t go past the year 3000 and it isn’t probably good enough for what we are looking for.



Something that grabbed my attention in regards to alignment, is the line of nodes.

Have a read through the following NASA blog if you like;

Or if TL;DR;
SPOILER: LINE OF NODES


Edit: July 2179 is the next one, then July 2266. The 2266 one is a great alignment, having Venus, Earth and Pluto all on the same side of Sol and also getting very close to the first documented mention of Raxxla.
