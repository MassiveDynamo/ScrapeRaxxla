I want to say many warm words to this Quest for it ability to bring me back to the game. I'm in Alpha Centauri now and look at Sol. Unfortunately I experienced some system failures with my PC. Need more investigation. Something with video driver. But I believe I'll find it. One day.
You believe you'll one day find Raxxla or a video driver?
