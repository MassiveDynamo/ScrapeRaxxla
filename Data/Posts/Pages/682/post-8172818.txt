Currently 1.25 ly from Sol looking for Nemesis & just got a massacre civilians contract offer, some strange programming here FD!
They just pop up randomly right? Nothing to note with the offering faction or anything? Seems like a weird place to get a mission. Even though it is likely completely random it would be nice if it were a covert initiation mission of some kind for TDW. However a massacre of helpless civilians doesnâ€™t seem like something one would have to do to prove their integrity or skills.
