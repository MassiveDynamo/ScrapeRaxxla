I’m wondering if they are part of the “in-game storyline that leads to Raxxla”....
This is why I took the time to unlock all the available ones outside of CQC and HIP 54530 which the latter is apparently broken and has been since the Ts'ao Tach CG months back and the former just being difficult to obtain on XBX. When Mbooni becomes openly available I'll be adding that one to my list.

I've read somewhere, I think on a Drew Wagar post, that permit locked systems were meant for future storylines but I have a feeling that references the Col 70 region more than the bubble options.

I still think the fact that most of the Bubble Permits being offered by these cult like personalities has something to do with a storyline and Far God Cult seems like an easy connection being the only cult I know of being mentioned in the game.
