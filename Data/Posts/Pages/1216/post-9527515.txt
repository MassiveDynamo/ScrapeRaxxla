In regards to the ‘tiny bit obvious’ statement, my personal opinion is this related to the older Dark Wheel missions which never directly mentioned Raxxla but which hinted toward it…

As outlined on page 1 of this thread these missions were later omitted from the game, hypothetically I presume because they were bugged, evidence being that they spawned more or less anywhere and to anyone and seemingly with no pattern and they never resolved in an outcome.

I presume they were intended to lead to the actual Dark Wheel station, the source of the crystal data spheres, but they were so bugged, deemed unimportant and subsequently deleted.

It is also possible they never actually lead anywhere in the first place, and that FD maybe hadn’t got that far and were took by surprise by players abilities!

I would further presume these missions were later repurposed upon the arrival of the Raxxla codex, and maybe now sit as audio logs on the Dark Wheel station…or were completely deleted as part of the 2017 purge.

My assumption is that anything prior to 2017 is now probably inadmissible.
