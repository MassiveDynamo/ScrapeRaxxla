To me “a tiny bit obvious” implies within, or very close to, Sol.That and the Mars Artefact (i.e. aliens were here long ago!) and the Raxxla codex logo (with astronomical sign for Sol in the centre) led me to my “Raxxla in Sol” hypothesis. So I think Raxxla is hidden in Sol, possibly as asteroid/comet Chiron (or maybe the Omphalos Rift that leads to Raxxla orbits Chiron). However I think the way to detect it is via access to TDW dark station, perhaps as hints or missions. How we get access to that station beats me though!

I’ve pm‘d both SallyMorganMoore and Dr Kay Ross asking for clarification of the Sol’s planetary position orrery time/date since we cant match those positions to Stellarium for 2021 or 3307. No response!! I’ve also pinged Drew Wagar on FB Messenger asking if he can clarify whether TDW are the secret society we were supposed to be able to join, since he’s the only author that wrote anything substantial about TDW, and also has one of his characters say the Shinrarta faction is a front (implying there are hidden depths to TDW that we need to resolve), also no response.

Now I know NDAs apply, and FD aren’t going to give away secrets (I wasn't asking for that, just clarification of astronomical time within Sol). I think silence can be deafening! But I’m still wondering how to gain access to TDW!!

@Comandante I think you need to get the permits to be able to check the system description, though might be worth checking them out on EDSM.

Edit: if failing memory and RSI permit I’ll try to remember to look in the system maps and take pix of the descriptions.
