ah thanks Drew, thought it was strange you hadn’t responded!
but I'm still in the Dark about TDW!

Edit: just a thought, but MB’s “you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious” could also include Shinrarta Dezhra, which apparently had some strange secrecy over its naming, and is the “home” of both Pilots’ Federation and TDW, and requires Elite to gain the permit.....
