Ah, so players have already tried the get-very-permit route then. I thought as much!

No theory as such about permit-locked systems, just wondered if the system descriptions, when taken together, wove some kind of story or clues for the search. I never really check system descriptions so have no idea what kind of information they contain!

I only have a few (10 or so) permits, so do not know what the text descriptions are for the majority of them... Is there a place where this information is centralised? TBH I don't think that it will help - it's not even a 'tiny bit obvious'!

As I said though, the whole point about this search is to try everything. The sad thing is that I feel there's no more theories or ideas to try, that hasn't already been discussed or tried.

One part of me keeps going back to MB's 'tiny bit obvious' thing and I think to myself, "what would be a tiny bit obvious" - you know, like trying to think the way he thinks. But I never get anywhere with that. Doesn't seem like anyone else has, either. I wonder sometimes if it's staring us in the face, although with the number of players having gone through this game and the number of Raxxla hunters that have graced this thread, I think it's a lot less obvious than he made out. Well, it clearly IS a lot less obvious than he made out!
