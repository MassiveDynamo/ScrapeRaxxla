So last week I spent some time unlocking all the permits and one thing I noticed was they all seemed to be cultists with markings on their foreheads. Possibly Far God Cult implications?

I don’t know about the Far God implication, but to my mind most of the permit locks are suspicious. WHY did they exist? From the outset of the game! Logically they were hiding something. Van Maanen’s star in particular stands out to me- there is apparently nothing there out of the ordinary!

I really think we should incorporate some or all of these permit locks into our theorising. I’m wondering if they are part of the “in-game storyline that leads to Raxxla”....
