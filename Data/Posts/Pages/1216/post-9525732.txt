For some reason, the map of the Horizons and the Odyssey are different in content.
For example, Horizons has Targoids in the system, but if you switch to Odyssey, there is no more.
Odyssey is effectively in beta testing phase, though FD aren’t admitting that, I don’t think you can rely on anything within it until the console version is also released!
