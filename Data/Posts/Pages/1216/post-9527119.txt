Well, itâ€™s a hypothesis as good as any other. We haven't explored anything, to my memory, that links these bubble permit loto tcks yet they do stand out as a game feature. Good luck!
I have to admit, I thought I was 100% certain that some of the players here (that may no longer haunt this thread) had already tried getting all known unlockable permits in a bid to see if that would lead to Raxxla. I may well be wrong about this, though.

AFAIK all permit locked systems have an interesting system description. It might be worth collating those perhaps as there might (cough cough) be a lead to Raxxla. As much as I strongly doubt it, I think if something hasn't been done yet it's always worth doing to prove it or not.

Sorry to sound downbeat about it but I do not think we'll find it before the game ends (if DB has put a shelf life on it). At that point, I don't think they'd tell us anyway - there would fire and pitch forks when MB announces what the "tiny bit obvious" thing would be! However, once the Odyssey pain has finished for both players and FD, I am really hoping that are several more DLCs to be made (more Odyssey expansions, ELWs etc.). I know it's not the topic of this thread but I really hope that they go through proper S/W testing strategies this time rather than crapping it out!
