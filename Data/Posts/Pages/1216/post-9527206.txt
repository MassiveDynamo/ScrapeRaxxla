Well, proper software testing doesnt seem to have happened since the initial release!

Yes, I’ve got all current permits on the assumption that was perhaps part of the “personal journey” which MB hinted was the way to attain Raxxla, but I still don’t see that there’s anything that links them. So if you have a theory about the system descriptions then we’d like to hear it. Gaining those permits doesnt seem to have made any difference to my own game journey. I suspect we need to go via TDW, and it may be there’s a mission-related link...?
