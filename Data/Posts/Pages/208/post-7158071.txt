Sure. These are the ones with Raxxla in it and one about the Formidine Rift.

Nice clarification from Drew. He is basically in the same position as us, when it comes to Raxxla.

'Raxxla is a definite place, that holds a mysterious secret', according to the codex. We just don't know how to find it.
We don't even know if it's possible to find it directly or if we have to go via The Dark Wheel(due to permit locks)?
