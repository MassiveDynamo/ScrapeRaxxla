Hey folks, who else is doing Beta testing?

Macros, are you doing anything with Squadrons wrt the Quest to find Raxxla.

And for the Rifters, an FR squadron for the Beta for testing?

o/

I couldn't find anything related to these threads (I even searched for tinfoil and "tin foil")

Not sure I could invest the time in an FR trip on my PC account but maybe...

Edit: If someone does create a squadron like this I'll certainly join up and see where it takes us. Not this evening, it's the final Fallout 76 beta slot.
