Sorry, Pal, but I myself am not buying that new explo "standstill discovering" mechanic, its crappy FSS 90's minigame and the "pewpewtheplanet infinite probes". Just waiting for the release, if by a miracle, FD kiddos get it somewhat tuned.
Then, X4, SC and DU.
I bet their "Raxxlas" will be at least as exciting as FD's.

Fair enough I hope you don't end up heading off from the game mate, but you've got to do what's right for you ultimately.

I'm giving things a fairly thorough run through. Got some reservations about the standstill and scan mechanic as you do, and also the way probing has brought planet based discoveries completely from one extreme to the other. That's for the 3.3 Feedback thread when I put together a more explained post about it all though!

Squadrons is a different thing though, so I want to give it a try in the Beta and see how it works for different styles of groups.
