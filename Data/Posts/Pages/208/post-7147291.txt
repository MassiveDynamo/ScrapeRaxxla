Princess Astrophel and the spiraling stars is the name of a childrens book, mentioned in the codex.
Some thinks it contains clues.

There's a book real with a very similar name to 'Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars'. It's called 'Astrophel and Stella', meaning 'Star-Lover and Stella' (Stella being the name of the Star in this case).

A quick read of the wiki for this gives basic information about the collection of sonnets, (like the translation of the title) and if you search for the PDF, it's readily available to download and read. There might actually be something hidden in there.
