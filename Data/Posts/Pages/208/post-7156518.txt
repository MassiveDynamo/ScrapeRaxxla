I couldn't find anything related to these threads (I even searched for tinfoil and "tin foil")

Not sure I could invest the time in an FR trip on my PC account but maybe...

Edit: If someone does create a squadron like this I'll certainly join up and see where it takes us. Not this evening, it's the final Fallout 76 beta slot.

Oh, I'm not thinking in terms of an actual trip, I'm more thinking about seeing how it works as a general tool for a group of the nature of the Rifters, as opposed to as a tool for doing something associated with the Formidine Rift itself.
