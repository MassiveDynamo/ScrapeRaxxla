Ahm... guys...
I don’t know if anyone saw this but there in some „unofficial“ Facebook elite dangerous group and Drew Wagar chimed in this week for a lore Q&A where he mentioned some quite interesting things.
So if anyone wants to read up on Drew’s thoughts about Raxxla, feel free (unfortunately this is a closed group).

Here‘s a link to the group Drew’s post was on the 6th November
