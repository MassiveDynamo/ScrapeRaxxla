It could only be ‘supposedly’ from him, because it had his avatar attributed to it… it was a graphical screen grab, but the page was clipped, ergo edited. By simply discussing this we are adding weighted biases. It just needs to be dropped I think.

The Codex is the only reliable evidence to date in my opinion.
