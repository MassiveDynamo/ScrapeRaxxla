Question for y'all:

How believable/reliable do you find this? https://m.twitch.tv/clip/SnappyScaryMousePupper

"I was in the room when Michael Brookes said the thing; 'the system where Raxxla is has been entered at least once by a Commander'."

"He didn't say anything else but: 'the system where Raxxla is has been visited'.


SPOILER: MY OPINION (SPOILERED IN CASE YOU DON'T CARE!)









I've been thinking about this in relation to the Landscape Signal - which seems to be between systems, and therefore patently unvisitable. I got this clip from Jorki's excellent thread, it says that this comment was allegedly made "during the last Q&A Michael Brookes attended, so Lavecon 2017."

How many people went to Lavecon in 2017 that might still be around and remember Brookes Q&A? Pretty sure if he mentioned Raxxla there must be more than Cmdr Ascorbius talking about it, especially at a Lavecon! Can't find anything myself other than people repeating the unattributed rumour over and over again.

Obviously it would be lovely to have confirmation that a: Raxxla is in a star system (as opposed to being a star system, nebula, rogue planet, etc), and that b: it is/was visitable prior to 2017, presumably still was or why bring it up?
