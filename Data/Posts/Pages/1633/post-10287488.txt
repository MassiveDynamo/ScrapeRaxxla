I won’t post the ‘supposed’ statement potentially from Brooke’s refuting it, because its third hand informative, as I’ve mentioned its circumspect; said statement is a screen grab off some old post hosted on another thread someplace, so it’s likely could have been recorded but posted out of context - which I highly suspect to be the case… or it’s a forgery… but I won’t give it credibility by forwarding it on.

Safe to say there simply is not enough information to confirm nor deny it it. I don’t think it’s worth the effort to investigate this.
Ah I thought you meant from MB directly... totally agree!
