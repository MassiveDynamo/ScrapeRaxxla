Look back at the livestreams where any official staff mentions Raxxla (especially the 2018 codex reveal), tons and tons of people in chat shout "RAXXLA!" and suchlike.

I'm struggling to hold in my head the image of a room full of Elite super-fans (because it's Lavecon, who else goes?), and Brookes himself dropping bombshells about Raxxla, and then no-one talking about and making videos and podcasts and suchlike immediately after. There's a freaking 34 minute biscuit review video from Lavecon 2017 posted, but I'm really struggling to find anyone talking about this alleged Q&A reveal from Brookes.

IF TRUE - It means that we can automatically discount any theory that doesn't take place in a standard solar system. We can discount anything of the more exotic nature (clearly whoever it was didn't notice anything strange). We also have flat-out confirmation that it wasn't permit locked (as of 2017, presumably) - at least. We can also discount any system that wasn't discovered as of 2017 (so no point looking for undiscovered systems, for example).

That's monumental information. For example it rules out the Landscape Signal, it rules out exotic systems with weird stuff, etc etc. it also means we don't necessarily need to pass tests or carry special objects, or find the Dark wheel, etc.

It seems to me that one of the most reliable ways to 'gain more clues' is to verify this alleged Brookes statement.
