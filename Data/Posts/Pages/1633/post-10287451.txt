Thanks Emperor, I feel much more confident continuing to ignore this 'clue' now It seems clear that this is equivalent to "a bloke down the pub told me that dogs can't look up".

Incidentally: Brookes isn't on the list of attendees for Lavecon 2017. So even that (as per the info on Jorki's post from 2021) is suspect. According to Jorki's quote Ascorbius said he didn't got to 2015 or 2016, so that's... well frankly that seems to immediately mean that Ascorbius clearly didn't see Brookes at a Lavecon Q&A...because Brookes left Elite Dangerous in 2017 for other projects.

I wonder if it's time to remove that 'clue' from the OP? Or at least add in some additional caveats?

Click to expand...

It should be left on the OP as it was said.. I'd like the MB quote denying it added if it can be found...

Plus other people have mentioned it too (including today from @Shadowsnog)

Do I think it was said... Probably... Does it help...? Only if something else helps narrow down the search like the beta reference if it can be found... And of course if nothing has changed in the mean time...
