Question for y'all:

How believable/reliable do you find this? https://m.twitch.tv/clip/SnappyScaryMousePupper
i know of at least one other person who can personally testify for it as well.
is it is askewed collective memory or real?
would fdev not change things at least a bit when such a piece of intel got leaked?
