The thing about the statement is that even if true it doesn't really give any information beyond "Raxxla has a defined location and is in a system which can be reached normally", which is what most of the searches for it have assumed is true anyway.

If it's within or very close to the bubble or maybe some other obvious POI, then obviously the system containing it has been visited, and equally obviously it requires something more than a casual look around to find it.

If it's in deep anonymous space, then it's a massive coincidence that someone visited it early on, but that clearly wasn't the way it was expected to be found, and it doesn't rule out there being something more than "standard exploration" required to actually see it.

(Statistically, any system visited at least once by 2017 may have been visited at least 3-4 times by now, though that obviously doesn't hold for systems where the one visit was on someone's obscure deep space expedition)

The only rumoured reference I'd like to find is the one about it being around in the Beta... with the first beta's being very small e.g. the "lozenge" rather than a "bubble"... and 50 odd systems were available prior to 2.04 beta I believe (55 is mentioned in the video)...
