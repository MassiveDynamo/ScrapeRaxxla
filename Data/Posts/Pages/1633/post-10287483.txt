I won’t post the ‘supposed’ statement potentially from Brooke’s refuting it, because its third hand information, as I’ve mentioned its circumspect; said statement is a screen grab off some old post hosted on another thread someplace, so it’s likely could have been recorded but posted out of context - which I highly suspect to be the case… or it’s a forgery… but I won’t give it credibility by forwarding it on.

Safe to say there simply is not enough information to confirm nor deny it. I don’t think it’s worth the effort to investigate this.

I once had to give a statement about an incident myself. I’m a trained person in this field and hand on heart I can categorically confirm after I wrote my own statement down even I could not assess that my own recollection was accurate… an independent person had to weigh it with other information to assess if it was accurate, in that instance they marked it with a low reliability; which I agreed with… and that’s first hand knowledge after 24 hrs, to this date my recollection has shifted, memory is not fixed, it is changed by the act of recollection.

If you have bias it will impact on what is said, it also has the power to infect other’s memory too, it’s a very powerful tool used in counter intelligence especially over time. I don’t think it warrants any energy.
