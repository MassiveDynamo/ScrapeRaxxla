I think the fact that Ascorbius claims to have heard it from someone who wasn't physically present at the event, and had actually left the company by then, is a sign that the Ascorbius video is reporting something that's at best hearsay and conjecture - therefore it at least needs that note on it really
What makes you think he'd left the company by then?

MB moved on to a secret project? https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/a-big-thanks-to-you-all.358889/

Looks like he was going in 2017.... so perhaps not an official Q&A and at the bar after a few sherbets or in a chat with people?
"I will be attending Lavecon again this year as a fan of Elite and to meet with old friends and the fantastic community. Naturally Iâ€™ll keep an eye on the forums and pop in from time to time!"

And not sure the actual event was ever mentioned or confirmed absolutely?
