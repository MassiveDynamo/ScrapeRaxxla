I found some 2mass with J181 and J180.(do all 2mass in game have a, "J," before numbers?) They aren't far from the bubble. 9K+ ish. I also found another area with something similar I am very close to that I will check out. It's not 2mass but I will report back after scanning them. It's a good chunk of systems right next to each other with very similar names! I'll check after I travel 400k to scan some planets.

Random thought. The ships in game lore might not be limited to 2001c with extended burns. How fast could they get with their fuel and be able to stop. They are supposedly on one way trips and only need enough fuel to accelerate/decelerate and maybe refuel at a star if they need to stop and start over.... Is this taken into account with normal calculations for gen ships?

Do we know what type of engines they had and when they can no longer accelerate effectively or how they are limited in thrust naturally? Doesn't normal bell engine thrust get lower in efficiency after certain speeds?
