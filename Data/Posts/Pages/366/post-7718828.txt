Not exactly. Further reading here and here, but TL;DR to define a coordinate in the sky from Earth you use celestial coordinates, which have three components: A time component (the "epoch") because stuff moves a lot; and two space components, "right ascension" and "declination", which are sort of the same idea as longitude and latitude.

Right ascension and declination are angular measurements so they are expressed with hours, minutes, and seconds. So you have six components. And if you just use a letter-number cipher on "RAXXLA" (a=1 b=2 c=3 etc) you can interpret the resulting six numbers as celestial coordinates. Right ascension 18h 1' 24", declination (Â±) 24 12 1.

UPDATE: I'm having trouble locating this entire region of stars. "2MASS J18" turns up an area in 1802, but the sign is wrong. "2MASS J19" turns up a region with the correct sign. But any 2MASS J1801 stars are conspicuously missing.
