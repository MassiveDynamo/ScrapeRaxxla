Don’t take it to heart. Everyone’s been caught out by a prank, joke or hoax at some point.

Anyway, thanks in principle for posting what I’m assuming you took to be news to the thread. However, I think what would be appreciated is a bit of sense and validity checking before posting something as though it’s factual news. This ain’t the first ‘Raxxla discovered’.

Oh, and given that there’s a good few days between the OA video being posted and you posting about it on here, it would have been good to consider that the thread in general might already be aware of it.

I hope that all sounds fair and helps in terms of having good interactions in the thread for your future posts!
