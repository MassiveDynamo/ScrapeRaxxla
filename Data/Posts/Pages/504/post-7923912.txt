Yeah, it's an interesting place!

I did manage to find a way into the interior via Neutron Star, but ultimately it's just another way in in addition to the main routes and doesn't take you anywhere that isn't easily accessed via the main routes.

I also found a particular version of that NS route for which the line goes directly through the system that the Thargoid Probes reference. No way of forcing a drop part way through the jump though, so it's nothing more than an interesting little coincidence that the route happens to exist.

Which systems take your fancy in there?
