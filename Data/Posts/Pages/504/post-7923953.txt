That had crossed my mind. I also thought maybe that star was moved a few light years for whatever reason, and it just registers it as still being there. I spend hours just searching through that galmap, and I hadn't seen that before, so it got me excited.

Also, is it normal for there to be a flat plane of stars of a certain class? In the Rift, there's a a layer of M class stars, in other areas I've seen it with L class stars.

I've only been playing for a few months, so I'm still catching up.
