This happens sometimes. The star was probably added both as AO Cass and HD 1337, from two differen catalogues, giving them slightly diferent positions.
Then the one from the Henry Draper catalogue was removed in cleaning, but the position reference stayed.

I often will use the HD numbers if im looking for a star and cant find due to odd naming conventions. It usually works - i think alot of them have secondary searchable names.
