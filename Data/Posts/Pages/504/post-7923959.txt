I stumbled upon something odd while playing with the galmap. It's probably just a bug, but it seems to line up with a couple of things. If you search "HD 1337" it takes you to AO Cassiopeiae, which is just a different designation for that star. However, if you search again it will move a few light years away from it and just stop there. No star near that spot. I mess around with the map a lot, but I have never seen it do this.

I know some stars below and above the galactic plane will shoot you back to an empty spot, but this just moves over as if something there. A lot of people have linked the Raxxla mystery to Cassiopeia, and "A place that isn't a place" seems to fit this situation.

Once again, probably just a bug, but it made me add a few extra layers of foil to the hat.

Deserves a bug report. Continuing the search brings you to:

HD 133704, HIP 73849, HIP 73928, HIP 73974, 5 Trianguli, HIP 73765, HIP 73793, HIP 73874, HIP 73906, HD 133729, HIP 74053, HD 133738
HD 13374, HD 133740, HIP 73877, HIP 73912, HIP 73957, HIP 73987, HD 133755, HIP 10108, HIP 73474, stopped searching here.

Strangely enough, I've visited none of these systems.

Edit: One idea is to look in the nav-panel for a system listed there, but not visible in the Galmap (the one you mention)
