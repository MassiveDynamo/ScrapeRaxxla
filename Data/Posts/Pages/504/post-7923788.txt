Which is EXACTLY why I'm still enjoying the hunt for Raxxla.

The Formidine Rift mystery was ruined the moment FDev decided they wanted us to find it - the clues became increasingly simplistic until we were basically spoonfed the location of the Zurara (with direct assistance from DrewW to make sure we got it right). The absolute last thing I want to happen is for FDev to decide 'Okay, it's time for them to find Raxxla', because at that point the story is 'on rails' and there's nothing we can do to direct it.

And so we find Raxxla, and then what?
Are FDev going to add a whole new mystery to the game? No, they're not, since there are clearly no story-tellers left on the project. The Halsey and Jacques storylines are dead, Gan Romero shows no signs of being anything other than another fluff piece that FDev have already forgotten about.

Whatever the 'new era' brings, it sure isn't going to be announced with "Hey, we put some cool stuff in the galaxy but there's no way for you to find it. What? Spacelegs? Oh, no, none of that stuff. Maybe after we do atmospheric landings in 2022".

So yeah, I'll take no clues and especially no breadcrumbs thanks.

Well that's you but some of us want to find it sooner, preferably before cyberpunk 2077 is released
