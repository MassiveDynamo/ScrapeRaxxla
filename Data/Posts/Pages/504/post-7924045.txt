I want to believe that Raxxla is indeed in game, that it hosts some kind of portal to other universes with all what it implies in matter of alien knowledge and treasures. I want to believe that DB and MB had enough sensibility and honesty to NOT defraud their customers as well as the creator of Raxxla.
(Amen.)
Well.. What I really would like is just another fresh galaxy to explore...
I may have said this before, but I have come to the belief/hope that Raxxla will be largely uninteresting in it's own right, but unlock the DW, which may bring additional game play.

I cant imagine that FD have a bunch of servers, ready with an alternative galaxy loaded. Although that being said, I believe they use AWS, which would make it possible for them to do this, whilst spending close to 0 money. If they have, then the 1st CMDR should expect the load screen to last about 40 minutes, whilst the auto scaling group spins up some EC2 instances and the game loads!

Edit - Even more possible, if they have a failed model of the Milky Way left over from Stella Forge development and testing. Create a galaxy that doesn't look like the milky way and hey presto, new galaxy!

Damb it - I'm talking myself back into Raxxla being the end game!
