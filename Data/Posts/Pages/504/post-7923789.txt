As a new CMDR tbh that's how I've experienced 99% of the game, with no clues / pointers of what's happening or has happened, especially in regard to past CGs or 'Community' events or 'storylines', I'm trying to catch up and actually do them in the order they appeared but that's very hard to track in game. Very little is given in game and some of that is read between the lines....I had no idea the majority of the backstory of Colonia (according to Codex some people helped out one time basically, no mention that it moved or disappeared or the rest), the Rift mystery and the whole chase through space of Salome...none of that is explained in game, you have to come onto the internet and often rely on a YT vid recorded at that time to get any sense of what happened, including many many clues and red herringsâ€¦.I go down one thought track to find that in an obscure livestream it has already been discounted by Frontier et al but there's no record of that livestream anymore....many similar things!

there is this old summary if thats of any assistance. I don't think we got much further than this, and it may save you reading all of the 508 pages (though I recommend the 1st page)
