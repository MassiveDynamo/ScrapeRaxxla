Deserves a bug report. Continuing the search brings you to:

Strangely enough, I've visited none of these systems.

Edit: One idea is to look in the nav-panel for a system listed there, but not visible in the Galmap (the one you mention)

I was thinking about going back out there when I got to Elite rank in exploration. I went before and tried jumping from star to star, trying to pass through that spot. I even flew about 5,000,000 light seconds in that direction from AO Cass, and at different angles while watching the stars. Even though I'm pretty convinced it's a bug, I still think it's worth trying. There's not much else to go on at this point.
