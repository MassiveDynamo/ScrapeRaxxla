It appears the Dark Wheel has in fact metaphorically killed off my CMDR through this process, much like Alex Ryder, Jason Ryder and the rest.

Do you even know the story of Demete
Did you even read the novel itself?
The supposed people who found raxxla (suspicion falls at children of raxxla) ordered a hit on Jason. With Alex subsequently hunting down (or rather Rafe arranging for bounty hunter to find him) and killing the bounty hunter.
With Rafe later pretty much recruiting Alex into Dark Wheel.

The amount of pretense in that sentence...ugh the cringe. UUGH THE CRINGE.
