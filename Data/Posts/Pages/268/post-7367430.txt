Yeah, I know all this. Played it 50 + hours, the whole beta. Nothing to do with credits. Already a long time since I don't care for Cr.
For me, Exploration is dead in ED. Then, ED is dead for me. But I am glad you enjoy that stupid and dull minigame unworthy of a 2019 major space game.
Have fun making big £££ pointing and clicking at blue blobs !

And, as you have a lot of stuff with your name on, others also have. Then, finally, nobody has nothing.
Totally spoiled game.
