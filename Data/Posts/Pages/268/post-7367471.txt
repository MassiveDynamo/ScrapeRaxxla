Yeah, I know all this. Played it 50 + hours, the whole beta. Nothing to do with credits. Already a long time since I don't care for Cr.
For me, Exploration is dead in ED. Then, ED is dead for me. But I am glad you enjoy that stupid and dull minigame unworthy of a 2019 major space game.
Have fun making big £££ pointing and clicking at blue blobs !

And, as you have a lot of stuff with your name on, others also have. Then, finally, nobody has nothing.
Totally spoiled game.

I must admit that after almost 500 scans using new (FOR f...k SAKE) mode im a bit bored. I suspected that feeling will come.... sadly. Now we have faster tool but there is still no sand in this sandbox...

Do you think that Fdev will polish this experience in the future ?
