Commanders,

Regarding CMDR Guru951's latest statements - As a former member of the (now disbanded) 46&2 group, I would like to apologize for all of this. I'm currently trying to understand what determined Guru to behave this way, as he has disgraced our group, abandoned his brothers and continues to torment seekers with misinformation and delusions.

From what I've managed to piece together, Guru did indeed NOT uncover anything of note, let alone the greatest mystery there is (RAXXLA).

For now, all I can recommend is steering clear of CMDR Guru951, and anything he has to say or offer.

Hey. Thanks for clarification, i respect that but it was obvious that he didnt found anything. Probably he take to much "knowledge" about Ancient Greek mythology and get confused and in the end frustrated.

Lets remember that ancient mythology is a mess.

Fdev are using ancient mythologies and symbolism very hardly. There are LOot of things you have to combine and consider if you following that path, for example i didnt saw any mention about LOGOS - Dark Wheel logo is "Ouroboros" . Main corporations contains Dragon Eye symbolism. One of the old raxxla missions is called Silent song of the spheres witch reffers to Musica Unversalis - ofcourse it is ancient philosophical concept... and many more. It easy to get confused.

Raxxla is Probably hidden by some form of BGS, probably. I hope that is not the only way to find it because it means that withut FDEV clues we are walking in the dark..... forever
