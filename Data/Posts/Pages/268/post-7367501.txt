There was even less sand without it. At least now you don't need to sniff every planet to map the system.
Sure; No more need to Explore. Just play the minigame at a standstill. Coool ! Next patch: "Extended FSS." Scan the whole MW when still docked at Eravate. You will love it !!
But off topic, anyway.

Do you think that Fdev will polish this experience in the future ?

Actually, I don't care, but I bet they'll keep getting this game more and more arcade-ish. That's what the kiddos like.
The easy, fast, effortless way.
