RIP Guru, it seems the fruitless results of his efforts have broken his psyche completely. you confused the hell out of us the whole time.

As far as the main topic goes; someone said something in a twitch stream that really made me think the other day. The idea that Frontier paid developers upwards of hundreds of thousands to work on content people might never see is absolutely bonkers. It is more than likely that Raxxla will be added as some sort of future content, or it's something so small and unfinished that it wouldn't really be a huge deal to actually find it.

At first I disagreed, because Raxxla was a big mystery in the original Elite back when the game was tiny and barely had anything, but I think that's just what it was. A whisper. A mention. An idea that isn't even fully formed. I'd genuinely put my money on it not actually being in the game, or it being something so insignificant it wouldn't matter if we did find it.
