I must admit that after almost 500 scans using new (FOR f...k SAKE) mode im a bit bored. I suspected that feeling will come.... sadly. Now we have faster tool but there is still no sand in this sandbox...

Do you think that Fdev will polish this experience in the future ?
There was even less sand without it. At least now you don't need to sniff every planet to map the system.
