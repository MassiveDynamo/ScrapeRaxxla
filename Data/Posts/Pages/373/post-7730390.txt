Keep an eye out for ancient message capsules while visiting close to the orbit of Saturn, in case you stumble upon some data crystals. I hear they contain starmaps from long solitary expeditions. Witchspace was different back then, considering how they used to do access hyperspace and interstellar travel. Don't bother with the one Elon Musk left orbiting in space, that's been stolen already. Though I do like Daft Punk. If you ever happen to find one, don't tell Rockforth Corporation or the Federal Navy, or you'll have everybody plus the Dark Wheel after you. You know Omphalos Rift is a crystal, right? Well, an optical ring resonator on a hexagonal lattice, suspended in cryogenic conditions inside a fusion-core containment field, to be precise. Simple optical cavities were quite instrumental for all sorts of stuff, like testing the theory of special relativity, or figuring out Planck constant. I hear it's quite useful for observing electromagnetic radiation for purposes of astronomy too. Though when considering radiation and quantum tunnelling, I would prefer more spiritual approach for application. Perhaps there still is a chance. How do I know all this? You see, I was doing a bit of bounty hunting and onionhead the other night, and happened to find this unstable data core hang up on a palm tree in Mars High...

Community managers knows nothing about Raxxla, as far as I have heard.
I think Will is just adorable, he doesn't have to stress about knowing these things. The journey is too difficult for most anyway. Somebody should show him how to drink proper tea though.
