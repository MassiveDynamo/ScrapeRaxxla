That picture is a RL photo from the Cassini probe.

Now that is interesting, so we now know probrably where the creators of the simbol came up with the idea...
And that leads to a startling conclusion... Could be Saturn the place we should start the search?!
Taking the pole as the indicator and checking wich systems align with those figures around the design of the symbol?

Ok... I really wore my aluminium hat today...
