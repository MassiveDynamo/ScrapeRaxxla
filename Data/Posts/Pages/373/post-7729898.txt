I did some digging around on the Raxxla effects pedal the first time it popped into this thread. I thought, you know, given that Ed is a musician....maybe? But I think that either it's total happenstance or, the manufacturer of the pedal in a fan of the game. It's made by a Russian company in St. Petersburg and is currently discontinued. The company seems to have existed from 2002 until 2015. So it's highly unlikely (read: nigh on impossible) that the pedal has anything to do with this. Linky below:

Shift Line - Professional Sound Equipment

I'm sure all of us knew that...just felt like giving a contribution of some value. Not much else I can do out here 45K from the rest of you.
