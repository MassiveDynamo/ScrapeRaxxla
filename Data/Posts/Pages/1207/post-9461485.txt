I think that is just fan fiction / Oolite lore. There isn't anything official (lore or old games stuff) that mentions any relationship between Raxxla and Thargoids.

The closest thing I can think of is the Thargoid portal in Polaris, in FFE. I don't think it had anything to do with Raxxla, but it showed that Thargoids had the technology to make something similar. Something we could accept as a resonable solution to the Raxxla myth.
Yes, but I don't remember a mention of the Guardians earlier, either.
