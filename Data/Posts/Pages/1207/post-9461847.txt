There is mention of a third alien type, in the FFE journals. These sound more like the fabeld Klaxians, than Guardians.

Who knows? Perhaps Klaxians and Guardians are the same?
Interesting thought, but OOTD says there are two species of Thargoids, Klaxians and Oresrians, and I think that book is still canon.
