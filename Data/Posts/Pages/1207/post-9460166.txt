Today’s Galnet: “A new independent branch of Mastopolos Mining has been established by its controlling shareholder, Senator Zemina Torval” ... She “has set her sights on a permit-controlled system as the headquarters for this new company.”

So perhaps FD are starting to open up the locked systems, just before the Thargoid (Far God?) invasion.....
Looking at the region control, if its going by that the permit system she would be diving into is looking like Alpha Hydri, although now it seems she has a presence in Mingfu when thats listed as a Fed system and now it actually has a population of 8m+ while it didnt have any population a while back
