It may even be a 3rd unknown race we havnt even seen any sign of yet, Raxxla is hinted to be older than the galaxy itself, Thargoids are most likely older than the Guardians however if they Feared Raxxla (Fear glands removed from old lore may pertain to a pre war with an even older race), but not the Guardians who basically wiped them clean out at first...thats bad, they may even use that pre-races technology or even be the workings of them like we are for the club
Well we probably will find Raxxla when they want us to find it. For now it's just a shot in the dark.
