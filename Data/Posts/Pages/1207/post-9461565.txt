You don't say .. we only have two ancient probes pointing directly at Polaris (Voyager 1 and New Horizons). Humans detected something very early in the 21st century in the game via those probes. Also, I am on the trail of the non-human artifact (pretty sure it left Sol a long time ago -- like with Marlin Duval when she left). That artifact changed history (and has a trail of death left in its wake). It is part of the reason Hengist Duval allowed female emperors. It was in First Encounters and disappeared again towards the end of Wanted.
