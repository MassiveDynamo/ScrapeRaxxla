Originally the Thargoids feared the word Raxxla, or adleast this was also rumored.....maybe this is still, or now is cannon and Raxxla may be tied with Guardian AI/Technology
Yeah either way it's from one of the races. My guess is the Thargoid because they are very mysterious and old. Don't forget they were the first ones to use witchspace technology. They can travel true wormholes. Hyperdict. Can travel very fast. In one of the logs in a site i even mentiones that the sky opened like a rift with light and then Thargoids attacked. Also it's noted that after the first Thargoid war, there wasn't any trace left of them. They just vanished. Raxxla is said to be a gate. I mean I feel a connection there. If you start reading some of the logs in settlements from the Cannon website you will start to notice unexplained things that sound a lot like Raxxla.

It could be from the Guardians but it doesn't hint at it and if it was it's probs from the Construct. I mean it could be but sounds unlikely. Anyways those 2 alien races are really a mystery. We only scratched the surface.
