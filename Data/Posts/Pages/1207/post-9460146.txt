Yeah either way it's from one of the races. My guess is the Thargoid because they are very mysterious and old. Don't forget they were the first ones to use witchspace technology. They can travel true wormholes. Hyperdict. Can travel very fast. In one of the logs in a site i even mentiones that the sky opened like a rift with light and then Thargoids attacked. Also it's noted that after the first Thargoid war, there wasn't any trace left of them. They just vanished. Raxxla is said to be a gate. I mean I feel a connection there. If you start reading some of the logs in settlements from the Cannon website you will start to notice unexplained things that sound a lot like Raxxla.

It could be from the Guardians but it doesn't hint at it and if it was it's probs from the Construct. I mean it could be but sounds unlikely. Anyways those 2 alien races are really a mystery. We only scratched the surface.
It may even be a 3rd unknown race we havnt even seen any sign of yet, Raxxla is hinted to be older than the galaxy itself, Thargoids are most likely older than the Guardians however if they Feared Raxxla (Fear glands removed from old lore may pertain to a pre war with an even older race), but not the Guardians who basically wiped them clean out at first...thats bad, they may even use that pre-races technology or even be the workings of them like we are for the club
