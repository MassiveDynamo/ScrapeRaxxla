Anyone else thinks for sure Raxxla, Witchspace and the Thargoids are somehow connected?
Yes, via Meredith Argent and her husband Bill Turner and their son Bill Turner and his connection to MetaDrive. Argent and Turner's Argent Aerodynamics Amalgamated Inc (AAAI) is very much in the game. The in-game lore stretches at least from the late 1960s - 3300s. Also, Meredith Argent is connected to every last Witch and wiccan reference in the game.
