Nice video....

I did a quick trip over to the systems you covered....
Firstly Pink Floyd video - very apt! ;-)
I couldn't replicate the human signal at ADS 10329 B5... it was my first visit to the system, lots of degraded emissions and pirates at the asteroid belts but nothing weird for me...
ADS 4229 ABC / PMSC 05322+3026 is truly weird being separate systems and yet in the same system (I searched for the PMSC system and jumped to it and whilst the ADS system appears as a separate system in nav, you can fly to it and if you try and jump to it, it says destination is obstructed)..... 26 AURIGAE D is also a bit weird as the icy planets don't show up when you scan the system using the field spectral analysis to discover them (I'm guessing because they are tiny by the looks of it, looked like empty targets until I got very close when flying to them).
I have recorded most of the stuff mentioned above and if any of it is of interest, let me know and i will upload...

keep the good work going! o7

Simples!
According to Simbad (http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=PMSC+05322+3026&submit=SIMBAD+search) PMSC 05322+3026 is also known as 26 Aur (a double star Ads 4229 ab), aka ADS 4229 C, while if you check ADS 4229 (http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=ADS+4229&submit=SIMBAD+search) it is also known as 26 Aur & 26 Aur C. So these two systems that seem to be so close together are actually a single system IRL that has been imported from two separate astronomical catalogues with slightly conflicting data. Presumably early in the import process during game build Stella (pun intended) Forge did not implement much in the way of data error checks.

Looks like there should be a binary pair AB and a third star C in the system if the import had gone properly, but some astro data is a bit sketchy due to manual identification etc.
