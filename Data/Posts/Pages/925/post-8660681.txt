The string of bright stars happens because a particular RL astronomy survey identified a bunch of stars in that angle - the line points to sol as it is a piece of sky surveyed by a telescope fixed to that angle. All the stars have S171-### names - S171 being the Spitzer young star survey in the star catalogue. All the stars have bright O or A stars - interesting bunch of systems if you want multiple black holes and massive blue stars - I did go through them all and others have too - in EDSm its called the siren of the spinward stars, but that's a player description.

There are other examples of such surveys in the game, mostly concetrated about nebulae etc.A list of the Spitzer survey can be seen here:
