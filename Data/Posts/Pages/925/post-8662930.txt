Made me wonder too.
Someone recently pointed out to me that Tornqvist also may be related to something called the Tornqvist Index..

That name Tornquist sounds so familiar... It is in the game IIRC. Didnt we had to do something to unlock ??? something related to that name some 2 years ago?
Epic videos btw.
