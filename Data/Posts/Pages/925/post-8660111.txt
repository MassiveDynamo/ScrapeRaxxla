You're pointing out of Thorncroft Terminal made me wonder - Thorncroft / Tornquist?

Tornquist or Törnquist or Tørnquist is a surname of Swedish origin. The word can mean"Thorn twig" or "thorn branch".

Thorncroft terminal is in Kuwair, meaning "small seawater canal".

Im there now, nothing out of the ordinary, lots of pirate contracts for the neighbouring system.

Then again Tornquist alway made me think of Eumaeus, who lived in a hut of thorn branches and welcomes Odysseus the wandering vagabond...

Made me wonder too.
Someone recently pointed out to me that Tornqvist also may be related to something called the Tornqvist Index, but I myself can't seem to make sense of its application to the quest. Though I too noticed the Thorny Branch reference, I still have never been able to make any sense of it. Seeing you talk of Eumaeus is totally new info to me and only makes me think that it may be more relatable than I had previously noticed. Glad to see you clearing up the Kuwair meaning as well. To me, you've made the most sense, and have connected it the best. Dahan is a river in Taiwan, and the system has a station called Dahan 3 Metalworks. I've suspected this might be the place we might get secret drive tech, like what we might be seeing with the turning Mamba, but my efforts came up dry once again.
