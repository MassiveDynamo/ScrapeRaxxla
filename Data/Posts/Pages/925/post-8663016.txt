You're pointing out of Thornycroft Terminal made me wonder - Thornycroft / Tornquist?

Tornquist or Törnquist or Tørnquist is a surname of Swedish origin. The word can mean"Thorn twig" or "thorn branch".

Thornycroft terminal is in Kuwair, meaning "small seawater canal".

Im there now, nothing out of the ordinary, lots of pirate contracts for the neighbouring system.

Then again Tornquist always made me think of Eumaeus, who lived in a hut of thorn branches and welcomes Odysseus the wandering vagabond...

This.

I have an older post (which i can't seem to find right now) where i go into detail with it, but Art Tornqvist means Bear Thorn-Branch, the name Arthur seems to mean "son of the bear/warrior-king". Maybe a connection with Arcturus, which means "guardian of the bear". Or with one of the Ursa's (ursa is bear in latin), because permit-locked Polaris of course. And Polaris also has a weird connection to Sir Phillip Sidney, because he wrote Arcadia. Polaris also has the name "Star of Arcady". So my money's on Polaris as Raxxla-location/Raxxla-clue for now.
I have some other ideas but I have to confirm/deny them. (most likely deny )

edit: added meaning of "ursa"
