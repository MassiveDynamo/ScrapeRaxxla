Interesting looks like a player submission.... but interesting
There’s a post on the forums about the true North Star (galactic) and it must have made Galnet (there’s a link to an old news item too, so Frontier must have put it in game when they were a bit more responsive)
I found our 'True' North Star!
I found it, ladies and gents - Our 'true' North Star - Wregoe TV-L C24-0 :) It's over 1200 LY north of Sol, and less than 1 LY from our ancestral home on the other axes! In fact, it's the furthest 'north' by far of any star within 1 LY. I was first there, as evidenced by these pics. Kinda proud...
