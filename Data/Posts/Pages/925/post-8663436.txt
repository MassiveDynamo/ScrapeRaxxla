Really, REALLY strange sound in Sagittarius A.

If you place the super massive between yourself and Sol, you get this strange chittering sound mixed with what sounds like distorted jet planes landing, voices, a strange strumming, mixed with all sorts of atmospheric synthy stuff. To be honest? It creeps me out.

I'm not sure if this even relates to Raxxla, or perhaps the Landscape signal.

I'd do a recording, but I'm on Xbox, and lacking a PC, can't easily do an analysis of the sound to see if there's any images or anything.

My apologies if this had already been done.
