Decided to do an in-depth analysis of the recent trailer.
I think they may have revealed something.
Possibly have found something of interest to some of you.
2 possible Dark Wheel station locations found. Literal vanishing planets and hidden systems,
two 8th moons of gas giants that vanish from radar. Ghost Worlds.

Nice video....

I did a quick trip over to the systems you covered....
Firstly Pink Floyd video - very apt! ;-)
I couldn't replicate the human signal at ADS 10329 B5... it was my first visit to the system, lots of degraded emissions and pirates at the asteroid belts but nothing weird for me...
ADS 4229 ABC / PMSC 05322+3026 is truly weird being separate systems and yet in the same system (I searched for the PMSC system and jumped to it and whilst the ADS system appears as a separate system in nav, you can fly to it and if you try and jump to it, it says destination is obstructed)..... 26 AURIGAE D is also a bit weird as the icy planets don't show up when you scan the system using the field spectral analysis to discover them (I'm guessing because they are tiny by the looks of it, looked like empty targets until I got very close when flying to them).
I couldn't replicate the bending jump... (how do you do this? where do you jump from and to?)
Odd behaviour - "bodies that vanish from your radar" - I couldn't replicate this myself, do you have a video of it? or can you explain more?
I have recorded most of the stuff mentioned above and if any of it is of interest, let me know and i will upload...

keep the good work going! o7
