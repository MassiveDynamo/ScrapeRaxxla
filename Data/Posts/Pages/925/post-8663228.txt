There’s a post on the forums about the true North Star (galactic) and it must have made Galnet (there’s a link to an old news item too, so Frontier must have put it in game when they were a bit more responsive)
I found our 'True' North Star!
I found it, ladies and gents - Our 'true' North Star - Wregoe TV-L C24-0 :) It's over 1200 LY north of Sol, and less than 1 LY from our ancestral home on the other axes! In fact, it's the furthest 'north' by far of any star within 1 LY. I was first there, as evidenced by these pics. Kinda proud...

Ya thats kinda what i meant. There was a time when we could submit possible points of interest and frontier put a number of them in game. Not saying that it isnt meaningful but if we are looking for something based on an axis that has been in game since the beginning... just a little sceptical.
