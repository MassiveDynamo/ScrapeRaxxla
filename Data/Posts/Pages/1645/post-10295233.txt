If the landscape signal is part of this, then I strongly believe the Codex is telling us to look at the Lost Realms area, maybe there’s locations there with a unique ‘audio’ signal?

Do Trinkets sing at certain locations? Do certain bodies emit unique audio with hidden data?

Or do items including Tharg/Guardian in game alter the landscape signal itself?

Guardian Ancient Key for example....
