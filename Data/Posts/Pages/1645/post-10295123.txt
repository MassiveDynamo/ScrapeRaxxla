So are you proposing specifically that the use of "Princess" and "Spiralling" are essentially red herrings and consider it as MB saying to us "reference the tribute not the source for further clues" ?
I don't know about those bits specifically, my gut says it's just "something that sounds like a children's book title", and yes, I think we're supposed to reference the tribute not the specific words. Could be fully wrong about all that, but Astrophel is so very specific and the rest just isn't at all.

The word sonnet is derived from the italian term sonetto literally meaning "little song", derived from the Latin word sonus, meaning a sound.
Your post here is awesome. I'm going to have to read it again and digest it some more! Very exciting!
