Some interesting markings on the beacon..... looks suspiciously like a human in the middle to me....
Awesome! The Guardians did look similar to humans though, so it might equally be a picture of a Guardian It's very unclear how similar they were to us physically, other than two arms, two legs and a single head, which is basically what your image there shows.

I think it's interesting Ram Tah references a 'common ancestor' and a 'branching in their genetic history' there in Biology 6. Obviously this isn't a new insight; but I wonder if we're not a descendant of the Guardians as much as we are cousins - which means there's a common ancestor out there somewhere.

I wonder if that ancestor might be Halsey's Caretakers of the Galaxy, and therefore maybe the sirens aren't post-Guardian, but some even more ancient life... maybe they built Raxxla and maybe the Guardians also heard the siren song and experienced fernweh?

Have you been able to listen for the Landscape signal while you've been going about your investigations in Guardian space?
