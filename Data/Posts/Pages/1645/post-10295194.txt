Awesome That was basically my thinking too!

To compare notes, this was my shortlist:
The early Sol colonies (someone probably heard the call during this period of early expansion, originating the DW and Raxxla myth). Tau Ceti, Beta Hydri, Altair..etc.
The early settlement systems seem intriguing to me, even just because of what MB talked about with the power play between Sol, the fledgling Federation, and later the Empire.

Wow, this took on a whole new level of significance. Even the sound it makes when grabbing an ancient key could be worth checking.
