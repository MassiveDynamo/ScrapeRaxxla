Or do items including Tharg/Guardian in game alter the landscape signal itself?

Guardian Ancient Key for example....
This was what my second expedition to the Landscape Signal source was all about I have been carrying all the Guardian items and two Thargoid Sensors with me the whole time I've been out here (Sensors because the UA's existed very early in the game) . I didn't take Keys since they're more recent inventions in the game.

I tried dropping the items and listening to them near the LS source, I tried jumping through it with them, I tried listening to the LS through them from various places, etc. nothing I've tried has any effect at all.

I also wondered if just carrying those object and jumping around out there might attract the Caretakers, but I saw and heard nothing significant at all.

Doesn't mean I didn't miss something, but I assume others have tried this too. As I said a while back I don't think items you can carry are significant to this, at least not in the same way Thargoid Sensors/Links/Probes were to the Thargoid narrative.
