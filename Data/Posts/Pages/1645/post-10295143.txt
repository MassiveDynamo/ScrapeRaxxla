Looking at it further, the joint US/UK Nautical Almanac highlights 57 navigational stars: https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/Nav_Star_Chart
Four of them belong to the Argo Navis complex.
Canopus (Alpha Carinae) - A frequent destination for Federal rank grinding, as it gives plenty of courier missions to and from neighbouring Exphiay; many Corvettes got new homes thanks to it, including mine. One of the few systems permanently displayed in GalMap when close enough, and forms a remote Federal exclave with four other systems in the Synuefe region. Only two planets, to the disappointment of people looking for Arrakis (which should be the third one).
Miaplacidus (Beta Carinae) - Actually inside the bubble but devoid of planets, having only three stars.
Avior (Epsilon Carinae) - Two stars and two gas giants; either part of the Guardian area of influence or right next to it.
- Two stars and four planets (all landable); on the other end of the IC 2391 Sector relative to Avior.
