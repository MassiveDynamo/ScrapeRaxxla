I would recommend listening to the whole section with the cool sound devs, interesting things discussed like the sounds of planets originating from real audio recordings from space, the work they do and how they go about it... but it is quite long...
All that time flying my favourite Krait and never once thought of listening out for a coffee machine for each new contact. So much attention to detail.
