I don't know about those bits specifically, my gut says it's just "something that sounds like a children's book title", and yes, I think we're supposed to reference the tribute not the specific words.
Though since you're poking around near the centre of the galaxy for the landscape signal, "spiralling stars" works as a pointer to that too.
(Not that they actually spiral unless they get fatally close to Sag A*, but the visual impression nevertheless works)
