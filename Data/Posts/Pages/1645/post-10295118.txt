If what we are supposed to be looking for is actually something we ought to be ‘listening’ for. Then I still propose my work with the Lost Realms and Milton/Holdstock model might have relevance.

If the landscape signal is part of this, then I strongly believe the Codex is telling us to look at the Lost Realms area, maybe there’s locations there with a unique ‘audio’ signal?

There are various locations in game which seem to have some relevance.
I'll start checking these systems soon I'm about 1/2 way back to the bubble now. I'm vaguely assuming that either a stellar body will have special audio, or that simply listening to the Landscape Signal from the right system will show more in the spectrogram... ? Not really sure, finding the first one will be the hardest.
