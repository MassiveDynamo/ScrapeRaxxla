longer look at the beacon and the markings and etchings (or just scratches/wear?) all over it....

Just watched these. You can actually hear the siren song (Landscape Signal) in your video

It's most noticeable around 4mins in to 6 mins in when you're panning across that panel. I assume you're pointing roughly towards the Galactice core there.

That's interesting, it means the Beacons function like other space objects (i.e. transparent to the signal). You can also hear the signal through Lagrange clouds, starports, distant planets and stars, etc.

Question: The Triangles on those beacons aren't regular... could they represent mountains?



Edit: I suppose I don't mean "is this a specific mountain range", I meant more generally, if a species has been seeing a mountain range in their minds, I wonder if they'd develop triangular markings as a sort of unconscious expression of that? It's a reach, I know
