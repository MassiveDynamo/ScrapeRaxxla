It’s probably a silly question, but not clear to me since I haven’t got into the beta, so are these sonnets of astrophel mentioned in the codex? I’m getting frustrated reading the spoilers & only understanding half...

If you are beta testing, then do you delete those log files before running the released version in order to avoid confusing your travels in the real universe (e.g. for EDD)?

edit: are there any dark nebulae within the bubble? Thought the nearest was the Coalsack.

Princess Astrophel and the spiraling stars is the name of a childrens book, mentioned in the codex.
Some thinks it contains clues.
