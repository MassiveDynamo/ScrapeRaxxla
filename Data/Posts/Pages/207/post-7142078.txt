May Omphalos artifact connected to Raxxla and sonnets of Astrophel point to the middle of Raxxla word, mean we should look at sonnet xx? In that case Raxxla could be somewere in the dark dust nebulae or behind it.
SPOILER













It may also then confirm end of the codex article, that some tyran is using Raxxla for his own needs. Interesting could we find it just following some special npc ship?
