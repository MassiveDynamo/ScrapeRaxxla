It’s probably a silly question, but not clear to me since I haven’t got into the beta, so are these sonnets of astrophel mentioned in the codex? I’m getting frustrated reading the spoilers & only understanding half...

If you are beta testing, then do you delete those log files before running the released version in order to avoid confusing your travels in the real universe (e.g. for EDD)?

edit: are there any dark nebulae within the bubble? Thought the nearest was the Coalsack.
This is the place to go to find which real nebulae (including dark nebulae) are in ED:

There are no known procedural dark nebulae (big shame!). The closest dark nebula to Sol is the Taurus Dark Region but see the list at the top of the OP in the thread above as there are several others within 1 KLY or so.
Regarding log files, those are separate between beta and live - no need to delete anything. I've been running EDD the last couple of weeks as in live I've been on the Lightning Strike Expedition, whilst my beta save has been in between Colonia and the Bubble and there has been no conflict or confusion.
