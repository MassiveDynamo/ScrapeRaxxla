May as well drop in a few things.

Vela Dark is part of the remnant of the Vela SN.

IRL, the Vela Pulsar is just over 11,000 yrs old, see https://phys.org/news/2016-02-glitching-vela-pulsar.amp

In game, the age of the Vela Pulsar is 2 MYrs. (See https://www.edsm.net/en/system/bodies/id/491743/name/Vela+Pulsar )

Which is quite an odd discrepancy, especially given that the Vela Pulsar is right in the thick of the Guardian bubble, and the time the Guardians were around was 2 MYrs ago.

The Vela Pulsar is just under 1,000 ly from Sol.
