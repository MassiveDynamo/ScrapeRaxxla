May Omphalos artifact connected to Raxxla and sonnets of Astrophel point to the middle of Raxxla word, mean we should look at sonnet xx? In that case Raxxla could be somewere in the dark dust nebulae or behind it.
SPOILER













It may also then confirm end of the codex article, that some tyran is using Raxxla for his own needs. Interesting could we find it just following some special npc ship?

It’s probably a silly question, but not clear to me since I haven’t got into the beta, so are these sonnets of astrophel mentioned in the codex? I’m getting frustrated reading the spoilers & only understanding half...

If you are beta testing, then do you delete those log files before running the released version in order to avoid confusing your travels in the real universe (e.g. for EDD)?

edit: are there any dark nebulae within the bubble? Thought the nearest was the Coalsack.
