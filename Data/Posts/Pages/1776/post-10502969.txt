Interesting ideas.

Consider it from the other way around though too.

You're naming a character that you want to be an astronomer or "star lover", someone powerful, celestial, a princess or goddess figure...google those ideas, one of the names you get offered in those "250 names for your baby" type lists is, in fact, Astrophel. Here's one such, out of many.


This works both in the lore and out: In the lore it's the name of a character in a book so the author of that book chose that name - and it was also chosen by whoever wrote the codex info to be the name of a fictional person in a fictional book.

Having sat looking through endless names lists myself trying to find the right name for a character... maybe this is actually "what Astrophel means". Maybe it's just a name that someone picked?
