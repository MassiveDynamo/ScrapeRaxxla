In short, consider the Codex as Fdevs first (and really only) actual hint and first ever actual in-game confirmation of Raxxla and start there with the assumption that they put that in when they didn't have to (no-one was expecting it at all and the quest was virtually dead), so they wanted us to have that specific set of info. It says what it says because Fdev made it say that deliberately and with intent.
Thank you. I was around when this thread started but I been gone for a long time and I wasn't aware of this. Matter of fact last time I played regular there wasn't even a Codex. Hard to play catch-up over 1700 pages this thing has grown to. I found a transcript of the codex entry, and it seems it is indeed the source where the language from the wiki comes from.

I'd ignore Astrophel and Stella and Astrophel too, no-one's found any references to anything in them at all
I plan to find out. Hope you're wrong.
