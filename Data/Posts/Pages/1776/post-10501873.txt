And I am saying it could be a giant arrow, that they have never approached something, fairly central to the most central and engineered system in the game.

Every other asteroid field works perfectly. Except Sol's.

I can go to Tau Ceti, and go to their Asteroid sites that are less than 4 ls from the star. Never any issue with any star outside of Sol.

Also, side note, every other Mining site in every other Planet's rings work 100% perfectly. Except the Void Opal site in Neptune's rings. Which doesn't have a drop point.
You could have something there, never tried void opal mining in Sol& haven't heard anything about drop point problems at Neptune. With the recent discussion on Triton it may be FD were giving us clues... Have at it Commander!
