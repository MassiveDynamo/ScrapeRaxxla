I'm making no assumptions, but I'm wondering how much credence we can place on that apparent hint in Elite Legacy (& possibly also the hint from the Dev Diary vid also stressing Alliance & carrying illegal goods, possibly implying TOHF) that Raxxla is in Alliance space. I suspect it may be obfuscation...
