Going by wiktionary's linguistic guide it would be said just like 'fel'. Hence why I asked if there were native speakers around
While digging around for pronunciation I found there are certain scenarios where the p can be softened to a 'ph' sound in Welsh, but it wouldn't be a guaranteed thing. Beats digging around for stegosaurs at least.
The voice actor does say it in a way that emphasises the second syllable - which happens to be like iambic pentameter, thus a-STROFF-el - coincidentally used by Keats who abandoned Hyperion because of too many inversions like Milton but then ended up using Milton's style anyway in Fall
Mmm, googling...
A "strophe" is a group of lines that form a section of a poem..the first part of a Greek Ode poem (the Odyssey???)

"stroph" comes from Greek, where it has the meaning "turn; twist"

Edit
So are we being told the solution is in an anagram, twisting the letters/words??
