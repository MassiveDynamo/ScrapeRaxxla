Going by wiktionary's linguistic guide it would be said just like 'fel'. Hence why I asked if there were native speakers around
While digging around for pronunciation I found there are certain scenarios where the p can be softened to a 'ph' sound in Welsh, but it wouldn't be a guaranteed thing. Beats digging around for stegosaurs at least.
The voice actor does say it in a way that emphasises the second syllable - which happens to be like iambic pentameter, thus a-STROFF-el - coincidentally used by Keats who abandoned Hyperion because of too many inversions like Milton but then ended up using Milton's style anyway in Fall
Yes the letter ph would sound like an English F
