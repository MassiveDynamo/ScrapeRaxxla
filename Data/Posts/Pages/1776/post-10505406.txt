The assumption made by @Jorki Rasalas (correct me if I have it wrong) is based upon a statement made by Brookes about flying through that area with unidentified prohibited goods. And is combined also with the assumption that in Brookes Elite Legacy, certain acts occur in that general area.

The assumption is from my perspective, not that Raxxla has had an effect upon exploration (?) but rather the author may have hidden locational environmental clues in his statements and work(s) to advocate that zone might be a good place to look?

We also seemingly have it by official source, that other novels were told to avoid the subject of Raxxla.
