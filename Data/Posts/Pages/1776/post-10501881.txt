Thank you. I was around when this thread started but I been gone for a long time and I wasn't aware of this. Matter of fact last time I played regular there wasn't even a Codex. Hard to play catch-up over 1700 pages this thing has grown to. I found a transcript of the codex entry, and it seems it is indeed the source where the language from the wiki comes from.


I plan to find out. Hope you're wrong.
I never believed that the codex's Astrophel (a boy's name, so why princess? sounds contrived to me) was a reference to Philip Sidney's prose (didnt stop me spending a lot of time diving binary BH from "Stella's black eyes", just in case!) nor any other classical literature- I cant believe MB would set us off chasing down external leads like that...the clues and solutions should all be available within this game. So I tried looking at that supposed book title as an anagram; many many system names can be derived, narrows down a lot if you believe Elite Legacy's hint to Raxxla being in Alliance space. But havent found it yet though.

Just a thought.
