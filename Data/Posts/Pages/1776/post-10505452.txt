I'm making no assumptions, but I'm wondering how much credence we can place on that apparent hint in Elite Legacy (& possibly also the hint from the Dev Diary vid also stressing Alliance & carrying illegal goods, possibly implying TOHF) that Raxxla is in Alliance space. I suspect it may be obfuscation...

Mmm not sure, I think it is possibly related but only temporally.

In so much that its possibly had relevance in an original timeline of orchestrated events, but maybe now, any such evidences relevance might have degraded, because of obfuscation!

Personally I feel there are two mysteries at play here.

One revolves around an original narrative that was cut short, but whose architecture persists to this day?

The other possibly a redux, a redraft of the original, which may or may not continue along the same path of enquiry?

Logically any evidence ought to correlate along the timeline irrespective, but if chapters were removed, before they were drafted, or shared, how reliable would it be now?
