That would be interesting. It's that or they messed up and it's a glitch and it should be slid to the right more. I've noticed some things need you to have it all the way too far to the left potentially are off the side at times. Either way potentially. Since most things seemed to be centred correctly. Unless I'm missing something. Not sure if that is a bug or intended. I also might be remembering it wrong.
