This is what Raxxla or the Omphalos Rift may look like, based on the thumbnail displayed in the Codex.

SPOILER
The positives:
A hexagonal dotted line is appropriate for depicting a portal since a portal is not made out of solid material, is temporary, and could be transparent.
The Codex entry on Raxxla also mentions a portal: "Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed."
A circle with a dot in the middle is the alchemical symbol for the sun, a star.
Interpreting the circle with a dot as a star is fitting for the context of a portal. Creating a portal requires a massive energy source and stars emit huge amounts of energy.
The funnel-shaped form fits the function nicely. The back end is larger thereby increasing surface area for collecting energy from a star, and the front end is smaller thereby concentrating said energy.
The six pieces also fit together in three dimensions and doing so closes the front, allowing for the necessary function of shutting down the portal by physical means.

The negatives:
The three segments around the circle with a dot remain open to interpretation and are not present in the model in any way.
What is holding the six pieces together? Any force exerted by the portal would set the pieces adrift in space.
Spatial dimensions cannot be inferred from the two-dimensional drawing. The size is unknown and the shape could be a lot longer, shorter, tapered, or less tapered.

Suggestion to explorers seeking Raxxla: Keep an eye out for signal sources very close to the star. These should be discovered automatically due to close proximity and appear at the top of the ship's navigation panel.
