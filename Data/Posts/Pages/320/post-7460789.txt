Blimey. I'd forgotten about that. It's been a long road, getting from there.... ahem.

Yes. When I put Raxxla in those fan novels I was trying to figure out a way to have Raxxla be a portal and a planet (as per description in the Dark Wheel) which had somehow not been found despite decades of searching. I figured it had to be meta-physical in some manner, hence the wierdness/witchspace implementation in Mutabilis. I'd do it differently now (not that I have anything to do with Raxxla in ED I hasten to add), but that sort of slightly ethereal, magical, otherworldness struck me as quite a good way of realising Raxxla.

Oolite was true to the original game Elite, where we had different 'galaxies', galactic hyperspace and other conventions now long abandoned by ED. Whatever they do with Raxxla in ED, it will be different.

Hi Drew! The reason I reference those books is that we can still found many small pieces of those events and universe in the game right now as unconnected fragments copied 1 on 1, so I believe they are still used as one of the sources for FD inspiration.

I have no words to describe Your passion to do such a huge work for free. Thanks for all the effort and fun You made us with those books.
The only major reason I could think of for excommunication of those books is *insert conspiracy theory here*.
