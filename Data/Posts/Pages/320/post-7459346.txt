Anyone think it is significant that the far right hand side of the FSS spectrum is the only part that is not labeled? Check this out for yourself. Honk the system, open up your FSS and tune the scanner to the far right hand side of the spectrum. You’ll notice that, unlike the left-hand side, there is no label for the farthest right hand portion of the signal spectrums. The “gas giant” label doesnt extend over the farthest right hand side of the FSS.

Could this be where signal sources for “exotic” stars or “rogue” planets might appear? I.e., could this be a way to find Raxxla?
