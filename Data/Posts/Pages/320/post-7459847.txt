This is what Raxxla or the Omphalos Rift may look like, based on the thumbnail displayed in the Codex.



The positives:
A hexagonal dotted line is appropriate for depicting a portal since a portal is not made out of solid material, is temporary, and could be transparent.
The Codex entry on Raxxla also mentions a portal: "Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed."

The negatives:

Suggestion to explorers seeking Raxxla: Keep an eye out for signal sources very close to the star. These should be discovered automatically due to close proximity and appear at the top of the ship's contacts panel.

The guardian gateways already potentially fit that.

Did anyone realize the guardian gateway parts look like a gun. A german leuger and something else?

There are multiple parts that are clearly simply guns. Why is 1 million year old tech modelled after ww2 area weapons?
