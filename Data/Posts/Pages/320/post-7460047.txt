Oh yeah ! The "Oolite Raxxla" !
I love it.

' Itâ€™s not a portal, or even a time machine by design, but it is an alien construct that underpins the very fabric of witchspace. It is linked to space and time.'

Mutabilis, by Drew Wagar.

Blimey. I'd forgotten about that. It's been a long road, getting from there.... ahem.

Yes. When I put Raxxla in those fan novels I was trying to figure out a way to have Raxxla be a portal and a planet (as per description in the Dark Wheel) which had somehow not been found despite decades of searching. I figured it had to be meta-physical in some manner, hence the wierdness/witchspace implementation in Mutabilis. I'd do it differently now (not that I have anything to do with Raxxla in ED I hasten to add), but that sort of slightly ethereal, magical, otherworldness struck me as quite a good way of realising Raxxla.

Oolite was true to the original game Elite, where we had different 'galaxies', galactic hyperspace and other conventions now long abandoned by ED. Whatever they do with Raxxla in ED, it will be different.

I hope they come up with something compelling, but, whatever they do, it's going to be very very tough to make it live up to 30+ years of expectation and also makes it more than one person going "here it is" and everyone else watching it on Youtube. Tough one.

Cheers,

Drew.
