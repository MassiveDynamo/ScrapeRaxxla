This chat is nothing special. It's just a weak interpretation of the Codex entry.

Edit (to be more constructive):

- Finding TDW stations makes Raxxla hunt easier | This is pretty obvious to me. As I played dozens of games over 15 years and solved mysteries with my guilds and myself. My personal experience tells me so.
- Orbiting the 8th moon of a GG, already known. It could've been orbiting permenant dark side of the moon and the planet, with moon being at the L2 of the planet and the station being at the L2 of the moon, but that wouldn't have given us the codex screenshot as we would've seen the planet in the background too.

The double L2 configuration could work i theory but with seven moons orbiting between the gas giant and the moon, it doesn't sound very stabile.
