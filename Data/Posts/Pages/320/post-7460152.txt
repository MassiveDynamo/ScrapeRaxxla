Dark wheel station confirmed? Canonn NDA chat confirmed https://imgur.com/gallery/nMZVO1X

Sounds fishy. How can a station orbit the dark side of a moon that orbits a gas giant?

The gas giant is not a light source. You would need a very peculiar set of orbital resonances to keep the station in eternal shadow form the moon.

The station in the codex would be brightly lit by the red star. It also looks to close to the star to fit a gas giant, in addition to the moon in the picture. I don't think the picture is of the actual Dark Wheel station. At least if the eight moon thing is true.
