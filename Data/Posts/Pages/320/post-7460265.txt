Sounds fishy. How can a station orbit the dark side of a moon that orbits a gas giant?

The gas giant is not a light source. You would need a very peculiar set of orbital resonances to keep the station in eternal shadow form the moon.

The station in the codex would be brightly lit by the red star. It also looks to close to the star to fit a gas giant, in addition to the moon in the picture. I don't think the picture is of the actual Dark Wheel station. At least if the eight moon thing is true.

This chat is nothing special. It's just a weak interpretation of the Codex entry.

Edit (to be more constructive):

- Finding TDW stations makes Raxxla hunt easier | This is pretty obvious to me. As I played dozens of games over 15 years and solved mysteries with my guilds and myself. My personal experience tells me so.
- Orbiting the 8th moon of a GG, already known. It could've been orbiting permenant dark side of the moon and the planet, with moon being at the L2 of the planet and the station being at the L2 of the moon, but that wouldn't have given us the codex screenshot as we would've seen the planet in the background too.
