Bumpity-bump! Any of you wise CMDRs know the answer to this?

Did you used to be able to select permit-locked systems?

I recently tried, and found that you can no longer select them. I am certain you used to be able to.

Is this a new thing?

POST EDIT: as in select them in the galaxy map.

The reason I ask is that I was sure (but can't remember) that you used to be able to select them in the galaxy map. I can't do it any longer, which is a pain because of something I wanted to check out...
