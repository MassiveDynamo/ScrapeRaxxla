Bumpity-bump! Any of you wise CMDRs know the answer to this?



The reason I ask is that I was sure (but can't remember) that you used to be able to select them in the galaxy map. I can't do it any longer, which is a pain because of something I wanted to check out...
I don't remember having problems selecting them but if you type the system name in it should do that for you.
.
Most individual permit-locked systems in the Bubble now say which faction gives the permit. A couple say they are locked by the Pilots Federation and no permits are issued. Some say nothing at all other than 'X system permit required'. Are you checking the different messages given when you try to hyperspace to them?
