The myth of Atlas and Pleione seems relevant too. Pleione gave birth to the Pleiades, Hyades, and Hyas (mother of stars). The Pleiades also have been central to the Thargoid thing too (Merope and Maia are Pleiades). Just another of an endless list of myths we could tie into this. Gotta find a relevant one lol.
