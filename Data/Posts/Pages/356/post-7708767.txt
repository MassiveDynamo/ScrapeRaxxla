There is an opinion, that "Raxxla" is a design world for the developer. You know, such places can often be found in games. Usually there is everything in the game. (Example: Fallout, GTA, old Nintendo games, etc.) They are created for different purposes: for the test, creating game videos, fast upgrading testers, checking game mechanics on the combat server, etc. If so, then no one simple player will not get there by legal means (ED is online, and this can upset the balance.). At a minimum, access there is limited, and even if the developer allows the player to visit this place, he first makes sure the player adequacy. If the game is solo, the player can gain access to a place like a promotion at the end of the game. I apologize for my bad English, but I think the idea is clear to you. Based on all the information that I learned about Raxxla for 4 year ED and 2 mouth Elite, there is such a possibility.
