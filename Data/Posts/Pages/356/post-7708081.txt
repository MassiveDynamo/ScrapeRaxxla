All the ancient probes I saw were insanely far away. Nothing else out of the norm on FSS near Galileo/Moon. Only anomaly is the “Other (1)” that shows up on notable signals when I’m by the station. Like out of SC.
Oh, it’s orbiting the Moon? Couldn’t remember exactly where the station was. Check the Nav Panel - can you see an Unregistered Comms Beacon nearby? (Might be a Listening Post rather than a UCB, can’t remember off the top of my head and would have to look it up, which would be a bit of a waste as you’re in a position to check directly in game! )
