I think we can agree that "tiny bit obvious" is a failure; whatever they put in to make it obvious is something most players don't pay attention to.

It's also entirely possible that any CMDR competent enough to make it out of a mail slot has flown right past an obvious but symbolic clue, hidden right under our noses in plain sight at least once, if not hundreds or even thousands of times.

The problem is, it won't be obvious until after it's recognised.
