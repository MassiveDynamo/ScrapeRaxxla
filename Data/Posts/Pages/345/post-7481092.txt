I just made an edit to my original post, but I'll put it here as well. According to Drew Wagar's hyperspace lore: https://canonn.science/lore/drewwagar-hyperspace/, hyperspace wasn't discovered until the 2200s. I'll still take Drew as the authority on this, as IIRC, it was put into the game as a Galnet article a long time ago.

I saw Drew's information on the history of Hyperdrive. even at 2800 this is well after the first report of Raxxla meaning to say the rumor was a myth before space travel? the Raxxla codex implies the author mentioning the Raxxla myth had a ship able to travel space to follow a "pirate map".
So i had to look before 2800 to find a reasonable method humans could explore the galaxy and develop the Raxxla rumor.
