It is but the FTL travel was rudimentary and not widely used in manned vessels. The FSD (able to jump by itself, over long distance, and without a pre-made tunnel system) is quite new. According to MB it came into use just before 3300, and the major powers still havenâ€™t adjusted to it yet. Before then hyperspace was mostly used for launching probes to potential habitable systems, or on trial basis by exceptionally brave pilots.

I just made an edit to my original post, but I'll put it here as well. According to Drew Wagar's hyperspace lore: https://canonn.science/lore/drewwagar-hyperspace/, hyperspace wasn't discovered until the 2200s. I'll still take Drew as the authority on this, as IIRC, it was put into the game as a Galnet article a long time ago.
