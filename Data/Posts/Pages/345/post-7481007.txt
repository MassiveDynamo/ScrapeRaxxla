A problem with Raxxla's time frame.

The premise of this discussion is that the myth of Raxxla's first recorded appearance is not enough time for humans to have explored far from SOL.
Some raw data first.
Year 2097 - The first Generation ships where deployed.
Year 2100 - The first hyperdrive was invented
Year 2151 - The first colony was set up at Tau Ceti
Year 2296 - The first mention of the word Raxxla
Year 2800 - The Faraway Jump system was developed (Hyperdrive Type 0)

Are you sure about these dates? That's only three years between the first Generation Ships and the introduction of FTL travel. At 0.225LY/per year for the Generation Ships, three years isn't even enough time for them to have left the Sol System.

According to Drew Wagar's hyperspace lore, Hyperspace wasn't discovered until the 2200s.
