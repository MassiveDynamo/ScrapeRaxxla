No, I'm refering to the source of the statement from the video I watched. They have never said it was a little big obvious. I watched the livestream where DB stated this and rewatched it in the past in regards to this. The statement about it being a little bit obvious is not a clue to raxxla. It was about the question of how obvious it is certain things come up as subjects in questions in live stream. That is the origin of that statement. It was not a clue in any sense.

It would not even work at a clue on top of it because that does not actually say anything. People just got worked up over people talking about this and it keeps being repeated. It was never a clue about raxxla. It's not even helpful. Anything you know instantly becomes a little bit obvious by definition.
The ‘tiny bit obvious’ isn’t from the video with David Braben that you watched. Not sure where you’ve got the impression that people thought it was. It’s from a completely different (and quite a bit older) video and was said by Michael Brookes. It’s linked to on the FP.

It is absolutely, 100% a Raxxla related statement.

I do think having the context of the rest of what was said is pretty important though, hence why I retranscribed all the relevant bit from the video and posted it on here just the other day - see the link I gave you, or the Q&A bit from the middle of Xaintly’s reply.

Hope that clears things up.
