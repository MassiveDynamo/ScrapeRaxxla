Are you sure about these dates? That's only three years between the first Generation Ships and the introduction of FTL travel. At 0.225LY/per year for the Generation Ships, three years isn't even enough time for them to have left the Sol System.

It is but the FTL travel was rudimentary and not widely used in manned vessels. The FSD (able to jump by itself, over long distance, and without a pre-made tunnel system) is quite new. According to MB it came into use just before 3300, and the major powers still havenâ€™t adjusted to it yet. Before then hyperspace was mostly used for launching probes to potential habitable systems, or on trial basis by exceptionally brave pilots.
