I saw Drew's information on the history of Hyperdrive. even at 2800 this is well after the first report of Raxxla meaning to say the rumor was a myth before space travel? the Raxxla codex implies the author mentioning the Raxxla myth had a ship able to travel space to follow a "pirate map".
So i had to look before 2800 to find a reasonable method humans could explore the galaxy and develop the Raxxla rumor.

Achenar was colonized in about 2300. Jump capability wasnâ€™t that bad, back then.
Faraway and quirium drives were GalCop specific systems, designed to limit pilots from traveling outside the eight maps.

The rest of the galaxy probably used the same system as in Fe:2, where one max distance jump took 1 week.
