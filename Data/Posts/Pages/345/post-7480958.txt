It's also entirely possible that any CMDR competent enough to make it out of a mail slot has flown right past an obvious but symbolic clue, hidden right under our noses in plain sight at least once, if not hundreds or even thousands of times.

The problem is, it won't be obvious until after it's recognised.

After a couple months of searching myself, i came to a similar conclusion. The only solid clue is the codex so far. This one clue.... With one data point we can have any number of wild conclusions (as exemplified by this thread). What we need is a second clue. With 2 points, a trajectory is established. We will be able to move in a meaningful direction. otherwise we are lost looking for ...something... in a stack of 400 billion needles.

I have put my search on hold until another clue comes through the codex
