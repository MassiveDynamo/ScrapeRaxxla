@drew immortal one, may I ask you to create a screenshot or video of the galactic map Elite 1984, interested in the systems that are in the gap from Lava to Tionisla at that time, in order to understand where the events that are described in the 1990 magazine could take place?
Drew doesn't read the forum nowadays.
Raxxla has never been implemented in any of the previous games; ED is the first time. I think what you are referring to in that magazine article is just fluff.
