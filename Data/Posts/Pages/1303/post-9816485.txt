Someone mentioned Lave the other day...
There is an oddity. A while ago (just rereading my ipad notes, again!) read ED 1.5/2.0 change note and spotted, under General tweaks, “Fix an issue with entering the reference frame of a space station while on the surface of Lave 2 by shrinking the station's reference frame size”. Can’t understand this as Lave 2 is not landable-it’s permit locked at the request of the author of “Lave Revolution” with no known way of getting the permit.
