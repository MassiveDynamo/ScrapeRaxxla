Current half-baked hypothesis:



the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void: Earth- Li Qin Jao (inventor of hyperdrive) station, Venus (Marvel Comic siren), also in classical and medieval folklore Venus became associated with witchcraft via the ars veneris, or love magic, OR Burnell station (Jocelyn Bell Burnell found the first pulsar which elsewhere have been called sirens in space)

Another Sol Siren reference....Triton.... "Furthermore, Tritons in groups or multitudes began to be depicted in Classical Greek art by around the 4th century BC. Among these is the work by Greek sculptor Scopas (d. 350 BC) which was later removed to Rome. The sirens of Homer's Odyssey were sometimes being depicted, not as human-headed birds but as tritonesses by around this time, as seen in a bowl dated to the 3rd century BC, and this is explained as a conflation with Odysseus's Scylla and Charybdis episode."
