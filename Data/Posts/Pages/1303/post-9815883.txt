there is an easter egg. hexagonal of Jupiter, but no matter how much I searched there, I didnâ€™t find anything with which I could interact.
try interacting with Voyager again, I didn't find anything special, but Voyager has been on the ad banners ever since release. suddenly you find something that we missed, a signal that needs to be decoded or something
Hexagonal shape of south and north poles on gas giants are something to be expected. These shapes are created because of strong storms that are present and no land mass, there are no natural obstacle like mountains to disturb their path and for that reason a hexagon or symmetric circular shape is created. Size, shape and color will be effected by gases that are present on given planet and pressure under which these storms are created.
