Drew doesn't read the forum nowadays.
Raxxla has never been implemented in any of the previous games; ED is the first time. I think what you are referring to in that magazine article is just fluff.
here the meaning is not that Raxxla was in past games... IT was not there, at least legally. But thanks to this article from the magazine, I have already found many oddities in the region that is described in the magazine. Perhaps this is all nonsense, but given the path we have traveled, we need to check everything
Between Lave and Tionisla there is one Zaonse system, perhaps at the time of Elite 1981 the location of the systems was different. I don't remember these details anymore, because I played for a very long time

Someone mentioned Lave the other day...
There is an oddity. A while ago (just rereading my ipad notes, again!) read ED 1.5/2.0 change note and spotted, under General tweaks, “Fix an issue with entering the reference frame of a space station while on the surface of Lave 2 by shrinking the station's reference frame size”. Can’t understand this as Lave 2 is not landable-it’s permit locked at the request of the author of “Lave Revolution” with no known way of getting the permit.
On Lave2 there is an oddity in the Odyssey, 2 unregistered signals are noted on the surface (but you can't get in without permission, it is not known if this permission can be obtained at all now or if it is closed to new content. We now know that permissions are obtained not only from some minor faction, but also from interactions, for example, with a beacon). by the way, on the release it was impossible to land on planets,apparently these are some changes associated with the addition of horizons. most likely it should not be on the surface, but in space
