September Summary for #fight-the-club

In September we did fewer, more difficult operations in systems with active player factions and significant traffic. Since June 1, we have removed 19 Club factions from systems representing 2.4 billion people. Significantly, this month, Club faction Sirius Mining Merope - which at one point was active in seven systems, now exists only as a zombie faction in Merope.

We're pleased to announce that squadron Close Encounter Corps, led by CMDR @AntonyVern [СЕС] have joined the fight against the Club. Besides their help in the campaigns in Pleiades Sector PD-S b4-0, Hemaki, and Wolf 202 - working with a large squadron has led to a number of improvements to the discord, which will be valuable when other squadrons join the fight.

Sirius Mining Merope removed from system Pleiades Sector PD-S b4-0.

Squadron & Discord

PLEIADES HISTORICAL SOCIETY [PLOR] formed in August to explore the mysteries of the Pleiades, and to combat regional factions affiliated with The Club: Aegis Research, Janus Incorporated, Pleiades Resource Enterprise, and Sirius Mining Merope. The mystery of HIP 22460 is of particular interest, including The Black Flight, Megaship Overlook, and the involvement of Pleiades Resource Enterprise.

All commanders interested in fighting the Club are welcome to join the discord at https://discord.gg/PdaCsRA.
