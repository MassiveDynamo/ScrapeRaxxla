A black hole is a jewel as well....it refracts like a gem.
Spiralling stars is the tunnel to hyperspace,
Whispers in hyperspace....
we can interpret the clues in many ways.
(which is annoying, but it only takes one interpretation to be correct, I do enjoy these reads a lot, as people are very clever and creative)

I also thought about 2010 a space odyssey:
where a star was manufactured from a gas-giant (Jupiter) by the monolith.

It has been a long time since the Dark Wheel and Raxxla mysteries where established, at the start of Hyperdrive space age.

So stars could have died out since then,
Or that a particular gas-giant with eight moons could have compacted into a small stat and knocked the moons out of the immediate orbit. The Stellar forge simulation accounts for solar winds from newly created stars
And has that capability, but I just assumed it Simulates a period of a few millions of years back and does really “continue” day for day, accounting for more modern times. (Or the magic hand of the devs)
