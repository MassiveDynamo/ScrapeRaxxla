If you sit in some systems for long, like running courier missions to unlock ranks you will get "mysterious stranger" message eventually.
Those are different tasks, some are to visit exact said crashed ship (those are many too around, picks random) and you will be given a key to core. You will be able to scan core ONCE and get text from inside + some mats.

Yes, either we had a discussion about it or there’s a separate thread on Mysterious Stranger tip-offs, probably a combination of the two. My brain is not yet working today, awake at 04:00, need more coffee!

But it’s that fact that you have to be in-system for a while (30 minutes rings a bell) to get them that makes me think they can’t be related to TDW’s test. If this TDW test is a real thing, and not more FD fluff, then TDW should be watching your progress continually; possibly they have many related factions (Premonition’s “wheels within wheels”) and they get interested in you when you’re allied with several of them, at a trigger threshold. Either that or it’s dependent on your commander stats.
