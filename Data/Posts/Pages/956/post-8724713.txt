A question though,
What the flarkin is “The Princess & The Spiralling Stars"
I’ve tried googling for the book and landed on something bizarrely from the 1800 or something.

is it an in-game reference to that in-game sci-if author that was in galnet? The one that disappeared and came back, bad sales / publicity stunt gone bad?

it seams like a “look here”
Which then turns out to be a big massive instant dead end with a just lot of emphasis put on it, or have I missed something revolutionary by having a typo when searching on the internet?

Do you think it could be a red herring? It's weird how it says that the resemblence was eventually discredited. I wonder how it was discredited. I'd also like to know if it's just a coincidence that there is a real life story with the same name or the author of the codex knew. I had a look into the failed author in galnet archives. He wrote a series of books called the corsair King which again there is a real life book of the same name. The real life version is about a pirate. The corsair king is also a game of thrones character which seemed interesting. The in game author does a runner after his fans keep demanding he changes the narrative to suit them
