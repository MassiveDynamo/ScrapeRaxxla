Yes, either we had a discussion about it or there’s a separate thread on Mysterious Stranger tip-offs, probably a combination of the two. My brain is not yet working today, awake at 04:00, need more coffee!

But it’s that fact that you have to be in-system for a while (30 minutes rings a bell) to get them that makes me think they can’t be related to TDW’s test. If this TDW test is a real thing, and not more FD fluff, then TDW should be watching your progress continually; possibly they have many related factions (Premonition’s “wheels within wheels”) and they get interested in you when you’re allied with several of them, at a trigger threshold. Either that or it’s dependent on your commander stats.

This wasn't a tip off mission, it was a direct find based on interesting information within the system description. It's also persistant, relogged the game to confirm. I'm not ingame to check, but the systems probably within 20Ly of SD and TDW.

I can't recall reading anywhere of getting a thargoid sensors from a non-thargoid crash site though?

Can anyone verify or refute that assertion?

I've also encountered the tip offs before, usually when fully allied with a faction in a system and >15 minutes (and there isa cooldown from previous missions too i believe).
