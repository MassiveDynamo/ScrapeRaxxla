Anybody else using EDDiscovery? I’m convinced that I used to be able to type coordinates into the Route Planner & it would find the nearest system in-game (mmm, more likely from EDSM). Doesn’t seem to work now for me, which is a great shame as it was very useful when testing hypotheses for Raxxla etc.
