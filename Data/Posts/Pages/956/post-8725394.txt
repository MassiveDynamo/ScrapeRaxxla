what's expected there
If you sit in some systems for long, like running courier missions to unlock ranks you will get "mysterious stranger" message eventually.
Those are different tasks, some are to visit exact said crashed ship (those are many too around, picks random) and you will be given a key to core. You will be able to scan core ONCE and get text from inside + some mats.
