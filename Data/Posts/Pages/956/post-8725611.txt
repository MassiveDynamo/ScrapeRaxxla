This wasn't a tip off mission, it was a direct find based on interesting information within the system description. It's also persistant, relogged the game to confirm. I'm not ingame to check, but the systems probably within 20Ly of SD and TDW.

I can't recall reading anywhere of getting a thargoid sensors from a non-thargoid crash site though?

Can anyone verify or refute that assertion?

I've also encountered the tip offs before, usually when fully allied with a faction in a system and >15 minutes (and there isa cooldown from previous missions too i believe).

Yes, Shipwrecks are static and persistent locations. There are a few in/near the bubble that have thargoid sensors. I picked up 16 in my CRCR before I went back out to help Han_Zen explore the sysmap anomalies near Star of India and so I could test dive black holes to see if they were Raxxla and you had to supply your own Omphalos. Cant remember how I found the wreck though, think it was a Canonn page or maybe online utilities finder. I noted the site on my gaming PC, will try to remember to look it up later.
