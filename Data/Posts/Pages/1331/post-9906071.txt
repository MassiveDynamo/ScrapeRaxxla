Hmm...

Some additional data.. summing up tho-


Scorpio -
Scorpius
Richard Denning identified Scorpius as Níðhöggr.

In Norse mythology, Níðhöggr (anglicized Nidhogg) is is a dragon or serpent who gnaws at a root of the world tree, Yggdrasil.

... so thats one root of 3.

I'm still looking at the constellations though I don't believe we'd need to go too far into the rabbit hole. Look at what constellations are in Norse Mythos and what they represent. We should be ably to triangulate the (6) systems for the roots and branches of the tree.

Of course, this is a grain of salt in a sandy ocean beach -- we must not discount past discoveries nor cleared worlds, to do so we may just miss whats been in front of us this whole time.
