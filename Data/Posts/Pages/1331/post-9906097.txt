Unlike many other locations associated with Yggdrasil, Nidhogg is not represented in game as a system, but it is the name attributed to a planet in the permit locked system of Nastrond.

Nástrǫnd is a place in Norse underworld, there is also the system Hel a deity, which is also an in game system, Hel is the Norse version of the Greek deity Hecate, and all are relatively close to each other, as represented in my Yggdrasil investigation.
