I recall permits that are locked but have no source as to who or what unlocks them. I know some of them have a future thing to do with them which has been a long time now. But for some that just were locked for a purpose now I'm curious if The Dark Wheel has something to do with those systems being locked for a reason. Then again probably they aren't involved but they have been locked for a long time now for a reason.

This just came to me as I'm unlocking some of my permit systems.

Edit: Something interesting happened while doing missions. I'm not sure if their is a long delay very long like 20mins long but I was doing "Infiltrate the megaship data link mission". I scanned the wrong Ship data logs and ended up with a Tip Off still a recycled tip off from the list but interesting if this maybe the case.
