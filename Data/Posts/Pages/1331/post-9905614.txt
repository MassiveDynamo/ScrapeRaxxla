In my opinion ED is riddled with inconsistency.

The Codex I feel is part confirmation, part alibi.

The Codex identifies the DW and Raxxla as in game (at least initially as textually in lore).

The alibi arises when FD allude that there ‘maybe’ a test, but said source of that information is very likely unreliable. Next it states said test, if initiated, would not be recognized, nor ever acknowledged, only upon the discovery of the DW station.

FD then state when directly questioned about the Codex and the manual, that certain factions and permits are not currently active. I take that to mean the DW invite is not currently active. That’s speculative insight.

Of course the DW station may still be findable?

Next we discover the tip-off missions, released some years later.

Tip Off missions did not come after the release Codex, but were released years before. They were there when i started playing seriously in Jan. 2017.
