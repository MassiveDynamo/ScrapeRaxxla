Norse Mythos....

However, Snorri Sturluson, in his Prose Edda, holds that there are actually three wells beneath the tree, one for each of its roots. The Well of Urd, according to him, is not below Yggdrasil, as it is in Völuspá – it’s actually in the sky, and the root that grows out of it bends upward into the sky (!). The Well of Urd is where the gods hold their daily council meetings. The second well is called Hvergelmir (perhaps “Bubbling Cauldron”[14] or “Roaring Kettle”[15]), and it’s the body of water beneath the second root, which stretches into Niflheim, the world of primal ice. This is the root that Nidhogg chews. The third well is that of the wise being Mimir, and it and its root lie in the realm of the giants.[16]

I for one do see this as potential. But we also must look at the DW toast, though it my not be the key, there may be something there that may just need to be done to see what must remain unseen.
