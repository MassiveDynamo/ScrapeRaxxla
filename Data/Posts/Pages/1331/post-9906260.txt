Peaks in the middle of impact craters are very common. It’s the same effect as when a drop falls into water-the surface depresses then rebounds, only with land it freezes into a mountain.

I’d be surprised if there are caves though. It was widely circulated at one time that the game engine cant do caves, though I kept asking in that case how are Thargoid bases generated...nobody resolved that question!

Edit: if it gets too hairy you could boot into the base game so would be placed into planetary orbit, then land again and retry.
