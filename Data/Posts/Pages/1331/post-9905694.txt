Perhaps one obvious drawback is that the “personal journey” was all about the effort to gain elite rank which gained the Founders World permit to access Shinrarta, but since many backers & founders got that for payment it would have been unfair to everyone else, so perhaps FD decided to make access to the secrets a little more convoluted.
Well as a beta backer I was one of the cmdrs who accidentally got access to Shinrarta from the start which they didn't take back... think it was fear of a backlash when going live....

Guess there were a lot more people flying around in Shinrarta than they expected....
