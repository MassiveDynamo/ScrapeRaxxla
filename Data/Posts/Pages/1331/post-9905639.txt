I think Tip Off missions were introduced as part of the mission system revamp, which IIRC occurred around the end of 2015 with release 1.5/2.0, and I suspect the Shinrarta E/F missions were deleted at the same time. I suspect they were deleted because either 1) they were red herrings and FD decided they would cause too many problems or 2) were too revealing....I’m still pondering what could have been revealed by them!

Perhaps one obvious drawback is that the “personal journey” was all about the effort to gain elite rank which gained the Founders World permit to access Shinrarta, but since many backers & founders got that for payment it would have been unfair to everyone else, so perhaps FD decided to make access to the secrets a little more convoluted.

I suspect if there is a storyline leading towards Raxxla and/or TDW station then appropriate missions would have been created under the new mission system to replace the old E/F missions.
