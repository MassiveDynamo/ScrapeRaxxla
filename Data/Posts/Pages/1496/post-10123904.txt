So are the sentient androids from FFE (Jaques is a cyborg. He used to be a regular human) and the massive clone armies of the Empire.
Holo-Me says otherwise especially by way of circuitry tattoos and eyes. However, that is assuming humanity isn't extinct and just trapped in the Sim-Archive/Guardian Monolith Network. Though, at least, in theory, Mycoid should be why there are less androids. See my "The Case Against Salvation" PDF posted earlier.
