FD just forgot about that part of the story. Just like the time traveling airplanes on Zemien (was Olf Trygvasson was responsible for that one?), the vanishing Levithan form Liaququ, the bubble ships and Romeo and Juliet from space.
Perception is not the same as reality. The two can be quite divorced from each other and everything be quite fine.

Before you proceed..magic always come at price. It may be a gift but the toll is immense..

The price like the power is - total and complete. It requires surrendering everything you value - because that knowledge comes with responsibility. That said .. if you are still interested...

SPOILER: LIAQUQU, CLONES, BUBBLES ARCS AND CONSEQUENCES
