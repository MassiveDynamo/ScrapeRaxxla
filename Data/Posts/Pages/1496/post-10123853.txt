It seems some people forget that nothing exists unto itself. Even The Dark Wheel has connections to Earth as does the Galactic Navy. Trying to pretend the past doesn't exist, won't make it go away.

So Jaques and Augustus Brenquith appear from thin air as if by magic? Then there's the Galactic Navy comprised of nearly entirely Lakon Spaceways craft or vessels now made by Core Dynamics. Let's not forget Lakon Spaceways being from Sol from multiple sources: Holdstock/Edwards "Tour of the Universe", TDW novella, and first game manual. You cannot have Raxxla without Earth. It is mentioned eight times directly in TDW novella and multiple further times indirectly (e.g. Alex Ryder flying over London as reward for doing well on flight sims). We also have Salom√© directly make reference to old lore/stories. Finally to hit home the point, we have Lavian Brandy per in-game description being made in oak barrels from Earth. This viewpoint simply lacks any basis in actual fact.

Everything you mention and much more has been republished in ED. There are tons of stuff from the old games in ED. Half the FFE stories have been republished in tourist beacons, Galnet and the codex.

There are also thing we know are gone form the old games. The sentient aliens from Elite are gone. So are the sentient androids from FFE (Jaques is a cyborg. He used to be a regular human) and the massive clone armies of the Empire.

Most of the old stuff is still in the dark. It may pop up in ED at some point and become canon. Until then, it isn't. It's still interesting to read the old stuff, but we can only guess if it actually happened.

Earth absolutely existed in the lore of Elite. It was well outside of Galcop space and was not accessible to Galcop pilots, due to their limited trade maps. This is relatively clearly explained in Imprint .
