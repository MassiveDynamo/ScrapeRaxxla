Now just a moment there!
Arrakis is in-game & Iâ€™ve seen the film (very much looking forward to the second part!)
The Empire had the Sardaukar clone army!


P.S.
Has anyone gone looking in Odyssey for the sand worms?
It is sadly just the star. I've been there. I think Dune happens about 6880-ish or so years after Elite Dangerous.
