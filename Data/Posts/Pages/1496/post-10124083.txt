As the one who revived most of it, the blame for this lies at the feet of a community that did not want to research the old lore (notably certain mods at Canonn Science who shall remain unnamed). This is despite warnings from Salom√© of the old stories were critical to understand the present. Further, we had key pieces like Lakon Spaceways being from Sol in the Codex, generation ships largely originate from Sol, and Faulcon Delacy and Old Worlds Coalition having strong connections to Sirius Corporation that produced Hydrogen fuel. There is very little in the way of evidence to suggest otherwise. Even the various lessons from Codex entries often involve learning based on the past. The core story is after all is entirely based upon the past being rather intentionally obscured.
okay thanks for this explanation. I had the feeling that the stuff being said about the old lore being retconned was like an official Fdev Statement.
