"Elite creator, David Braben, has stated that we as players have not been playing the game the way it was intended, and such we have never seen specific missions, ever. It is our mission as investigators and treasure hunters to try to unravel this statement, and to give our best to figure out how to play this game differently. We also focus on the search for Raxxla, The Dark Wheel, and any other mysteries this experience provides."
