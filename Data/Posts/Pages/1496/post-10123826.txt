FD has been clear that nothing from the old games are lore, unless it is republished in ED.
But what about the ED novels?
We know that FD went to some trouble to support Drew’s Salomé storyline, both in-game and via Galnet.
AHTW support seems shoddy by comparison.
Perhaps an analysis for each novel is required?
