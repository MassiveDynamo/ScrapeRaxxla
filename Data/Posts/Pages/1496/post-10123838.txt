But what about the ED novels?
We know that FD went to some trouble to support Drew’s Salomé storyline, both in-game and via Galnet.
AHTW support seems shoddy by comparison.
Perhaps an analysis for each novel is required?
They are all officially canon. Except the bits that were about the Alliance / Thargoid relations. That part was retconed.

Most of that stuff is told by in-story characters, so it can be put down to them lying or misremembering.

I doubt that any of the books contain anything useful in regards to Raxxla. Premonition may have some useful pointers about TDW and it portrays the Club as the primary 'sinister cabal' candidate.
