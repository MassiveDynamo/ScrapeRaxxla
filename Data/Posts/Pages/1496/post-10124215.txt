Perception is not the same as reality.
perceptions, interpretations, truth are always a matter from the own position. yes, it's true that the own truth is relative from a certain position. but the relative can only exist because of the absolute ,so in my opinion there is an absolute truth or an absolute state of reality. but its a fact that humans define reality from the own ego.
very interesting theme, especially for those who were chosen to know.
Had some really interesting debates about this in my life.
and yes...there is always a price or a sacrifice one had made.
