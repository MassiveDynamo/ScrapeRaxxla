so some weeks ago I have been told that all the old lore from the old books and old elite games have no meaning for elite dangerous. then in this forum I read about people referring to hints about the search of raxxla related to the old lore.
for me as a new participant in this forum ,it would make things much easier if there would be finally a consensus about what's lore and what's not.
if it's really the fact, that the old elite lore hasn't any meaning to ED than I can easily skip this chapter.
sometimes I wonder if people who still point on raxxla related stuff in old books and games (despite the fact that old lore has been retconned, if this is even a fact) are doing this, because they want to believe this...please ask yourself if you are just doing this to keep up an self created illusion.
FD has been clear that nothing from the old games are lore, unless it is republished in ED.
