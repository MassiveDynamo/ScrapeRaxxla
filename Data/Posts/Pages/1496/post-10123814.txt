The document (and other info on the page) is very well made and accurate, but it also has elements fan fiction. Jades is his own commander and J-Corp is his role playing corporation
Just so it is out in the open: FDev may have canonized this bit of lore as the basis for the faction Janus Incorporated in Delphi and its' much larger connections Facece and the staged death of CMDR Peter Jameson and then Jaques. The letters from Frontier and First Encounters that serve as the groundwork. Also, possible that Jade misunderstood or claimed something from the manual since J-Corp was at the time a rather open-ended question.
