The game is self-contained and you don't need any prior knowledge to play it. Everything one need is in the Codex or Pilot Manual (accessible via the right panel of your ship

FD has been clear that nothing from the old games are lore, unless it is republished in ED.

It seems some people forget that nothing exists unto itself. Even The Dark Wheel has connections to Earth as does the Galactic Navy. Trying to pretend the past doesn't exist, won't make it go away.

So Jaques and Augustus Brenquith appear from thin air as if by magic? Then there's the Galactic Navy comprised of nearly entirely Lakon Spaceways craft or vessels now made by Core Dynamics. Let's not forget Lakon Spaceways being from Sol from multiple sources: Holdstock/Edwards "Tour of the Universe", TDW novella, and first game manual. You cannot have Raxxla without Earth. It is mentioned eight times directly in TDW novella and multiple further times indirectly (e.g. Alex Ryder flying over London as reward for doing well on flight sims). We also have Salom√© directly make reference to old lore/stories. Finally to hit home the point, we have Lavian Brandy per in-game description being made in oak barrels from Earth. This viewpoint simply lacks any basis in actual fact.
