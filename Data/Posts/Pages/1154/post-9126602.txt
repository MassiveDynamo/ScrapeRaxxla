NEWSFLASH: There is no singular path to Raxxla. The entire thing is designed so you can come at it from a multitude of angles and many cultures and still end up with similar conclusions if you pay attention to the larger themes (regardless they all map to the area of the sky surrounding Ursa Major).

Ya I get the feeling that it is tied to early shared myths across cultures ( a big part of Holdstocks shtick). Especially ones like the Persephone, Orion etc... Also currently working off the idea that we arent looking for stations or hidden beacons but rather bodies in the system that are oddly named. which will lead to the next system.... etc tilll we get to the end of the trail....i suspect the dark wheel station.
