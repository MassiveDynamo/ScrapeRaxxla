Dont be sorry for that, I guarantee you whatever language is your native one I cant speak it better than you can speak / write in English.

If youre French I can ask for 1/2 lb of cheese.
If youre German I can ask you where the Town Hall is
If youre Welsh I can insult you pretty well but nothing else

Anything else I cant even begin to talk



Do you mean the Military Convoys that were spotted talking in chat and then had UAs onboard maybe? They were precursors / signs of Thargoids and finding UAs and took a while for a Cmdr to finally hatchbreak them? if so there may be a thread somewhere but before my time so hazy on details. Dunno if thats the right time though or where they were headed and not sure what faction they were unless they were the Isinor ones that mentioned.

Ah, yes. The military convoys carrying UA would have been discussed in the old Canonn threads several of which were archived. See https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8241129

I thought the request was for info on the NPCs that are apparently jumping to the 6 unknown-permit locked bubble systems, which I remember has been discussed in this thread.
