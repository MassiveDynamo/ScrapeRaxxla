I'd be very surprised if we saw these right away, but you never know. I'm guessing that will be another update six months down the road at least, after they get Odyssey onto consoles. Could be wrong but can't imagine them doing it for PC only.
Im imaging an acapella chorus of thargoids floating around in witchspace.. batting their eyes at us... trying to get us to crash our ships so they can abduct us in our escape pods.
