Do you mean the Military Convoys that were spotted talking in chat and then had UAs onboard maybe? They were precursors / signs of Thargoids and finding UAs and took a while for a Cmdr to finally hatchbreak them? if so there may be a thread somewhere but before my time so hazy on details. Dunno if thats the right time though or where they were headed and not sure what faction they were unless they were the Isinor ones that @simulacrae mentioned.
thank you.
