Yes that and also Odyssey is expected to get ground Tharg soldiers
I'd be very surprised if we saw these right away, but you never know. I'm guessing that will be another update six months down the road at least, after they get Odyssey onto consoles. Could be wrong but can't imagine them doing it for PC only.
