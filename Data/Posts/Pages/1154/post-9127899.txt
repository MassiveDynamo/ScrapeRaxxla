Discord is separate to here, not run by Frontier. Main one is 'Independent Raxxla Hunters' but dont have a link, dunno if you can google that or put it in Discord? Its generally more of an echo chamber though with one main theory being pushed as 'the solution' rather than offered as a suggestion amongst other suggestions. Lot of cross-over people here and on Discord. Think 'Canonn' have a Raxxla sub-subject as well, as do a fair few independent groups and Squads / factions etc.

Youre always welcome to join in here in the meantime and afterwards Just post your tinfoil and have fun. Nobody can say youre definitely wrong as nobody knows what it is or where it is or what its based on...but we do spot hoaxers here a lot quicker so in some ways its 'safer' if youre new to the search.

Do you have a theory or thoughts yet? Always interesting to get a new or different POV on it.

Most of the time; I am travelling, out of the bubble. I follow this thread and enjoy reading, all the theories; so, I better also help if I can.

My theory: until FD let us interact directly with the Thargoids, we will not get the key; the bearing to set sail, in the right direction.

Maybe O Gigante Adamastor & The Odyssey will change, all that the current CG is to research, new technology.
