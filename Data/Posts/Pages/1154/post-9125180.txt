Digging more into the idea that Raxxla is related to some kind of early contact (think Sumerian) with earth by Thargoids. Relating to the Gilgamesh Myth / Huluppu Tree . Possibly also Innana/Dumuzid (a little weaver girl/cowherd connection for HZ) . Also where Gilgamesh learns from Utnapishtim (the far away) of a secret of the gods... a plant like a buckthorn... which brings back youth...

Imagine a thargoid ship floating over a barnacle... with the Pleiades in the sky

SPOILER: ANCIENT THARGOIDS

Ya still playing with idea that Art Tornquist (Thorny Branch) and his gal Cora (kore) relates to Holdstocks fascination with Mating with the Earth and the Thorn and the Stone.... ya Nothing terribly new - I found out that the Norse Giants were also called "thorn" (when they werent being called jotun). ... how this translates into a path we have to follow... still working on that.
