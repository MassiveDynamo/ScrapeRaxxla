Don't think I said who or what created it. It's still in game. Did stellar forge create the ships? How about the mission boards? Those are noticeably in game
That's the important part. Ships & mission boards are in the game and they can be interacted with.
Now Andromeda. To me it looks like (a poor quality) picture painted on the skybox, being just that - a background picture, gameplaywise just a decoration. If it was a tangible in game thing made using the Stellar Forge, then it could be said to be in the game, just (so far) inaccessible.
