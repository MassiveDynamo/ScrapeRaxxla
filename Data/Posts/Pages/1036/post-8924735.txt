And Michael Brooke's said we don't actually know what Raxxla is. For all we know it could just be an object in the sky box, which would technically be in game.

I'm not saying I think this or I want this to be true. But we can't say with any certainty that Raxxla is anything specific or not because we don't have that information. Only that it's in game
