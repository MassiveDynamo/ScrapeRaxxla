@Jorki Rasalas If I get some spare time I'll visit some other systems and play around with the idea. Having some extra help would definitely speed up the process!

On the topic of recorded interviews, I've been combing through the Elite Dangerous video archives for hours every day and still haven't come across the referenced interviews. That's not to say they don't exist, but I haven't found them yet.

What I have found is DB explicitly stating* that they had NOT created extra galaxies in the game, so if Raxxla has been there since the beginning I think we can safely eliminate that possibility.
