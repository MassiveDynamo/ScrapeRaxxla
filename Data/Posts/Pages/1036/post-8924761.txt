given all the effort put in to find raxxla, the devs are at some point have to help the players find it. the reason is that if the players don't find it, at some point they will have lost faith in frontier and simply stop playing the game. also the negitive feedback from that may stop other players from joining.

it seems to me, given all the effort, that raxxla in either not in the game, not accessable, or simply not identifiable (ie: under a different name)
