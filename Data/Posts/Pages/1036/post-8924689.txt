Alright. I can't let you guys have all the fun wearing a path between Sol and Jupiter. I got some time to kill so I'll join the fiesta for a bit.

Does nobody have headtracking here? Seems like it would be handy.

I was in an iEagle and didn't have luck with the hunt last time. I saw Phantoms and DBXs are featured in the green glow vids. Are those the preferred ship for this endeavor?

I started in my Phantom, then briefly tried an Eagle for better manoeuvrability to get round to see the light source. I think anything with a decent cockpit should do, but a Clipper with white dashboard might be good.

Yes, I’ve got headtracking; you can see in my videos that I often use it to check my distance from Sol, when the battery doesn’t run flat!! Didn’t help me view the green glow light source. Perhaps each nav computer has a Raxxla detector built in with a light brightness set to the detection distance? I strongly suspect Guardian AI involvement in those Pilot Federation-controlled nav computers!
