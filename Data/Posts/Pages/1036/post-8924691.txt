@Sparklepaws: your suggestion of a parallel search for green glows in another system is an excellent idea! It would give us a very useful baseline for this search! I guess it should be a system with an asteroid belt to search in, just in case these “asteroid clusters” are a factor.

Volunteers please??

The triple Elite idea came from a livestreamer ages ago. I think it was based on the original novella where a Raxxla was supposed to be a mysterious planet with an alien gateway to other universes and had already been occupied by a band of evil Elite Pilots. I think FD have implied that’s all retconned- they confirmed no other galaxies, & it was in-game before Horizons so unlikely it’s a planet to land on. The only proviso is that reported but unconfirmed interview with DB where he’s supposed to have said Elite was a requirement. May be that whatever it is is guarded & you need to be Elite to stand a chance of survival. No recording of the interview has been found so it’s speculation. We’ll find out when/iff we find it.
