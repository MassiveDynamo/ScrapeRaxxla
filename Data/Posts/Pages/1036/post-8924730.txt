What I have found is DB explicitly stating* that they had NOT created extra galaxies in the game, so if Raxxla has been there since the beginning I think we can safely eliminate that possibility.

Not other galaxies as such, but they did look into extra galactic clusters etc. Some of the systems related to this did make it into the game. (It came up in an ancient MB post related to that weird Gen+ system or some such if memory serves)
