Yes, I chose the iEagle for its maneuverability. It has the lower 50% obstructed by the ship though. I went with the AspX this time for the massive glass it possesses. With the positioning of the cockpit and the thickness of the hull, it should rule out any glow coming from behind me. Maybe that means I'll never see it We'll see how it goes.

I swear, if it's in the cockpit, and it's just Alexa turning on for no reason, I'll be so mad.
