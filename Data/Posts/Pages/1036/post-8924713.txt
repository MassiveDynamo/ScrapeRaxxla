We still can't assume that "in game" is the same as accessible or interactive. Everything fdev says is some kind of tongue in cheek play on words. You couldn't get a straight answer if you asked the shortest distance between 2 points.

For example, Polaris is clearly "in game" but thats it. you can't interact with it. You can only look at it in the galaxy map. Words are really good for misleading folks who want them to mean something specific.
