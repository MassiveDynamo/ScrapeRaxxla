Alright. I can't let you guys have all the fun wearing a path between Sol and Jupiter. I got some time to kill so I'll join the fiesta for a bit.

Does nobody have headtracking here? Seems like it would be handy.

I was in an iEagle and didn't have luck with the hunt last time. I saw Phantoms and DBXs are featured in the green glow vids. Are those the preferred ship for this endeavor?
