Having a look in the Independent Raxxla Hunters Discord.
Falconscreech went glow searching with Sap 8, AI Relics, Trinkets, Mysterious Idol, Jaradharre Puzzle Box, Galactic Travel Guide, Probe, link, Sensor, Ancient Key, Unstable Data Core, and a Guardian Relic.

Spliffz had a crash to desktop while looking; this is very reminiscent of the FRift base CTD when FD had a bug that prevented them instancing.

Our old friend Scytale is hanging out there

Someone suggested the green glow may be a USS spawning in the vicinity; this would tie in with my note that it tends to appear around the time that “new signal source detected” appears in the ship’s info panel.

Someone wondered if the asteroid cluster apparent positional jump might be related to a Caesar cypher. This is intriguing-the logo seems to be a puzzle clue. And we know how FD like to set puzzles! Perhaps Raxxla/Omphalos is another example?

Someone ran out of fuel and the SAR ship came to his assistance. The SAR ship does seem to be part of this puzzle! I’ve not come across another like this; anyone else?
