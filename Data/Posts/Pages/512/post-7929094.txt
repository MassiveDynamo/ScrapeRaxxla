Not plausible. Neither The Dark Wheel nor And Here the Wheel mention Alex's mother. And, while Robert Garry's mother is mentioned in And Here the Wheel, he is unable to find any record of her burial because his entire family history is a sham. We therefore have no proof that any of the Ryder family members have mothers (or any other combination of two parents). Maybe this is why the CIEPers have a bias against female pilots?
Absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence.
