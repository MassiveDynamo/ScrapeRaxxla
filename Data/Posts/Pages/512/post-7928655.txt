Not to mention, there are actually tons of cloned humans in the ED universe. At least two members (associates?) of TDW are confirmed clones - Elyssia Fields and Salom√©. The Empire has a long precedent of cloning, especially to create soldiers. There is reason to believe that cloning plays in to TDW storyline.

Edit: 3 TDW members are known to be clones - i forgot about Rebecca Weston. Interestingly, all females...
Walden had clones too... All of his seemed to grow up from children and develop distinct if similar personalities... If Salome was a clone it seems she was produced as an adult? Might suggest a different process.
