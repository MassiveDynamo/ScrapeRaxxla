You omitted Tionisla from your list. Speaking of which ... Holdstock says that the Ryder's home world is Ontiat in chaper one of The Dark Wheel yet in And Here the Wheel by John Harper when the Architect reveals that Robert Garry is actually a decedent of Alex Ryder he does so by, if I recall correcrly, telling Robert that his blood is Tionislan.
