The video posted by Six6VI explains the source of the quote. For brevity's sake though I'll answer via text. The quote comes from The Alien World which was written by Robert Holdstock under the pen name of Steven Eisler. Professor Steven Eisler has appeared in a couple of Galnet News articles that I wrote back when we players were permitted to submit articles for Frontier to publish. It's also the name of my son's CMDR so if you find a system first discovered by Steven Eisler ... don't go thinking you've found Raxxla

Bah. I was hoping it had to do with Elite. I even had a crazy theory going just from that quote. Guess I'll have to trash that one.
I'll post it if anyone wants a dose of crazy for the day.

This game is making me insane.
