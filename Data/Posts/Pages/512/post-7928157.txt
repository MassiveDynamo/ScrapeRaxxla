Credit to you for the discovery. Try using EARTH.

It bounces between two systems, SOL and something called the EARTH EXPEDITIONARY FLEET.

Anyone ever heard of the Earth Expeditionary Fleet? (Closest system is EOL PROU ZO-U B18-28)

Also, while your searching names of systems, be on the look out as each comes up for the spelling of R-A-X-X-L-A

It may be a string of system names which spell it out. Hey man, to date we have found nothing. I think th Galaxy Map was designed to do this, as my results show more than just ending up in empty space, especially with the systems Earth and Lave, both in Elite from the start, and both doing different things.

Sorry. The Earth Expeditionary Fleet is my minor faction. We won the system during the Colonia expansion thanks to months of hauling Galactic Guides to Jaques. I asked Frontier to name our system "Dākuhoīru" (ダークホイール) or "Covfefe" but I guess both of those names ended up being too cheeky. Instead they ended up just naming the system after the faction.
