Where did you find the info in your spoiler? I had long accepted that Salomé was a clone, but i just realized i am currently lacking evidence. I have poor memory of Reclamation, and always assumed this book revealed her clone status, but i can not find any corroboration.
Premonition. Can’t give page numbers as I understand they’re different depending which version you’re looking at.

One slight disclaimer, it’s all stuff said by a character so there’s all the standard considerations to take into account around that, but given the context and other evidence, it would seem they can be trusted on this one.

It’s in Chapter 22 if you want to have a read of that whole bit from the start.
