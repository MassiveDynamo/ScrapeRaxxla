I'm thinking this is from the dark wheel novella. So far it's the only one that I've actually finished reading I'm on and here the wheel right now but I haven't finished it and I know I've read that text somewhere before. so with Robert holdstock as the author of the dark wheel novella and him being credited for the quotes I'm certain it's from the dark wheel.

Steve Eisler is the Pen name of Robert Holdstock https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Holdstock Holdstock's novel "The Dark Wheel",was included with the best-selling computer game Elite in 1984
