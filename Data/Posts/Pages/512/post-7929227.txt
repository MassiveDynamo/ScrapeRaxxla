Premonition. Can’t give page numbers as I understand they’re different depending which version you’re looking at.

One slight disclaimer, it’s all stuff said by a character so there’s all the standard considerations to take into account around that, but given the context and other evidence, it would seem they can be trusted on this one.

It’s in Chapter 22 if you want to have a read of that whole bit from the start.
Ah thanks, after your earlier post, i started frantically searching the Premonition ebook for anything. I tried just about every synonym of "clone", "newborn" and "pregnant" but didnt find results. Silly me, of course "oo" was the word i was looking for!

Edit: hahaha best use of the profanity filter i've ever seen. Can't spell "c.u.c.k.o.o". Thanks, alt-right, this is why we cant have nice things.
