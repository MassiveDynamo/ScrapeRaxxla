Walden had clones too... All of his seemed to grow up from children and develop distinct if similar personalities... If Salome was a clone it seems she was produced as an adult? Might suggest a different process.
Same principle applies for the line of clones Salome’s from as it does for Walden’s clones. All the clones have distinct personalities but various similar traits.

Premonition spoilers ahead...
