Not plausible. Neither The Dark Wheel nor And Here the Wheel mention Alex's mother. And, while Robert Garry's mother is mentioned in And Here the Wheel, he is unable to find any record of her burial because his entire family history is a sham. We therefore have no proof that any of the Ryder family members have mothers (or any other combination of two parents). Maybe this is why the CIEPers have a bias against female pilots?
Not to mention, there are actually tons of cloned humans in the ED universe. At least two members (associates?) of TDW are confirmed clones - Elyssia Fields and Salom√©. The Empire has a long precedent of cloning, especially to create soldiers. There is reason to believe that cloning plays in to TDW storyline.

Edit: 3 TDW members are known to be clones - i forgot about Rebecca Weston. Interestingly, all females...
