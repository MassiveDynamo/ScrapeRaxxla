Could somebody point me to the source of this quote? I thought it was from Robert Holdstock's The Dark Wheel, but I just checked that out and didn't find it.
It does credit Holdstock in The Holdstock Report, but it doesn't indicate where it came from.

SPOILER


The video posted by Six6VI explains the source of the quote. For brevity's sake though I'll answer via text. The quote comes from The Alien World which was written by Robert Holdstock under the pen name of Steven Eisler. Professor Steven Eisler has appeared in a couple of Galnet News articles that I wrote back when we players were permitted to submit articles for Frontier to publish. It's also the name of my son's CMDR so if you find a system first discovered by Steven Eisler ... don't go thinking you've found Raxxla
