As a bit of personal experience, I have been targeted by assassins merely for ticking off powerful groups in a sector. It doesn't take finding something big. Sometimes merely destabilization of the status quo is sufficient to put you in the cross-hairs of bounty hunters, assassins, military organizations, corporations, and/or local criminal syndicates.
Completely agree, I've been chased by FIA, ATR, IISS, Alliance Interpol, Thargoids and Blue Epaulettes for years now. Basically have to carry a rocket launcher everywhere and sleep inside a spaceship. It's a really rough galaxy out there.
