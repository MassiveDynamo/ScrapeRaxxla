Maia is neat but the blackhole is really far away (~25 minutes of supercruise). Perhaps start there. Maia B is noted on the beacon as being a lens for local star and nebula. Possibly, a specific alignment as suggested by Rochester's research. In, theory this should be possible by going to Maia B and then targeting something nearby at the approximate alignment. Yes, I do believe some of the "user submitted" beacons were FDev CMDRs dropping hints. Some of these are just too weird for that not be happening. Either that, or FDev currating keen observations by us regular CMDRs that fit the larger narrative.

My first visit I had tried to position myself to see what they were talkimg about but no dice.

I think if we have the correct (raxxla?) System we will see something to confirm it.
I've also been trying to line up several systems to see if I can get a line (pointer) that could also show what system may be a good check point. Honestly though, 7 Sisters seems like the best point to start before looking out (ha, a pun.)
