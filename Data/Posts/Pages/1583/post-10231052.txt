Re-reading Milton in relation to the quote used from the Brookes Tour, describing Miltons pendant world.

Its actually described in the full text as hanging from the walls of heaven, which I interpreted as being described as an expansive circular area. An enormous circle, a circular wall in space. Could Raxxla be ‘below’ the Lost Realms… because my current hypothesis is these areas collectively denote an ‘Otherworld’.

This ‘Otherworld’ area sits directly below the great world tree Yggdrasil, upon Axis Mundi, a Celtic symbol for a doorway to the Otherworld, it’s surrounded on all sides by systems and bodies named after ‘Mountains’, and ‘seas’ more Celtic symbolism for the zones separating the Otherworld from our realm; effectively and collectively has FD built a Celtic cosmological model?

Did FD then hang Raxxla from this area, in a sort of reversed Miltonian heaven? Again remember in Miltons Pandemonium, Hell is supposed to be a perverse version of creation.
