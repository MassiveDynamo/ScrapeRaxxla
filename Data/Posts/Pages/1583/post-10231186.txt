On the subject of the Pleiades, Pleione was considered the mother, what star would be the "brow" of the mother of the Pleiades if viewed from Sol?

I refer to the below image, is that a Cobra mk2? shape for WFPC2 within 3 FGS's????? is this a subtle clue from Frontier that we should be looking at the WFPC2 picture catalogue? refer one example below again.
