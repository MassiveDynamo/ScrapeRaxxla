Will be in Pliedaes system this weekend for Tourist Spot 0748 A Rare Warmth.
As this is one of our hotbed of ref locations I will be spending some time here.

I've been to Maia before but never took time to really look around the system or visit the others.

Anyone have any suggestions for areas to double check in or around the 7 sisters?




Similar “lost Pleiad” stories are in European, African, Asian, Indonesian, Native American and Aboriginal Australian cultures. Many cultures regard the cluster as having seven stars, but acknowledge only six are normally visible, and then have a story to explain why the seventh is invisible.


In today's episode of "waaaaaaaait a minute...":

Orion pursued the Pleiades named Maia, Electra, Taygete, Celaeno, Alcyone, Sterope, and Merope after he fell in love with their beauty and grace. Artemis asked Zeus to protect the Pleiades and in turn, Zeus turned them into stars. Artemis was angry because she no longer could see her companions and had her brother, Apollo, send a giant scorpion to chase and kill Orion. Zeus then turned Orion into a constellation to further pursue the Pleiades in the skies.

Artemis, the Pleiades and Orion have a very clear mythological link that we somehow missed or forgot.
Now the question is, assuming all stops are meaningful, where would Beta Sculptoris and the Guardian space even fit.

Also, the lost Pleiad is our good friend Merope (out of shame for her husband Sisyphus tricking his way out of the underworld twice) - so you could start from there.
