True but how could Orion and the Pleiades fit within the Codex?

I’ve looked at a potential link for years over multiple relationships including this association, but at most the link is tenuous, granted historical but I think we need more than classical mythology.

I want the Pleiades to fit, because of the obviousness of Delphi.

The only thing pointing from the Codex to Delphi is the references to the Omphalos Rift.

Most of the Codex I presume is effectively telling us to look towards Axis Mundi and the Lost Realms around there, Ive associated with Robert Holdstock…

Now we could draw a correlation between AxiscMundi and Hyperborea, because when you look at their XYZ positions they ‘sort of’ line up, but that’s a stretch. Nothing else seems to point to Delphi?

Which is sort of counterintuitive, especially since the Brookes tours.

My presumption then is the Thargoid narrative eg the site of Delphi was a ‘clue’, telling us to look for a world tree, and an axis mundi… that is effectively the Lost Realms area in my opinion… but what else’in game’ could point us towards Delphi?

Personally I don’t think it’s relevant, please I want to be proven wrong. I suspect it’s the other way around. There’s too much going on in the Lost Realms area, it’s a relative hot spot. And the first leg of Brookes Tour points us directly to it!

It makes no sense to me to suddenly jump from Axis Mundi to Delphi, without some context in game, the distance is too big, not without a clue or context, what could we be missing?
