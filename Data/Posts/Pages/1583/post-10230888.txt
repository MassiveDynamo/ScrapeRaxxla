Will be in Pliedaes system this weekend for Tourist Spot 0748 A Rare Warmth.
As this is one of our hotbed of ref locations I will be spending some time here.

I've been to Maia before but never took time to really look around the system or visit the others.

Anyone have any suggestions for areas to double check in or around the 7 sisters?




The lost sister
Similar “lost Pleiad” stories are found in European, African, Asian, Indonesian, Native American and Aboriginal Australian cultures. Many cultures regard the cluster as having seven stars, but acknowledge only six are normally visible, and then have a story to explain why the seventh is invisible.

The world’s oldest story? Astronomers say global myths about ‘seven sisters’ stars may reach back 100,000 years
Cultures around the world call the Pleiades constellation ‘seven sisters’, even though we can only see six stars today. But things looked quite different 100,000 years ago
