I've been to Maia before but never took time to really look around the system or visit the others.
Maia is neat but the blackhole is really far away (~25 minutes of supercruise). Perhaps start there. Maia B is noted on the beacon as being a lens for local star and nebula. Possibly, a specific alignment as suggested by Rochester's research. In, theory this should be possible by going to Maia B and then targeting something nearby at the approximate alignment. Yes, I do believe some of the "user submitted" beacons were FDev CMDRs dropping hints. Some of these are just too weird for that not be happening. Either that, or FDev currating keen observations by us regular CMDRs that fit the larger narrative.
