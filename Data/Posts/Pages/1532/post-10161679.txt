But I thought OOTD was a non-canon book? Isn’t that what @Allen Stroud said? Or am I getting confused again?
It’s the heat! Looking out the window at a cloudy sky & hoping for a thunderstorm after yesterday, my brain melted! Keeping the epileptic copawlot cool was a nightmare.
It’s canon. Just not the parts about the Alliance / Thargoid meetings in the 3250s.

That part was told by a character, not the narator. Characters can say things that aren’t true.
