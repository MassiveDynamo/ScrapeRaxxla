Could be.

I was thinking more basic green and black sunbursts

Ya I think you are right in that is what FD interpreted as a black and green starburst. I just dont think that was the original intent from Holdstock. Looking at his Alien World he describes the humans of the dark wheel as maintaining a medieval appearance - carrying swords a and building dark castles ... fighting dragons... And these tales are told by Naranthnu entertainers.... accomplished dancers, musicians and storytellers....

It very much makes me think of Holdstocks famous series on Mythagos (an ideal-type of a mythic figure) ... which is why I think he modeled the society of the Dark Wheel on the Fianna who in their own way are often used to describe the Koryos ... the generic indo-european brotherhood of warriors....

But back to what FD is thinking.... In Out of Darkness.... there is a section discussing "thargoid" symbols one of which is an eight pointed star with a circle in the center and a fractal spiral. We have a green and black six-pointed starburst... with a circle inside and three arcs which could indicate turning... Its tempting to think there is a relation here.

I still think Raxxla is tied to the Guardians... but what if Grelics arent new.... The Guardians and Thargoids fought long ago... maybe Grelics were created then..... could Raxxla be a combination of Thargoid and Guardian Technology?
