Nope. Not what I said. What I said was that the game has priority in terms of canon. You can't hold the game to account by using the fiction as fixed points. We (myself included) all dearly want our stories to remain absolutely integral to the game and the developing story, but given that people are human and that different minds are working on things now than those who originally conceived them, some details may change.

So, you can hold the fiction to account by investigating leads in the game, but if you do the opposite, be prepared in case you find a discrepancy.
Thanks Allen!

Edit
I think the problem is that I (& I suspect many others) have from the outset viewed the game plus books as a single “multimedia experience” & so expected them all to be congruent and canonical. I am getting the message that is not the case, with only the game as canon and the novels as “flavourful entertainment”, intended perhaps to expand the game experience but not to define it.
