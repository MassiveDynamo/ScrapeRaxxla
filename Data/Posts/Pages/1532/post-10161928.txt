Thanks Allen!

Edit
I think the problem is that I (& I suspect many others) have from the outset viewed the game plus books as a single “multimedia experience” & so expected them all to be congruent and canonical. I am getting the message that is not the case, with only the game as canon and the novels as “flavourful entertainment”, intended perhaps to expand the game experience but not to define it.
The books, RPGs, and the game I would say are a single experience. However, anything living is fundamentally messy. You have groups with different objectives, politics, religion, propaganda, you have community goals which require reading between the lines, and anything from the super-powers or mega-corporations often needs thorough fact-checking. Meanwhile, the dead do lot lie. Take for example the Sacrosanct megaship (and cargoes it was carrying) or some of these old sites left abandoned, the materials, tools, and corporations providing supplies tells a much fuller story. Even with Soontill, parts of that are a lesson. The Pleiades region is loaded with systems with Technetium meaning asymptotic giant branch stars (yes, Soontill has Technetium). So, it is more that deduction of what actually happened is often required. Then you have systems like Placet, that I swear must be hiding something (given the weird stories of banning anything older than 30 years).
