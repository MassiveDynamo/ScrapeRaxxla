But I thought OOTD was a non-canon book? Isn’t that what @Allen Stroud said? Or am I getting confused again?
It’s the heat! Looking out the window at a cloudy sky & hoping for a thunderstorm after yesterday, my brain melted! Keeping the epileptic copawlot cool was a nightmare.
Nope. Not what I said. What I said was that the game has priority in terms of canon. You can't hold the game to account by using the fiction as fixed points. We (myself included) all dearly want our stories to remain absolutely integral to the game and the developing story, but given that people are human and that different minds are working on things now than those who originally conceived them, some details may change.

So, you can hold the fiction to account by investigating leads in the game, but if you do the opposite, be prepared in case you find a discrepancy.
