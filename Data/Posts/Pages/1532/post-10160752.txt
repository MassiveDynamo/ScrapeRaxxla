That’s awful, how terrible. He will be remembered. His hand helped build and shape this galaxy. Always appreciate his passion for this game. His work helped reawaken my interest in 17th century poetry and Greek Mythology, and I learned a great deal about Norse and Saxon history!

The stars are his legacy, they are rich with meaning. Can’t express how sad this is.

Let’s find Raxxla, for him.
