Think it was Derthek.

Thanks for seconding the motion. I did have the idea that it was Derthek, Dommaarraa or Delmonte... but wasn't sure exactly. In any case, I know I wasn't just imagining that I remembered it. That was an entirely possible scenario.

Stange that this gets brought up now though, as I'm currently back in NGC 6357, which, if you might remember, was Derthek's space whale. He was convinced there was something there.
