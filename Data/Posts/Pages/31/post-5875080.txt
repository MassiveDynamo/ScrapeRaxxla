Here's a thought, if we accept that back in the days of Elite a very long trip was possible (and i still think Raxxla is going to be relatively close to us), how about checking the galactic opposite of where Sol is.

Sol is at 0 / 0 / 0.

Sag A* is at: 25.21875 / -20.90625 / 25899.96875

What is at 50.4375 / -41.8125 / 51799.9375 ?

You know, I vaguely remember somebody on the Canonn Thread trying this nearly 2 years ago. I can't remember who, or whether it was at the exact cords you mentioned, but I seem to recall it was a very dull, disenteresting system.
