I agree mostly.
That's why I stick to what MB said. 'Milky Way' and 'personal journey'.
'Personal' in E: D means Status, Rep and Permits. I am trying to max these parameters. (Besides having the max ship jump range possible, of course)
Maybe then some closed 'doors' will open.

He also told about 'something a little bit obvious'. What is the only obvious thing in E: D regarding Raxxla ? The Dark Wheel minor faction. (Besides why putting such a faction in E: D if not related to Raxxla ? Nostalgia?)
I'll stick to this. This will be my 'personal journey'. ( To nowhere ? [haha])

Just got myself allied with The Dark Wheel today. I'm elite trader with about 30% to go for elite explorer but 93% to go for elite combat, so hopefully triple elite isn't a requirement.
