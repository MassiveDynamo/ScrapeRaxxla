Yeah the 8 "Galaxies" were not True Galaxies so it would all have to be in the milky way. I'm just curious because I think Rain was a system in the old Elite and that is also in the bubble but it was in a different galaxy then Lave, Reorte, etc etc. Also I kinda though you were implying that the other galaxies were in this game hence the Michael Brooks quoted link I supplied.

Rain was a system in Galaxy 8, in Elite. It's about 190ly from Lave, in ED.

It's not the most unike name though. It would be interesting to find more Gal 8 systems in the neighborhood.

As Galaxy 8 is just one Galactic hyper jump from Galaxy 1, it could lead to some kind of pattern of distances for these jumps.

Lists of all systems in the eight galaxies are available on Alioth.net: http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Oolite_planet_list

The list is for Oolite, but it's exactly the same as the original.
