I'm mostly focusing on old lore and anything that might be unique. For an example of something unique, there is only one 2MASX object out of the 400 billion stars in the game. Makes me wonder why they would even add it at all. If I remember correctly, it's just a red dwarf with no planets.

I'm trying to find other catalogs that only have a few stars represented in game.
