I wonder if someone at FD was into the Deadspace series. I mean... if you have ever played Deadspace you might notice the similarities between Deadspace and the FD stations. Every time I docked I always thought of Deadspace. Also, Aegis.

I played 1-3, but I don't remember anything that would be similar to what is in Elite. It has been a while, though. Do you have any examples?
