I wonder if someone at FD was into the Deadspace series. I mean... if you have ever played Deadspace you might notice the similarities between Deadspace and the FD stations. Every time I docked I always thought of Deadspace. Also, Aegis.
you mean like the fact that I always have terrifying hallucinations at the least opportune times?
