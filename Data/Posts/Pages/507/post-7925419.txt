I wish GM had an option to enter stellar coordinates as opposed to star names, then GM could point you in the vacinity and we could just fly there.

EDSM reports (real world) equatorial coordinates as well as the ED ones, so clearly someone has done the math to translate between the two.
Try posting in the Exploration subforum asking if there's a tool.
