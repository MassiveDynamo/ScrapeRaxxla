I you intend on heading back, I would recommend checking out the Cygnus X Complex: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X_(star_complex)

It should fit well with Gan Romero's comment about 'an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven’.
I've tried to find this by searching for BD+40 4210, BD+43 3654, v729 Cygni and v1489 Cygni (aka NML Cygni). None of these show up as these names in-game and neither they nor several alternate names (from 2mass or Tycho catalogues) are in EDSM. This is one of the largest star-forming regions in the Milky Way, with ten times the mass of the Orion Nebula Complex, yet I see no sign of it, or its highest-mass stars, on the Galaxy Map!

I've moved on to Colonia. I don't plan to stay long but I won't get back quite as quickly as I went out (the ship I'll use on the way back has a range of just over 38LY on a full tank).
