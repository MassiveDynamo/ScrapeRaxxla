What about Robert Holdstock or Steven Eisler. When hiding Raxxla, it must have been tempting to pay tribute to the late, great, author that dreamed it up all those years ago. Would also be a little obvious....

I searched Holdstock and ended up with 10 results, but they all turned out to be stations and bases. That was the end of that for me. It is possible that there is something that could be searched which would indicate some kind of path, but I don't think common names or names associated with the game will work. That leaves that theory as open as any other. We simply wouldn't know what to search.
