That's the point, though. Everybody avoids what seems to be the most obvious. I'm trying everything from the most simple ideas, to the most outlandish. Even if it doesn't turn up anything, it could give someone an idea.
I agree. That's why I stopped looking for non-elite related reference material. Ancient poetry and parallax aren't obvious to the average gamer(Fortnite and yeet?). Whatever actual clues there might be are probably in game or some official frontier related elite book.
