In Polaris system!
Fits all the facts:
exists
is in the Milky Way
devs (or a select few of them) know where it is
devs know why players haven't been able to find it (permit lock, duh!)
The problem with Polaris is that it was accessible in FFE. Placing Raxxla there would be weak, from a lore perspective.

It did have an ailen portal in FFE. A bit silly with another, perhaps?
