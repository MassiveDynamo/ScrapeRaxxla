We still can't assume that "in game" is the same as accessible or interactive. Everything fdev says is some kind of tongue in cheek play on words. You couldn't get a straight answer if you asked the shortest distance between 2 points.

For example, Polaris is clearly "in game" but thats it. you can't interact with it. You can only look at it in the galaxy map. Words are really good for misleading folks who want them to mean something specific.
I believe this green glow is visual bug. People and I were saying that Raxxla may be very well bugged and knowing FDev if 1000 people don't report the bug it will persist..
More so after the thread about Sabiyhan system name that crashes game to desctop if searched on galmap..
