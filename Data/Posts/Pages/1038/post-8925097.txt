Back to the topic.

We have to admit that the most exciting question for everyone is whether Raxxla exists and is currently available in the game?
It doesn't matter what it is or how difficult it is to find it. The community does not need any hints, we are happy to continue all this search, but we are not sure about the technical availability of Raxxla.
Can someone from the developers already answer these simple questions?
