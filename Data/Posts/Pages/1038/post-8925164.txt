I'll try to mention the Hilda-asteroids again, which would fit the three arcs better, since the Hildas are in three clusters, please take a look at the picture on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_asteroid

Mmm, didn't see your first mention, good call! I like the fact that the Hildas move in a triangular orbit so I see the possible resemblance to the three arcs of the logo.
Hildas are ~ 4.0 AU semimajor axis = 1996 ls. Might be worth a look!
