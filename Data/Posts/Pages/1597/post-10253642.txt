I think you may have misread the article



The ship was passing an unknown planet. (more info in the Thetis generation ship logs if you've not yet heard them, well worth it )
Yes, but they clearly draw a parallel between the Thetis event and the Shamash madness, citing an "unknown planet" (and thus "unnamed" or nameless).
I didn't read the article I listened to the french translation, it is possible it wasn't a perfect translation...
