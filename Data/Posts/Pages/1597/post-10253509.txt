pareco? there arent visually any comets, but forge has them, world has them, albeit hard to find. maybe we dont have the right eyes to see, maybe the eyes should be looking at gravitational anomalies rather than some raxxla blinker pointer...





yes but they are about poking the obelisks with items to get supposed lore. were there different ones? aimed at finding the sites and removed afterwards? could there be a mission that went to the first raxxla breadcrumb, that got completed and removed but we never figured out what we are actually looking at and never triggered part2?
As I recall first base was opened by accident and at the wrong time. I think it was done after analyzing the starry sky from the video.
And it was unexpected even for the developers, I remember later they were forced to remake the first ruins, but I'm not quite sure why.
