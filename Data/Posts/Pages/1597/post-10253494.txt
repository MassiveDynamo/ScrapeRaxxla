There are no comets anywhere
pareco? there arent visually any comets, but forge has them, world has them, albeit hard to find. maybe we dont have the right eyes to see, maybe the eyes should be looking at gravitational anomalies rather than some raxxla blinker pointer...

The initial missions from the Federation of Pilots, gave the opportunity to gradually find the ruins of the guards, after the ruins found these missions removed from the game.

The Ram Tah and Palin missions are still in-game.
yes but they are about poking the obelisks with items to get supposed lore. were there different ones? aimed at finding the sites and removed afterwards? could there be a mission that went to the first raxxla breadcrumb, that got completed and removed but we never figured out what we are actually looking at and never triggered part2?
