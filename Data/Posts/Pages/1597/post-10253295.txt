The ‘jewel’ reference is a metaphor, in Galnet it’s that Sol is the jewel of the galaxy. In Milton our pendant globe (universe) was described as being like a jewel because it hung like a pendant jewel and shone like a star of low magnitude in comparison to the brilliance of heaven from which it hung.

Eg basically something ‘shiny’ or something ‘hanging down’ or something ‘new or insubstantial’.
Shiny!
