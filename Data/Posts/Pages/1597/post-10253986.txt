On the issue of the signal linked to Shamash and Thetis; @CMDR ARGHouse has made certain observations which correspond to my ‘Older gods’ hypothesis.

As above so below, a clear dominion set out in game of a heaven and a hell.

Upon its own Thetis was not enough to illicit a significance, but a second within relative close proximity does in my opinion.

That particular region is heavily populated with ‘upper older gods’ eg the have an XYZ above Sol which commonly associated them ‘positively’ either with ‘higher’ gods, ‘Solar’ or ‘creation’ deities. The wider relationship cannot yet be established.

Again we have the locational information that ‘something’ exists in this area from the Thetis records, the fact something else has recently occurred ought to indicate that entity is fixed and likely within a sphere of influence of 15 lyrs, the presence of something similar in the Shamash system might help reduce this area, if we apply a similar sphere of influence around that system too the intersection might identify a potential focus point?

I have tried to extrapolate this location against other information I have been compiling around the Lost Realms hypothesis but as yet nothing seems to correlate, as this location sits too high up.

The area as I’ve said is a concentration with deities linked to creation myths. It ought to be noted the the goddess Thetis was also known as the creator of the universe!
