The ‘jewel’ reference is a metaphor, in Galnet it’s that Sol is the jewel of the galaxy. In Milton our pendant globe (universe) was described as being like a jewel because it hung like a pendant jewel and shone like a star of low magnitude in comparison to the brilliance of heaven from which it hung.

Eg basically something ‘shiny’ or something ‘hanging down’ or something ‘new or insubstantial’.
I agree, I'm pretty sure the Toast's reference to the jewel is actually talking about Raxxla itself, as the 'precious object' in the galaxy.

"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!" = Raxxla, the most precious thing in the Milky Way.

Is there a comet in Sol?
There are no comets anywhere (unless it's a new sneaky thing they added). There was planned to be, there are comet placeholders in the game that sometimes show up weirdly, and I believe they do/used to show up on some external sites when you look at the bodies in certain systems. There is/used to be comet placeholders in Lave, Tau Ceti, Sol, etc. They've been there since the early days, I think it was in Tau Ceti that a station used to orbit nothing cos it was supposed to be orbiting a comet, can't fully recall the details.
