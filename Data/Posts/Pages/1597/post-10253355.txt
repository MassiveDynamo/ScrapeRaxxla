The ‘jewel’ reference is a metaphor, in Galnet it’s that Sol is the jewel of the galaxy. In Milton our pendant globe (universe) was described as being like a jewel because it hung like a pendant jewel and shone like a star of low magnitude in comparison to the brilliance of heaven from which it hung.

Eg basically something ‘shiny’ or something ‘hanging down’ or something ‘new or insubstantial’.
There are plenty of stars just like Sol. There are plenty of Earth-like planets just in the Bubble. There is absolutely nothing special beyond it being the human homeworld. You're going to have to do better than that if you want Raxxla. You've only got 400 billion-ish systems with several trillion celestial bodies and pieces of proto-planetary rubble. The rumors tell you what to look for. What would set a system apart as being important. Shiny is common but special is something else entirely. You aren't wrong for highlighting Sol but that isn't what made Sol special and you could have started elsewhere using the things that make help to identify Sol as important. Raxxla isn't one system (though the gateway/omphalos rift might be).

Humans are important but only because we are the storytellers. What would you be looking for that says at least pieces of Raxxla are here or at the very least Raxxla exists?
