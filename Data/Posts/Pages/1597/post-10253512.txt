I am just going say it: the most valuable things in life are the very things others call trash or garbage. Have any of you actually looked at the occasional open floor boards in the docking area either with camera suite or via on-foot exploration? What does it say? Why might that be important?
Open floors, yes. I've been researching them for a long time and didn't realize ... There are a lot of things in the game that I don't understand, carefully crafted doors in ruins.
The ground engineers have a window to a hall, in this hall there is a man, standing near the computer and with his back to us.

But most of all I like to study the billboards ....
