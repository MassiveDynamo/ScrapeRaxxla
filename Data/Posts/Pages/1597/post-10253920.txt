There comets in game. They are not modeled, but they are accounted for and can be seen and targeted. By seen I mean just their marker. Parelco specifically a player has dropped in on and shared the screenshot. The mechanics are there for Raxxla to exist as some far away object that does not pop up on FSS and does not have a physical model. Raxxla may as well be the same, probably to avoid file dippers from finding it.
can you provide source to it? i never seen a comet before
