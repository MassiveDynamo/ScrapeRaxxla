I find it curious that, given all of the names of all of the Generation Ships, the two that I seem to think fit the 3rd line of the toast have the names Pleione and Atlas.
I wonder if the Pleiades fits into the other lines but either way, I think it worth another visit (in a ship that can outrun the bugs). I am not a fan of long supercruise journeys but maybe that is what is needed...
See, these are the ideas we can 'play around with a bit', to see if it fits even better. To see if we can find a way to 'introduce results in the game'.
.. my head just exploded now - I have too much info again, ... <curses all 1419 pages> ... time to ponder.
