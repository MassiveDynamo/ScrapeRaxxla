I find it curious that, given all of the names of all of the Generation Ships, the two that I seem to think fit the 3rd line of the toast have the names Pleione and Atlas.
I wonder if the Pleiades fits into the other lines but either way, I think it worth another visit (in a ship that can outrun the bugs). I am not a fan of long supercruise journeys but maybe that is what is needed...
I don't know if you saw my post a while back on my "cold read" of the Codex using only simple knowledge and top-level reading. I basically ended up at Delphi and connected it the the Thargoids. Quite a few other people over the years have come to the same conclusions too. Delphi being renamed on the same day the Codex dropped is... suggestive... and containing the station named "The Oracle".... etc.etc.

If interpretations of the Toast relating to the Formidine Rift (plagued with Thargoid-like interactions) and Jaques comment about the UA's singing in hyperspace (sirens). The fact that a lot of the Raxxla Codex seems to lean towards Greek Myth, and a lot relating to the Thargoids leans that way too... it all seems to come together.
