Ah, darn yeah, forgot about that. 5c, for so long, for so many years. But didn't they point to Barnacles in some cases?

Well, there were barnacle sites on 5c. In fact, they were the first discovered because so many cmdrs were searching there.

I think, for such a long time we have mostly assumed that was the reason for the UAs pointing there... and it probably is still the case. Why that particular one, I suppose there could be somthing more specific, but I don't think we know that for certain.
I may vaguely remember, or I may be dreaming it, that MB (I think) intimated UA were pointing there to highlight Barnacles. Seems a very poor hint if so as they dont point to any other barnacle location as far as I know.
