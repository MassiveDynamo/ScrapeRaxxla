Question for you all.

What do you make of the alteration to the Codex from 2018?

I've been trying to find a screenshot to post this question with evidence, but I can only find references to it, and references to it being changed.

b) Fdev thought it might actually be too big a clue and removed it?

Translation of the circled: Summary of the myths surrounding the legendary planet RAXXLA))It says right there, the PLANET.
Does the English version also say about the planet?"

So... not sure if this is confirmation, but I'm pretty convinced this is one of those things where we should bump up the probability that we're looking for a planet (given all the other stuff we know too, planet is incredibly likely).
