Ah, nope, I'm staying away from this non-cannon leads now hehe. The whole idea 'how far could we travel in the past/what kind of drive limited us' is something they may have changed due to new teams, new producers, new designers over time.
Fair point. But I want to point out that a lot of the speculation here is that Raxxla is the same (or in the same place) as it's always been since it was put in the game. Therefore we get into the debate about whether Raxxla is the same as it was (same location) or moved based on the needs of the game and developing narrative.

Pick your team!
a) If it's the same as it always was, then all clues/hints/info from the early days of the game are still just as valid, since the thinking behind them is the same as the thinking that went into where to place Raxxla - and we know that was Micheal Brooks and David Braben from historical sources.

b) If Raxxla has been moved or the discovery process has been changed due to, as you say, new prople getting involved then we need to define a point at which previous clues are invalid - so Gen ships, Rift, etc. maybe all should be discounted? Anything pre Codex maybe? Where's that line? Do we discount all things prior to December 3304 as valid, or only some of them? That starts getting complicated very quickly!


I also don't want to open a can of worms about how "the more people that know where Raxxla is (devs, programmers, etc) the more chance of leaks or accidental reveals there is". The probability remains strong that Raxxla is relatively stable and innocuous and immune to game updtates (like it's just a planet or a space station using existing asssets, for example). If it were anything more complex then it would require cumulatively hundreds of devs and dev hours over the last 8 years every time the game is updated to check it's still working - etc.etc.etc. Rabbit hole...... ....
