Been pondering the generation ships hypothesis and checked mythology and other references for each plus wiki description.

Summary:
SPOILER: GENERATION SHIP PRECIS










































































































I think we can safely ignore the Golconda, it is too recent to be relevant, but a couple of themes strike me:

Wanderer/vagabond/homeless: Spear of Hope (Technician Farrow is homeless), Lazarus, Phanes (possibly), Phobos, Pleione (link to Odysseus via Calypso), Odysseus

Wolf/cannibalism: Artemis, Lycaon

Grief/woe: Lazarus, Atlas

Whispers: Thetis

So, there are several possible route variations if the puzzle is to fly between the various generation ships equating to the lines of the Alleged Toast!
