This afternoon I switched to my Imperial Courier (and needed it as I did get jumped by the bugs - leaving 98K Tauri, so I lost the neutron boost...) and made my way from Pleione to Atlas in supercruise. This is 0.70 LY, so it seems a good place to have something, but at 2001c I could easily have flown right by it in a blink without noticing. I'll try the run from Atlas to Pleione when I am next on. (The journey is several hours and I had to shut down what modules I could so that I did not run out of fuel)

One thing I did notice on the way out here is that the hyperspace tunnel is different (within Pleiades Sector or when jumping to a star in that region). It is as if you can see the nebulosity and stars of the Pleiades even within the tunnel. That behaviour does not happen near any other nebula that I can remember visiting (and I have been to a few). So that is something else telling me that the Pleiades are important, though it need not be related to Raxxla.
