Mm, hadnt spotted the reference to the Pleiades in those gen ship names. A hint that we should reinvestigate the Pleiades perhaps?
Those darned UAs have to be pointing at Merope 5c (IIRC) for some reason!
I do remember searching Merope and 5c in particular looking for an antenna sticking out of the “ground” if it was n alien mothership submerged in eons of galactic dustfall....
