Tau Ceti is a very interesting lead in this, I got the same gut feel. So much in the Codex wants us to look in that direction.

Yeah, but are we jumping to conclusions a bit too quickly here? Following the leads from the codex to the gen ships is a healthy idea though.


Ah, nope, I'm staying away from this non-cannon leads now hehe. The whole idea 'how far could we travel in the past/what kind of drive limited us' is something they may have changed due to new teams, new producers, new designers over time.

Exactamundo, good point.

I still think we need to pick the genships as (all including the ignored ones) has shown.
Go one place, find something, then a new direction - repeat - perhaps triangulating a bit.

In all of this, there may be some leads in the text (toast) itself that needs some out of the box thinking.
Like the toast cloud be a number-station message - or something we find along the way. It's out in the open, but some of it may need decoding.

Yep, I think gen ships might be my focus for a while too. Problem is that takes me away from my next major long range exploration trip for who knows how long. I do keep forgetting about my Alt. Need to get that account dusted off so I can do both again. I think I picked up odyssey for it in the recent sale, so I should be good.
