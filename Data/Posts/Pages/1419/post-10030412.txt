I find it curious that, given all of the names of all of the Generation Ships, the two that I seem to think fit the 3rd line of the toast have the names Pleione and Atlas.
I wonder if the Pleiades fits into the other lines but either way, I think it worth another visit (in a ship that can outrun the bugs). I am not a fan of long supercruise journeys but maybe that is what is needed...

Louis Calvert: I agree about the doubts as to whether The Dark Wheel ever found Raxxla and whether they knew about Generation Ships that the playerbase had yet to discover.
I feel it might be worth pointing out that The Dark Wheel toast might itself not have existed prior to its inclusion in the Codex! The toast, the Codex and a number of other features (like the FSS) were all dropped into the game at once, however I recall that the player discovery of the Generation Ships was sporadic, as if they were added into the game in groups rather than all at once.

I also need to be wary as to what the toast might be leading us to. The Codex also mentions a Dark Wheel station, so it seems odd that The Dark Wheel would give us clues to Raxxla itself without having brought us to meet them first!
