I don't know if you saw my post a while back on my "cold read" of the Codex using only simple knowledge and top-level reading. I basically ended up at Delphi and connected it the the Thargoids. Quite a few other people over the years have come to the same conclusions too. Delphi being renamed on the same day the Codex dropped is... suggestive... and containing the station named "The Oracle".... etc.etc.

If interpretations of the Toast relating to the Formidine Rift (plagued with Thargoid-like interactions) and Jaques comment about the UA's singing in hyperspace (sirens). The fact that a lot of the Raxxla Codex seems to lean towards Greek Myth, and a lot relating to the Thargoids leans that way too... it all seems to come together.
Had time to read through your 'cold read' of the Codex and it is interesting. I particularly like the Omphalos stone being a gateway and that the Delphi system is a beginning, with the Omphalos stone being positioned beneath the Oracle. The Thargoid Site certainly bears greater inspection.

I am trying in my head to get around Tau Ceti being a starting place and Delphi being a starting place. Why do we have to travel to multiple locations? It is almost as if we have to travel a certain route, hitting key waypoints, maybe even performing key activities, before we can make a final jump from Delphi. A route as a password.

Nine worlds connected to the World Tree. Nine waypoints? Maybe Pleione and Atlas are two and The Dark Wheel toast is giving us clues to more. After visiting them, light up the Thargoid Structure. A rift may then open - or perhaps then making a hyperspace jump to a final destination. Activating a Thargoid Structure does give you a message, so perhaps that will contain the information?
