I don’t wish to discuss my fantasies
I have already been warned about making a mild joke......


But the last 1400 pages haven’t been fantasy. There have been a lot of interesting hypotheses raised and tested. The fact that we havent discovered anything just reflects on the quality of clues we have been basing those hypotheses on!

(Edit: of course, from FD’s perspective that means they were very good clues as they’ve kept us guessing and searching for a loooong time!)

Now, where is my deerstalker and pipe...

Both my accounts are a loooong way from Charick’s Drift!!
