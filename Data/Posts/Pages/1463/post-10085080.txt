But not helpful

We still dont know what it is weâ€™re looking for, so how will we know if we find it?
Oh when did they say they would help? lol

I just chuckled when I saw it and had to watch it again...lol


In terms of knowing you've found it.... Well I would hope if you found it you'd think "that's a bit weird"... And it might go something like.... I wonder what that could be.... Oh...... it couldn't be..... it is.....

Not knowing what you are exactly looking for doesn't mean it won't necessarily stick out like a sore thumb if you happen to randomly (or intentionally) stumble across it?

Even if someone didn't know about Raxxla I would hazard a guess there would be a good chance that they would stick something in the forums/reddit/etc saying "what's this?" ;-)

And wasn't there a tiny bit of you that thought.... well they've said it out loud now and intimated it is actually there.... (I don't think they would joke openly about it if it was a lie and not in game.... the backlash would be a tad large as it would be taking the mickey out of us all).... And the rather loud "SHHHH" at the end suggests someone shouldn't have mentioned it in a "Macbeth" type way... and perhaps suggests the location/what it is/where it is is not limited knowledge to MB and DB....lol

And even if that wasn't the way they have hidden Raxxla, what jumped out to me was the fact they were talking about "hiding" mining stations/refineries in asteroid belts as if they already have the settings to do so in game (or it would be easy to implement) may give more credence to them being able to hide the DW station easily and scanners may not help you find it....?

Just a thought....
