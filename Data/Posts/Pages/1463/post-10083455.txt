Note to self: Do defect from a super power and then do passenger missions in a cardboard Anaconda for added danger. This also seems to make the Adjuster happy for some reason. As he stated "This is isn't personal, you are the turncoat I have a contract for...".

I wonder what the Adjuster will feel about a tour to a Thargoid infested system?

Got a surprise Yesterday, Elite II?
