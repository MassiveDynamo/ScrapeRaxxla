It's like Raxxla and DarkWheel are different things.
That’s an assumption. Raxxla might be the Dark Wheel’s hidden station, or it might be something entirely different. We have not been told they are different things. We have been told explicitly that “we don’t know what Raxxla is”. Perhaps the Dark Wheel (if they actually exist and are not just a red herring) found Raxxla first? Perhaps they are Holdstock’s
“there are people on Raxxla already. This is only a guess, mind you, but from what happened to Jason I'd say it was close to being right. We've long suspected that a corps of élites lives there, and are exploiting the gateway. They're powerful, twisted men.
