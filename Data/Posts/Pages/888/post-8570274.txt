So this lft business at the moment. Am I right to think that if it is indeed directly connected with the dark wheel that the permit for the system has been available since launch? If so are there any galnet articles that are connected in any way to this system or a group that has ties to this system.

My own thoughts on this is I doubt it has anything to do with the raxxla plot as polaris seems more of a prominent place to put any progression to something such as whatever raxxla is. Lft seems more of a base that the thargoids want something from if Buurs video is correct. Raxxla has not been confirmed to be a planet. Nobody knows what it is yet (outside of fdev).

The alleged toast of the dark wheel is not confirmed to be the actual toast.

Anyway that's my 50p worth. Keep on entertaining folks.
