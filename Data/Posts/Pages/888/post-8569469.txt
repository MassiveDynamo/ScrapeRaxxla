Thinking about the quote "for those with eyes to see" might point towards one of the 8 supernovas that were visible to the naked eye in history. Currently thinking it is something to do with SN 1604 which is not in game under that name.
SN 1572 is also interesting. It was in Cassiopeia and Tycho Brahe wrote "Stella Nova". This was also shortly before Phillip Sidney wrote Astrophel and Stella.
