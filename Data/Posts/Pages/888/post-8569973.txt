Gotta get the right music for your quest!
This video also features two systems that were found that both have an 8th moon,
and for some reason certain bodies (including the 8th moons) within the systems will vanish from your radar when too close or too far from them.
Unresolved. Enjoy the video and the tunes.
The two systems are ADS 9338 AC and ADS 4229 ABC. There are a total of ten ADS systems in game, only these two do this thing.
