SN 1572 is also interesting. It was in Cassiopeia and Tycho Brahe wrote "Stella Nova". This was also shortly before Phillip Sidney wrote Astrophel and Stella.
Yeah that was my first thought but there was a search done earlier and fdev stated that tycho g and cass a are not ingame(but that might have changed) , it is an interesting SN and one that philip sidney would have witnessed(visibility during the day and such) , but due to the earlier search and my own i've decided to move on. I originally thought that one of sir philip sidney's sonnets might have been about sn 1572 but couldn't come up with anything. Now a friend has tied some theories to the ophiuchus constellation but I will let him post them if he wants and that leads me to sn 1604.
