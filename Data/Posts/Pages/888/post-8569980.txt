Problem with allegories is ...
...I don't get 90% of it because English is not my native ... now, how many langs Elite officially supports?
And how much will be lost in translation? I can say example:
"mother's brow" in Russian is translated as "crown on mother's head" such context. So every russian player was checking north/sourth crowns asterisms.
So that should be ...more straight. For example most cultures use rings on weddings, then parents feel not good after weddings ...so that could be some sky-ring, like nebula, etc.
