Hi all, first post but long time lurker. Trying to make sense of it as an amateur astronomer. I know it was maybe mentioned so far. But I believe the only clue is the first sentence of the toast.

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!

jewel = star, star system, something

mother of galaxies = Cassiopeia

brow = the summit of a hill or pass

Schedar = The starâ€™s name, Schedar, derives from the Arabic word for breast.

To the Schedar that burns on the summit of the breast of Cassiopeia!

So am I crazy or is it something? The system is empty and after scanning all the signals only those two were interesting but I think they are generated the same around the galaxy.



The only problem I have with this is that Cassiopea is the mother of the galaxy, Andromeda. One galaxy, not galaxies like in the toast.
