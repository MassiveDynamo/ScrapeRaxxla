But one thing that has always irked me. Donars Oak in the Delphi system. It always seemed to be some sort of obvious clue but I couldn't make it fit... but Donars Oak (Thor) and of course not forgetting Distaff?

Well this was a new one on me... in norse myth theres Friggs Distaff... which is... Orions belt!

Wife of Odin and considered a 'mother godess', also known as Figga, Frije, Frea, Frig, Perchte, Berchet, Frau Holda, Frau Gode, Freyja and Frige. As Orion is located along the celestial equator it's stars spin over time (thus attributed to Frigg at her wheel).

Ya I have been playing around with this as well, Of course from the Platonic angle - a little bit of syncretism based around spinning - Frigg and her Maidens (Fulla in charge of Friggs Jewels) / Anake with her sirens/muses.... makes for interesting correlations - especially with the Orion Nebula being the fiber on the distaff.
