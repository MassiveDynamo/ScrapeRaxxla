Except for he says it is in the milky way which in fact is not in Andromeda. But it could be a jump gate to a rogue planet otherwise inaccessible for the lack of a target star

Again...remember that there were two Raxxlas. The real planet, protected by a Raxxlan race, and the Coriolis station, which was essentially a stepping stone to another galaxy. So unless Braben, or someone at FDEV says the actual planet is in the Milkyway? I'm going to put my $$ on a station. It's most feasible. I couldn't see how they'd justify a moving of a planet all the way across deep space to another galaxy. The coriolis station is what used to be located in Lave and had since been moved. Not the planet Raxxla, which Ryder ultimately located in Andromeda.
