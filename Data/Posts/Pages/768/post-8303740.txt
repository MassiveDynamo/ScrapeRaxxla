I never took the "no clues" comment literally. I regarded as, "Raxxla is hidden, it will not be visible in the traditional sense." Meaning there will be no clues to it's location or existence. You just have to stumble upon it. Or at least the gateway to it. I think we're looking for a gateway, not a planet. The planet was always ever in Andromeda. However it had a Coriolis station of the same name and that was located in Lave. You had to dock there and ask for permission to use the gateway, which as I understand was actually in Tionisla, but you had to fly around the Lave system a couple of times and jump to Tionisla within a specific amount of jumps for the gateway to Andromeda to open. Once there you still had to find Raxxla (the planet). The Raxxlans may have had the ability to move the planet, system, to system, but they sure as hell didn't move it all the way to the Milkyway. If anything the Raxxla Coriolis is still around, but perhaps renamed. Which means it could be any station we've seen.
Except for he says it is in the milky way which in fact is not in Andromeda. But it could be a jump gate to a rogue planet otherwise inaccessible for the lack of a target star
