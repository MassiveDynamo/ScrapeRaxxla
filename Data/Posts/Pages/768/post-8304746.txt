1. Examples? Most glorify something real or imagined.
2. Source / Citation? - Often confused with DW statement 'surprised nobody has solved it yet' about Salome riddle and perhaps MB said it about Zuara but unconfirmed.
3. Yes - but what does that mean exactly? Its like saying it was in the last place I looked, ofc it was you stopped looking when you found it.
4. Total Speculation - nothing is known so please don't assert speculation and opinion as fact. Its a Theory, until its proven that's all it is. Some theories may seem to hold more water but the more assertive someone is the less likely we will see the truth because of Confirmation Bias.

That said, I like the diagram, don't believe most of it for a second but some thought gone into it.
