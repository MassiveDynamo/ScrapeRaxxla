I know MB said that as well, but I couldn't find that statement again yesterday. However, Braben has also been clear on this in the past.
MB's statement was interpreted in two ways previously. Some thought it was just regarding a particular interview. Other thought it was more in general that there would be no clues given. Many assumed there was not more hints (facilitation) coming after that.

But I think we're also missing the point. We know MB carefully chooses his words.
MB said they had to try "make it a tiny bit obvious", not that it was too obvious as we previously may have thought.
Hence two conclusions may be drawn from this:
Raxxla is meant to be found. By us, the players. It appears they have not made it inaccessible then.
This also goes speaks against all who thinks Raxxla is not in game or is not meant to be found.

I never took the "no clues" comment literally. I regarded as, "Raxxla is hidden, it will not be visible in the traditional sense." Meaning there will be no clues to it's location or existence. You just have to stumble upon it. Or at least the gateway to it. I think we're looking for a gateway, not a planet. The planet was always ever in Andromeda. However it had a Coriolis station of the same name and that was located in Lave. You had to dock there and ask for permission to use the gateway, which as I understand was actually in Tionisla, but you had to fly around the Lave system a couple of times and jump to Tionisla within a specific amount of jumps for the gateway to Andromeda to open. Once there you still had to find Raxxla (the planet). The Raxxlans may have had the ability to move the planet, system, to system, but they sure as hell didn't move it all the way to the Milkyway. If anything the Raxxla Coriolis is still around, but perhaps renamed. Which means it could be any station we've seen.
