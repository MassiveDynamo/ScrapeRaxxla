maybe he wasn't being literal with the word "in" ...

you either take what was stated in the most likely context or you might as well make any theory up imaginable since at that point, you've decided anything is possible.

No clues almost certainly means there are no secret galnet posts or hidden book secrets or missions that would lead you to the location
In the milky way almost certainly means that it's not in any other galaxies if there even are any galaxies generated in the game other than the milky way.
That players can find it almost certainly means that it's not hidden behind any kind of unknown permit (or that it is and there is a way to get the correct permit)

I do think that employees have slipped up on some aspects of it's location that they may be more privy to than the general public.

I think that the roid field comment was less a joke and more of an in-house theory with inside info on why it's likely to be in such a place.
