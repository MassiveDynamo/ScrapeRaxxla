Again...remember that there were two Raxxlas. The real planet, protected by a Raxxlan race, and the Coriolis station, which was essentially a stepping stone to another galaxy. So unless Braben, or someone at FDEV says the actual planet is in the Milkyway? I'm going to put my $$ on a station. It's most feasible. I couldn't see how they'd justify a moving of a planet all the way across deep space to another galaxy.
imo thats exactly what this is

Just a reminder, from the DJtruthsayer interview with MB, 1 min clip with the important bits



MB: "It's a journey everyone have to ."
DJ: "You have said there will be no clues haven't you" ...
MB: "... That is true, but you have to , but so people know what they are doing. But, there is nothing to be revealed at this stage."
