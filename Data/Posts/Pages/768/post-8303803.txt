On an off note.
I wish I had known more of the Elite universe when I first started playing. Back in preview. Jason Ryder was a Wanted target in a Nav beacon that I had noticed, when I was learning how to play. I don't know if he killed me, or I him...could have gone either way. I was really sh** at the game and in a Sidewinder. I didn't know there were anything other than fixed weapons, in fact. I was learning how to use the fixed weapons provided with the ship. Later, I seen the name again and the only reason I remember to this day is because it was the first name I had seen come up twice. Not knowing the name, I thought, "Huh...weird, I either didn't kill that guy and he killed me/ got away, or the game likes to generate the same names over again." Imagine the possibilities...wake scan and follow? Methinks?

Anyway, so once I heard about this whole RAXXLA thing, the name popped up in forums again. It immediately brought me back to the old Nav beacon camp days. Again, it's where I made all my money, as I had no knowledge of Res hunting even. I think it may have even been before I joined a super power. As I was lawless for quite some time. It may have even been in the original start system...before LHS-3447.
