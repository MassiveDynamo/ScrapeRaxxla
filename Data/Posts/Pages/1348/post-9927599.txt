What about Raxxla being the "center" (like Sol is for the Bubble) of Guardian space?
Read in the codex the Guardian had a territorial space similar to the Bubble.
That’s possible, but it depends on where that centre is, it being Sol, or someplace else. The codex reads a little like a road map, potentially giving six references (much like the logo) which many suspect could relate to systems which if triangulated might resolve a common centre, that’s one theory.

It could just be down the back of Michael Brookes sofa.

Understanding that relevance has yet to be conclusively understood.
