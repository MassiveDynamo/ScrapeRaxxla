Checked. Think it was the princess astrophy (or whatever) story. Says it was discredited sorry.
Cute story though
Just in case the "discredited" part of the codex was here to mislead (after all, isn't it more of an opinion rather than a fact expressed here? Discredited why? Maybe the story contains clues.), I found this old story with a title very similar.
Who knows.
