Well, this afternoon been out to Praea Euq EC-L d8-6291469, cos the coordinates are pretty close to the label on the Trinkets
“NEX0275401977”
X= 275 Y=401 Z= 977??
but nothing here other than 3 stars, no comets!

Earlier chat with @Dox Paradox re Paradise Lost reminded me of my early hypothesis wrt Apha Centauri & Eden, sadly no comets there either!

Over the last couple of days also checked Hathor (Mother of Galaxies), Aten (sun disk Jewel in her headdress) & Siren (obvious!) systems...
nowt to report!

is it too early for a brandy???
