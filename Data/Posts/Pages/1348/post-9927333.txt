A few ppl have suggested the construct that supposedly guards it is guardian in nature. Some think they found it from a prior civilization, others that guardians were not indigenous to our galaxy and came thru it ( not supported in guardian historical logs)
Your take?
Insufficient information to hypothesise on that. We know that Raxxla is discussed in the FD internal alien lore bible, but we dont have access to that. It does, however, imply Raxxla is of alien origin & the name supports that. Weâ€™ll (hopefully) found out when (if!!!) we find it!
