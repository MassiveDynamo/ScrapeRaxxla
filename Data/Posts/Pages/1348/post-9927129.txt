So canidate for TDW station...

Decima - Gustypants Outback Emporium

This one is NOT it but it fits the bill, large wheel style station, compact and older orbis - plus when the sun isn't hitting it, it's really dark.

Now if I could only narrow down systems with this version of an orbis station..... ok found it.



I'll be checking it out in the morning.

According to the codex entry, the station is "dark" because it use minimal power to remain "silent" (on radar I suppose?)
