While trying (& failing) to hear these supposed noises from Trinkets of Hidden Fortune I took a couple of pix.
It may be interesting to note that the label on the container (NEX0275401977 VESPINE TRANSPORT SYSTEMS) has the same number as did SAP8 containers

Cant see this is coincidental, but is it meaningful?
I remember looking into the canister labels a while backâ€¦ if i remember correctly. They are all the same - but worth checking again
