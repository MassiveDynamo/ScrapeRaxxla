This thread is dedicated to the non-role-play Quest for Raxxla. Of course everything might be related, but we start out by keeping things simple (Occam’s Razor) and assuming they aren’t until proven otherwise. If you’re interested in Guardians & Thargoids there are more appropriate threads, e.g.
Alien archaeology and other mysteries: Breaking News, Theories and Tinfoil Hattery
It would be a good idea to go near to HIP 22460, determine the patch of sky from the video, look in the galmap and see if it lines up with any of the previously locked regions....I’m guessing Klaxians or Guardian AI.

Just to clarify, because I haven’t looked into this particular mystery that much, is the report from the noble the only actual reference we have in the game? It seemed like the entire legend was born out of that person’s mind alone. But I’ll admit I didn’t read the whole thing.
