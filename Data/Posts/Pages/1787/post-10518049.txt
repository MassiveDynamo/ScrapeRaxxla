@Allen Stroud would you be able to elaborate upon what was considered or established in game, about Randomius Factoria and or Fortuna?

Or could you provide some insight into the contextual links for Fortuna in the works of Robert Holdstock, and why he referred to her in the work, in respect to his wider concepts?

It’s evident some work was incorporated into the game, in respect to the Trinkets of hidden fortune, and these have some locational ties to certain systems, possibly in name or mythology only, but FD has confirmed, the story they were originally tied to was ultimately removed.

There’s obvious reference to Randomius Factoria directly in game, but I suspect that was a separate story thread by another author of whom I have no interest in.

So I’d like to understand the Trinkets wider context, because these elements oddly still exist and operate in game, so it’s possible they continue to perform some ‘environmental’ aspect, of a larger locational concept concerning the ‘fates’ and ‘norns’, in particular a specific location Im currently attempting to peace together in respect to the storyline about the Nemb megaship at LP 892-51.

“Well the way those pirate ripped the ship apart, it was more than some rare old trinkets”.

Nemb is interesting because unlike many objects or locations in game, the word has no meaning nor real life origin I can establish?

Locationally Nemb is very close to the system Atropos, the eldest of the three Fates, or Moirai, in Greek mythology.

I find that very interesting…



Love the new Holdstock book by the way.
