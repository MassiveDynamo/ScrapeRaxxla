@filthymick420 has kindly donated some trinkets so next time I'm online I'll try flying to the centre with both trinkets and thargoid sensor, and I'll try scanning the sensor and see what if anything happens. In other news, I've ordered a playstation hotas so i can practice pc controls. I've also been in touch with FDEV. Early in the new year I'm going to close down the console account and make the leap to odyssey. wish me luck, I'm sure it will be as traumatic as finding raxxla. lol
