lol, was just asking about this. What are you theories on all of those? If you don't mind sharing.
most are prose way of describing an astronomical body but with a double meaning. For instance the mother of galaxies is both a person and an astronomical body. Its more than I care to write here, so if you catch me live I'll explain a bunch but not all of it.

Things are really settling into place and I should be getting close to the end. My question is if/when I find it, should it be posted? Even posting the answer to the first line of the TDW toast could ruin the whole thing.

Waypoints I'm willing to share:
LGM-1
Crab Pulsar
The Raxxla image contains the specific unique pulsar timing of the Crab Pulsar. These two waypoints and their history should be what you need to follow my path. Anything more would give it away.
