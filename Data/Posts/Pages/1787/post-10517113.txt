Now then, for any fellow current RAXXLA searchers: Has anyone tried placing a 'Thargoid Sensor' into your cargo bay ( anti-corrosive version of course ) and then scanning around some of the rumored/suspected potential systems to see if maybe something triggers?

I havent yet, but I intend to try next time I'm on. I have the sensor. I've spent a couple of hours today trying to find a trinket of hidden fortune to take as well, but its looking like i could spend a few years searching and never find one
