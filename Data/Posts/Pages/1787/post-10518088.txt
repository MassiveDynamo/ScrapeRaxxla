Lady Fortuna mythology (not conclusive)

Fortuna (in game) is similar in aspect or at least equivalent to the Greek Tyche (in game); and one of her epithets or surnames as Automatia.

Tyche manages fate according to her own will, without any regard to the merit of man.

‘Automatic’ in Greek (αὐτόματος) means "what is self-willed” but also “to what is not willed”. Tykhe had a number of alternative cult titles (not in game).

Fortuna is a Roman goddess of fortune and luck whose popularity continued on throughout into the Middle Ages. Her common concept being that luck is blind and capricious, highlighting how there was no method of control over destiny, or life, advocating a passion for life or living in the moment.

The capricious Fortuna, was often depicted with the Wheel of Fortune or Rota Fortunae, which spins at random.

The earliest conceptions in both the Roman and Greek involve not a two-dimensional wheel but a three-dimensional sphere, a metaphor for the world or zodiac.
