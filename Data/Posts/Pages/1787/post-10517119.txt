I've spent a couple of hours today trying to find a trinket of hidden fortune to take as well, but its looking like i could spend a few years searching and never find one
i'm pretty sure i have an extra 'Trinket' on my FC i'd be happy to give you for your efforts, but i think you said earlier in the thread PC players like me can't trade/give items to Console players? ( different platforms & all that )
