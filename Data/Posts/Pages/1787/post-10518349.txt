I was wondering, what is your guess on the first line of the alleged toast of the Dark Wheel? "To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies".

‘His spread wings, at leisure to behold. Far off the empyreal heaven, extended wide. In circuit, undetermined square or round. With opal towers and battlements adorned. Of living sapphire, once his native seat.

And fast by hanging in a golden chain. This pendent world, in bigness as a star. Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge. Accurst, and in a cursèd hour he hies’

John Milton Paradise Lost.
