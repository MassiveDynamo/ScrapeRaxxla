I havent yet, but I intend to try next time I'm on. I have the sensor. I've spent a couple of hours today trying to find a trinket of hidden fortune to take as well, but its looking like i could spend a few years searching and never find one
The Quest To Find Raxxla
I've heard these mentioned but I have never in 3? 4? Years plying ever seen them in game? You get TOHF from trader ships (IIRC I had most success with Adders) through pirating them- you need a reasonably fast well-armed & Shielded ship with cargo space, manifest scanner and a point Defence...

The way to do it is to drop out & hang around at the nav beacon of an anarchy. Cargo scan ships (particularly trader ships, Adders, Type 8, etc) as they head towards/away from the star for fuel scooping. Play some enjoyable background music as you'll be at it for around an hour ( the normal spawn rate for TOHF carrying ships) or more. If you dont find them be prepared to move systems.

Once youve found a target ship get close (preferably away from the pirate shark pack circling the nav beacon) and fire off a hatch breaker limpet. Repeat (their pds will destroy your HB) until TOHF are dropped, then open cargo scoop & quickly scoop in or use collector limpets to gather them in, close the cargo scoop & hightail out. It can be frustrating gameplay as the spawn rate is quite low and then the oher pirates will gather the trinkets, including using hatchbreakers against you, hence have at least one pds yourself. An alternative is to wait away from the nav beacon to intercept traders as they drop out of SC, but that location is fairly random
