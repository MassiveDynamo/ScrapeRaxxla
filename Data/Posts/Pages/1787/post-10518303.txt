I'm 1/2 way through the journey, and along the way have identified and found:
-Mother of Galaxies
-The jewel that burns on the brow
-The whisperer in witchspace
-The siren of the deepest void

I was able able to identify the parent's grief and lover's woe but haven't gotten there yet. It all neatly fits, matches the hidden info in the Raxxla logo and enlightens the story of a famous UK astronomer. Enjoying it very much.
