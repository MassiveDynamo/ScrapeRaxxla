I was wondering, what is your guess on the first line of the alleged toast of the Dark Wheel? "To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies".

For me it's clearly referring to Cassiopeia, the mother of Andromeda (which is a galaxy). From the stars in Cassiopeia the ones I suspect more are Sigma Cas and AO Cas.

Sigma shows in the forehead (brow) of Cassiopeia in the app "Star Walk 2", and there's also an article about Sigma which describes it as "The Smalt Blue Jewel". But in the same article they claim the start is on Cassiopeia's shoulder, not her brow.

As for AO Cas it shows in the head of Cassiopeia on the Stellarium website (although not exactly on the forehead). And it's one of the brightest stars in the constellation.

What is your guess for this part of the toast?
