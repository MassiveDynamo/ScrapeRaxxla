Last time I got some in Lang Wang after trying three other systems, but I think its random where & when, they're very rare, which makes me think theyre valuable for something...after all they are illegal everywhere! With no good reason...the deacription is "This container appears to hold an assorted collection of low-value trinkets, knick-knacks and statuettes. Such trinkets are generally used by superstitious pilots to try and win favour with the lady Fortuna. However, these particular knick-knacks have a much more valuable prize hidden within"...so what's somvaluable hidden within? You cant open them, or breakm by gunfire to release the contents...

They used to be more common in three systems. Two are way out of the bubble (Thor's Helmet Sector FB-X C1-5 and Seagull Sector DL-Y D3), the other was Plendovii but the latter is not an anarchy so you'd get a bounty for piracy.
