Err... this is why they were "Founder or Elite" missions. We (the Founders) were granted immediate access to these special missions without the need to gain Elite rank first.
This was a KS perk. Of course it's a bit of a bad joke that they disappeared before many of us even tried them and I for one are well past Elite ranking now anyway.

Yes. What I meant was that they weren't strictly a KS reward as you could also earn access to them via rank.
