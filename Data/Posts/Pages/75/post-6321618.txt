Is it still possible to get the Obfuscated In The Outer Rim mission? If so, where?

They were handing them out at Jameson Memorial but have since gone away...I think just shortly after 2.3 dropped.

No, they went missing over 2 YEARS ago in 1.5. FD refuse to even talk about the Founder missions. God knows I've tried getting this addressed!

Recent efforts to ask in the Q&A livestreams got a "Nothing to talk about on this right now" in September and were flat out ignored last week.

Someone else needs to have a go at getting a response because I think that they just ignore me now.

Or maybe waving pitchforks and shouting loudly on the main forum, as that seems to work for the PvPer's when they want something.
