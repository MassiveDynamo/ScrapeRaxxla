Can you provide the text which talks about special missions as a KS reward? I can only find "Be a founding member of ‘The Elite’ in the game, plus all rewards above.", which sounds like instant access to Founders World which I know was a thing. I never heard anybody say that special mission where a KS reward, though.

It was never a Kickstarter reward ... but given the fact that they were only available early on in the game when fewer players had reached Elite status it sure felt like one.
