I think Fdev decided at some point to freeze the Raxxla storyline, maybe because the learned how fast people tend to solve things and that what they have planed for the next years would probably last only a couple of months. Therefore I think it is understandable that they removed the missions and are not willing to enable them again. Its their game and their narrative. However, it would be nice if they could say that those missions have been disabled on purpose, they don't even have to give a reason why.

All the evidence points to a bug preventing them from appearing when they were meant to be, and then developers not having time to port them - not that it was deliberate.

Access to the "Founder" missions was related to a Â£150 KS pledge tier, there were meant to be more to come and not all were potentially Raxxla related - there was a bounty hunting one for example.
So I disagree, they certainly do owe an explanation about why these missions were left out of Horizons and remain missing.
