I think Fdev decided at some point to freeze the Raxxla storyline, maybe because the learned how fast people tend to solve things and that what they have planed for the next years would probably last only a couple of months. Therefore I think it is understandable that they removed the missions and are not willing to enable them again. Its their game and their narrative. However, it would be nice if they could say that those missions have been disabled on purpose, they don't even have to give a reason why.
