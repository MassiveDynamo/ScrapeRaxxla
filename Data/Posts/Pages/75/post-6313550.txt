Thx Doc. So we may say it's unusual to have him so close ?
By the way, may I ask you if you are actually tracking him ? And can you confirm he's an NPC ?

lol. It's a joke. An NPC can't go flying about when there aren't any CMDRs about. There wouldn't be an instance for him to share. I've never personally seen NPC Rob Holdstock but if I did ... TARGET THAT WAKE!
