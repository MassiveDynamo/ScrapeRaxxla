All the evidence points to a bug preventing them from appearing when they were meant to be, and then developers not having time to port them - not that it was deliberate.

Access to the "Founder" missions was related to a £150 KS pledge tier, there were meant to be more to come and not all were potentially Raxxla related - there was a bounty hunting one for example.
So I disagree, they certainly do owe an explanation about why these missions were left out of Horizons and remain missing.
