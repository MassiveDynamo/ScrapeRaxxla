I don't know that I'd put a whole heap of confidence into any NPC name. Weren't they all suggested by early backers? Something like "Give us "x" amount of money and you can name the NPC's?" So wouldn't it make sense that there were some "lore-ish" names thrown into the hat by fans?

I mean, there's a CMDR Carlos Spicyweiner flying around out there.
