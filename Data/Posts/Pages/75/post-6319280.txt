You mean like Raxxla being the Graal of this storyline ?
I bet you can figure out how both quests can be related by analogies, Doc. [yesnod]

Oh my ... So many ?

Where to start ? [where is it]

Avalon system has Noctilux and Persephone stations ... just to mud the water a little bit more [haha] But no Arthur-Lancelot-Parsifal-Galahad-Nineve-Morgana-Mordred-Igrain .... Entering 'Merlin' leads to Ross 154, Birkeland sation, the inventor of the Gauss (rail) gun ... LoL
And not far, is Hyperborea ... [haha] [haha] But no Bifr√∂st leading to Asgaard there ... Ok, I stop here.
