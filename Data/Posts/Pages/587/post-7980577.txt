Here is an interesting article about measuring cosmic distances, using the gravitational waves from merging spiraling bodies (black holes and neutron stars): https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/PT.3.4090

They call the method Standard Sirens.

I haven't dived into the math. It's a bit heavy.

Yes, I think they call supernovas as "sirens" too. Had a link 30-40 pages ago. So my idea was to find ex-SN or possible SN. SN Ia should happen when white dwarf Z is close enough to some 2nd star. So it can explode each 10000 years or so. There are about 4 near Sun such when DZ is below 200ls to another star.
