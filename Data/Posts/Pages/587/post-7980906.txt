Soooo, to cut to the chase if you read this far is, I am wondering if these little missions are similar to the unique ones in the original game. A path to the Dark Wheel. I noticed that the mission giver ( the T9 ) was persistent, ie, did not despawn until I accepted the mission AND completed it. I did note the Corporation he was allied to which was the main faction in Teorge. I have explored a LOT in the bubble and never had this. All I can say is... it was damn fun!
They are fun. I ran across one in a random system a few months back. I don't think they have anything to do with the Dark Wheel, though. They are always attached to a faction in the system in which they spawn. I think they are simply RNG emergent game play opportunities...they seem too disparate to be cohesive in terms of a pathway to The Dafk Wheel or anything narrative driven.
