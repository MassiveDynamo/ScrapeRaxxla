They are fun. I ran across one in a random system a few months back. I don't think they have anything to do with the Dark Wheel, though. They are always attached to a faction in the system in which they spawn. I think they are simply RNG emergent game play opportunities...they seem to disparate to be cohesive in terms of a pathway to The Dafk Wheel or anything narrative driven.
I have a LOT of exploration data stored so I do make sure that interesting corporations I can make to Allied. Risky yes. But I don't worry about money. Plus, I like risk.
