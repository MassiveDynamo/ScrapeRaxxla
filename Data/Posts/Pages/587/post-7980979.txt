These missions seem to spawn when you hang around for a while in a system. They seem mysterious, but are actually quite common. Had my first 2 in sol, about the time GURU-951 was lead astray by a similar mission. Whilst fun, they don't lead to any chained missions or special permits etc. as far as anyone can tell.
But, in the search, I won't pass one up. The mission certainly got this old fella's heart racing.
