Ooookay. quite the harrowing day for me so far. Decided to give Teorge a visit. I like to map everything in the bubble and as I was refitting in Lave it sounded a good plan.

Warping in I did a full system scan and was intrigued by the Listening Posts so, in order ( I read up they were the Solome event ) I went to the first one. Suddenly my computer chirped up "Mission-critical location detected". I scan everything in a system including the signal sources most of the time so I anchored on the brakes and took a shufty. There was an orange USS. A trade one. I wasn't going to miss out on this so I dropped in. A T9 offered me a simple resource mission ( or so I thought ) to acquire Survival Equipment. I accepted and high waked to continue my trek quickly to the Posts.
That was when I was set upon a host of Deadly Anaconda toerags. I killed them ( my Corvette has a few guns ) and it was a hell of a fight. Left me shaking a bit as I got out with 77% hull. That's when I checked the mission again and noticed it was Elite only. A good payout which I completed but I was hounded all the way.

Soooo, to cut to the chase if you read this far is, I am wondering if these little missions are similar to the unique ones in the original game. A path to the Dark Wheel. I noticed that the mission giver ( the T9 ) was persistent, ie, did not despawn until I accepted the mission AND completed it. I did note the Corporation he was allied to which was the main faction in Teorge. I have explored a LOT in the bubble and never had this. All I can say is... it was damn fun!
