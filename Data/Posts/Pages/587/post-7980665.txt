You didn't quite say 'spiralling stars'...

I fear this may all be too new for our purposes..

"The idea of using gravitational-wave sources as standard sirens was put forward by Bernard Schutz all the way back in 1986. But it’s been developed substantially since then, especially by my friends Daniel Holz and Scott Hughes. Years ago Daniel told me about the idea, as he and Scott were writing one of the early papers. My immediate response was “Well, you have to call these things `standard sirens.'” And so a useful label was born. "

From one of their early papers https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504616# , the term is at least 13 years old.
