Well, had a thought - siren of the deepest void might be a whale? which is Cetus constellation, and where was the first mention of Raxxla- Tau Ceti! And the toast is sort of poetry, so perhaps the jewel is Earth or Sirius (brightest star in the sky from Earth). So tried several centroids involving them...
Now, I've been saying for a long time that I think the Horizons start screen might be a clue, it shows an old style wheel station

And I read the Dark Wheel and Raxxla codex entries again yesterday- realised that TDW entry shows the same station type

, though looking from the rear towards a star and a planet; the star is M type (I reduced the colour saturation a bit) and they are both too close to the star to be an 8th moon... The Horizons start screen shows the station in (I think) a double B-type system and might be orbiting a moon.
Mmm, methinks Lyta Crane may have been putting out false info! So had a mooch around the bubble today, looking for M types with an orbiting old style station. Ended up in SD since the second star is M, and it would be just like FD to hide it in plain sight and mislead us with the 8th moon comment. Didn't find the station, though did find 3 salvageable wreckage sites that seem to be repeatable and would make an excellent hiding place. Can we search EDDB etc for salvageable wreckage?

Back to the drawing board! Lavian Brandy!!!
