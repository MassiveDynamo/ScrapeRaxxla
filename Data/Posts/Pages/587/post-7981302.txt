Theres a whole thread on which type star etc is in the DW Codex pic, have a look, its quite interesting.

Tourist Spot 0251
... at the centre of that is the
elusive "Founders World".

It is the only system directly controlled by the EFP, and
even its location is closely guarded. This secrecy is
maintained by the EFP through 'misinformation' - there are
a great many rumours of its rough location - and they all
contradict each other. Only a select few - the members of
the EFP - know the truth.


OK so now Im confused, even more so.

I thought the Founders Worlds was in Shinatra Dezra? Haven't actually visited since making elite so have I got this completely wrong? Do we get to join the EFP once elite?
