Here is an interesting article about measuring cosmic distances, using the gravitational waves from merging spiraling bodies (black holes and neutron stars): https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/PT.3.4090

They call the method Standard Sirens.

I haven't dived into the math. It's a bit heavy.

You didn't quite say 'spiralling stars'...

I fear this may all be too new for our purposes..
