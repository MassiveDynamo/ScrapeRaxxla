The codex phrasing throws significant doubt on confidence in Lyta Crane's veracity.
It does - though equally it would seem narratively weird to mention something so specific if it turned out that it was entirely or mostly wrong. Lyta Crane can't be the only self-proclaimed Dark Wheel expert with a pet theory, after all, so why mention it in the first place?

If we could actually listen to Lyta Crane's shows (and her several rivals) and hear five or six theories all of which had elements of truth while being mostly wrong, then sure, lots of it could be false while leaving room for the truth to be concealed and needing to be extracted from some combination of it. Having just one (actionable) paragraph summarised from her entire career, it would be really odd if that turned out to be one of the 900 things she was wrong about than the one thing she was right about.
