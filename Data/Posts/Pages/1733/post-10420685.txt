Regarding lore around Jacques, I remember what Allen Stroud mentioned. (Not a quote - but this is how I interpreted it) - Look at ED now, and what is in ED now and what it’s talking about, then maybe work backwards, but not everything is canon.

Following the Galnet posts we can establish a path for Jacques, in his past it’s a little vague but I believe it can be plotted and it does in my opinion intercept a weird ‘bridge’ area, his path likewise seems to correlate with a directional path ‘out of the Greek underworld and southwards’ much like Satans path in Paradise Lost.

I can’t confirm if this correlates theologically or precisely with fictional representation, only that due to certain exact alignments, there is a correlation with Jacques path and certain systems, which only presents it is intentional.

In the text there is no war in hell. The war is in heaven and Satan is pushed through a breach in heaven north wall.

In Dante Satans fall is described much like a celestial impact; into the Earth, creating the gates and paradises mountain. In Milton paradise and hell are separated by the void of chaos and his fall predates the creation of paradise.

I do believe Jacques is linked…

A bridge to the Empyrean?
