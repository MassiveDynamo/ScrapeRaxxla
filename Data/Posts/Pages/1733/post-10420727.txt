And the picture was taken in presumably a pre-release of ED 3.3 but the lighting changed a bit in 4.0 anyway. (Reverse correction seems somewhat likely as the Colonia picture very definitely matches the ED 3 appearance of Colonia Hub when using the default HUD colours)

Still, the relative scale of the star means that if that's a picture of the station and an 8th gas giant moon, the star must be quite sizable - some sort of giant, or O-class - just to get a situation where the star would look that large viewed from the moon. I wouldn't necessarily say definitely M6, but the pattern of bright and dark patches looks very much like some sort of M, too.
I don't think you can rely on the relative scale In that codex pic, odds are it's been manipulated.
