Notes from "And Here The Wheel":

TDW are elite-ranked treasure hunters from a bygone age, tales of the Ryder family, they found monsters beyond explored space, they never found Raxxla but found something else-Soontill, a former Thargoid planet lost by them, full of Thargoid treasures that TDW (actually the Ceepers (Circle of Independent Elite Pilots) subfraction of TDW) exploit.

Alex Ryder had two sons: Neptune and Oberon. Oberon believed he could find Soontill. Neptune considered anything other than Raxxla to be irrelevant. CIEP led by Oberon split from TDW with the goal of using Soontill's power to protect humanity.


Gunn-Britt Grotenfelt was an Alioth Intelligence Service agent infiltrating the CIEP, and 12th pilot in a Saker fighter squadron, so likely she was infiltrating the station in question. CIEP was led by the Architect and 6 elders: Old Tom, white haired and deeply wrinkled; Rapier Rick, the youngest of the elders and still quick with a blade; Hamer the fisherman (Hammer in Legacy?); Dominic the Greater, Giovanni (Reclamationâ€™s Luko?) and Swenson.
