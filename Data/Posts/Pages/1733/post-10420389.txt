After getting intel on Soontill from the CIEP station Robert was unconscious & Gunn dumped him on Tarlak/CD-73 253 a day or so later. In game support for the storyline is a bit poor, but I think it all suggests the CIEP station is within 42 ly from Tarlak/CS-73 253.


For some reason have been unable to post this as a single message so have probably omitted some of my reasoning!

LTT 2771 is supposed to have the Smugglerâ€™s Junction pirate asteroid base, but not an asteroid in sight in that system in-game!! Also planet 1 is Tarlak, But Tarlak is supposed to be the garbage planet in CD-73 253 where Gunn dumped Robert after stealing the data from the CIEP station. However CD-73 253 in- game has no planet, even though the system description talks about it having the garbage planet!

Robert was supposed to be unconscious for a day or so after the CIEP station escapade, plus an unknown duration of time before Gunn dumped him on the garbage planet. However it took her 7 days to make the 19 jumps for the 119 ly trip from Epsilon Eridani to Vequess. So her ship jump range was around 6.5 ly and she could only make 2 or 3 jumps in a day, which should define a shell of probability for the CIEP station location from Tarlak/CD-73 253...3 jumps /day for 2 days at 6.5 ly =radius of 40ly.

System was explored so it should be within a Spansh database search...explored but empty system, sufficiently far from civilisation to be of little interest; a common-as-hydrogen red dwarf star, an asteroid field behind them and a blue-green (not in-game?) gas giant with orbiting station.

We've covered this all before in this thread & @simulacrae (I think it was he) posted an interesting diagram which I can't post....
