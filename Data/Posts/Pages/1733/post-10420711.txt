I'd certainly agree that the Dark Wheel station has a far stronger case for being "near" Sol than Raxxla does; equally I wouldn't necessarily draw "near" in this context as merely being in the present-day bubble or want to underestimate the capabilities of early hyperdrives.

Achenar was canonically colonised in 2292; it's well over 100 LY from Sol, and that required moving not just a few ships but a substantial colony fleet; sure, the Federal Navy was running on overstretched logistics when it tried to attack just thirty years later, but by that time the Empire had managed to establish a sufficient industrial base to win the war (and just 4 years to self-sufficiency!): they must have moved a very substantial number of colonists and supplies over to start with to achieve that, and did so independently without Federal backing.

A smaller group not trying to set up an entire major settlement could I think very plausibly have gone quite a bit further and carried less; Elite pirates might be the sort most expected to be able to do "unofficial" hyperspace jumps well.

With 8th moons of gas giants around M giant stars being very rare I'm having to draw a wider definition of "near" - currently I'm using a 1000LY radius cube and I wouldn't be wholly surprised if it turned out to be slightly further than that; 15 Lacertae seems to be the closest and that's already well outside the bubble. (Of the five I've looked at so far, two of them had unmapped 8th moons, so this is far enough out to be a bit more obscure)
