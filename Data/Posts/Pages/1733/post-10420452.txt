My suspicion is that the Dark Wheel station is located at another “graveyard”. It was at one time supposed to be at the Tionisla Orbital Graveyard - but then moved according to Drews book. My guess is it moved to the HellsGate battlesite between the Federation and the Empire. Wherever that is. Thoughts anyone?

Salvation got his Proteus Wave device info from the Thargoid /Guardian battle site. And i suspect we will get more info from the Titan Graveyards … Cyst Pearls will probably have some importance…

I have been going through the “winking cat” stuff checking things out… so im currently at Eotienses.

I spent last evening zipping around the rings of Eotienses ABC 1h …. No dark stations were found - but it does have some nice dark rings to hide things…
