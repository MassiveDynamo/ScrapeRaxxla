Within 40 LY (cubic) radius of CD-73 253, the systems with both an M6 star [1] and a body with at least 8 moons are:
Valhoujem
HIP 28452
T'u Tu
Laukese
[1] All luminosity V dwarf stars with sub-Sol radii, in this case.
The codex phrasing throws significant doubt on confidence in Lyta Crane's veracity. By all means use the 8 moons as an initial filter, but I'd recommend being ready to ditch that and stick closer to the book's description of the system with the CIEP hidden station.
