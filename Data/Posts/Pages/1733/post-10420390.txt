I still wonder if M Brookes Legacy is pointing us towards the DW station?

He gives us a few locational and temporal clues to the supposed Beaumont system!

“Bring up the Beaumont insurrection from 3294.” “The Beaumont system was a frontier world far below Achenar.” “The mining base was positioned in a rich cluster in the asteroid belt around two AUs from the populated planet.”

It will never stop haunting me that Beaumont doesn't exist as a named system in the game, and that simple notion makes me wonder if its absence is directly hinting towards a TDW mystery. We can technically regard it as a "lost world" after all - and thus representing a metaphorical step along the journey.

Like Jorki points out, the station may have become dark as a result of a system being lost or abandoned due to a conflict. It would be the perfect scenario for a secret organisation to 'facilitate' an information vacuum for their chance to slip in and turn a certain station dark for their own purposes. It may not just be the station itself that went dark either. Not that the system was removed from the game, but more like it exists as an unnamed system when it "should" have had the Beaumont name when our timeline started. It would be as if TDW took the opportunity to "expunge" it from the galnet system.

Beaumont being labelled as a frontier system also points to it being strategically wasteful for the empire navy to maintain an active presence for no good reason. Especially when a messy uprising impacts their reputation.

The other very tenuous association could be Soontill, but that seems too good a scenario to be true.
