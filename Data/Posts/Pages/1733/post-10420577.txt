Wasn't Jacques at Hells Gate?
Mmm, yes-thats where he was captured by the Imps, can't find any other reference.n Does anybody have the ED RPG? I gather that has pukka lore?
@Rochester - did Hell have a gate in Paradise Lost? Is this battle perhaps another PL myth location in-game?
Yup that is my current working theory (well im looking at the classical/dante model a bit more) - i wouldn't be surprised if Beaumont and HellsGate are the same thing.
