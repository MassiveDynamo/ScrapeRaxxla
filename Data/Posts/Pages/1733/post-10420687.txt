FYI the DW station star colour in the icon on the Codex isn't necessarily a real picture in the strictest sense. I did that thing years back that changes my HUD colours - the DW star colour for me is different to the images I've seen people post of the same image, observe:



See, it blue!

So what that suggests is that those images are at least tinted by the UI colour scheme for everyone, and therefore aren't necessarily reliable. All of them have a blue-green tint for me, whereas on the default UI colour they are all orange-yellow tinted.

Therefore, either Fdev/PF knew this going in and reverse-corrected the image of the "DW station" so that when tinted through the UI of the ship it would show the right (as in the real-star) colour... or they didn't...

If you're looking for the DW star/station based on that image alone, then at least be aware that the colours may not be as they seem to you.
