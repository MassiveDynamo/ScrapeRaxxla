Pursued by CIEP fighters, Robert fled to “CD 32-331” (non existent, probably CD-82 331, though in-game has 7 GG, logically “Middleton” would be #4, but in-book there’s 2 GG and a settled rocky planet) on “fourth jump since the ambush, three empty dark systems and now here, two gas giants and a settled rocky planet further in system.” They hid in the GG then escaped depth charging by misjump to Skardee IV....desert planet & red star. Crew & Jordan killed during escape. Went through Arouca towards Granite City, New Aberdeen to bury Jordan. These are all positional clues to the interception point of the ship carrying Oberon's coffin!

Jordan’s ship was the "Vista Oculto" (Hidden View)...this is very reminiscent of the codex's "for those with eyes to see" line!
