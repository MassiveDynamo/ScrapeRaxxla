Just reread my notes on this hidden station hypothesis:

“Disused” station ‘occupied by TDW’ - could have been built in very early exploration trips, so probably very near/within Sol. Could have been located at an unusual star for scientific studies (carbon star? Protostar? The latter might explain the appearance in the codex pic-dimmed by the molecular cloud which is building the star?), or as a staging post in a war (e.g. Battle of Achenar, so might be between Beta Hydri & Achenar [139ly]), or as a remnant of colonial expansion-old worlds, or early Federation.. or INRA before it was disbanded.


Lyta Crane claimed the station was toroid (Orbis) and operated with a minimal power output so as to avoid detection, hence "Dark Wheel". The Orbis is the oldest station type originating from the early days of the Federation. First introduced in 'Frontier Elite 2' (any signicant stations from that game? Never played it myself). I suggest even if Lyta was pukka there might be some obfuscation involved, e.g. "8th moon of gas giant” might actually be "moon of 8th planet" or even "moon of 8th GG"...TDW are supposed to be secretive, even if she had a reliable source within TDW I can imagine them making some deliberate errors in the information they gave her.


TDW codex shows a (when colour adjusted) M6 subdwarf with orbiting moon=planet & station. Nearest M6 to Sol are:
Proxima Centauri 4.3ly
Wolf 359 7.78ly
Ross 248 A 10.37ly
Groombridge 34 B 11.73ly
SPF-LF 1 11.82ly
Teegarden's star 12.43ly
Kruger 60 B 13.98ly
LHS 292 A 14.74ly
BD+19 5116 B 20.19ly
Ross 104 B. 21.7ly

Though could be further out from Sol...
