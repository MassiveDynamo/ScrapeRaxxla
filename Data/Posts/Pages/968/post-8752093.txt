I hope that whatever we’re searching for isn’t between star systems like many have implied. That would make it even more difficult but I did find an article alluding to something being between stars...

Also notice the similarity of the name Children of Tothos to Children of Raxxla. Surely FDEV wouldn’t tease them like that on purpose...
