Yep. I'm not familiar with all those constellation names.
.. we have too many loose ends and failed attempts here. I'm too old to remember all those things ..
(Some hundred pages earlier you've investigated Corona Borealis.. and people already searched for Gemma/Alphekka .. oh dear)

Just basic night sky watching!
I’ve not personally explored in-game Corona Borealis, though I believe others have in this thread, but I’ve certainly been to Gemma/Alphekka to test it as a candidate for the first line of TDW toast.
There are no failed attempts! Every hypothesis tested, even if the results are negative, is one more step nearer to the truth.
Old? I’m 68, and not doing much flying at the moment as my efforts to get third (combat) elite early this year during Covid lockdown have resulted in persistent wrist & thumb pain. I ain’t getting any younger!
