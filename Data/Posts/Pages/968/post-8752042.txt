Someone was already there: https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/5898909/name/CS+Camelopardalis
Yea in this search I don’t think it matters if someone has been there previously.

I’ll tell you guys one thing though, these Camelopardalis systems have more than one “errors“ in their generation. There’s “Camemopardalis” the typo, and then 2 Camelopardalis system has a star in it labeled 53 Camelopardalis even though there is a completemy separate 53 Camelopardalis system nearby. Not that this means anything but it’s interesting.

I’ll check out CS Camelopardalis when I get on later, thanks for recommending it.
