My current personal hypothesis remains mostly the same. Any of our theories could be the right or most likely wrong one. This is just my head canon based upon reading between the lines of Galnet and lore.

-Copy Oberon and Neptune Ryder, pursue Soontill to find Raxxla.
-Soontill was described similarly to a Thargoid Surface Site which many believe are defunct mother ships. So perhaps it’s a whole planet, mothership, or surface site (not discoverable by all though if it is on surface) out there still in control of The Dark Wheel. Jameson even said a mother ship was beautiful before he killed it.
-The Vain Queen Rides A Giraffe That Remembers her Daughter’s hero. I’m still fixated on Camelopardalis due to this and The Andromedaries article. I think “Vain Queen” means mothership or hive that is in hiding. Giraffe that remembers her daughters hero, something to do with Camelopardalis, Perseus, Andromeda.
-The Thargoid Sensor, Probe, and link may lead to this as well. Whatever these things were sent out to find has not been conclusively found imo.
-It could be between systems, like between a Camelopardalis system and a system in Perseus or maybe even Andromeda. I think Thargoid Link, Probe, and Sensor could help.
-I think finding either Soontill or Raxxla will flip the bubble on it’s head and cause The Club to lose their grip over everything for better or worse with whatever consequences that shift in power may bring.
-Weird specifics I came up with from reading: I think probe EMP might be needed to remove a protective disguise around said lost object, which may look like a normal Celestial object but glitchy. Like a bad hologram. I believe what I’m searching for is “West” of the California Nebula if you open the galaxy map and look at it how it opens by default. I don’t think it will be ridiculously far from the bubble. I believe the Thargoids want the Sensors, Probes, and Links because they lead to this missing object and they have lost it themselves. Might also explain their incursions into human space.
I believe Raxxla appears “mundane” and “durable“ when compared to Soontill, and is being exploited by The Club.
