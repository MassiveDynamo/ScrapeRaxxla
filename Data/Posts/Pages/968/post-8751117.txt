Hm, there are so many stars out there you can "see" any shape you want from certain perspectives ..

Personally I like the small "spiral" which can be seen from SOL. Fly to Earth and look in the direction of Persephone.(I think that's the direction)
It certainly is nothing, but for me it was eye-catching as I turned my ship. (yes, and the madness of course..)
I'm currently thousands of LY away, so I can't confirm the direction. I arrived at Persephone some time ago, turned my ship and I immediately noticed those stars.
But again, I think it's nothing special.

Update: Added my screenshot .. it still looks interesting ..View attachment 191592
