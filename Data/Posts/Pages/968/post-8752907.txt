My current personal hypothesis remains mostly the same. Any of our theories could be the right or most likely wrong one. This is just my head canon based upon reading between the lines of Galnet and lore.

-The Vain Queen Rides A Giraffe That Remembers her Daughter’s hero. I’m still fixated on Camelopardalis due to this and The Andromedaries article. I think “Vain Queen” means mothership or hive that is in hiding. Giraffe that remembers her daughters hero, something to do with Camelopardalis, Perseus, Andromeda.

Pretty sure you’re on a hiding to nothing regarding “The Vain Queen...”
This was a clue by Drew Wagar relevant to his Formidine Rift mystery, intended to point people towards the Zurara. He has said several times he knows nothing about Raxxla, nor did any of the other authors (except MB) as FD instructed them to stay off the subject and kept it for themselves.

MB wrote the book Elite Legacy about the mining colony Freeholm in the Artemis system; didn’t spot any clues in there that might relate to Raxxla, or TDW.
