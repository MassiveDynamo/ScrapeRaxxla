If it's a simple formula as they state then it shouldn't take long to work out, given a dozen or so examples. I'm out in the middle of nowhere at the moment, so can't fetch some examples, but if CMDRs want to record some examples then put them in here and I can have a go..

Is that sheet unlocked? Couldnâ€™t add to it from ipad. From the thread mentioned:
FSP#0000, Heisenberg Terminal, LHS 1914

will probably have a break from DW2 for a few days & help my young clone Tyko get friendly with the engineers. Currently trying to deliver 50 tonnes of coffee in fed space. Will update sheet if I can.

if we want to add pix of front/rear to bolster Raxxla ramblings then someone will presumably need to supply an imgur album.
