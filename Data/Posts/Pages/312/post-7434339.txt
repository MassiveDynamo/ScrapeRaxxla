If I understand correctly, that is a user submitted beacon. Looks like the first 110 or so were user submitted (maybe from early beta? - long before I was 'born') See spreadsheet above.

There is an FDev quote somewhere that the Fed station numbers are generated by the coordinates of the system and the distance from the star etc. - I'll see if I can find the ref. Although the algorithm is hinted at, its not spelled out in detail.

that was easy enough to find..

Yes that's the same reference I recall too...however 'how' are these numbers calculated?

I'd like to think the DB statement about these was a fluff but he seems the sort of gent not to make such errors.

Would they admit to an outright question about these numbers, they've given an in game explanation but only partially....if they did contain some sort of mystery they wouldn't necessarily confirm nor deny that...

So the question remains, how are these numbers generated, we understand the explanation but what is the equation - then we can rule this out.
