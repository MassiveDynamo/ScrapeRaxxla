Is that sheet unlocked? Couldnâ€™t add to it from ipad. From the thread mentioned:
FSP#0000, Heisenberg Terminal, LHS 1914

will probably have a break from DW2 for a few days & help my young clone Tyko get friendly with the engineers. Currently trying to deliver 50 tonnes of coffee in fed space. Will update sheet if I can.

if we want to add pix of front/rear to bolster Raxxla ramblings then someone will presumably need to supply an imgur album.

Here is one of the things I've been wondering about. Are there oddities or unknowns about the FSP#'s? Are there two of FSP#0000. And, yes, I think we should collect pictures! If we are both correct this could be very interesting. 8)

Was your's correct or are there two of them? Or is this the same station somehow? I'm honestly not sure. Do the change names or do they have numbers based on system location within an area?!
