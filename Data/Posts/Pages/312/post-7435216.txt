Anyone actually chase the coords from the listening post in Delphi? Never noticed it before myself, but it gives a thing about someone being chased (probably by thargs) an incomplete lat and long location, and a statement that the signal is also found in a HIP system and a Pleiades Sector System. Didn’t get a change to chase it myself yesterday as the servers went down for maint.

Can you pm me the details & I’ll update the LP/UCB sheet (see my signature)
