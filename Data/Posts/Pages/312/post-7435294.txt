As I thought. Nail this loose thread down with others, thanks for confirming - there are so many theories.

There’s a lot of misinformation, and some downright trolling, in the Forums especially when it comes to a mystery like Raxxla.
That’s why us old timers always demand sources we can independently check and supporting evidence for any claims that can be independently tested, that’s the scientific method.
