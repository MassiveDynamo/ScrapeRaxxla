Anyone shed light on this one, bearing in mind I have a cold so not too level headed of late, but doing some trawling and this popped up from 2015.

Now there is no direct quote which me thinks means tis poppycock but its not the first time I've heard this...

"David Braben himself told that Raxxla exists in-game, and will appear in the FSD computer once the player does enough DS scans at that region of space..."
