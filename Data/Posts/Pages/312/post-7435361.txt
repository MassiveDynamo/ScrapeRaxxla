That only works if it can be solved with the scientific method. The game was created by writers and artists. Sure, science is very much a part of the galaxy, but its creators are also very much story tellers, if not mostly that first and foremost. It is a simulation and does not need to conform to the physical and scientific rules that rule our own world.
Just a thought.

Yes it is a story but it is also just a game as well. One that has been programmed to do certain things at certain times. There will be a direct cause and effect when a player does something. You cannot program for an individuals own personal enlightenment that would just be a happy by-product of the story progression.
