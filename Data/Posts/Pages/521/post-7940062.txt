There are thousands of players that would qualify for any criteria in this game.
I am not sure I would recognize that discreet test if I were contacted to do some apparently difficult and uninteresting tip-off / mission...
Maybe thousands of players like me simply didn't accept the test... Because they just didn't suspect that was THE test...
Besides, CQC Elite is not discarded from being a requisite. Who can say ?
Or perhaps the Quest is supposed to be played in Open only... Then my max ranks/rep etc.. would be worthless as I had been playing 99% Solo/Group...
Anyway.. Only FD knows, and as they don't say anything, nobody knows what he is doing..
