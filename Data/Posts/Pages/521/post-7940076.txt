I am not sure I would recognize that discreet test if I were contacted to do some apparently difficult and uninteresting tip-off / mission...
Maybe thousands of players like me simply didn't accept the test... Because they just didn't suspect that was THE test...
Besides, CQC Elite is not discarded from being a requisite. Who can say ?
Or perhaps the Quest is supposed to be played in Open only... Then my max ranks/rep etc.. would be worthless as I had been playing 99% Solo/Group...
Anyway.. Only FD knows, and as they don't say anything nobody knows what he is doing..
Anything is possible to make, but experience tells me that FD goes for very simple solutions. There has never been any complex mechanics for anything in the game.
Making something that is very hard but simple, cost far less than the alternative. FD aren't likely to spend much on something that may never be used by players at all.

This goes for both TDW station and Raxxla. It is probably not very fancy. The station will be a standard orbis design. I suspect Raxxla is just a blob that triggers a hyper-jump to somewhere we cant reach(permit locked or to far).

Simple and cheap. That's what I look for.
