That's pretty much the theory I had going at the time. To me it seemed like a good theory. I was even able to make sense of The Dark Wheel secrecy and the sabotaged generation ships with it. It's just that the source of some of the information isn't exactly from the Elite lore, but the lore does look to be heavily influenced by Holdstock's works. Maybe it is all connected.
Fdev never said it isn't related or relevant. That was someone here. We have 0 confirmation on everything.
