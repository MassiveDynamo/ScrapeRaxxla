Well I'm certainly not suggesting that we in game could possibly time travel, only that potential Time travelers may have existed in our past(future) somehow and in the process of existing through the years may have left clues somewhere.

Hell I'm not even suggesting that. I'm just trying not to exclude it.
No reason to exclude that possibility.

ANCIENT AIRPLANES FOUND ON JAMESON'S ROCK
J.F.

Back on Earth they used to say how strange the world was. Well, folks, now we can reveal that the galaxy is even stranger than they imagined. Were Fungle, the greatest living explorer, has brought back news of a bunch of twentieth century flying machines in the deserts of Jameson's Rock (Zemien)in the far southern sector.

"These cabs were so old they couldn't even get into orbit and here they were 45 light years away from Sol with not a scratch on them. They must have slipped through a time warp," said the intrepid explorer in an exclusive interview with your reporter who tracked him down to the exclusive Artemis bar on Home (also in Zemien).

We think someone should go and have a good look at this discovery pretty pronto.
