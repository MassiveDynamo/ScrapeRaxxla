That's officially stated? I understand he isn't involved anymore.

There is no public guide to the rules of the ED galaxy, but several of the authors have mentioned time travel as forbidden territory.

No time travel in the game is more for practical reasons. It does not fit well with a multiplayer game. I doubt Raxxla has changed since MB went Jurasic. It's probably not something that FD has put a lot of resources into.

Stories involving possible time travel like those in the Journals, shouldn't cause any technical issues. Seems like of-camera stories are getting minimum attention from now on, though.
