So back to the holdstock lore and non elite related stuff. If we try to connect the two and add the theory above about the guardians being humans, one could theorize some of the humans who accidentally time traveled through a misjump, arrived in the past at the 'dark wheel galaxy', potentially found/created Raxxla, and eventually evolving into what we know as the guardians. How's that sound so far?
That's pretty much the theory I had going at the time. To me it seemed like a good theory. I was even able to make sense of The Dark Wheel secrecy and the sabotaged generation ships with it. It's just that the source of some of the information isn't exactly from the Elite lore, but the lore does look to be heavily influenced by Holdstock's works. Maybe it is all connected.
