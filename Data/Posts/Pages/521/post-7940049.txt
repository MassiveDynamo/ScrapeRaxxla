You don't find Raxxla. The Dark Wheel finds you. That is when the hunt begins. Now if we can just figure out how to get The Dark Wheel's attention. Anyone ever level up to Combat Elite by taking down an Elite Dark Wheel NPC?
In RH's lore, being worth of being "one of ours" seems to be related to be an Elite combat pilot.
Becoming 3 Elite is now so easy (Explo/Trade is ridiculously easy and as soon as you are rich in billions you can have any OP ship you want and be promoted to Elite fighter in no time..) that I fear you now have to be a CQC/PvP ace, just to be remarked among thousands of 3E players... I hope I'll be proven wrong.
