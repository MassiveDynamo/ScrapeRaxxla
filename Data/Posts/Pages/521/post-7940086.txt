Trade! Fight! Explore! - Gasp! You have to reach Elite in that order.

Incidentally 'lost' can mean lost in battle as well as just forgot where it is or it moved.
Nah. The proper progression is Explore > Trade > Fight.

Build your initial fortune by hitting Elite in Exploration. If you fly to the galactic center in a moderately upgraded Sidewinder and back to the Bubble (do a little bit of full system scanning along the way) you'll make it back home Elite and wealthy enough to equip yourself with a pretty nice Trade/Passenger/Mining ship to make Elite in Trade. As long as you keep your Combat status down to Harmless most of the NPCs will leave you alone and the ones that do pursue you will be easy to avoid. Now that you've grabbed all those credits you can focus on Combat.
