So back to the holdstock lore and non elite related stuff. If we try to connect the two and add the theory above about the guardians being humans, one could theorize some of the humans who accidentally time traveled through a misjump, arrived in the past at the 'dark wheel galaxy', potentially found/created Raxxla, and eventually evolving into what we know as the guardians. How's that sound so far?
