That looks a lot like a clue, and (sing it with me now, you know the words) There Will Be No Clues
If there aren't any clues it can 100% only be found randomly by accident, and then only if the person involved somehow knows exactly what they were looking for when it's found. If they put it in game then they want it found. If they want it found there have to be some sort of clues. The 'there will be no clues' statement is hugely open to interpretation as to what he meant by there won't be clues. I personally interpret that to mean they will not be giving anybody clues personally, that any clues are in game to be found so don't ask us for hints.

Otherwise if there are no clues then they don't want it to be found because it doesn't actually exist in game and we've all been being lied to and we are all a- holes.

You can't get back time. This would have been an enormous waste of time for all parties involved if that was the case. I'm sure they wouldn't sabotage their own fanbase like that.
