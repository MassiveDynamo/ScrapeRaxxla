Does anybody know if there are examples of time travel in Elite? It seems like the lore is heavily based on Holdstock's works, so I would think it could be possible.

There are hints of time travel in the FFE journals. In ED it has been put on the no go list, together with anti gravity. Authors were not allowed to touch it and it will never happen in game, according to MB. ED is a multiplayer game with a common clock, that even overrides relativity.
I don't know if the no go also cover all potential in-house lore, like Raxxla.
