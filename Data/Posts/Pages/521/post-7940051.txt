You don't find Raxxla. The Dark Wheel finds you. That is when the hunt begins. Now if we can just figure out how to get The Dark Wheel's attention. Anyone ever level up to Combat Elite by taking down an Elite Dark Wheel NPC?
I doubt you will ever get contacted by TDW. I think you have to find that station first. There are thousands of players that would qualify for any criteria in this game.
The gate is probably just being Elite. The test is finding the station.
