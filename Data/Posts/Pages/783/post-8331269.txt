Mmm, hadnâ€™t thought about having to do a sequence of ev3nts within 30 days. Always assumed that the 30 days was just a timer for how long it would stay in your inbox before automatic deletion.
Tried again after lunch. One time it rescanned the logs, after that it said the datapoint was already scanned. Seems a bit hit & miss.

Also, ive been told if your ship explodes it resets certain data you've obtained but dont have any real confirmation of this or what all data that effects.

Yes, it may be a bug that you can rescan after a relog or so, not sure. I would expect you should be able to rescan after 30 days and the message archival though.
"After ship destruction" should certainly allow a rescan.

But again, in case Fdev has been clever perhaps we need to perform the 'the set of actions' within a timeframe of 30 days so it will be harder to discover the correct sequence.
If there is a set of sequences that is.
