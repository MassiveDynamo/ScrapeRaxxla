But again, in case Fdev has been clever perhaps we need to perform the 'the set of actions' within a timeframe of 30 days so it will be harder to discover the correct sequence.
If there is a set of sequences that is.

Without any hints, this would be nearly impossible.
Elite tracks hundreds of stats; furthest distance from starting point, total distance traveled, black markets traded with, total markets, kills, bounties, passengers, beacons, etc...
If they put an additional limiter, like do X combination within 30 days, that would be especially evil.
