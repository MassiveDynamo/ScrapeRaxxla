The neck tattoos may be entirely decorative but meaningless?

Does TDW in SD have tattoos? Consistently across all their representatives?
We are told in Premonition that TRDW operates “wheels within wheels” and the SD faction are “merely a front”. I suspect the key is to find the inner wheels through some characteristic of the know outer wheel; is there anything else the SD faction exhibit? Background flags for instance?
As far as tattoos go, they do not have any visible. Im not on atm and cant speak on their backgrounds though.
