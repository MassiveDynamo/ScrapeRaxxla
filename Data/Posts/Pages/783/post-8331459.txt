I have started this week doing missions to expand the Dark Wheel in LFT 926 but the percentage never increases.
I believe someone is working against us to preserve green party of lft 926. I cannot confirm this but we shouldnt be in war with los chupacabras because we just beat them last week and their influence was not moving previous to tdw's rise in status positioning
