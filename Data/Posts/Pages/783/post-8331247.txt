I always thought those things were paddle-shaped hand fans painted on washi paper. The fourth paddle, or a lotus petal, means your Ajna chakra is beginning to open towards ascension of the spiritual path of Raxxla. The third eye is purple and symbolizes the quest for truth. Anarchy factionists need kind of gnostic spirituality to keep rejecting so much. Elite angerous is kinda deep that way.

Ommmmmm,
Afraid that just went right over my lotus chakra!
