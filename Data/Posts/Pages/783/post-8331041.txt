I dropped into Van Maanen's Star to check the Tattoo of the Divine Galen Elliott. I was wrong, he doesn't have the neck tattoo of the engineers in my previous post, just the 4 leaf clover I'm loosely associating to the criminal gangs at the moment as per my previous post.

p.s. If I just disappear one day after switching allegiance, look suspiciously at TDW in SD as being allies of THE CLUB! ;-)

CMDR, There was an investigation on the Independent Raxxla Hunters discord into groups with the 4-leaf clover tattoo.
It lasted a couple months, then they found some player-created groups that had the tattoo.

You could look through the screenshots posted in the investigation '#groups with matching forehead tattoos [closed]' to see others with the neck tattoo.
If you find the neck tattoo on a player-created group, then you can probably assume it's random instead of an FDev clue trail.
