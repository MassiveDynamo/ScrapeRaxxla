Interestingly, I checked a couple of other 'enemies' of TDW from other systems (like Nuenets, Fong Wang etc) and they don't have either a representative, or passenger that appeared with either of those tattoos. Lots of criminal masterminds, no tattoos. Seems like there are two factions of Criminals(?) going by the tattoos. Those with the four leaf, and those with the neck pyramids.

I might have to go back to scratch with data collection about this - seems like a possible avenue that needs more thorough examination and data points before proving +/-.

The neck tattoos may be entirely decorative but meaningless?

Does TDW in SD have tattoos? Consistently across all their representatives?
We are told in Premonition that TRDW operates “wheels within wheels” and the SD faction are “merely a front”. I suspect the key is to find the inner wheels through some characteristic of the know outer wheel; is there anything else the SD faction exhibit? Background flags for instance?
