Without any hints, this would be nearly impossible.
Elite tracks hundreds of stats; furthest distance from starting point, total distance traveled, black markets traded with, total markets, kills, bounties, passengers, beacons, etc...
If they put an additional limiter, like do X combination within 30 days, that would be especially evil.
The hints are in the codex and lore and quite possibly there in game for us to see.
I'm just keeping my mind open to what kind of mechanics they may have used to trigger off any events.
