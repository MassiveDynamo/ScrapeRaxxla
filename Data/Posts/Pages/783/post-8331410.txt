Side note: some folk are working against my efforts to expand the dark wheel from lft 926. If any helpful cmdrs found it in their interest, a dark wheeling rock hopper like me self could use some support.

Sorry i been watchin a lot of the expanse lately

I have started this week doing missions to expand the Dark Wheel in LFT 926 but the percentage never increases.
