Good point.
It's quite possible that we need have wrapped up some conditions for a trigger within limitation of 30 days of archival of these messages.

Mmm, hadnâ€™t thought about having to do a sequence of ev3nts within 30 days. Always assumed that the 30 days was just a timer for how long it would stay in your inbox before automatic deletion.
Tried again after lunch. One time it rescanned the logs, after that it said the datapoint was already scanned. Seems a bit hit & miss.
