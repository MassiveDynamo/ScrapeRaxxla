Was pondering whether my progress on the personal journey is monitored via the Cmdr Codex archive, e.g. beacons & sites visited. Had a strange experience this morning-visited the Jameson Cobra wreck site again this morning (good for stocking up on encoded materials so visited a few times week before last but having spent best part of a week engineering a Krait2 battlewagon to help progress my combat rank, I am now having to do the same for a corvette!); so had definitely already seen Jameson’s log messages. This morning they reappeared in my inbox, as though the game had forgotten I’d already seen them! Now this could be a problem if the game really is monitoring progress this way. I got Jameson’s logs years ago when the wreck was first found, but they weren’t in my codex entry-didn’t worry about it cos it was before the codex was introduced. But if it’s forgetting things I’ve done....
And the logs for the Cete and Bifrost weren’t stored there either!
AFAIK there is always the 30 days expiration period mentioned below those messages. After that you can "re-scan" them again, imo.
