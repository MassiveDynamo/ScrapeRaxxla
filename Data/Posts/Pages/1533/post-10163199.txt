I was just playing with ChatGPT as an anagram solver, to see if it would be helpful to @Jorki Rasalas.

It is perfect for the job. You can ask it anything, specify must include words, require all / not all letters to be used and give a theme.

Example of all letters, include Alien or aliens and astronomy theme: "Alien Spirits Land Amongst Stellar Planets' Halo"
Ah
But does it know the answer to Life, the Universe & Everything?
If it responds with “42” then tell it to stop boasting about its IQ and tell us where the mice went!
