Rough idea to maybe to catch a rogue planet, which Raxxla could be.
Little bit based on that project of scanning each grid around Sol.


How many systems are there in a bubble of Sol of:
10ly
20ly
30ly

The idea is to place in each system one cmdr. (question is how many cmdrs must we have for this in each bubble)

The cmdr scan the system and take notes about how many bodies in the system atm.

Each of them do this each 1 or 2 hours to check if something is changed in bodies in their system.

Maybe one cmdr noticed that one body has gone and another noticed one body is added.

Maybe with this we can see from and to which system a rogue planet goes. If a rogue planet exists, of course
