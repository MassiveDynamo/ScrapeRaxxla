Oh, just remembered another reason for investigating Dahan. There was an interesting news item a while ago: Dahan-Smithy’s Claim galnet reference 5 September 3300 (i.e. 2014), puzzled FSD mechanics “These cores are normally good for 1000 light years, and yet nearly 1 in 20 of my customers has needed a complete drive overhaul, where have these Commanders been flying?”

I did investigate that a while ago but couldnt find anything, but suspect it was a hint...
