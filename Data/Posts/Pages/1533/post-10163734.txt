The Ark hips would be sub lightspeed. Realistically 0.6 C maximum. They would not have made it trough more than a couple systems, in 9 years.
Rogue planets would be much slower that that. They probably need a hundred years to clear a system.
If Raxxla really moves from system to system, it's a ship with at least supercruise capability.
Hm. I wonder whose FSD technology. We jump very fast between the stars, our aircraft carriers also jump.
But the Thargoids turn out not to be able to, as far as I remember the arrival of the Titans, they slowly flew between systems.
