Still questing!
A major part of my current hypothesis is that “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars” is an anagram of the clue to Raxxla’s whereabouts
If we assume-
Princess Astrophel : The celestial princess

And add anagram-
“Spiraling stars” an anagram for: Altairs Springs?

Are there geysers there?

Qixi festival?
