Rough idea to maybe to catch a rogue planet, which Raxxla could be.
Little bit based on that project of scanning each grid around Sol.


How many systems are there in a bubble of Sol of:
10ly
20ly
30ly

The idea is to place in each system one cmdr. (question is how many cmdrs must we have for this in each bubble)

The cmdr scan the system and take notes about how many bodies in the system atm.

Each of them do this each 1 or 2 hours to check if something is changed in bodies in their system.

Maybe one cmdr noticed that one body has gone and another noticed one body is added.

Maybe with this we can see from and to which system a rogue planet goes. If a rogue planet exists, of course
Rogue planets exist IRL and there is a mechanism for them to exist in-game from the journal file specification.

You don’t need to go to those lengths, a single cmdr could do it. Just visit each system to be tested, pull up system map and enter the orrery view.

By definition a rogue planet is not captured by the gravity fields within the system to go into a closed orbital path, it’s just wandering through, so for a rogue planet the orrery view would show its orbit entering and leaving the system in a parabolic or hyperbolic path.


Edit
There is no evidence, either in-game or the lore or the novels, that Raxxla is a rogue planet. That probably originated in Drew Wagar’s fan fiction which is an entertaining read but is not canon for ED.
