With the example of the Titans, we were given a mechanism and taught how to keep track of the wandering planets.
True - I always thought the way fleet carriers moved around and attached themselves as extra moons was possibly how Raxxla could be moving - but now with the Titans you can quite literally have it moving between the systems instead of “jumping”

Edit- would also be neat if they applied this mechanic to the ark ships.. though i have no idea how we would find them…
