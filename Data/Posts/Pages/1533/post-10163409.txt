Rogue planets exist IRL and there is a mechanism for them to exist in-game from the journal file specification.

You don’t need to go to those lengths, a single cmdr could do it. Just visit each system to be tested, pull up system map and enter the orrery view.

By definition a rogue planet is not captured by the gravity fields within the system to go into a closed orbital path, it’s just wandering through, so for a rogue planet the orrery view would show its orbit entering and leaving the system in a parabolic or hyperbolic path.


Edit
There is no evidence, either in-game or the lore or the novels, that Raxxla is a rogue planet. That probably originated in Drew Wagar’s fan fiction which is an entertaining read but is not canon for ED.
With the example of the Titans, we were given a mechanism and taught how to keep track of the wandering planets.
