True - I always thought the way fleet carriers moved around and attached themselves as extra moons was possibly how Raxxla could be moving - but now with the Titans you can quite literally have it moving between the systems instead of “jumping”

Edit- would also be neat if they applied this mechanic to the ark ships.. though i have no idea how we would find them…
The Ark hips would be sub lightspeed. Realistically 0.6 C maximum. They would not have made it trough more than a couple systems, in 9 years.
Rogue planets would be much slower that that. They probably need a hundred years to clear a system.
If Raxxla really moves from system to system, it's a ship with at least supercruise capability.
