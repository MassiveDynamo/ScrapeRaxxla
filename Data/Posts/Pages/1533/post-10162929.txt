If we assume-
Princess Astrophel : The celestial princess

And add anagram-
“Spiraling stars” an anagram for: Altairs Springs?

Are there geysers there?

Qixi festival?
Nah
“And the Spiralling stars” -> “gin and it”!
Though I prefer Lavian brandy!


And I’m still suspicious of those 13 TB references to Saturn’s E ring!!

Edit
A bit of copy & paste I could understand, but 13 instances? I remember MB inviting proposals for TB, so guessing he was in charge of the process. And a Raxxla clue...??
