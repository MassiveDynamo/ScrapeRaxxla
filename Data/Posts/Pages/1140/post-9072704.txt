Ahh good point !

I ran a quick look at angles minus those stops if that helps:

The last log of Adamastor where she entered HIp 69200 said “Currently 1.. Ly “ but not from/to where. I suspect the secret base she was heading to is therefore 100 to 199 ly from HIP69200 probably along the straight line route from Coalsack. I did try a search around there but there are a lot of systems & dont know what divergence angle there could be. Another possibility is that the intersection point of the two lines might be a clue, how far would that be I wonder? My 3D math isn’t good enough to calculate it (yes I know- too many Lavian brandies!!).

Don’t understand the navigation info in the latest message (from Hesperus)
“ Navigational data to follow...
H1 Key -E
H2 Key +H
H3 Key -C ”
