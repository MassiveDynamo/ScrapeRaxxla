What clavain said ... plus I think a few of them are laughing at us from the Bar in Raxxla where they can actually sit and Drink with their Unicorn Bunnies at their sides (looking at you Macros and Han Zen...)
Just searching the thread for what you said about Adamastor & Hesperus, and found this...

You’re accusing Macros and Han Zen of being Unicorn Bunnies???

That’s rather non-PC isn’t it???
