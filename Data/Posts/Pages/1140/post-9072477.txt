This is image a clue as it is in the actual Codex for the The Dark Wheel. From the looks of it this is either an exceptionally cool and small M-class star or a L-class brown dwarf with a nearby moon or planet. Station appears to be an Orbis.
Sorry.
This picture appeared on the forum only because that's how the forum works.
My opinion: TDW has nothing to do with Raxxla, yes members of TDW searched for Raxxla and even someone found it, but as a rule he was quickly killed.

You have to follow the link and see there a map of the galaxy from the codex, divided into regions.

The green drawing in the margins I think is just an advertisement for the movie. And it's not a circle but a spiral, one way from edge to center and vice versa.

As for the tale of the astronomer and the spiral star, my opinion: this is any ancient astronomer looking into the sky through a telescope and when he saw another galaxy he called it a spiral star.

P.S. For some reason WIKI says that the first spiral galaxy was found by Lord Ross in 1845, although it also says that at least 4 galaxies are visible to the untrained eye.

P.P.S. I wish we had a offtopic in the section that could discuss modern astronomy outside of the game. As many things in modern astronomy incomprehensible and contradictory but to discuss it on scientific forums is not very desirable
