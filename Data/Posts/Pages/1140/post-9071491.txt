Just searching the thread for what you said about Adamastor & Hesperus, and found this...

You’re accusing Macros and Han Zen of being Unicorn Bunnies???

That’s rather non-PC isn’t it???

Ya - Welll I was trying to say they had their own Unicorn Bunnies- and I want one too (I have an extreme case of Unicorn Bunny Envy). But hopefully soon that will be rectified
I always Picture Macros as some kind of Dragon - with me as the guy in the reflection. And Han Zen as some sort of Daoist Han Solo....
