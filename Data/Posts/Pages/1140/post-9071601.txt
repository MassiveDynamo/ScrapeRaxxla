This is image a clue as it is in the actual Codex for the The Dark Wheel. From the looks of it this is either an exceptionally cool and small M-class star or a L-class brown dwarf with a nearby moon or planet. Station appears to be an Orbis.
An Orbis yes, but if you compare that pic with a similar Orbis (e.g. Aulin Enterprise) the colour of the lights at the back of the station do not match. If you correct the colour of the Codex pic to match the star is less red and looks like a subdwarf. The scale looks like it may have been manipulated also.
I posted a link to my colour corrected version a while back in this thread.
