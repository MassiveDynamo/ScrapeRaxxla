When I wrote about the regions I did not mean sectors, namely the regions of the game. As far as I remember these regions, a strange shape was introduced into the game with the codex.
Measure the galaxy in cubes is not correct, it is round and the concentration of stars near the center is very large i.e. the accuracy will fall.
The sector of the polchr system just takes this into account. To increase the number of stars in the central cubes, a correction for this must be introduced in the grid, in the polar one it will be by itself.
And I believe the grid and distance from the Sun are then recalculated from the polar system.

Ya - was playing with the regions before - they definitely line up along the polar coordinate galaxy map you also see in the codex. I vaugely remember something early on where they talked about how they arrived at the coordinate system they are using.... Also I know there is a thread out there from Jackie Silver(?) maybe - that has some good insight into naming conventions within the sectors.... (edit - ah ya looks like that is what alexyk had in his link)
