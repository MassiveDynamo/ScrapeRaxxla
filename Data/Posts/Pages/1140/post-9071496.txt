No, Thats the CoR logo background which is a player made design and unofficial. Unfortunately the Wiki is not a reliable source of information. If I had a credit for every time that logo comes up I'd own a fleet carrier by now..

The image, btw , is from the barberry crop circle:

With regards to the toast. Darth Ender is correct in so much as TDW don't know where Raxxla is, so expecting the toast to lead you there is likely to be a false hope. My impression after much deliberation is that the toast describes Raxxla itself, as much as they know about it, and the effect it has had on their members:

Jewel, Siren etc. - this is what it is; lover's woe, parents grief etc. -what its done to us.

So for hints, I think we need to look elsewhere in the codex article.. not that that helps much
