I see some changes were done to the thread. I am against Censorship in all forms. I believe he had a right to post - and his Image analysis was fun. I think it was best in his own thread like he had it before - and probably should have been using spoilers instead of walls of images - but I feel the response from the community has been less than good.
Proper mod etiquette requires the person being harassed should be the one to be censored not those doing the harassing
