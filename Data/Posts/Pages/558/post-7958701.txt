I'm joining you. After thinking and searching for Raxxla for approximately 1,000 hours I don't have anything to show for it except an NPC named Raxxil.

Good luck on your journey to everybody sticking with it! Reading every word in every post here was more joyous than finding it anyway. You're all awesome!
An NPC named Raxxil seems pretty badass to be fair.
My whole Gan Romero obsession yielded very little more than my NPC, Pilot Holloway. But she was worth it too.
