I've been having an interesting chat with @Ian Doncaster in the 'Dark Wheel Station' thread next door - it's worth checking out since it's related to the whole Raxxla thing.
Interesting yeah. But I wouldn't discard TDW station being ridiculously close to Sol/Tau Ceti/ SD. For practical reasons.
And as it avoids detection... Just a convenient way to justify hat nobody is meant to find it unless invited to, as you very well stated.
But... why does FD tell us about all that 8th moon... blah blah ? They want us to play their game looking for red herrings?
As (almost) always...
