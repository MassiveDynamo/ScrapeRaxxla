Interesting yeah. But I wouldn't discard TDW station being ridiculously close to Sol/Tau Ceti/ SD. For practical reasons.
And as it avoids detection... Just a convenient way to justify hat nobody is meant to find it unless invited to, as you very well stated.
But... why does FD tell us about all that 8th moon... blah blah ? They want us to play their game looking for red herrings?
As (almost) always...

It's possible it's a Bubble system, but there can't be that many red giant stars with 8 mooned gas giants in the Bubble - which means it should be feasible to locate the system. I'll expect a screenshot that matches the Codex entry minus the station from you tomorrow
