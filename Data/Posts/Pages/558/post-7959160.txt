It's also worth noting that FD can modify proc. gen systems, after their generation. They can both insert assets and modify Stellar Forge objects.
An example of this is Hypuae Aim ZP-R b48-0 that has a gas giant, named Travis Green. This one has been in the game since launch. Probably named by a backer.

It's also worth noting that even though I have fully explored Hypuae Aim ZP-R b48-0, Travis Green is not searchable in the galaxy map.
