I did some search and found that Shoujeman have appeared on the skybox while i was doing my supercruise flight towards Virgo. There are few screenshots. On the first 3, there is no Shoujeman, there is empty black space. On the last one, it is here Since then, it is always here. I am posting in Raxxla thread because i did that flight while searching Raxxla, because i was thinking it should be in Virgo constellation in the Sol system.
