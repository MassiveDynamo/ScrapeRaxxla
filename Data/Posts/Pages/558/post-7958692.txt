I think I'm gonna stop looking. If they actually did want us to find it they wouldn't be silent ASF about it entirely. There would be clues. If it is in game it's probably all glitched out and not supported by ps4 anyways. This is a sad day.
I'm joining you. After thinking and searching for Raxxla for approximately 1,000 hours I don't have anything to show for it except an NPC named Raxxil.

Good luck on your journey to everybody sticking with it! Reading every word in every post here was more joyous than finding it anyway. You're all awesome!
