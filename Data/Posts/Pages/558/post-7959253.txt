It's possible it's a Bubble system, but there can't be that many red giant stars with 8 mooned gas giants in the Bubble - which means it should be feasible to locate the system. I'll expect a screenshot that matches the Codex entry minus the station from you tomorrow
Mmmmh... TDW station in a system with a red giant just like the Zurara on the RR line in a system with an ELW. Yeah, of course, gonna start searching right now.
That screenshot statement doesn't totally convince me. Sorry but it's just that I no longer trust anything coming from FD in matter of consistency and sensibility...
