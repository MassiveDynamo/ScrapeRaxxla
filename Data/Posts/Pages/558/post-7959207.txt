Iâ€™ve been entertaining the thought that TDW station could be a hollowed out asteroid station floating in a sea of other asteroids in the ring of a planet. A star is technically a gas giant, just with a lot of fusion reactions going on, so it could be the 8th body orbiting a star..
I have had similar ideas, but I think that would make the codex entry too misleading, given the picture and all....
