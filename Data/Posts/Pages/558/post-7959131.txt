Qiefoea CL-Y g0 apparently = BD-12 1805 in galnet.

It's always confusing if the line of -# less stars has a 0 value or starts at 1. -# less means no last numerical value. Just a letter then number at the end. XX-X X#-# with no -# at the end. (XX-X X#)

What are those sequences called? There is at least one in every sector in the game. It doesn't have all numbers in a sequence but it always has most of them. And they tend to have an abundance of pre exploration buff stars like metal rich and high metal and unusual star combinations. They are all usually worth good money too. Even if they are explored.

A lot of them are bright blue or other unusual stars also.
