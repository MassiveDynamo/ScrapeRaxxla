I know. Not sure why he would attack a post with evidence and images.

Never seen any attacks in this thread. Though have seen many discussions over the validity of assumptions, or claims that something was lore. That’s what’s the thread is for.
This is a nice friendly thread where people can ask for help or post their ideas on Raxxla for discussion; doesn’t necessarily follow that the discussion will be entirely supportive, if readers think an idea has faults they’ll point them out. It’s criticism in the friendliest way. We might have arguments discussions about ideas, but there has never been any malice. It’s by pointing out weaknesses in ideas that they can be improved, hopefully leading to the correct idea that results in locating Raxxla. That’s why we also report failed attempts. It’s the appliance of science.
