Personally I lean towards it being a real screenshot.

Think it came out after the screenshot which may or may not have been 'solved' by looking at the stars so if it is real then fdev knew this and would have avoided it - theres no background stars in the screen shot, its a deliberate viewpoint

Its the right shape apparently - never sure what a Toroid is as described in Codex coz never see Toroid in any current station description?

Its not the best shot - its enough to show a bit of station, a bit of presumably planet 8H and a bit of Star, just enough to include to entice us in without any real info

Theres no asteroids in shot, there is a planet - this fits in with the old lore and as written in the Codex (DW station orbits a planet, supposed to be 8H) Doesn't mean the shot isn't deliberate to avoid asteroids though.

It would be a lot of effort to go to just to take one screenshot just to put it in the Codex. They didn't bother for other entries like Fed, Enpire or Alliance you just get a nice graphic cityscape, could easily have done the same for this supposed DW station so why do a screenshot?

Whether that means its in game now or 'active' as such I don't think it is or someone would have triggered something surely - not scientific but cant imagine theres many 'achievements' or 'milestones' that someone hasn't done or reached. Plus DB vid talks about your friends plural getting invited to a secret organisation so it may be a more widespread affair at some story point.

And even if it is there and is 'active' the Codex makes plain we probably wont be allowed to see it until they want us to probably after making contact with the DW and being shown it as proof they are real like the Codex says they do, until then we can scan and fly by and we just wont 'see' it, like the Golconda which just appeared out of nowhere.
