Yeah, it's probably the biggest mass star, not largest. I agree with most of what you said Vetinari, the TDW station is probably on the 8th moon of a gas giant in probably a unnamed (or recently named) system near the bubble.

If the star filter only takes in account the main star, we can't really use it to search. I did see a proton star (I think it was) that was really red and huge, similar to the one on the Codex photo.
Not really ... saw systems (Star +(bh+bh)) + huge star and named as (Star), where masses (Star +(bh+bh)) < huge star
And well, entry point is mostly 1st star on top of map. But extrta rare (like I saw 3-4 times) entry point to system can be on 2nd star on map, maybe 300000ls away from 1st, but system named as 1st.
Maybe it is based on luminosity? I.e. brightest star names ...
