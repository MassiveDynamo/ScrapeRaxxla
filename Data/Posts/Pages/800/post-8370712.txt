P.S. And the lore in Codex says that DW don't know where Raxxla is, they're looking for it. So fdev can let us find and maybe join the DW without giving Raxxla away, it will still be the games biggest secret.

GalMap routes through greatest mass stars yes technically not largest but we knew what they meant and English not always first language its written in. So yes GalMap will list stars in order and you could enter at 2nd or 3rd Star not the Primary. Filters turn off the Primary, the one that visually shows as a star in GalMap so you will lose sight of any and all non-primary regardless of what they are or what mass if you use filters.

So if you have a L,WD type system and turn off L you will lose the system from the map even if you would have landed at the WD and leaving WD or Neutron Boost on won't show it and you won't route through it at all.
