Is there a way to search for systems which have at least one gas giant with 8 moons? Never used EDSM before, only use EDDB.
I don't think so, people do a copy of DB to own servers then do SQL queries on in as they like. But as I said, if anything is listed on EDSM this means somebody already was there & checked.
