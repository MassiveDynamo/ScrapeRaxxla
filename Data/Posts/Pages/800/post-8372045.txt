Yeah, it's probably the biggest mass star, not largest. I agree with most of what you said Vetinari, the TDW station is probably on the 8th moon of a gas giant in probably a unnamed (or recently named) system near the bubble.

If the star filter only takes in account the main star, we can't really use it to search. I did see a proton star (I think it was) that was really red and huge, similar to the one on the Codex photo.
