Theres a thread somewhere that focusses on the Star in the DW Codex entry, its worth a read but don't have it bookmarked so that's helpful but my own theory is, if its a real screenshot then it almost certainly has to be a binary or better because of the proximity of the moon to the star, if its an 8H.

If its a binary or better, it would make sense to have A as L,Y, or T and B as M or whatever it is and AB 8H be the one you're after. Players filter out L,Y,T even if not just KGBFOAMing their way around coz they're boring ice worlds 99% of the time, few check the secondary star in GalMap and nobody checks the route they would have taken if they hadn't turned them off. Just a paranoid or extremely suspicious thought, no evidence at all.
If you filter the galaxy map for systems with red dwarfs, will that include red dwarfs in binary systems? Or only if the red dwarf is the main star (where you jump to)?
