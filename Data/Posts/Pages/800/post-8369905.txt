If you filter the galaxy map for systems with red dwarfs, will that include red dwarfs in binary systems? Or only if the red dwarf is the main star (where you jump to)?
I think that will be MAIN star. However I met 2-3 systems already where you exit hyper on 2nd star without own name and system itself named as 1st star.
