Sorry, ur english is ..hard some times ...for non-natives.
P.S. and others this count too - that guy with indian videos - i just skip. Sorry.

Basically we've found more places where Raxxla isn't located so in that sense we've narrowed the search from 400bn systems to 399.99bn (not exact maths but hope you get the idea) Another 30,000 years and we'll only have a couple of systems left to search
