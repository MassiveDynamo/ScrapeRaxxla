Perhaps the current lack of gal news is the Shadow super powers that be silencing media sources for perpetuating rumors and information that may lead others to discover the intentions and whereabouts of said Shadow superpowers. That would be an interesting take on the current situation. Also it kind of forces those who want information to go out and seek it instead of waiting for it to be discovered and reported through the news. It kind of seems like an improbable theory but still makes the whole media silence a lot more interesting to think of it this way

The Club stifling news while they make their escape during the build up to the Klaxian invasion!
