Just a little extra on the "Tour of the Galaxy" As I belive it to be the genisis of the lore format for Elite (And since FD seems intent on destroying it lately). The book is presented like a scrapbook showing journal entries of the couple as well as photos, newspaper articles, receipts and other clippings detailing their journey. It presents the actions of the protagonists through the journal articles as well as the photos. The news articles are slanted based on the news outlet. It also has military reports that correspond to events as well as snippents from the cosmic gazetteer. All staples of the Elite series. There are even two superpowers the Galactic Cooperative (earth) and the Aurora Magellan Federation which fought a war of independence from the Cooperative and is described as militaristic. Saud Kruger got its start by making interesting bracelets and Lakon Spaceways was originally Laker Space...? o7
