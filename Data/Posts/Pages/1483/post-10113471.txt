Elvira Martuuk wanted Soontill Relics expressly to disprove Soontill had any legitimacy. Even GalNet told you these were Earth relics per "Soontill Relics Test Results Queried" ( ). Elvira Martuuk in-game description:



These were artifacts previously known as Dropa Stones but now referred to as bi (jade) disks.



Fancy that, the 12,000 year figure from Galnet was not coincidence.

I have no idea what all this is worth, but it all lead to new connections and new directions so I welcome it.
The Dropa/Bi-jade are supposed to be humming in special conditions (according to 50's USSR science). A bit like the Trinkets of Good Fortune or so I've heard (was it "hidden fortune"?). No use was found for it outside missions but I still believe there's more to it. For starter it is forbidden everywhere, why? Consumer protection law against esoteric scams ? Or because it is a lead to something that all the powers want to remain hidden? Carrying it bring enough discomfort to suppose there's something to it, if brough to the right place. What if it can reveal something normally hidden on the left panel, by some sort of activation resonance or like?

That's kind of the problem (and the fun!) with Raxxla and TDW. We can build theories endlessly.
