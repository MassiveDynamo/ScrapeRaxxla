What was later found and what was later called Raxxla, I don't quite follow?
Earth relics are depicted as mere archeological artefact, why link it to Bi jade it could be Venus statues, or Macron portraits
Description of Earth Relics is ambiguous enough to cover legitimate artifacts from humans while also possibly some stuff left by visitors to Sol. The Soontill Relics description meanwhile matches with GalNet proposition that they were from Earth. This is also why Elvira Martuuk wanted to investigate them. Still CMDRs were in a way being tested to see if we were paying attention.
