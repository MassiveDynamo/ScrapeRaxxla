There is no reference to them being anything other than relics from ancient periods of the earth? (i.e. not alien)... this could be anything from a ming vase, the turin shroud to a Nokia mobile phone and other historic junk.....?
So, some are indeed human Earth relics from humans but read the "Soontill Relics Test Results Queried". There is more than enough ambiguity to match both on description for Earth Relics. The Soontill Relics description is quite explicit and matches with it being from Earth (because nothing would survive a visit to Soontill 1 - that place makes Venus seem heavenly in comparison). The Raxxla rumors have always been strongly linked to Earth because of the events from "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide".
