Mark my words: the Frameshift Drive has always been inherently linked directly to Raxxla and the Talmor Lens/Faraway. Especially because of a literary technique called a Frame story. No, I am not an FDev employee or one of the authors tasked with going incognito to alert CMDRs to the breadcrumbs laid down by Frontier Developments (though that would be hilarious).

Frameshift == change of perspective
Perspective due to framing == secondary narrative
