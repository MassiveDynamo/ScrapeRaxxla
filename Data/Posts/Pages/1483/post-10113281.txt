Particularly your interpretation of AHTW is wrong.
Is it, though?



Soontill 1 where the secret base supposedly was..


Elvira Martuuk wanted Soontill Relics expressly to disprove Soontill had any legitimacy. Even GalNet told you these were Earth relics per "Soontill Relics Test Results Queried" ( https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/2ff0af566b06e051c2af52cd02a467351b449535 ). Elvira Martuuk in-game description:

Elvira Martuuk is a well known explorer although she is rumoured to have once been a deadly assassin before heading out into black. Some have claimed she needed to 'cool off' after a particularly high profile case, so went exploring, but Elvira denies it. She is fascinated by all things alien, and has become expert at spotting human fakes. Her reputation is such that her base is rarely troubled by freebooters. She believes in being self-sufficient, and her tight-knit group grows all their own food. Develop your relationship with her to discover another engineer.

These were artifacts previously known as Dropa Stones but now referred to as bi (jade) disks.

Fancy that, the 12,000 year figure from Galnet was not coincidence.
