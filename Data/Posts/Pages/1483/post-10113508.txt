@yelboc My apologies. You were thinking I killed "..And Here the Wheel". No, I would never do such a thing. Transform it from a source of pain to happiness sure. Let me explain...

You apparently didn't understand why I went this route. "And Here the Wheel.." is still canon though it was part of larger tale of propaganda to protect the secret of Raxxla and the origin of our Frameshift Drives. Okay, so the Dropa Stones and Bi (jade) disks are a form of Earth Relics that are a salvage commodity and able to be found through convoy POIs. Here's the catch: both Mars Relic and the Earth Relics are a form of what we found and later called Raxxla. What is on sale in Ngurii is for all practical purposes simultaneously a fraud (in the sense they aren't from Soontill) and what causes the greatest technological leap for humans. The prior alien relic sales are much the same from First Encounter journals. Remember, per "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" the Raxxlans visit both Earth and Mars. These are the proof.

That said, this is far from over. We still have the stargates from "Tour of the Universe" to uncover and it appears Faraway/Talmor Lens is still very much in existence and much more upgraded.
