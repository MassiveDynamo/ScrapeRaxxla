I made some experiments:
Flying in normal Space aiming away from a Station towards its orbital center will eventually get you out of the SOI of that Station. There are the things that can happen now.
1.) Getting in the SOI from another Station (the SOI "Nav" panel will the show that Station)
2.) You get in the SHIPPING LANE whit nonzero relative velocity too the stations and the SOIs around you (have a look at the distances to the stations) and you are fast some times even put u back in one of the SOIs
3.) You hit the SOI of Pareco Comet 2. the SOI panel will show SHIPPING LANE, but your Ship is stationary relative to the other SOIs

To confirm i dropped right at Pareco Comet 2 by directly targeting it and i had the same result. I was stationary relative to the Stations but had SHIPING LANE showing as my reference Body. I then flew 50km ~perpendicular too the orbital plane (just giving upwards trust) and the SOI stayed at SHIPPING LANE but i got instant rel. vel. to the Stations.

TLDR: SHIPPING LANE can obstruct the real reference Body.

Talking of Pareco, did anyone try bouncing around the 6 stations in the segmented hex pattern from the Raxxla logo in the Codex?
Maybe that unlocks the center point?
