Welcome!

“8th moon of an unnamed GG” is Lyta Crane’s “info” in the Codex about TDW stealth station (nothing to do with Raxxla). IMHO it’s hogwash and a red herring (read the codex description of her reliability).
Edit: and FDev response to a question by @Rochester suggested it may not be in game at present; perhaps there’s a storyline that we need to trigger, or maybe the whole thing is hogwash/fluff...

As for area of search, make up your own mind. It’s a “personal journey” that we all must make. I’ve searched extensively in Sol and not found anything, but then not found anything anywhere else either!

Whatever Raxxla is it’s been in-game since before Horizons so may not be a landable planet/moon. Might be a POI, a USS, even disguised as a comet (my current hypothesis)....
