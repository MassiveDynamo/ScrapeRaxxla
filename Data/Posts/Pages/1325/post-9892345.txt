Well, it can/could be done, as per the pic in the first post of the finding comets thread https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ormal-space-close-to-them.350586/post-5486213.

I suppose the question is -is it still possible to drop in on comets in this way? Not been obfuscated/“corrected”?
If so then it should be consistently repeatable, unless there really is an RNG element involved....

Perhaps this is just a Horizons thing? anyone able to do it in Odyssey?
