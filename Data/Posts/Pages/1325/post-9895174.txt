Welcome!

“8th moon of an unnamed GG” is Lyta Crane’s “info” in the Codex about TDW stealth station (nothing to do with Raxxla). IMHO it’s hogwash and a red herring (read the codex description of her reliability).
Edit: and FDev response to a question by @Rochester suggested it may not be in game at present; perhaps there’s a storyline that we need to trigger, or maybe the whole thing is hogwash/fluff...

As for area of search, make up your own mind. It’s a “personal journey” that we all must make. I’ve searched extensively in Sol and not found anything, but then not found anything anywhere else either!

Whatever Raxxla is it’s been in-game since before Horizons so may not be a landable planet/moon. Might be a POI, a USS, even disguised as a comet (my current hypothesis)....

I have been doing a lot of thinking about this as well....


The dark Wheel (a loop in space?)


Elite (prev game) insinuated you needed to loop a spicific system 7-9 jumps before heading to the system with the gate.


My thought, the "Dark Wheel" is a journey or a rite of passage that unlocks the being able to access Raxxla.

I've also noted that Raxxla may or may not be in the system where we can find it. (Possibly due to this 'loop' or seasonal.)


Though I did find some amazing locations with an 8th moon, one is literally the 8th not 'H' but shows as 8. And the system it's in is... vastly un-expected, especially within the bubble.
