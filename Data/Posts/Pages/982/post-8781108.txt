The only thing that caught my eye was reference to a 'Child' in the text logs, and that this was the only Gen ship log that mentioned that out of the ones currently found.

I have been wondering this also. Why are they posting these now when they were found in the last few years? I'm putting it down to the Horizons fold and they are giving the newer Horizon players a chance to see these ships.
