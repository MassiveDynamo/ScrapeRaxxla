Nothing new to reveal here...

But, I've poured through Drew Wagnar's videos on Raxxla, and his hours of "waffling" (his word choice, not mine) can be distilled down to a couple key points:

1) The writers (including Drew personally) have ZERO CLUE about Raxxla; they were SPECIFICALLY BARRED from learning anything about it, or writing about it.
2) He is the one to theorize that it's got to be somewhere in "The Bubble", given the tech level of 1000 years ago before the events of Elite Dangerous.

Now, the problem with his theory...is that in a whole 1000 lightyear radius from Sol, every star system that CAN be explored HAS been explored...all done YEARS AGO! SO, assuming his theory is correct, combined with process of elimination, it'd only exist in one of the permit-locked systems that is SPECIFICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to acquire the Permit for (such as Witch's Reach). And if this is all correct and true, then we shouldn't even BOTHER trying to find Raxxla. That would explain the futility behind the search, and how Frontier can get away with saying "Yeah Raxxla is in the game" while also deliberately preventing players from finding it...as finding it is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
