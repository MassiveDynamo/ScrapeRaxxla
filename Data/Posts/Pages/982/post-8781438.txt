Theyve mentioned doing a tour of the gen ships a couple times, I assumed on a LS but the Twitter is it, so it seems.

However, as this is the tinfoil thread, it may suggest they have a ton of new stuff in or coming and its kind of a 'sale' of old stock to get people in and generate interest or it fits in with the new stuff more, more lore coming and connections being made.
