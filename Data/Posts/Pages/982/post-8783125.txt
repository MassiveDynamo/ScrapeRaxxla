The theory that Raxxla is located within the bubble is not Drew Wagar’s alone!

Moreover we have the rumour that MB said at a closed meeting that the system in which Raxxla is located was visited by someone who didn’t notice it!
So:
This rumour is untrue OR
IF it is true then:
Raxxla was not within sensor detection range at that time & so was not observed (either short/intermediate range scanner, or it is far away from the system entry point)
OR
Raxxla is a/in/on a permit-locked body (e.g. Triton in Sol system)

Those two are the strongest choices to this CMDR. Some hapless CMDR in the early days had a short range discovery scanner and honked the system only to reveal the star and the rock ring. Raxxla was out of range.

If it is in a permit locked system, said CMDR would have had to have visited it prior to it being locked. Which would narrow down which system it could be.

But even after this rumour was apparently "confirmed," I'm still not sure I believe it.
