And to add, I actually first mapped on the way between LP & CSN and Ive spent some time at the mysteries in the Col sector and got quite a few more, some in places I never expected where I left a few for others at as well. hint, 'cups' constellation...
And here, imo, one must mention that in general case "first discovered" or "first mapped" tag means nothing in the domain of mystery hunting. May be I'm wrong, but the presence of this tags means only that someone have performed a fly-by, may be even have mapped this particular body for some unknown goal - credits, the tag itself? I suppose that only few commanders pay real attention to the possible content of a particular body - and that's not mentioning that the extended information supplied nowadays by FSS/DSS was not available from the very beginning. Plus, as we know most of planetary POI's are not visible in the left panel even in proximity (after DSS) - one must check the body itself - head looks - or do exit/re-enter supercruise procedure in order to make them appear on the left panel display. And in fact that do not applicable exclusively to planetary POI's - I've observed recently the same behavior from space objects in Colonia.
