So.....Crater?

Yes it went something like this, tinfoil warning:

During the newsflash stream and then during the LS there were certain objects in view.
On the LS table from left to right was a Cactus, a Space Station, a red stone (I think) and then 3 cups with DW2 logo displayed.

Chukchan can be linked to Mexico = Cactus
Space Staion = GalNet Article In Cactus system
Red Stone = The stones
3 Cups - ? Constellation? Crater? Where is that, here! Between here and Chukchan! That could mean something....

So while others were testing the line from CSN I was hopping about far above the plane and one of them has 3 molten Metal rich bodies, 1 close to the Star and then the last 2 in the system, unusual, and its an A star. the coincidences just lined up.....or I missed it as nothing found....then Bruce said all locations have been found so that was that.

You can see why I dont post my wilder theories now, coz theyre super tinfoil
