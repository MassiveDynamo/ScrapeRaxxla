As some one who is participating in both the Potato Hunt and the Glorious HIP event, I can say, with firsthand knowledge, that all of the systems with a 1,000ly radius of Sol have NOT been discovered or explored. My last trip out HIP Hunting, I tagged two virgin systems less than 600ly's from Sol and two other systems where only the star had been discovered. Space is big...just 'cause it's close doesn't mean it's been looked at.
