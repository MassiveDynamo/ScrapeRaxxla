Context please?

As far as I am aware this relates to ‘proposed’ content not actual.

Dark systems it seems were effectively originally brown dwarf stars, these are all now visible in the galaxy map, so evidently FD dropped this very elegant and imaginative content, favouring a more simplistic design.

At best it hints to how ‘mysteries’ may have initially been discovered in game, if ever actually worked upon it may have crossed over into the game actual.

Many clues, such as listening posts etc tend to originate in uninhabited systems, but not all. Ultimately it doesn’t reveal anything, only begs more questions - about how the game was made, what did / didn’t make the grade.

DB stated once “we got it wrong” stating that Cmdrs were meant not to grind but ‘follow the missions’. I believe such ramblings never related to the actual game, only the concept inside David’s head.
