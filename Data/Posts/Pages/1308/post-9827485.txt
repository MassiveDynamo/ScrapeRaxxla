The Quest To Find Raxxla - Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth.

This ship log will be used to document the assumptions, facts, theories and efforts surrounding Raxxla, with the ultimate goal of locating Raxxla. All commanders willing to join are most welcome. If no new entries are made by me for a period of 2 weeks, you must assume that I have been eliminated by the Dark Wheel, swallowed by the abyss, or found Raxxla and have gone there. I hope for the latter (but will probably send pretty postcards).


A planet in another galaxy? with an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes. The Dark Wheel found it (and lost it?), and will keep it's location secret at all costs.



Please note that the missions listed, are no longer offered. AndyJ gave a great account here in post.
Also confirmed by FD here:



Public FD Raxxla statements:
ED Beyond - Chapter Four 3.3 brought more data about Raxxla via the Codex.

could the dark wheel missions have stopped appearing because TDW was successful in decrypting the Trinkets or SAP-8s? Perhaps they found Raxxla (again)?
