But why cant we find either???
because according to the old ancient FD tradition, since the time when humanity found an artifact on Mars, these things are bugged

a few hours ago I looked at the report of the dataminers (imperial intelligence agents), they also do not see Raxxla, except for a few variations of the codex and several carriers with similar names
