because according to the old ancient FD tradition, since the time when humanity found an artifact on Mars, these things are bugged

a few hours ago I looked at the report of the dataminers (imperial intelligence agents), they also do not see Raxxla, except for a few variations of the codex and several carriers with similar names
FD are too clever to implement Raxxla so it could be datamined.
I think it will be only instantiated from the server after you find the Omphalos Rift to jump to it!
