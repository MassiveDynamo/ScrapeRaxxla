Faraway isn't really a hyperspace technology. It's a network of stations that helps guide the jump. Jumping outside Faraway in a standard ship was dangerous "Jump on your own through hyperspace, across more than half a light year, and you'll be lucky to make the same Universe, let alone your destination."

At the time of Elite the Faraway network is already obsolete, but it is likely that it covered the same galaxy maps as we have in that game. Those maps are the GalCop trading network. They cover only GalCop systems, because we fly on a GalCop licence.
We don't know if the Federation and the Empire had a similar system to the Faraway. It's fully possible that they did not have anything like that. GalCops success may be due to them allowing independent pilots and giving them a relatively safe navigation system.

We do know that GalCop certified pilots could get trained in 'Full jump navigation', after they reached Elite status. This would presumably allow them to navigate freely, outside the GalCop network. It could be the reason Alex Ryder had to become Elite, to find Raxxla.

Not GalCop licence now though, surely! Wasn’t that for the original 1984 game...It’s now a PF licence.
