RE: Thargoid reputation / hidden rankings.

Just posted this on TTW thread but copying relevant bit here for posterity as been discussed many times here. From this 'The Pilot' video, just after 19.00m (the whole vid is worth watching though, a good Q&A overall with @Arthur Tolmie Lead Community Manager for Frontier Elite)






So he doesnt say 'No', he says 'I dont know'. I find it strange that he wouldn't know / be informed if it was true and was happening or being introduced, I would assume he would at least be told as its a Q we the players have asked many times over and is something some of us are hoping for. Then he could have said 'I cant say' or similar and we could have kept guessing.

So its not solid proof either way but it is the first public statement from Frontier or a CM that we do have on the subject so putting it here for the record.

CMs aren’t part of the development team, they’re part of marketing; they’re the front desk face of FD.
Their job is to interface with the customers, keep them interested, and answer their questions where feasible.
If a CM doesn’t know something and can’t be bothered to ask those who do then they’re not doing their job!

(I’m grumpy!
I had insomnia last night,
awake from 3 till at least 5,
my DIY is going badly and I’ve now got time pressure to finish it,
the release of Odyssey Alpha is delayed until this afternoon,
AND I STILL CAN’T REACH MY SHIP’S COFFEE MACHINE!!!)

Edit: p.s. I haven’t watched the vid, just going by what was reported above from it.
