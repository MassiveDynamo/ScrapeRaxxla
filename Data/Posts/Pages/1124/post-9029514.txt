CMs aren’t part of the development team, they’re part of marketing; they’re the front desk face of FD.
Their job is to interface with the customers, keep them interested, and answer their questions where feasible.
If a CM doesn’t know something and can’t be bothered to ask those who do then they’re not doing their job!

(I had insomnia last night,
awake from 3 till at least 5,
my DIY is going badly and I’ve now got time pressure to finish it,
the release of Odyssey Alpha is delayed until this afternoon,
AND I STILL CAN’T REACH MY SHIP’S COFFEE MACHINE!!!)

At risk of poking the papa bear but a CM who doesn't want to have to talk about something via plausible denial might not want to ask about certain things...
