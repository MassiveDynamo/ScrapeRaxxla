Are only the hyperdictions considered Encounters?

Yes only hyperdictions are counted there. Im still not sure how that got extrapolated to a 'ranking' with the Thargs, think that was someone claiming a private chat on discord with a dev, so put your own value of 'proof' on that. As usual no official word from Frontier either way to confirm or deny but thats partly because theyd need a whole new CM team to answer all the myths and lies and deliberate misinformation or trolling or plain false memory that gets spread around as 'true'.

It used to be that 'a man in a pub told me' was viewed as worthless and a joke, but saying the same about someone on the internet is taken as proof in certain quarters. Probably a mix of Fox Mulder 'I want to believe' and people wanting to be 'first' with the info driving it, or just the fact its written by the man in the pub rather than said gives it more credibility for some reason. Ofc the best way is to do a YT video, they are taken as pure fact usually.

Im not sure what went wrong with the internet. Most of us over 40 can remember a time before the internet, and when we heard about it coming we thought it would be awesome, it would be Encylopedia Britannica and more online and easy to find, all the sum of human history and knowledge and discoveries and sharing science across the world, it would lead to awesome new discoveries and collaboration to make giant leaps forward, interacting with people you would never get a chance to meet in real life, dictatorships would fall due to access to outside information.....instead 99% of it is and most of the rest is photos of peoples food or cats or conspiracy theorists and worse.
