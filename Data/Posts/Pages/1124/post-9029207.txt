Coriolis, has to be, the original dark wheel novella has one on the cover
That may be the Dark Wheel’s stealthy station, hence the name.

There is a hint that TDW may, or may not, be the route to finding Raxxla but that may also be obfuscation.

I still think Raxxla is a Guardian Ark ship. I suspect they visited Mars, left the artefact there, and have been guiding human development as an anti-Thargoid tactic. They’re behind the Pilot’s Federation, witness their triangular/hexagonal glyphs that appear very briefly on the ship’s nav panel (may need to be video’d & slowed down to see, they used to appear for much longer but that sequence was speeded up in one of the game updates-it’s in the change notes as I mentioned a few days ago!). That’s my theory about the metagame, what is my very own, dinosaurs are small at one end, very big in the middle, then small at the other end.

Oops, sorry! Mixing my theories again!
