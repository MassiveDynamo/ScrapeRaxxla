RE: Thargoid reputation / hidden rankings.

Just posted this on TTW thread but copying relevant bit here for posterity as been discussed many times here. From this 'The Pilot' video, just after 19.00m (the whole vid is worth watching though, a good Q&A overall with @Arthur Tolmie Lead Community Manager for Frontier Elite)






So he doesnt say 'No', he says 'I dont know'. I find it strange that he wouldn't know / be informed if it was true and was happening or being introduced, I would assume he would at least be told as its a Q we the players have asked many times over and is something some of us are hoping for. Then he could have said 'I cant say' or similar and we could have kept guessing.

So its not solid proof either way but it is the first public statement from Frontier or a CM that we do have on the subject so putting it here for the record.

I'm actually not that surprised as the turnover rate of CMs since I started playing has been pretty high imo. Honestly, I'd bet a fair amount of cmdrs know significantly more than the CMs. I'd believe something @Ian Doncaster would tell me over one of the CMs at this point. He at least answers my questions lol
