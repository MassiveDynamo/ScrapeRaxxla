Possibly. We never found Zurara until its location was spelt out for us, though some people were extremely close to its system.

I’m now trying to get into the habit of scanning through the nav panel list of nearby systems on every jump while the scanner is looking at the star. If there’s an unusual name outside the human bubble then it would be worth a visit, or at least a check on EDSM.

I really wish that Frontier had gone with hiding everything on the galaxy map. Always seems strange to me for Universal Cartographics to know the precise location of every star in the galaxy. Would have been really cool for the galaxy to slowly be revealed as you come within range of the stars that way there'd always be a bit of mystery to every voyage.
