Marcos has bee triple elite since the dawn of time. I don't think it matters. Just Elite, should do.
As long as you have the Founders permit you aren't locked of from anything, I think.

Raxxla has supposedly been in the game all the time, so we are not looking for complex game mechanics. The may of course put in a quest a some point, that requires triple or quadruple Elite. I don't think it's in the game, at the moment. I can't see any signs of a 'secret' mission path.

I believe Raxxla is either in a completely arbitrary location with not logical way to locate or it's a meta-puzzle. Something that has to be decoded from lore, mission texts or names.

Thanks, thought Macros was triple, but couldn’t spot in his signature. I’m double & don’t think I’ve ever been offered one of the missions.
Yes, Raxxla has been in-game from the outset, but so has SD hasn’t it? So i assume the missions may have been in from the outset too. It has always seemed a bit strange that MB said there will be no clues if the DW missions were clues, so maybe they were only window dressing; perhaps representing the DW’s attempts to relocate Raxxla, but not really relevant to our search. That could explain why they’ve been withdrawn, FD probably don’t want to repeat the salt thrown around after the Salomé event.
