Is anyone here triple elite? Just wanted to confirm that the SD Dark Wheel missions have disappeared entirely, & not just become reserved for triple elites.

Marcos has bee triple elite since the dawn of time. I don't think it matters. Just Elite, should do.
As long as you have the Founders permit you aren't locked of from anything, I think.

Raxxla has supposedly been in the game all the time, so we are not looking for complex game mechanics. The may of course put in a quest a some point, that requires triple or quadruple Elite. I don't think it's in the game, at the moment. I can't see any signs of a 'secret' mission path.

I believe Raxxla is either in a completely arbitrary location with not logical way to locate or it's a meta-puzzle. Something that has to be decoded from lore, mission texts or names.
