I really wish that Frontier had gone with hiding everything on the galaxy map. Always seems strange to me for Universal Cartographics to know the precise location of every star in the galaxy. Would have been really cool for the galaxy to slowly be revealed as you come within range of the stars that way there'd always be a bit of mystery to every voyage.

Actually, there are interesting options there.

The current thinking is that the galaxy might be far bigger than originally thought, extending well past the current 'outside' spiral arms. FD could (with a little work) add these to the game as above, not visible on the Galaxy Map until someone has scanned and sold the data.

It would add some mystery to the game, and still be consistent with current galactic knowledge (we don't really know much about what's out there).
