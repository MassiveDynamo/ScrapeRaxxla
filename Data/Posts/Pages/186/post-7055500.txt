Since a rogue planet would not have a 'star class', I'm gonna start scanning the galaxy map with all star classes disabled. That is, until we find a good enough lead. Does anyone have a list (or can compile one) of all the locations mentioned in the book(s)?

Here’s a link to The Dark Wheel, Holdstock’s original source for Raxxla that cme as a booklet with the original game.
