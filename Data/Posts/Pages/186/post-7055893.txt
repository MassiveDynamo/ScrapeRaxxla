I really wish that Frontier had gone with hiding everything on the galaxy map. Always seems strange to me for Universal Cartographics to know the precise location of every star in the galaxy. Would have been really cool for the galaxy to slowly be revealed as you come within range of the stars that way there'd always be a bit of mystery to every voyage.

It would have been a nice touch perhaps. But we already have radio telescopes capable of revealing RL stars orbiting SagA* , so maybe in 34th Century the technology has advanced to the point where all system positions are known? So in-game we are mapping them rather than discovering them, but then we are going to add mapping in ch4.....
