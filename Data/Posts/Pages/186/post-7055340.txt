My heart breaks at the possibility of finding something like that. The chances are unfathomable.

Possibly. We never found Zurara until its location was spelt out for us, though some people were extremely close to its system.

I’m now trying to get into the habit of scanning through the nav panel list of nearby systems on every jump while the scanner is looking at the star. If there’s an unusual name outside the human bubble then it would be worth a visit, or at least a check on EDSM.
