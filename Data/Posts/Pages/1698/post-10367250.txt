Yes it’s difficult to assess how far to take one particular investigation if the author/s have utilised various source material. I agree the Codex ought to point the way.

Much of the metaphorical information is interpretational at best, given the expansive and interchangeable levels of historical references in game.

That data in the codex which can be interpreted, with a certain level of certainty is contrary to the Miltonian hypothesis. Again this is why we challenge our assumptions, what is true and what is not?

There ought therefore be some keystone which advocates a particular location or direction, which we have not yet identified.

Logically I feel it’s tied physically to the book Elite Legacy and the system Artemis. My gut tells me to look below the Lost Realms zone, whereas my mind wants to follow the logic attributed to the Miltonian model!

There is evidently a cross-over of Milton, Holdstock and North mythology. The cosmological model I believe is a combination of all these.
