Good question! Only FD know the answers!

As I understand it the Pendent World in Milton was the Earth, surrounded by several spheres which carried the planets, sun and background stars. Paradise/Garden of Eden was on Earth in The East, connected to the Empyrean (Heaven) via a retractable golden ladder. The implication IMO is that MB was using it to represent Raxxla (i.e. Raxxla is Paradise??)





EDIT: but what the heck, it's poetry!!

I did get the chance to play for an hour this afternoon, despite fighting off the need for sleep due to the horrendous thunderstorms we had last night on the South Coast- I was effectively awake from 01:50! Never heard anything like it...should have opened the curtains and enjoyed the light show! The dog &cat didn't seem to mind, but I objected when they wanted to go out at 06:00!

My idea of last night was a rethinking on the meaning of the garden design...the middle panel seems to show a part (highlighted by two lamps) connected to, but off to the right of, a wide "golden chain", while the right panel seems to emphasise this...so perhaps the trees represent the six moons and need to go further into the system (search for gravitational anomalies? Stop & honk frequently?...FSS??). This ties in with an orbital period of a century or more (from the codex -"circulating, in whispers, for centuries") so from Kepler's Law the orbital radius would be 20.76AU/ 10,359ls; 200 years->32.95 AU/ 16,442ls; 300years->43.183 AU/ 21,547ls.

Have flown out from the star past planet 2, honking and dropping at the above distances then carried on...now at 127kls from the star, nothing to report!
