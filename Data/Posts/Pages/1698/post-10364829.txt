Or could just be dot & circle astronomical symbol for star, 3 arcs for its asteroid belt, dotted hexagon for Guardian "thing" hidden in asteroids of planetary ring... it's the Tri-Via crossroads and the 6 black shapes that puzzle me. They could be shadows? There are 6 moons...

I need a further clue to localise it a bit. I've tried flying in the planetary belts (there are two, and they're huge!), in the dark... it's very boring and not a good ending.
