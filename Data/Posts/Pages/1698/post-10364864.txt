I can't see MB making the Raxxla puzzle totally dependent on knowledge of Milton's Paradise Lost. The two clues in Legacy bypass that completely, and are congruent with the codex's Princess clue. So I think the Paradise Lost model was just to get us into the right part of the Milky Way and I'd be cautious about overegging it.

But the PL quotation "fast by hanging in a golden chain. This pendent world, in bigness as a star; Of smallest magnitude close by the moon" is clearly important since FD have made this the finale of the MB Tour. Logically it's relevant to Raxxla, and I'm thinking it's an indication of it's obfuscation...so may mean in an asteroid belt but may not mean it's physically close to a moon. I think it's just using the metaphor of a small star against the size of the full moon to emphasise it's very small! But then it's ambiguous (smallest magnitude is astronomically very bright!), this is why I dislike poetry!
Agreed, there will be other elements which point the way.

The text is as you’ve identified is all about magnitude, distance and size.

Milton was describing how Satan sees our universe from a vast distance, and that it was insignificantly tiny, in comparison to the size of the vastness and brilliance of Empyrean (the only source of light). Yet brilliant in itself, it’s uniqueness, as if like a distant star seen from Earth in comparison to the brightness and relative size of our moon - as if from the perspective of an astronomer at that time.

The textual description pops up at least three time in PL and is a physical description of the exact location of Paradise in the cosmos.

So as a clue in game, I am more inclined to perceive Raxxla ought to be a system just under the Empyrean, and very close relatively to one of the Empyrean walls. I think Starship One was another spacial clue for this general area.
