I can't see MB making the Raxxla puzzle totally dependent on knowledge of Milton's Paradise Lost. The two clues in Legacy bypass that completely, and are congruent with the codex's Princess clue. So I think the Paradise Lost model was just to get us into the right part of the Milky Way and I'd be cautious about overegging it.

But the PL quotation "fast by hanging in a golden chain. This pendent world, in bigness as a star; Of smallest magnitude close by the moon" is clearly important since FD have made this the finale of the MB Tour. Logically it's relevant to Raxxla, and I'm thinking it's an indication of it's obfuscation...so may mean in an asteroid belt but may not mean it's physically close to a moon. I think it's just using the metaphor of a small star against the size of the full moon to emphasise it's very small! But then it's ambiguous (smallest magnitude is astronomically very bright!), this is why I dislike poetry!
So, this pendent world. What is it?
Most text analyses seem to think it represents the entire universe, in the traditional geocentric sense. It does also fit with the earth, as it's basically the only thing next to the moon.

What Milton meant doesn't matter, but how have FD interpreted the sentence?
You don't have to go very far, for the earth to be as dim as as a smal magnitude star. If we are talking about the entire milky way, we have to be really far out.
It could of course also be Sol the devil is looking at, but that makes the moon reference a bit strange.
