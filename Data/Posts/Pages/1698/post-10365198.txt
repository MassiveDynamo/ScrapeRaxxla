Have spent a happy boring couple of hours after lunch travelling from pole of planet to each moon & back, dropping out of SC at the planet and each moon, honking at halfway point on my way to moons a, c & e.

Anybody got any ideas of other possible interpretations for the logo?
Can you share the system and planet you're investigating?
