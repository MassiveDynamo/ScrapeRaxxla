I can't see MB making the Raxxla puzzle totally dependent on knowledge of Milton's Paradise Lost. The two clues in Legacy bypass that completely, and are congruent with the codex's Princess clue. So I think the Paradise Lost model was just to get us into the right part of the Milky Way and I'd be cautious about overegging it.

But the PL quotation "fast by hanging in a golden chain. This pendent world, in bigness as a star; Of smallest magnitude close by the moon" is clearly important since FD have made this the finale of the MB Tour. Logically it's relevant to Raxxla, and I'm thinking it's an indication of it's obfuscation...so may mean in an asteroid belt but may not mean it's physically close to a moon. I think it's just using the metaphor of a small star against the size of the full moon to emphasise it's very small! But then it's ambiguous (smallest magnitude is astronomically very bright!), this is why I dislike poetry!
