Yep, but given MB's (or was it DB's?) statement that they'd only implemented one galaxy then I think it just adds to the lore/fluff...

Still pondering & trying to get more information from the garden and that dam logo!!

Ya i dont discount it as it is visible and the Magellanic clouds are so close as to be a part of our galaxy…. Wouldnt be surprised if there were parts of the “galaxy” that were generated but invisible and not accessible to us yet either.

As far as the logo goes - i think i like it as a yantra . With the 33 dashes symbolizing the 33 gods … the wheel of samsara cycle of rebirth and death with its three parts darma arthra and kama - with the central point moksha … enlightenment… freeing us from they cycle of death.

Raxxla is the EDDQD.
