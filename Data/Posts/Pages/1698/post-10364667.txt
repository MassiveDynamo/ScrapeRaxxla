I agree the sun dragon novel didnt seem to have any connection to elite. However - if i remember right - the indication in the tau ceti missions that a rouge planet from the tarantula nebula ( sun dragon delivery system) swung by tau ceti killing off an advanced civilization. I like it for several reasons - Tau ceti being the first mention of raxxla. The Magellanic clouds and raxxla possibly being a rogue planet ( a common speculation) …. Even with the holdstock book tour of the galaxy -they were going to the Magellanic clouds…. But ya - nothing terribly concrete to work with. Hmmm giving me some ideas …
Yep, but given MB's (or was it DB's?) statement that they'd only implemented one galaxy then I think it just adds to the lore/fluff...

Still pondering & trying to get more information from the garden and that dam logo!!
