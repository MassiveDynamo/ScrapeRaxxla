@Rochester : depends entirely on how well MB wanted to comply with Milton's prose when setting the location of Raxxla, and how he interpreted things.

Edit: logically, if MB was trying to fully comply with Milton's Paradise Lost, then Paradise (Raxxla) would be somewhere on Earth.

My own hypothesis, derived from all the clues we've been given, is that MB set up the PL cosmology as a general pointer to the border of Alliance space (while also giving us a direct clue in Legacy to look in Alliance space), but I'm not convinced that the Raxxla system is definitely suspended below the floor of the Empyrean region. It's a possibility & since the garden of Eden was on the Earth I investigated some possibilities on/near the line between Sol and Gateway (IMO the most likely "heaven's gate") or Wolf 294 ( which seems to be a better vertical alignment with Sol below the floor of the Empyrean). Gateway is, I think, near the centre of that floor and that ties in with the usual picture of the PL cosmology; but Milton said explicitly that Heaven's Gate was on the East side of the Empyrean.

But when all's said and done the puzzle should be soluble from information given within the game, including the codex. I'm loath to think that MB would rely entirely on knowledge of external sources such as Milton's Paradise Lost when setting the puzzle. I think that's just additional flavour.
