SPOILER: JORKI'S PETUNIA THEORY

















































































Why Petunias? Why not! the answer to life, the universe, and everything (ergo including Raxxla) is 42!

Your location, apart from being in the correct location in accordance with ‘Fall’ - one of the potential walls of the Empyrean, is also right next to Norse system ‘Urdarbrunnr’ the Meeting Place Of The Gods, the fountain or well of Urd (fate).

“The third root of the ash is in heaven, and beneath it is the most sacred fountain of Urd. Here the gods have their doomstead. The Aesir ride hither every day over Bifrost, which is also called Aesir-bridge.” - Gylfaginning.

We have most clearly identified the realm of the Empyrean. If the Miltonian model is being followed, as we’ve postulated, Raxxla ought to hang from the wall of the Empyrean… just on the out-rim of Chaos.

However, the Tour of Brookes, cannot be ignored as an important and intentional clue from FD. In my opinion it spatially advocates the importance of Artemis and that of the significance of the Lost Realms zone.

This generates a spacial disparity between heaven and hell, as it draws too much focus upon the underworld, not of heaven.

This in my opinion raises too many questions: about how Artemis might be significant:

Does it hold some physical clue in itself - which points us towards the Empyrean; there certainly is a spatial alignment that points upwards towards the Morrigans, but there must be something more to it?

Are the tours drawing attention to the Lost Realms zone; if so why; they obviously are referenced in the Codex - why; do they simply identify the existence of the cosmological model, or do they actually hold Raxxla?

I do speculate that the mystery of Starship One was a narrative marker, identifying the area of the Empyrean.
