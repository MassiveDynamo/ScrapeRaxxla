I kept chasing it after dropping out of sc and eventually it stopped. I had to go about 70km to get to it but it worked

sweet, gonna try that later!

Edit: when you say 70KM, your saying you only get about 70km away before you can start to catch up? wow... evey attempt I made it was over 150km away within like 30 secs and I just gave up, even the time it smashed into me lmao
