Tbh i wasnt paying attention i was on here and noticed it was getting closer instead of further

LOL so i finally made it there, but only after some extreme spamming of the boost button lol

But whats funny, is I couldnt get there until I managed to select the instalation out of SC, once I did that, it seems eventually it stopped and I was able too catch up... the funny part is, if you see the pic im posting here, the instalation stopped and I was catching up, but the yellow poi marker kept going as if the station was still moving... one was going down, the other up, bahaha was quite confusing for a few min, wasnt even sure I was actually catching it....

But yea other than that, wasnt much there just interesting too look at, scans gave back nothing, couldnt find the sign with the guys name on it I found in the other guys post, but meh....
