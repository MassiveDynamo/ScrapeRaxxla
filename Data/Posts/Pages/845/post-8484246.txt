oh lord, lmfao... my boost speed is like 292 hahaha.... guess my engineering isnt as good as I thought haha

Still, we should be instantcing with it, not chasing it like a rabbit on a dog track lmfao....

But keep us posted if you manage to learn anything lmao.... the img I found online of the installation shows some interesting things like a sign with them name of one of the first know astro-physisits I think... or somthing like that, beings with a T is all i remember off hand... having trouble locating the link i found yesterday with the information and pics, like i said, it was another language forum, I was pretty deep into google at that point lmao

Im just curious if it has anything to do with Raxxla or information we should know for general knowledge, as Tionisla was a main part of the raxxla story in the original story about having to go in a circle and use Tionisla as the last jump point to the "gteway"; and for that system to have an installation "zeta cass" in it, and zeta cass is a good guess for the jewel in the toast... idk, I need to buy more tin foil, ran out last night.. lmfao
