Edit: when you say 70KM, your saying you only get about 70km away before you can start to catch up? wow... evey attempt I made it was over 150km away within like 30 secs and I just gave up, even the time it smashed into me lmao
Tbh i wasnt paying attention i was on here and noticed it was getting closer instead of further
