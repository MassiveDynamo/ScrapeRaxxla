On large rings you have to launch probe around planet to use it's gravity assist
OK I'll have a play - never had any trouble with other rings but this one seems extreme. & for clarity I should have said C ring not B.
(there are several planets between the B & C rings, and was considering whether jumping between the rings was some part of this search but expect that is another dead end)
