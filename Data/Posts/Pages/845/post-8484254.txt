what platform r u on if you dont mind telling us... ? I use Xbox, but just curious if your having the same issue on another platform.... I told Fdev is wa happening on PC, lmfao but i didnt even log into my steam profile and check hahaha becuase it would ruin my plans...

I restarted my PC profile a few weeks ago becuase it was kinda poopoo to begin with and I just wanted to change strategies... A thought had occured to me about the Pilots federation and their locked systems after you leave them...

WELL, I decided for my pc profile, im going to try and abtain elite status without leaving the pilots federation... obv it would have to be trade or NPC combat, but technically not impossible. I want too see if anything happens or if there is somthing hidden in one of their systems, going too fully FSS them and fly around them and out into no where in them, and just see whats up in them....



THATS IT!! lmfao thats almost identical to an img I saw of it, and started my whole thing on this!! lmfao thats awsome that you got that!!!
