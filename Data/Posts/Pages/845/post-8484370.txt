just found this as well... bit strange... lit up just above a cargo bay with a long extrusion....

Meh, i think thats it... nothing else of note as side from an extreme allied police force presence... just about every ship or every other ship is allied police

Anywho.. im off... back to Vapreet, trying too ally with The Black Fleet, get a permit from them, see where that leads....
