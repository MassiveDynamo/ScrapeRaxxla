We aren't quite there yet. Our first ship is gifted to us by a mysterious benefactor(a friend). They are keeping an eye on us.

If we prove our self, they(possibly The Dark Wheel) might contact us again.

I compare this to Rafe Zetter making that cobra 3 available to Jason to have been kinda similar to our gifted ship from a mysterious friend. Rafe was awful mysterious. Then he made Jason earn elite. It fits.
