Blunt question: Does anyone know whether DB is as mason? There are several names in the game that only make sense to a mason. So if he is a member there is a possibility the riddle is based on masonic symbolism.

E.g.: Rift/Abss. There is a certain part in an A.:A.: rite where the candidate is saved from an abyss/rift by „a friend“.
