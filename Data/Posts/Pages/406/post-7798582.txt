I found a mildly interesting system.

G 180-18

It's in Corona Borealis, close to Eta and Rho
It has a station called Hale Port, controlled by a Faction called Helix

Corona Borealis is the wedding crown with jewels.
Hale Ports is an anagram of Astrophel. There are four Hale Ports in ED. (LHS 1050, LHS 112, Yukait and G 180-18).
Helix is of course a spiral.

Not much, but if someone needs something to do, it's there.

Excellent find. What about triangulation of those systems, anything there?
