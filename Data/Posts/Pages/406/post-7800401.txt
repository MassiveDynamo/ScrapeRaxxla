misinformation:

These are unconfirmed statements, we will assume they are false until we get sources for them. X Someone honked the system but didn't scan it. This rumor states a source as Elitecon (oldest citation) and a Dj Truthsayer video (with no link provided) X Decyphering the word “RAXXLA” using “HEXEDI” as a key results “KWATIS”. Nothing has been found there and it’s assumed just a coincidence at this stage. X CMDR FLAVIUS AQUILI stated he had found Raxxla and gave some coordinates, @[PC] 100.RUB (AXI) surveyed around said coordinates and in the system thoroughly and found nothing of interest. It’s now marked as deliberate disinformation
