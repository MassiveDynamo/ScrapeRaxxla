I don't see any reason why not.

Theory:
1) David Braben states "It's in the game and FDev knows where it is."
2) Michael Brooks states "No clues".
3) It has to be in the bubble, a distance reachable by a Sidewinder, given old Jump Drive range in the 1984 game, and the Dark Wheel Lore.
4) Alec Ryder was killed outside of either Lave or Leesti and knew of Raxxla, as he told his son 18 minutes before an assassian blew up his ship and ejecting his son in an escape pod.
5) Alex Ryder was not Elite, as it is suspected that those of the Dark Wheel only admits those who are, and Alec was not a member, but only knew about them.

That's all I have so far, and there are hundreds of theories on the location, but I believe it is in the bubble, close to Earth.
