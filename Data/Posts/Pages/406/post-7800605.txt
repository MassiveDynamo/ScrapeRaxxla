OLT3 status update:

In the 30 inhabited systems within 20Ly of Shinrarta Dezhra there's 162 factions. I'm now allied with 54 factions that has been given beneficiary missions by TDW. 82 of the 162 have been given non-beneficiary missions by TDW. There's a small overlap of factions given both kind of missions, giving the impression that TDW's not really knowing what they're doing.

That leaves me about 30 more factions I potentially need to be Allied with. Still a fair amount of work, fortunately I don't start from scratch (Neutral) with all of them, since I've been spending credits on donation missions every time I've seen one for factions I'm not yet allied with.

Haven't seen much to Eravarenth, but I'm pretty that TDW have zero love for Nuenets Blue Crew.
