We aren't quite there yet. Our first ship is gifted to us by a mysterious benefactor(a friend). They are keeping an eye on us.

If we prove our self, they(possibly The Dark Wheel) might contact us again.

The letter
SPOILER
I know of another occasion when the friend contacts us.
Usually i don't do a lot of combat but back in January I completed a lot of 'kill pirate' missions in one system in order to gain combat elite rank (unfortunately can't remember where exactly, but it was no special faction like DW or similar). Killed hundreds of pirates of one anarchy faction which made me a hostile commander to them. I completed even more kill pirate missions and suddenly got a message from the hostile faction. They told me that its enough and that they start sending out agents to hunt me down. Soon after that another message appeared, from our 'friend' , who told me how I could get rid of those agents. Had to scan something on a planetary outpost nearby (something common like generator or turret or similar, but again cannot remember exactly). After the scan the agents disappeared. Happened two times.
I am wondering if the outcome is different if we get hostile to Dark Wheel or Pilots Federation Local Branch? It is on my todo list but it is quite hard to get hostile to those factions.
