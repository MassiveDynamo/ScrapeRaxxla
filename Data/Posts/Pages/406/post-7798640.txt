Excellent find. What about triangulation of those systems, anything there?
I haven't looked at it much. I'm currently experimenting with alignments in the Lave cluster (Galaxy 1, the mother of all Galaxies in Elite).

If you skip LHS 112, you get a plane that is very close to Sol and probably intersecting Tau Ceti. I haven't calculated the distances, but I think Tau Ceti is about a quarter of an ly of the plane. UV Ceti looks spot on.
