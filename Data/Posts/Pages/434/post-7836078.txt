Yeah I don’t think it is either but it’s strange how the ship logs are similar to the story, still this little adventure had me thinking all day about it
Oh and there is no information about why the ship is there etc, and there is nothing online about the tip off missions I got for that location, from what I’ve seen I’m the first one to receive one to that location with the description key
It's the 2nd ship that interests me most. You never said what system it was in
