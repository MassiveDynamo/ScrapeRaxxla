Is/has anyone looked into Daurtu Jet Comms PLC as a possible Raxxla/DW link?

When Galnet released the story that Romero's dreams are linked to Jasmina Halseys visions (https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/5ce65512b22e87324244c4d5 ), I decided to look back into older Galnet articles regarding Halsey's disappearance. During the Search for Starship One, a minor faction called "Daurtu Jet Comms" competed with the Federation in a community goal for lost debris. According to that article,

"In a strange turn of events, an organisation by the name of Daurtu Jet Comms PLC has also announced its intention to search for the missing presidential vessel. Virtually nothing is known about Daurtu Jet Comms PLC, but the fact that it is offering even larger rewards than the Federation may convince pilots to lend the organisation their support. "
(https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/56a9ec0b9657ba9647be67bd )

So a small faction - who only operate out of one star system (https://eddb.io/faction/21638), of which "virtually nothing" is known about - was willing to pay more than the Federation for clues regarding their former president/mysterious disappearance..

Something seems a bit fishy about that to me.
