I saw this what it is statement myself and have wondered if it's real or not. In the version I saw, it was stated that when DB was asked if Raxxla was in the game, he said something like "That's a silly question, of course it is.........you just don't know what it is".

The author stated however, it was unclear if the WHAT Sentance was a continuation of Raxxla, or in relation to the following question.

If it was in relation to Raxxla, then that would strongly imply its not a moon/planet. So what else could it be?

A star
A black hole
A white hole
A generation ship
A different kind of ship
An astroid

Am I missing anything?

The statement is real, I watched it myself & it should be on the FD youtube site. It came from a livestream hosted by Ed Lewis and DB was one of the speakers, so I suspect it was the 3.4 release stream. Ed started to read out the questions, then got to one about Raxxla and said something like “that question was predictable”. DB responded as you say, but I think DB misheard what Ed said because the bit about “but you don’t know what it is” part seemed to be aimed at Ed ( he looked a little miffed), but it does make sense since we are fairly sure few people in FD are in on the Raxxla secret.

I’ve said for a long time that Raxxla may not be a planet; the original Elite “And Here The Wheel” novella doesn’t seem to be canon for ED, and Drew Wagar’s hyperspace-travelling moon of Lave is most definitely not canon (but good reading!) fan-fiction. The ED version might be a ship, or a derelict station, perhaps a Guardian ark ship, or even a derelict anaconda. We’ll found out when someone stumbles across it (or correctly interprets the clues.....)
