As DB said “you don’t know WHAT Raxxla is!” ...
Aw..
Alternative fact ?

Raxxla quest is tied to TDW.
That's why both are in the Codex. That's why TDW exists in game. That's why there were (are ?) the E/F missions.
And it is well known that Raxxla is... obfuscated in the outer rim and burning on the top/brow/crown of the... MW, that you need some sort of what has been lost will soon be recovered - "map thing".
Work for TDW. Only them. The Codex tells to do so. It's a personal journey.
Imho.
