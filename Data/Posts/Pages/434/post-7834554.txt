After handing in the black box I was greeted with another message telling me to go to a new location, that the data I had received from scanning the bank had brought up a new ‘mysterious discovery” and sent me 900 light years from the bubble where I discovered a new diamond back explorer but this time it had landed but looks like it ran out of power. Strange this is the commanders log reads:
The Hunger is starting to get to me, I've started seeing things. I know the deep space explorers like to tell stories, but these light shows are something else. They almost seem alive, and they are calling to me.
Now it was dark at the time but my SRV’s lights showed a SRV trail that went on for around 200km (not fun) where all of a sudden they vanish. Nothing. I searched around and around for something and there was nothing. No sign of struggle, no message and no ship lading marks. This SRV just vanished.
