Asked the same question a few pages earlier. IIrc the answer was something like Daurtu Jet tried some kind of cover up(?). Have Daurtu still on my list.

Hey thank you (great minds i guess). I flew out there last night and started doing some missions, but I'm still only cordial with them so I'll run some more after work...I'll report back if I pick up anything of-note from them
