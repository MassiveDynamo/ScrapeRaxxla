Remember when we were discussing what ranks you need to reach in order to find Raxxla.
I've been playing for a long time, and I've had an explorer and a few trading elites for a long time. I haven't had a combat one yet.
But the other day I got a combat one.
But for some reason the message came.
1. You received a combat Elite.
2. Since you received three elites, you are awarded a special badge.

I do not really understand what this mark and where to see it.
Maybe this is another step on the way to find Raxxla?
Put in a request to Support to explain it!

Difficult to assess what your issue is, but see below for excellent explanation of what it likely is.
