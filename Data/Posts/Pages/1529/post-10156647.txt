Alioth 5b is presently known as Turner's World. It is an Earth-like that is a 0.3 Earth-masses with a atmospheric pressure 6.93 atmospheres and surface temperature of 310 Kelvin. In fact, most the Earth-likes throughout the Bubble better fit with Guardian worlds than human.
Aye that's a mystery, like i very rarely find any ELW or WW in a G-Star system like Earth, my last small trek into Vulcan to snag beacon 256, registered 36 ELW and 87 WW none of which were in a G system let alone G2
