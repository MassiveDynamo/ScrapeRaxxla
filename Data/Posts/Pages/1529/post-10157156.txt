Most ELWs in the bubble have been terraformed. Natural ELWs are quite rare.

There is a higher density of natural ELWs in the bubble than the rest of the galaxy, but this is mostly for historic reasons.
I am a firm believer in the idea that lessons will keep reappearing until they are learned.

Have you looked at atmospheric pressure on the terraformed Earth-likes? Even Mars has a higher pressure than Earth. What does higher pressure do? Warmer temperature than Earth-standard. It would appear we aren't just terraforming for ourselves. Also, most of Humanity was wiped out at Earth by an incurable plague following World War 3. You don't just go back to trillions in about 1,300 years or so.
