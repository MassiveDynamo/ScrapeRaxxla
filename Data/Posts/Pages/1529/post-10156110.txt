From the Elite Dangerous Knowledge Base (Codex) > Alliance > History:

The crucible in which the Alliance was forged was Alioth, a system so rich in gas and mineral resources that early surveyors considered it as a stellar El Dorado. When the Federation established its colony on Alioth 5b in 2452, they gave the planet the less grandiose name of Fruitcake, as mineral deposits lay in the loamy soil as abundantly as raisins in cake. Later commentators would reflect, bitterly, that the world was well named because 'everyone wanted a piece'.

While it may not be Alioth itself I wouldn't strictly rule it out. Discovery would have happened probably a century or so earlier given how long it would have taken to get there to colonize the system. Further, this would go a long way to explaining all of fighting for control that went on over Alioth (especially given its' distance from the other superpowers).

Also, there are two planets by the name of Discovery in Human space: Arcturus has the first (closest date to actual Raxxla - 8 years afterwards) and the planet Discovery in Exphiay. I think efforts need to be focused on these few systems.
