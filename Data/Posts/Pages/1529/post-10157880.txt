Well i tried visiting a Maelstrom…. Got ganked by thargs in transit. They sniped my framshift drive and slowly ate me… contemplating new strategy…. Maybe will try dropping some occupied escape pods…
Expect to get interdicted at least 5 times from the Star to the Maelstrom, doesn't matter what ship you use as long as it can boost over 500 to ignore that new Glaive that reboots your FSD, ive been using a Cutter for ferreting around but have swapped to a krait 2 for doing the research stuff.
