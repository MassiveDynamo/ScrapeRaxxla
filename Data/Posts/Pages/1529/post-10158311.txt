Remember when we were discussing what ranks you need to reach in order to find Raxxla.
I've been playing for a long time, and I've had an explorer and a few trading elites for a long time. I haven't had a combat one yet.
But the other day I got a combat one.
But for some reason the message came.
1. You received a combat Elite.
2. Since you received three elites, you are awarded a special badge.

I do not really understand what this mark and where to see it.
Maybe this is another step on the way to find Raxxla?
Weird lore note: Combat Elite wasn't really a thing until 3100s approximately. Peter Jameson by all accounts is the first Elite CMDR. Raxxla, of course, predates this by more than 8 centuries. Insofar as first novella by Holdstock, Jason Ryder mentioned Raxxla to his son Alex before his death. Raffe Zetter appears to know about it, too. There are at least 7 very direct references to Earth specifically in The Dark Wheel story itself (despite Earth being erased from the galactic maps). We also have in the Coda section a passage reiterating the point of a gateway to other galaxies occupied by Elites.

Notable, also that Zetter is ancient, knowledgeable, and powerful. Now, I suspect he may be Peter Jameson/Jaques (based on Peter's Wreck and Peter's Base in Facece). I am still torn as to whether Peter Jameson/Jaques is legitimately not a threat or whether he is the major enemy in all this. Honestly, I tend to suspect he is the big baddie here having been responsible for death of John Jameson and countless others (based on stories about Jaques, the INRA sites, Imperials curing Jaques condition, and a number of stories in the official novels and Elite Dangerous).

Note: At the end of the story, Alex Ryder achieves Deadly as combat rank. There is also discussion about knowing when to run and how to survive.
