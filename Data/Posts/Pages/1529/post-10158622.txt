It's the Triple Elite ship decal.

You get it if your Trading, Combat and Exploration ranks are all at least Elite (grade of Elite doesn't matter, has to be those specific three - my CQC/Trade/Exploration combination didn't work until I got Combat as a fourth much later)

It applies to your ship in exactly the same way as the "Exploration Elite" or "Combat Master" or "Trade Mostly Penniless" rank decals you get at earlier steps go.

Is displaying the decal on your ship necessary to unlock Raxxla? Unlikely, since it wasn't implemented until 2018. Still, it might substitute for separately displaying the Combat, Trade and Exploration Elite decals on your ship in situations where that's required. There will be enough people using it that simply having it on your ship isn't sufficient, of course.
