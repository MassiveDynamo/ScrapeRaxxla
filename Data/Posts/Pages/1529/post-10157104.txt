Aye that's a mystery, like i very rarely find any ELW or WW in a G-Star system like Earth, my last small trek into Vulcan to snag beacon 256, registered 36 ELW and 87 WW none of which were in a G system let alone G2

Most ELWs in the bubble have been terraformed. Natural ELWs are quite rare.

There is a higher density of natural ELWs in the bubble than the rest of the galaxy, but this is mostly for historic reasons.
