From GalNet "Simguru Offers to Share Tomorrow Today" from 14th June 3301:

“It is only right for us to honour what came before us. Sol is the birthplace of our race, the shining jewel of our galaxy. At least, it is now that it has been restored to its former glory.”

This is the only mention of jewel in all of GalNet.
