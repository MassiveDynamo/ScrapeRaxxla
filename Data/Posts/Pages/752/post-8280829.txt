arrived to PSR J2055+3630

It's full of giants and brown dwarfs there. Still, same white light on arrive.
Soo ...I think we're looking for massive NS. As it is "whispers" if you FSS target it and it is bright light described in codex stories twice.
Also ...about light. Question is for whom. As that 2 humans were contacted by telepathy so they saw what emitters saw, i.e. it could be aliens who sees x-rays.
