Wait, wait, wait, wait... This indicates that flying manually does reduce the fuel use and jump range from manual flying. Someone told me it still uses the origin system to determine jump range and there was no point flying out to the location. Which way does it work. If I fly to a system with lots of fuel can I jump for less total fuel to another system? If so I can go explore some stuff I wanted in a feulaconda like I originally wanted to.

I don't think this mentions specifically but was linked in the thread.

If this was possible did they change it? I really want to visit a few locations manually.
