But does it reduce the fuel to jump and allow you to jump to locations you couldn't otherwise?

Someone once told me you can't do it because it will calculate fuel as if you were near the star of the base system and it's pointless. I'm still wondering about this.
Find maximum range jump system and start to fly to it. 1-2 hours later check if fuel required bar got shorter(white part!). I think best result will be with some low range, like 7 ly max jump and close systems.
