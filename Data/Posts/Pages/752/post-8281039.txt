On some early dee videos DB talks about the future - passenger missions, Big Game Hunting where you either take a passenger to a far flug planet to hunt some exotic species, or you hunt it yourself, possible shuttlecraft down to atmos planets ffom stations and some others so it was probably original idea. Thing is his vision isn't even half complete, the galaxy may be mostly there but the life isn't yet.

Ok, listened NS lecture again ... extra fast spinning NS may avoid being BH for some time, because being or not BH depends on density inside star. Current models predict easy 3 sol masses.
However, I still doubt about ingame 13 Sols ... as there are speed limits. At some rotation speed:
1. speed can be more then 1st cosmic speed and matter just fly out in space
2. "sound speed" may be more then light speed and then matter gets crazy and unstable.
all depends on initial radius-mass.

Huh, 1 more fun fact, minimal mass of NS must be 15% less then white dwarf, otherwise explosion will do dwarf. So it's around 1.1 SOL to 2.1 SOL. And I see plenty of NS of 0.3-0.6-0.7

Ask DB this on the next livestream, its probably the kind of question he hopes for and he can probably answer it for you in detail that will leave most if us behind including me.
