Looking at the Codex Cmdr stats & taking screenshots is an inefficient way to note the current stats. Is there a better way? Are they in the journal logs; if so anyone have some code to extract them?
Does EDD show them? (Thereâ€™s so much in EDD & I only use it to track travel history & convert screenshots )
