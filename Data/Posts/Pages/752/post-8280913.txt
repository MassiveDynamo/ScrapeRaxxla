Are those also fully Allied with Empire, Federation and Alliance? I was looking at this the other day, and in addition to working on my final Elite for combat, at the same time planning on ramping my Alliance rep.

I've also been investigating the passenger missions for TDW, Aegis Core et al and noted (anecdotally) there seems to be more 'Show me the Universe' style missions where you'll take a passenger to three locations close to, but around the bubble, within ~250ly. There are still the long trips, but these multiple hops are what I've been looking into.

Investigating all these out-of-band it seems like their nudging us to explore all the lore that already exists in the game, rather than relying on non-cannon, or unknown cannon material from the Internet.

Just my 2 cents.

How long have passenger missions been in-game? Since the gamma??

Edit: ah, googled & introduced in 2.2 (wish my memory was better. Must eat more fish, must eat...must drink lavian brandy! No, just finished breakfast, darn, too early!!).

But FD might have introduced passenger missions in an attempt to get gameplay more aligned with their initial expectations of how the game would be played, and hence increasing the chance of encountering Raxxla/TDW? DB said they were surprised how people played the game and the missions were expected to get people moving around the bubble....
