Y'all make me feel like a baby. I couldn't play first game because I was like 2.5 years old at the time and didn't find out about the series until recently (2016 - started playing a year after Horizons December 2016) so I missed the SuperCobra aka Cobra Mk IV when I started playing. Still kinda of bitter about that honestly.

SuperCobra - Elite Wiki

I've checked Elite around 2015/2016 but at that time there was no planet landing at all so it was a no-no for me, since my greatest memories are on planet surfaces (in game. Well IRL too in fact).
I wish Fdev had designed orbital cities FE2 style, it was really quite a sight!
