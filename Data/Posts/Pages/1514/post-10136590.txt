Lest we forget why FD may have utilised Demeter and Persephone?

I suspect it’s not a direct reference to the Eleusinian Mysteries, more like FD utilising similar themes to describe an abstract concept or path.

Eg Miltonian Hell; Greek Hell; Norse underworld; a journey to hell ergo Milton’s Lucifer in Paradise Lost; Demeter and Persephone etc culminating in an area filled with lost or sunken kingdoms, some of which linked to holy relics, treasure; concepts of an afterlife or heaven.

Individually they might not mean anymore than names, it’s their physical location in game and positioning which is relevant, not the wider mythology, as I suspect it’s mixed, so too wide?

I suspect the codex is a map and its interest is simply to direct us someplace, a hotspot, a focal point, and within that area is the objective.
