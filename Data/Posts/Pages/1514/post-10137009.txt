By the way, current research is reading the Eleusinian Mystery document and see if public scan data shows evidence of any references as systems or POIs. I would love to see some of line up with that Demeter/Persephone line. The question is how much do you read into the myth insofar as informing the search for Raxxla. My secondary approach has typically been looking at anything where the history seems buried.
