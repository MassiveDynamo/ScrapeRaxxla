I was searching INARA for Acropolis and it appears someone has scanned an installation with an interesting name:

Acropolis Navigation Beacon in Irandan
Station - Acropolis Navigation Beacon in Irandan [INARA - Elite:Dangerous]
The companion site for Elite:Dangerous. The game database, market data, trade routes, outfitting, engineers, blueprints, crafting, Thargoid war, squadrons, logbooks, galleries, galaxy information and much more...
inara.cz



Now it is near the Arietis Sector which is (if memory serves me correctly) a stretch of mostly unpopulated systems between the Federation and the Independent Worlds region.

I suppose this is going to get tacked on to my growing list of bookmarks for investigation if I am in the area.
