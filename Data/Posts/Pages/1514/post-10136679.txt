Why can't it just be a MYTH ?
In that perspective, an affirmative quote from a Frontier official (like David Braben) makes perfect sense as it gives a strong foundation to the myth.
And "The Myth" IS explicitly mentioned with these exact words.
In résumé it could have been PR talk aimed at teasing old timers (including myself, I played Elite 2 when I was 11. I had to fax the hand written order from France to England and wait maybe 6 weeks for the order to be processed. Admittedly I hadn't heard of Raxxla at this time).
