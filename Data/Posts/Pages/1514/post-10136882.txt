Y'all make me feel like a baby. I couldn't play first game because I was like 2.5 years old at the time and didn't find out about the series until recently (2016 - started playing a year after Horizons December 2016) so I missed the SuperCobra aka Cobra Mk IV when I started playing. Still kinda of bitter about that honestly.
