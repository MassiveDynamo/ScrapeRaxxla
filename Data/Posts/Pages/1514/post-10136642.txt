FYI : contacted, Fdev support doesn't confirm or deny that Witch's Reach is narratively locked, even when mentioned that they did for Polaris and that it is only fair to the players to let them know what's arbitrarily obstructed and what's a mystery waiting to be solved.
So we are left with guessing what's in-game or not, what's mentioned only to give some depth to the lore and what's actually implemented.
They can't confirm if Raxxla is still in game and accessible, or if it has been dropped (if ever implemented) by the new teams.
For the records, many advertised game mechanics have not been released in the end or in different format so a quote by David Braben from 10 years ago is only worth so much.
