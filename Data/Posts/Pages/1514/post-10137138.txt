I'm really having a difficult time finding a program that will translate my CSV file of systems with their (x,y,z) coordinates into a 3d space. This would allow me to look at the relation between the systems, especially by proximity. Does anyone know of such a program?
Note: Elite Dangerous coordinates are x,z,y

Where...
x is left or right of Sol
y is below or above Sol
z is further from core or closer to the core than Sol

Note: Not the same thing as Galactic Coordinate System (Right ascension, Declination). Elite Dangerous is basically Cartesian coordinates but with Left-Handed Cartesian coordinates:

Galactic Coordinates
I've seen a few people mention galactic coordinates in posts or mention things are a certain distance off the galactic plane. Can someone explain where this information is located and how it is read? I've looked on the galactic map but I can't seem to find anything. Thanks
