I'm really having a difficult time finding a program that will translate my CSV file of systems with their (x,y,z) coordinates into a 3d space. This would allow me to look at the relation between the systems, especially by proximity. Does anyone know of such a program?

Im using an older version of sketchup with an xyz input extensionâ€¦ but i imagine there are many 3d softwares out there that can do it.
And yes i have to format it differently for input (i put mine in z/x/y to get it right) - always good to ground truth your data after you input. See if things aligning right.
