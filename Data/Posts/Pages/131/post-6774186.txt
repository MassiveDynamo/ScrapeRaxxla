It's taken about 2 weeks but finally read though the thread! Some interesting stuff I too was confused by raxxla and formidine rift so happy to have that cleared up.

I don't recall seeing it, but did anyone try to get all the system permits. That would be part of the personal journey I think.
The other thought, which I hope isn't the case, is what if the secret is only revealed to the 'iron man's Elite? The game is a bit inconsistent with 'death' given escape pods exist, we can't die, but we have assassination missions and so on. Using "insurance claims=0" would likely reduce the number of Cmdrs to a small handful. Would be mean though.

In regards to "Iron Man" status ... I doubt it. The game doesn't official recognize "Iron Man" status. It's completely self-imposed. I managed to rank one of my accounts to Elite in Exploration and Trade with zero insurance claims but once you start pursuing Combat Elite "Iron Man" status becomes unsustainable.
