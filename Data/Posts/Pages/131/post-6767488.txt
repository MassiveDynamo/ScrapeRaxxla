I had the thought a while back that Raxxla might actually be Frontier HQ, finding it would mean arriving in Cambridge and knocking on their office door. After all, who else has that much power over the Elite universe. Oh, now I've got my headache again, best go for a lie down![smile]

I actually had a very similar thought just yesterday. What if Raxxla is just the other side of the video game screen? I mean ... what if Raxxla is just stepping away from playing a video game and going on a very personal journey to make this REAL world that we live in a better place for all of us? That would really suck because it would be mean that I have zero chance of ever encountering Raxxla for myself ...
