I would have loved that Raxxla were actually the origin of the Rift mYsTeRy. Would have been consistent with the lost ships myth, as it has been discussed in most station-bars all around the Bubble for years...
That would have been nice.
Maybe all is not lost. The Zurara/Dynasty mystery does not explain why the rift had the "here be ghosts" tag beforehand. Maybe Raxxla is what gave the rift it's reputation and maybe that's why "the club" sent the Zurara that way out.
