It takes about two minutes to type 'RA' in the galaxy map search box and click through all the systems. None of them have names that are interesting.

Unless you count Rakka, which has a L-class star in the system.

I have updated my list of 'RA XX-L A' systems, if anyone needs something to visit in the black:

PHOOE BRA XX-L A76-0 (Checked by rOmiLaYu)
HYPI BRA XX-L A21-0
HYPI BRA XX-L A117-0
HYPAO BRA XX-L A7-0 (Checked by rOmiLaYu)
HYPAO BRA XX-L A76-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A36-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A7-0 (Checked by rOmiLaYu)
DRYU BRA XX-L A49-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A21-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A9-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A35-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A63-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A76-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A118-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A117-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A62-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A7-0 (Checked by rOmiLaYu)
OOSCS BRA XX-L A7-1
OOSCS BRA XX-L A7-2
OOSCS BRA XX-L A36-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A90-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A90-1
OOSCS BRA XX-L A104-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A35-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A63-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A76-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A117-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A62-0

Finally reached and checked Ooscs Bra XX-L a35-0. It's just as barren as those previously visited by rOmiLaYu. I don't expect much more from the others, but hey I just needed an excuse to head back out, so thanks for that
