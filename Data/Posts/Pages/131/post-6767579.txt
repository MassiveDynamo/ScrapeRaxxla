I actually had a very similar thought just yesterday. What if Raxxla is just the other side of the video game screen? I mean ... what if Raxxla is just stepping away from playing a video game and going on a very personal journey to make this REAL world that we live in a better place for all of us? That would really suck because it would be mean that I have zero chance of ever encountering Raxxla for myself ...

But that would mean I have to...you know, go...outside.
