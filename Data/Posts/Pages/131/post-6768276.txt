I also don't see how MB's IRL clue "a little bit obvious" would fit with FDev HQ being Raxxla... :S

No? Raxxla is supposed to be a gateway to another universe. On one side of the monitor is the game universe while on the other side of the monitor there is our universe (the gateway therefore is so obvious that it is literally right in front of our noses). Of course this would mean that the "evil men" exploiting Raxxla for themselves is Frontier Developments ...

Final edit: I'm not saying that I'm convinced that this is the case. Just that it makes for an interesting thought.
