Collecting system permits was great content, I still remember selling data of my first ELW to gain Van Maanen's Star permit, or smuggling all sorts of nasty things for Jotun permit. There are still some left, mainly because I can't bother with higher ranks of Empire or Federation, and do too little CQC. It's those unobtainable system permits that bother me. It would be really interesting if some of those were actually obtainable, but required something different, like scanning some odd beacon somewhere in deep space... Or getting rep with a minor faction nobody ever noticed. It's a journey, personal one, but I don't know if there's anything too strange at the end of it. It would have been figured out ages ago.

Lately I've been thinking about starter systems, it would be funny if unlocking "all three Shinrarta Dezhra permits", or simply, being triple elite enabled some simple easter egg or the like. Did you know that the true starter system is the first system you jump into, not where you begin? I heard about this lately. Not sure if it's true and can't remember where I picked it from, maybe Reddit. Asellus Primus in itself is a great candidate, there's something a tiny bit obvious about it, check it out if you enjoy long supercruise voyages.

I've been thinking about the "puzzle theory" also. There are thousands of stations with funny names, millions of system names, sometimes planets have names of their own too. If some of those had a different meaning, and the pieces would fit together.. magic words. No, it must be too much tinfoil on me today..
