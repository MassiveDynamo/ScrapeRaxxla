It's taken about 2 weeks but finally read though the thread! Some interesting stuff I too was confused by raxxla and formidine rift so happy to have that cleared up.

I don't recall seeing it, but did anyone try to get all the system permits. That would be part of the personal journey I think.
The other thought, which I hope isn't the case, is what if the secret is only revealed to the 'iron man's Elite? The game is a bit inconsistent with 'death' given escape pods exist, we can't die, but we have assassination missions and so on. Using "insurance claims=0" would likely reduce the number of Cmdrs to a small handful. Would be mean though.

I think the Raxxla-Rift confusion came from Salomé being adopted by the Children of Raxxla group. Don’t think otherwise there is any connection at all. She might also have mentioned Raxxla in her speech at Beagle Point if I remember correctly, but that seemed to be Salomé plot elaboration rather than a real hint.

Collecting all the permits might be part of the journey, but since FD use the permit system to block off parts of the universe for their own development testing then that seems a bit iffy. I agree with Jaiotu that the Iron Man idea also seems off. But I have the impression that the personal journey idea came from MB & ties in somehow with version3 developments, so it might be that Raxxla plotline is on hold until the exploration improvements come in 3.4 at the end of the year. Don’t ask me how I got this impression, the brain cells are atrophying........
