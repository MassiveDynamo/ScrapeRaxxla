My tinfoil:

A place that isn't a place - this allows for Raxxla to be mobile. A place that isn't IN place, so to speak.

A door that is also a key - when coupled with the 'personal journey' concept, this could be referring to the Cmdr making some kind of jump/transition/evolution through a conceptual doorway, which then unlocks access to Raxxla. Unlocking could be permit-related or a code/cipher of some kind.
I've been keen on the mobile Raxxla idea for a while - it'd provide a mechanism for dealing with the situation if anyone does find it. It would also explain the personal journey part - if it moves when a cmdr finds it then everyone would need to find it individually. (Or possibly it's in a different place for every cmdr to begin with.)

For the door that's also a key part, would not that just be a fairly literal description of Raxxla - it's the door to another universe and all it contains, and thus the key to untold wealth, knowledge and power.
