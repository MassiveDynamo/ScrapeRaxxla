Any nebula would be a good place to hide something.

Well...not in this game seems to me.
There is no nebula left to explore in the entire MW.
Harsh nav conditions regions, however...

Anyway it would not be logical to refere the "outer rim" to another game than E: D
But coming from FDevs ...well...[blah]
