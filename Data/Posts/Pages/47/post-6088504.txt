A timely reply with the right text! o7
Having just had this conversation, I can see several clues here:
.
One I picked up on at the time: 'Outer Rim'. Is this referring to the part of the galaxy that the person found this information in, or is this where they were looking for Raxxla?
.
A second clue is highlighted by this conversation: '... information about a certain celestial body ...'. It might have been assumed that Raxxla was a planet from what was said in The Dark Wheel but this is essentially the mission-giver saying the same thing: Raxxla is a celestial body, not a space station or a huge spaceship.
.
A place that isn't a place and a door that is also the key. This gets quoted a lot but in the context of this conversation: what type of celestial body is a place that isn't a place? A black hole. It's not itself a place - it's just a hole, an absence of something (well OK it's a region of intense space-time distortion). A black hole might also be a door, if there's a wormhole past the event horizon.
.
Perhaps all those people who've wanted wormholes to be in the game had their wish granted nearly three years ago - but no one has found it, yet!

Mmm, more likely you enter the correct black hole and get spun around, to find a sign saying
Raxxla demolished by Vogon Constructor Fleet. You had access to the plans all along
once you found the cellar, and got past the tiger, and found the key to the filing cabinet
