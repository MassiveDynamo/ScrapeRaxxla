Small thought. I think "outer rim" is used in FE2 and FFE to refer to a region of space which in ED is actually very close to the bubble, if not in it. Checking the FE2 and FFEb fiction/journals might help narrow it down.

Yes you're right there. FE2 was set 100 years before ED, FFE 50 years. Hyperdrives back then were much slower and the bubble was smaller. The starmaps don't really match up between those games and ED (much). But it's safe to assume that the Frontier or "outer rim" in FFE/FE2 era is now well within the Bubble

EDIT: ... unless they mean "the outer rim" of the galaxy, in which case, probably in the same place...ish.
