Except KS backers also got access to Shinrarta from the get-go - no Elite requirements necessary.

Also, if Elite and allied with The DW was all it took - someone would have found it in Beta

And who says it has not already been found ?
I don't say it's all what is requiered, besides. (like DW missions leading to rep with other factions leading to new permits leading to new factions leading to ...ad infinitum maybe [haha])
All this would be, as I understand it, just the "tiny little bit obvious' part.
Tiny.
Little bit.
