I'm sure that in ffe there were stories about a pilot returning from the outer rim and considering the jump times and lifetime of hyperdrives nffe it must have been close to inhabited space. Something tells me it was another term for the far frontier systems possibly in the direction if the Pleiades.

Anyway, if "outer rim" in the DW missions means the same area then maybe this reaffirms the idea that Raxxla is not far from Sol.
