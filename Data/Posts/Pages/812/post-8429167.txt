I was doing at least four NHSS threat 4 (4 or 8 scouts each) per trip out from Artemis Reach station, and sometimes a couple extra. I usually turned in 270kCr war bonds but one trip I turned in 660kCr. You were docking after only 4 scouts killed?? No interceptor is elite but strong, scouts are elite & the way to go if you’re after rapid combat rank increase.

No thanks, I hate things bobbing around in the cockpit. I have a Christmas Tree which I load for seasonal festivities, but I got a couple of gold awards on Distant Worlds 2 and hate them. I would go with a DB bobblehead, but sadly they aren’t available.
