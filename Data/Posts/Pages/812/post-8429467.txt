I get about 1% combat per regular cz at dangerous. Those are only taking me about 8 mins to finish and no caustic damage to have to worry about. It might be more like 1.5 cz for 2% from 3 but i still think its as fast if not faster. Back when we had ax czs it was efficient because you could actually kill a lot of scouts quickly with out all the tedious mucking about in hyperspace. Imo not as efficient anymore and probably just averages out to be the same

Edit: My research on this includes a deadly fighter pilot also. Just imagine if i fired her.
