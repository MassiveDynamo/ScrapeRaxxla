Apparently that table is a bit out of date and all kills count for something now, but the principle still stands, Elite targets are much better than lower ranks and lower ones probably aren't worth the ammo but at least they give a micro advance just so its not meaningless.

Ive all but given up on Combat for a bit, PP since December just made me bored with the whole affair so Im back to chasing mysteries and just hitting whatever interdicts me or the occasional Nav Beacon, Ive even given up on PP until week 4 now. 12% Dangerous so a long way to go

Im a bit of a Thargoid symptahiser too (traitor to the human race?) as in if I step on an anthill I expect to get bitten but if they leave me alone I leave them alone and Im still trying to communicate by 'dancing' with them when they do interdict. The most aggressive entity in the galaxy probably isn't Thatgoids, its humans.

Oh and I havent found Raxxla or any clues either, just more mysteries that probably aren't connected.
