Mmm, we’re in danger of derailing the thread, but I think it will be a mix of all 3 play styles, and probably a few more that we haven’t thought of; everyone plays in their own way, but there are enough pew pew people around to place the emphasis on that. I will probably be off exploring or trading somewhere, I only made the effort for combat elite because I thought this is likely to be one of the requirements on the “personal journey” towards Raxxla.
