Nah, i mean x4 of NHSS. Do you say interceptors aren't elites, i.e. more kills is needed?

Ah, I misunderstood what you were saying.
No, I think all thargoids are elite, but scouts are easier to kill than any of the others. Plus you get at least two, usually four, and sometimes eight scouts in an instance, so the rate of ranking progress is much faster hunting scouts than any of the other types of goid. You need 16 elite kills per 1% of rank increase when youâ€™re Deady. So hunting them is the most efficient way of rank increase (other than the Anarchy Outbreak CheckPoint method).
