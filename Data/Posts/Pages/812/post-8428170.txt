So ... I was reading a little bit about history and I saw somewhere that the ancient Egyptians called Maia, Neith.
Neith was considered to be the mother of Ra, the first to give birth.
Neith is shown as a woman wearing the red crown.

It was named by the Galactic Mapping Project with the name of: Maia's Jewell.
in other words Neith's Jewell?
What do you guys think, maybe I'm already going crazy? xD
