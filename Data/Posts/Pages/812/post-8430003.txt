I get about 1% combat per regular cz at dangerous. Those are only taking me about 8 mins to finish and no caustic damage to have to worry about. It might be more like 1.5 cz for 2% from 3 but i still think its as fast if not faster. Back when we had ax czs it was efficient because you could actually kill a lot of scouts quickly with out all the tedious mucking about in hyperspace. Imo not as efficient anymore and probably just averages out to be the same

Edit: My research on this includes a deadly fighter pilot also. Just imagine if i fired her.

Yes, if you have crew then you’re sharing your kill points with them so slowing down your ranking progress. I think AX conflict zone is likely to be the fastest method plus you can get missions to hunt there which will have better payouts, but since there haven’t been any for a while, before I started to chase combat elite, I haven’t been able to try them & can’t comment. At Dangerous your Deadly and Elite kills count toward your progress, but when you get to Deadly you need to chase only Elite targets. Lower rank targets get you few or no kill points so a waste of time and effort. There’s a combat ranking payoff table on the Wiki that explains the target weighting.

My wrists are still hurting and fingers still tingling. Don’t remember it hurting like this 35 years ago....
I ought to get a bar on my triple elite decal-this is my second Combat Elite promotion!
