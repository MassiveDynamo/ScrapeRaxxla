Yeh, scouts are pretty fun, but docking/undocking after each 4 kills me. Even interceptor takes 8mins/kill. Scouts are faster. Then jump out, fly, jump in. Each 3-4 jumps -> station for rearm.
I like sit on place for hour or 2 without SC.
Btw, you can unlock thargoid bubblehead for your cockpit if you kill interceptor and get a heart. However, make sure you have 16 slots cargo resist on ship, which transports you to station, as you will need meta-alloys once you got heart on board as well. I doubt u will use fighter one.
