So many cmdrs seem to prefer big jump ranges and so many systems in between go unnoticed...
I like to fly out (Neutron Super Highway) about 2000 LY then set my nav computer to "Economical" and short jump around an area for a while. While I have first discovered many new planets and systems, I am still missing putting my name on a WR or BH. Those Wolf's and Black Holes are hard to find undiscovered.
I have even done the whole XXXX AA-A H and stuff too. But after I arrive, I find it already claimed.

I tend to get lazy around the bubble, though. I usually go with something 50+ ly jump range (usually closer to 65) and set my nav computer to plot "Fastest" instead of "Economical". ... Though I generally have my filters set to only plot my un-visited systems... again, unless I'm in a hurry and don't want to take the time to FSS/DSS things.
