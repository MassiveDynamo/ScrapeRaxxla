Ill definitely help with that if you want, just hit me up in game or here. I have a feeling theyre probably just fluff, a bit of RPG/D&D element but I have more fun wondering if they are significant and wasting time trying it out.

A journey everyone must make for themselves - wonder if that still applies in the FC era? If it does then its nothing to do with the location or physical journey.
