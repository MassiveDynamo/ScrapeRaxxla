Maybe the Gan Romero fluff was not about the guy but the encoded message he received (which we never pay attention to them) and the stolen DBX (which has a series of numbers in top centre front of the canopy "similar" to a IPv4 comms port address but numbering doesn't fit).

Also, a while back we've got a CG to find the wrekages of the Starship One... it was believed Halsey visited Raxxla prior her "accident" and no actual blackbox was ever recovered... just her scape pod.

I guess this is just pointing out to something and we should keep looking for it.
