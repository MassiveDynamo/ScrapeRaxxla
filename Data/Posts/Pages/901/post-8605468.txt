Just wanted to pop in a give a bit of perspective that's changing my mind. I'm out on the HIP hunt currently underway to get all in game HIP stars into EDSM. I'm spending a lot of time less than 1K away from Sol and am finding a good bit of undiscovered territory. I was firmly in the camp that Raxxla couldn't be near the bubble because it had all already been explored. I'm changing my mind on that. Just today I found two systems that only the main star had been discovered. One had 13 bodies in it. No gas giants with eight moons, though. So I don't know....lore or other reasons are irrelevant, I'm just saying that I found a totally "unlooked at" system less than 500lys from Sol. This also lends validity to "A CMDR has been in the system and didn't find it."

Take that for what it's worth.
