What are you doing with said Pirate rares? Tried taking em to the Guardian sites, see if some combo will get the door open? That is my plan as dont know if anyone has tried it yet but nowhere near starting, just another on 'the list'.
Thats one of the ideas we've kicked around, also at thargoid surface site machines. So far ive just been collecting them on a squad mates FC.
