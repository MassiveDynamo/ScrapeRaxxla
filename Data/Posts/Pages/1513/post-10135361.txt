The Marlinists have always been one of the top contenders for either finding Raxxla or something very closely related to it. If Baltah'Sine is close, that would probably merit checking especially the rings they are naturally found at. Though, I still need an explanation for Capella and the moon Duval's Grave amongst other oddities.
