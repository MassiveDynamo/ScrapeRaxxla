I thought I watched a video some where of FDEV saying to pay attention to station numbers...
Ha-ha not this old chestnut again

This was the CEO, he basically said the wrong thing, he was meant to say ‘number station’ ergo satellites which issue coded messages. This was later identified by a senior FD Dev to be an error on the CEOs part. It’s all in this thread somewhere.

Nothing to do with Raxxla just a hint he tried to drop about Gen ships. The numbers on Fed stations have no depth to them other than denoting the bodies of the system they are in, it’s cool but not a mystery.
