Points are now obtained via Spansh and a simple GIS app.

Baltah'Sine is not relative in my opinion, it’s in the general ballpark but not the correct plain so to speak, it’s too wide a mark in my opinion.



Delphi in game is home to the stations Oracle and Donars Oak.

The Oracle of Delphi sat over a geographic rift, in the temple which was situated upon the location of the omphalos.

There is a Hyperborea - the mythical land beyond the far north, and home of the founders of the shrines of Apollo at Delphi in game. This too is situated in the Underworld area in game… very close to the system Axis Mundi.

Donars Oak is a Saxon tree cult representative of a world tree or axis mundi.

The system Delphi is a good and likely obvious match but it’s hundreds of light years away from these underworld systems.
