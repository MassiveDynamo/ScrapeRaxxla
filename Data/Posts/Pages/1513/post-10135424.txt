Rochester - how did you come up with that specific angle of the Path of Persephone?
Simply join the dots?

Demeter is in game so is Persephone, draw a line between them and extrapolate.

The App I use allows for full 3D orientation.

I then inserted various (numerous) layers I have to see what might correlate.

One such was the early discovered systems and Pandemonium (capital of John Milton’s Hell).

I then looked for other hell / underworld systems, found some very close by. Then thought of how the codex might give other clues. Which took me to ‘Much like the ancient myths of Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John’.

Around these underworld systems are other systems denoting sunken lands like Atalantis, cities of gold like El Darado and mythological lost lands.

I then just thought it logical it all seemed to correlate. I could go on but but I’ve covered this previously. Not saying it’s definitive, just a potential theory but one I’m pretty sure is very likely.
