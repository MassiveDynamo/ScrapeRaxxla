Was thinking about Rochester's idea of the underworld/lost city theme. Maybe we should be thinking more ascent aspect ala the Eleusinian Mysteries - the returning of Persephone to Demeter. The descent, the quest, then the ascent. Really not sure how that would fit in in our search - just throwing out ideas.
As it turns out, I might have a document that can help with that particular approach. I actually think that is a wise idea. I had collected this more for intellectual curiosity but maybe it will help us. Obviously, this is not my work. Found online via Google searches.
