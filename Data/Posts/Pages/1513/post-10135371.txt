I can't find the posts earlier but I had thought I read something about the importance of Delphi.

I find that interesting. The Sirens were made into flying creatures and had dwelled in the land of Apollo (Delphi) as punishment by Demeter. It is said that they would live only until someone who heard their singing would pass by (whisperer in witch-space?). Maybe a connection there?
