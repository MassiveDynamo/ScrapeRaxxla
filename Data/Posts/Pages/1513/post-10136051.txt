The Nameless appear to be an FDev created minor faction that a number of squadrons have adopted for RP-purposes. Probably a good candidate for seeing if there are oddball missions. Though, that beacon in Shinrarta Dezra regarding Pilot's Federation Influence kind of begs the question of whether that is truly productive.
