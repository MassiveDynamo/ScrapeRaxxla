Has anyone ever asked FD if a Pulse wave analyser would help the search for Raxxla?
I also think that the analyzer shouldn't care if they are rings or not.
I always carry it around and try to scan in circles, but I get no results.
I mean, it should work on any mountain, but it only works in the rings... why so?
I also recently showed us a new ship Targoid, who can see it in advance?
I am writing this because it is useless to look for a place to have it in order to see it.

I think we have to carry something with us to see THIS. And it doesn't have to be something.
