Did you check the atmosphere? Some planets have a very small, thin atmosphere - in which case they are not landable. It's not always apparent that they have an atmosphere.

Hadn't checked that ... partly because, in reality, there shouldn't be such a thing as a planet with NO atmosphere. Even Earth's moon has an atmosphere: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_the_Moon
