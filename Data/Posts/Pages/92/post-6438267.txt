Considering what happened to Jason Ryder... anyone who's posted suggesting they found it (or something odd - remember that post on the French forums) has mysteriously never been heard from again...

The reward that would make someone keep Raxxla secret would have to be a hook, something that they didn't receive (or not all at once, at least) until later. Maybe an ongoing reward. God-like oversight of ED stats? Position on the game design design board (not the DDF, I presume that's dead now)? FDev shareholding? All FDev titles ever released into the future?

Maybe when you arrive in system the game defaults to a long-winded EULA/NDA, and so far nobody's bothered to tick "I agree"!

As for whether anyone else has found it. Who was searching, started this thread, and then said "ooh, the missions have disappeared, that's odd"? Who's leading us on a wild goose chase around the galaxy? It's Macros The Black! He knows where it is! Get him!
