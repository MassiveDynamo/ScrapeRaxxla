Wasnt there something in Lave that you couldnt get close to......
part of an asteroid belt if memory serves (before coffee has kicked in)

Lave asteroid belts 4 and 5. I manage to get in several times and there are just asteroids inside. Nothing special.
I tried even entering carrying Thargoid/Guardian artifacts and also canisters... it made no difference.
