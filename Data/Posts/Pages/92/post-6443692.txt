Agreed - but there's a "cut-off" point between low atmosphere and landables.

For example, Mercury has a very, very thin atmosphere that gets blown away since it's too small to keep it. And I think the sun boils it away too.

I am not sure what the percentage is, but I think that's why some rocky planets are not landable - I am sure someone around here knows the approximate value.

I'm sure you're right ... I've just never given much thought as to what that "cut off" happens to be.
