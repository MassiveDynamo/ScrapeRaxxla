Very much so. remember too that it was settled in the earliest days of colonisation - so people made a dangerous trip to a star that they know had no habitable planets, it's a pain to navigate around (long distances without supercruise) and yet an Earth-based group decided to sink massive funds into it to this project to develop it. They also do so really quickly, it only takes them a few years to go from newly arrived homesteaders to founding the Sirius Corporation to becoming a pivotal company in the economics of the Galaxy.

Also compound that with the fact that even now there's virtually nothing in the Sirius system - there's a couple of tiny little planet base and one Coriolis and one outpost. That's the home system of the largest and most influential megacorporation-government in Human history... You'd expect Lucifer would be one big city by now, running all the bureaucracy of the corporation and there'd be hundreds of orbital industrial stations.

It does suggest that maybe there's a lot more going on that we can't see...

It is curious. David Braben wrote the entry for "Sirius" in the Gazetteer from Frontier: Elite 2 which seems to go out of it's way to point out just how incongruous the Sirius system is when compared to Sirius Corporation's contributions to human history:
