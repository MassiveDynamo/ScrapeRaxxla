So, as I said a while back, I started working toward getting the Sirius permit with my secondary account (primary is in Colonia and I didn't want to fly him back to investigate).

After days of building reputation via the mission boards I gave up, equipped a passenger cabin and took a long-range tourist out 23,000 light-years to visit "The Beacon Worlds" ... which is something like 3 Earth-likes orbiting a companion to a Neutron Star. Total trip took me two weeks due to only putting in 30 minutes to an hour here and there.

So now I've got my Sirius permit.

I know I've been in the Sirius system before but I never really paid it much mind. This time I visited with my eyes wide open.

What a crudhole. Two stars. Each with one planet. There's the gas giant "Waypoint" and the airless world of "Lucifer".

THIS is the system that birthed the mighty Sirius Corporation? No way! This is a system that you fuel scoop through on your way to find someplace interesting.

It strikes me as extremely fishy that a corporation as massive and powerful as Sirius would rise from THIS.

Raxxla would certainly help explain how Sirius rose from such a dump to the heights that it has.
