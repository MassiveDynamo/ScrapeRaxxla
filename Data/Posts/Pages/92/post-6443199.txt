Not uncommon. I've visited entire systems where all the planets were rocky but non-landable. I'm honestly not sure what criteria is used to determine landable/non-landable. Gravity?

Did you check the atmosphere? Some planets have a very small, thin atmosphere - in which case they are not landable. It's not always apparent that they have an atmosphere.
