Hadn't checked that ... partly because, in reality, there shouldn't be such a thing as a planet with NO atmosphere. Even Earth's moon has an atmosphere: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_the_Moon

Agreed - but there's a "cut-off" point between low atmosphere and landables.

For example, Mercury has a very, very thin atmosphere that gets blown away since it's too small to keep it. And I think the sun boils it away too.

I am not sure what the percentage is, but I think that's why some rocky planets are not landable - I am sure someone around here knows the approximate value.
