Not sure if it's been discussed before, but how common are atmosphereless planets which are non-landable (without being permit locked). It's not something I've ever looked out for, but I spotted one like that the other day (Exbeur 1).

Not uncommon. I've visited entire systems where all the planets were rocky but non-landable. I'm honestly not sure what criteria is used to determine landable/non-landable. Gravity?
