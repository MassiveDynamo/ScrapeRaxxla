On contrary, when sup mas black hole eats mass it also generates around self so much energy, that it creates galactic waves of matter thickness with creates new stars en masse.

I'm not an expert in high-end physics, but I've learned that you cannot generate energy. It can only be transformed. So this is more a sort of question: Isn't it energy of the position that is transformed into kinetic energy, i.e. heat and then radiation. And since we know of this gravitational waves, I'd expect some energy to go into that too.
- Interesting enough that this leads to new stars... Looking forward to watching the vid
Edit: Fascinating how wise this old Heraklid guy was with his "panta rhei" idea! ... and good arguments for density waves leading to the birth of new stars.
