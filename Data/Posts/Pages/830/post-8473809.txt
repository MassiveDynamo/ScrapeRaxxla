Drew's view is also contradicted by the discovery section of the codex, which we have to take as canon.

Below is my top candidate although it's too far for me to make the trip to check just now.

View attachment 174022

Note:

1. Top left shows this is from the codex
2. Location is in the errant marches, 36k light years from sol
3. Date of discovery is 2136 - 160 years before the first written mention of raxxla
4. Discoverer is thedarklord which matches the codex description of 'a sinister cabal (or sole tyrant)' discoverer


whether raxxla is there or not, it still conclusively disproves the raxxla being in a sol bubble based on tech limits/lore theory.
