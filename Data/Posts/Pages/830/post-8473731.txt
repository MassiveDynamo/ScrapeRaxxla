Nope. The thought occurred after i was back and i wish i had thought of it while i was still out there. This could be something or not but its something to investigate even if just to disprove. Would be so cool if it is

Also idk how i can determine which way is up

Edit: with all those black holes in the area there is an incredible amount of spiraling Stars visible in many systems
well, you've got the pix there and the alphabet. Try some analysis - should only take half an hour to investigate, try looking at it right way up + upside down & also both left to right + right to left. If some of it makes sense then you're onto something!
