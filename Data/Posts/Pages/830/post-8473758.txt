the hyperspace lore is patchy and oft self contradictory. Also there are at least 3 different techs. of hyperspace.

Drew's view is based on the lore of Raxxla's first mention, but this assumes that at the time of 2296 in the codex that Raxxla had been found. Its not necessary for Raxxla to have been found for it to become a myth. Raxxla's existence may have been made known, perhaps from the Martian artifact or else from alien contact etc. Mankind needed only to know of its existence in order for the myth to be built. So this means that it need not be close to sol based on jump range arguments.

Drew's view is also contradicted by the discovery section of the codex, which we have to take as canon.

Below is my top candidate although it's too far for me to make the trip to check just now.



Note:

1. Top left shows this is from the codex
2. Location is in the errant marches, 36k light years from sol
3. Date of discovery is 2136 - 160 years before the first written mention of raxxla
4. Discoverer is thedarklord which matches the codex description of 'a sinister cabal (or sole tyrant)' discoverer


whether raxxla is there or not, it still conclusively disproves the raxxla being in a sol bubble based on tech limits/lore theory.
