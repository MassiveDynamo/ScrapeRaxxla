Diadem seems to fit best as the jewel referred to in the alleged toast in my opinion. Referred to as the gem in the Queen's crown. Being in the coma berenices, she's not exactly a mother of galaxies but in this constellation there is the The Coma Cluster having more than 30000 galaxies. Also The Coma Cluster used to be called the lock, could a door that is also a key be a lock?
