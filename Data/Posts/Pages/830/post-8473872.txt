Lol. Im in errant marshes, but the other end. I'm still 21k away away from it!!!! On my way, but might take a while before I report back.

May not be worth the trip after filthymick's discovery about the dates being wrong, but I leave that call to you.

It was probably just first found by a player called thedarklord.

Feels sloppy if the dates in the codex discovery section are off by 1200 years (Galnet says we're in 3306) but it looks like that's the case.
