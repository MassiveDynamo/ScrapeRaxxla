So have you had a go at translating it??
Nope. The thought occurred after i was back and i wish i had thought of it while i was still out there. This could be something or not but its something to investigate even if just to disprove. Would be so cool if it is

Also idk how i can determine which way is up

Edit: with all those black holes in the area there is an incredible amount of spiraling Stars visible in many systems
