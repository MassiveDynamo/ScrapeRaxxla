May not be worth the trip after filthymick's discovery about the dates being wrong, but I leave that call to you.

It was probably just first found by a player called thedarklord.

Feels sloppy if the dates in the codex discovery section are off by 1200 years (Galnet says we're in 3306) but it looks like that's the case.
Well I'm circumnavigating the rim - half raxxla hunting, half hoping UC are going to be kind enough to buy me a new FC so it's only about 4-5k ly off my intended course anyway, so may as well have a look, although I agree its probably not an NPC, but hey....gives me some purpose!
