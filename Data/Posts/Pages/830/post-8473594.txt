Poseidon is Neptune. Idk if that is connected.

I wonder if lover's woe could refer to Penelope, Odysseus' wife, queen of Ithaca Odysseus was an Argonaut who was lost for ten years while returning from the trojan war in The Odyssey. There were siren songs in that tale. And Poseidon/neptune.

I think we chased this rabbit before or we might still be lost in its hole...

Still lost!!!
Could also be Orpheus who lost his wife Eurydice twice to death?
Or Persephone? Daughter of Zeus and mother of Zeus' son Dionysus, kidnapped by Hades to become queen of the underworld, so both parent’s grief and lover’s woe in one?
And how about Sirius (brightest star in the sky for first line) which in-game has a planet Lucifer for the second line- Lucifer was supposedly worshipped by witches, & was a siren/whisperer to Eve in the Garden of Eden.
