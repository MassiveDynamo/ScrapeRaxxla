I'm not disagreeing it may not be in the bubble. That is based on lore based clues and the belief is shared by others (i.e. Drew who recapped this in the livestream, which is why I called it out in my livestream summary.).

However, isn't it also true before 3290's with the new FSD technology, FTL jumps took time. I.E. there are several historical statements stating that a jump of 'max range', which was 7 lys in a Cobra, could take week(s). If the time factor was still in play, Ryder didn't make it that far in months. Or is this no longer cannon?

the hyperspace lore is patchy and oft self contradictory. Also there are at least 3 different techs. of hyperspace.

Drew's view is based on the lore of Raxxla's first mention, but this assumes that at the time of 2296 in the codex that Raxxla had been found. Its not necessary for Raxxla to have been found for it to become a myth. Raxxla's existence may have been made known, perhaps from the Martian artifact or else from alien contact etc. Mankind needed only to know of its existence in order for the myth to be built. So this means that it need not be close to sol based on jump range arguments.
