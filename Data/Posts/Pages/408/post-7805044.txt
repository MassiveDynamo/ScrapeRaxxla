This is a huge area of the galaxy, with absolutely tons of stars...
Don't necessarily have to search the whole area.

'The region of pure light and fire; the highest heaven, where the pure element of fire was supposed by the ancients to exist: the same as the ether, the ninth heaven according to ancient astronomy.'
‘an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven,’ and being called by ‘voices that didn’t come from anything with a body’.”'

Just search a nebula that matches this. Perhaps EORM PHYLOI AA-A H13?
