The First Rule of Raxxla Hunting is nobody knows what is or isn't related to Raxxla.

I thought that was the second rule, the first being that we don’t talk about it?
Have I been following the wrong rule set all this time?
Well I’m flabbergasted
In fact my gast has never been so flabbered!


But we’ve had threads closed down in the past because they were deemed to have gone off-topic, so until some evidence suggests this stolen dbx is relevant to the Raxxla Quest I prefer to keep them separated. I suspect the Raxxla mystery is a fairly stand-alone puzzle that may only loosely be linked to anything else in ED.
