There was another guy a while back in this thread who said he "checked" all systems with words relevant to a master mason. I can't seem to find that post though.

It certainly can't hurt to check again, given that any location is as likely as any other right now.

I would disagree that there are game elements that ONLY make sense to a mason. There is an ordinary meaning to the term rift (and abyss). In fact, there's a whole RPG called "Rifts" that's centered around portals to other universes. If DB has locked some pieces of the Raxxla puzzle away behind membership in a secret society, that's not even remotely within the ballpark of "[I made the trail to Raxxla] a little bit obvious so you would know you're on the right track".

Well. That was me. Good idea. Those words btw would also make sense to someone who knows the bible, especially Solomons temple. There is an awful lot of Boas installations btw. (right hand column at the front entrance of the temple).

Edit: To clarify my words from earlier on: There is only one system that has a name which can only be understood by a master. Everything else is second degree stuff that even a well studied apprentice might guess at. (Including Gan Romeros dream - concerning that my best guess would be visiting the heart of darkness. Sag A?)
