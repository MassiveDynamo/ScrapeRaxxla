Maybe it is.....

“Our analysts have recovered a few fragments of these recordings, which appear to have been part of a dream journal. In them, Romero makes repeated mention of seeing ‘an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven,’ and being called by ‘voices that didn’t come from anything with a body’.”

Could this be alluding to Lagrange Clouds and the Notable Stellar Phenomena such as the anomalies!

To quote MB maybe we should listen to them?

It's well worth paying attention to the Romero story. He was living in Vega.

Vega is one of the best candidates for Princess Astrophel.

Perhaps something can bee seen or heard, only in that system? Some spiraling stars or something?

I like this train of thought. I'd considered this some time ago but never followed it up as there wasn't any link to the Codex...could be something.

Cant engage with these at present as investigating a number of locations referenced in Astrophel and Stella.
