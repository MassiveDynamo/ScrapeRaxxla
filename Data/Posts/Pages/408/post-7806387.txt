On a side note.. I tried to hike (supercruise) it out to the ring nebula as there is no way to jump into it (a place that isnt a place) ... But got bored at about two Huttons in... Dont think i have enough fuel anyway.

Ha ha.

I just supercruised 0.72 ly in CD-34 9020, to get 'down' to the Old Worlds plane(48.75). Jumped to Lave, to pass the center of Lave, Leesti and Diso.

Might do a full ly up from Quator and jump to Reorte, to see if that works better.
