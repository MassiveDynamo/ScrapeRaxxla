Don't necessarily have to search the whole area.




Just search a nebula that matches this. Perhaps EORM PHYLOI AA-A H13?

All the nebulae I could find in the Empyrean Straits have been explored, per EDSM. It's more than likely I'm missing something, but nebulae are obvious exploration targets. Figures they'd be explored already.
