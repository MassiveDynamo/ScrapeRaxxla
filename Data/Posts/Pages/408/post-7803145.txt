The 'area of space, not black but radiant... glowing like heaven' is a good description of the Galactic Core.
The material quoted from Gan Romero's 'dream journal' is strikingly reminiscent of Halsey's experience whilst in cryosleep in her escape pod. Could they both have seen Raxxla? It would be great if the DBX that Gan Romero is flying was something we could find in-game. Keep your eyes peeled if you're doing a Sgr A* run!

Interesting theory ... and possibly related to Jasmina Halsey's Architects. Wasn't there also something about strange sounds coming from the direction of Sagittarius A*? My memory eludes me.
