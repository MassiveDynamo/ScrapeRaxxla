Just a simple thought on a path to Raxxla.

"RA" may be, in Egyption mythology, the "Sun".
"XX" may be a "find for X" a distance traveled.
"LA" may be the first two letters of "LAve".

So, I'm plotting a path from the sun to lave, and plan to travel that path and scan everything along the way.

Probably nothing, but it should be a fun and short trip. The theory is no less valid than anything else I've heard.

I've tried RA = RA system (System available in original Elite and Elite Dangerous).

from RA system towards Lave system 20LY?
from RA system towards Alpha Centauri 20 and 50 LY (roman numerals for 70 would be LXX and for 30, XXX)
from RA system towards Sagi A 20 LY?

From original (now not available) Dark Wheel Missions...
"A Certain celestial body. Place that (its name?) isn't a place, door that (its name?) is also the key (to find?). The myth."
