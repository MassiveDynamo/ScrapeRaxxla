Where is that quote from?
Three options:
1. From the deepest abyss within the Akasha.
2. Underneath the first laid stone of the Great Pyramid at RosTau written in proto-hieroglyphs.
3. From the poetic subconscious mind of the Arch Emperor among emperors.

It is also a dynamic state: Because if I tell you, Raxxla will already be something completely alien again.

We are manifesting Raxxla as we go.... it is the road that is forming it.
