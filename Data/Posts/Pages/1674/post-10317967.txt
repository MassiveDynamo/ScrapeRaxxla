I believe Brookes wrote the Codex, he also wrote all the Gen ship stories, and he probably seeded (indirectly) various nods and winks towards a very large cosmological construct, that Raxxla is tied to directly, a concept which is vast. But ultimately not the official core narrative.
I think you might overestimate MBs contribution. He left ED for the dinosaur game in 2017, long before he left FD . He did of course partake and lead in the development of the initial background for ED. Those early text may well have been used later, in the codex and in other stories.
We know MB had the idea for Powerplay and lead the so called 'Retcon'. After that, I think it difficult to pin anything directly on him.

ED is just a computer program. New executive producers would have the same knowledge as MB had.
