Were you checking in the system or around the system? I believe the exact distance was 3,155,760 ls from the Tionisla graveyard. Although the only thing at the spot of the graveyard is the Curious partially decrypted beacon POI. I'm not sure which direction to go from it!
I've been flying around. All we have on the distance is: "At 0.1 light years from Tionisla he (Rafe) was safe from detection".

The graveyard orbits Tionisla every 234.8 days (same as New Caledonia). Anything as far out as 0.1 ly could stand basically still, if they wanted. I don't think Rafe would spend fuel to stay at a constant distance from the Graveyard.
