"The the cemetery is always between the planet and its star" . This means it has the same orbit time as the planet. It probably sits in the Lagrange point (L1).
If anyone did want to look there for it, that should be possible to check in principle. Given the relative masses, the L1 point should be just over 1% of the Tionisla - New Caledonia distance away from New Caledonia, or around 3.3 Ls away. It's hard to be more precise than that because the masses are only recorded to fairly low precision, and keeping an exact course between the planet and the star would be tricky too.

In theory there could be a hidden POI there - like the Pareco comet - which doesn't show on FSS and is only detectable by getting within 1000km so you're in its frame of reference. If so, actually finding it would require extremely careful flying.
