I've been flying around. All we have on the distance is: "At 0.1 light years from Tionisla he (Rafe) was safe from detection".

The graveyard orbits Tionisla every 234.8 days (same as New Caledonia). Anything as far out as 0.1 ly could stand basically still, if they wanted. I don't think Rafe would spend fuel to stay at a constant distance from the Graveyard.

Also - DW Page 23: "Besides, wherever we're going, we're only going a tenth of an LY. And that's basically safe (RE the safety of witch jumps at that time)."

Wait, where did you find that "The graveyard orbits Tionisla every 234.8 days"?? do you know where the graveyard is?
