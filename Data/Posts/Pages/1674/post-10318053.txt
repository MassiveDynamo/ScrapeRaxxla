I finally got one! WOOP WOOP! 8 days of patience, going to space jail and one Mexican cruise I finally got it! I've picked up a bunch of Guardian artefacts and now I'm hunting for a few Thargoid items. I picked up Trinkets of Unknown Fortune and scrapped the hunt for AI Relics.
Before I bring the FC out to the Landscape Signal, are there any more recommendations for items to bring out? Just a reminder, I'm bringing items out to see if traversing the systems around the L. Signal with said items will trigger an event.
SAP8...Solo it with cargo hatch limpets?
And any tips as it's rising up the list for things I need to try as no one has sold one to my fleet carrier so far

One thing I want to try is hanging out in some systems and see who comes sniffing for the cargo and see if it's more than just pirates.... If the DW finds you and you can't find them it might trigger something...

Oh and where did you get the trinkets from... Want to carry some of those too!
