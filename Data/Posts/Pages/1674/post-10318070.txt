Also - DW Page 23: "Besides, wherever we're going, we're only going a tenth of an LY. And that's basically safe (RE the safety of witch jumps at that time)."

Wait, where did you find that "The graveyard orbits Tionisla every 234.8 days"?? do you know where the graveyard is?
"The the cemetery is always between the planet and its star" . This means it has the same orbit time as the planet. It probably sits in the Lagrange point (L1).
