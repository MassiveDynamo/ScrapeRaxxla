If we were to choose a cake for the thread, it would probably have to be a honey cake. Did we discuss the interesting connection between chthonic figures, honey and bees in the Greek mythology a few dozen pages back? http://www.sourcememory.net/readings/Pythia.pdf ? Let's have a great Raxxla bake off.
SPOILER

I don't remember if we discussed it or if it was just me rambling about it, but bees were mentioned.
