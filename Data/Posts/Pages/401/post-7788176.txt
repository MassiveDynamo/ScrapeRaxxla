I've noticed that the contents of the witch space tunnel you travel through DOES change with location. When you are closer to the Pleiades area, there are more Thargoid looking star things, and somewhere between the main bubble and Pleiades, the dark planet looking thing I posted about appear. Generally when you're about 3/4 of the way to Pleiades. I can't seem to spot the dark planet thing when I'm anywhere else. On one occasion, while jumping back and forth in the same 30-40ly area, I spotted 3 of them during transit. I think that the things we see in hyperspace are the "obvious" clues DB mentioned. I think the real challenge is figuring out how to either enter witch space without a jump, or how to interact with whatever Raxxla is. Most lore about witch space involves structures and strange objects and I don't think thats just to add to creepy vibes.

One thing I was thinking about was maybe finding an older piece of FSD tech that could allow entry to the other dimension.

Also want to point out that the Gen ship Thetis logs describe the weird signal they got as a whisper and that mystery doesn't seem to have been fully solved yet either.

Press and hold "TAB" when jumping, that worked very well on the Atari ST...
