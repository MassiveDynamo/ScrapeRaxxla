Why is Tau Ceti suspicious? I see the dark planet in hyperspace around Tau Ceti IIRC.

CMDR Guru-951 has lots of reasons, but the main ones are
It's the only system name mentioned in the codex for TDW or Raxxla
It's described as the location of the first known mention of Raxxla (even though it says the legend is already old at the time of the first mention)
There's a station orbiting a comet, which is somewhat unusual
