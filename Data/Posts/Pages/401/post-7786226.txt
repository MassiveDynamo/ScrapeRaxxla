Hello all,
First off kudos to the peeps who have been working on this since 2015. With that being said maybe the community is looking too deep into where Raxxla is? I have the feeling this is one of those mysteries where the answer is so obvious that it gets ignored, because it can't be the obvious answer. Or could it? I have no idea what the obvious answer would be; i tried putting Raxxla in the galaxy map and nothing came up. Anyway, that is just my two cents- keep up the good work y'all!
