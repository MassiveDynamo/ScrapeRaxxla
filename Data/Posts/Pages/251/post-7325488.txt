Unlikely, since DB said Raxxla has been in-game from the outset, whereas I think CQC came later.

It could've been ingame but without means to access it, like, it can be a surface site, so it became accessable only after Horizons. Or permit-locked, which is more likely IMO.
Still i don't think 3E/4E ranks are requiered, the way it is spelled in CODEX quest to find Raxxla/DarkWheel is not a series of missions, but more like a series of things you need to do without instructions.
Also, i guess Raxxla and DW appearing in CODEX this path is some kind of a proof that the way to access it is finally implemented.


Now looking at Fluk memorial, a listening post in heart nebula. Knowing how those Formidine rift LPs were broadcasting their message only nce a day, have anyone already checked if that one does the same?
Seen an idea about it some pages earlier in that thread, not sure it's worthy, but not much worse then any other idea.
