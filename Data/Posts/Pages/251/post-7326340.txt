So im new to the hunt for the Raxxla but ive done some research, and in the opinion of you ladies and gentleman who have apparently been on the hunt for some time, what is the general consensus of the area of space that should be focused on? Near the bubble? Near Sag A? Edge of the galaxy? Or is the entire galaxy free reign? Any input is greatly appreciated, im out in the black right now and i plan to stay out there for 8 months, ill go wherever the leads take me.

Well, the thing is - most likely Raxxla and DarkWheel station are inside or close to the Bubble.
But it's as well possible that key for finding it or accessing it is far there in the void.



Also, one of strange things that i stumbled upon, it's most likely not connected to the Raxxla search, but why not:

On the wiki and Cannon website there is listed only one comms beacon for Formidine site Beta in Eafots LZ-H b10-0
However arriving there i found 2 of those.
Quick google didn't get me a definitive answer, so was it already discussed and discovered earlier, or is that one beacon a new thing, as it's not listed in the original Formidine rift project?
