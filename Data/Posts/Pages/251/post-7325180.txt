During one of the Creator Roundtable streams, DJ Truthsayer said that FDEV have come out and said that someone has actually travelled through the system that Raxxla is in, unaware of the fact.

1) Is there a source for that? I'm assuming that it was on a gameplay stream or something, rather than an official announcement or forum post. But I thought I'd ask?

2) This would narrow our search down to only previously visited systems. Which I don't know if there's a way to even catalog that considering the amount of players.

It's still a TON of systems and "narrow" isn't exactly the right term, of course, but relatively speaking it's also not 400 billion etc.

Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to track down the source of that comment and report it in this thread for verification. Nobody else who mentions this myth has mentioned a Creator Roundtable stream or DJ Truthsayer as the source, so you’re well ahead of the pack.

The common perception is that this is a load of (male cow). However given that lore implies Raxxla is likely to be within or near the current human bubble (due to limitations of early jump drives) then as a fact it is quite likely since we now understand (TDW codex entry) that FD have utilised technology that was capable of evading detection by the old style ADS.

This post will self-destruct in 10 seconds. As will I if I don’t get another coffee soon (bad night).
