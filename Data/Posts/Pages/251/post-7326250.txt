So im new to the hunt for the Raxxla but ive done some research, and in the opinion of you ladies and gentleman who have apparently been on the hunt for some time, what is the general consensus of the area of space that should be focused on? Near the bubble? Near Sag A? Edge of the galaxy? Or is the entire galaxy free reign? Any input is greatly appreciated, im out in the black right now and i plan to stay out there for 8 months, ill go wherever the leads take me.
