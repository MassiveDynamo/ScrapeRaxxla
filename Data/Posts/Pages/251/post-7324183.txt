During one of the Creator Roundtable streams, DJ Truthsayer said that FDEV have come out and said that someone has actually travelled through the system that Raxxla is in, unaware of the fact.

1) Is there a source for that? I'm assuming that it was on a gameplay stream or something, rather than an official announcement or forum post. But I thought I'd ask?

2) This would narrow our search down to only previously visited systems. Which I don't know if there's a way to even catalog that considering the amount of players.

It's still a TON of systems and "narrow" isn't exactly the right term, of course, but relatively speaking it's also not 400 billion etc.
