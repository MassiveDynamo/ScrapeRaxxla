I took a look at the Raxxla logo from the codex and here is some tin-foil I came up with. Not sure if someone else had this idea before me but at least I don't know about it.
Yeah, I stated something like that time ago here, "Bridges theory". Could be 8 bridges if we add one "up" and one "down". 8 like in Oolite...
m1 to m3 could also be some kind of defenses and the dash/dot line the "obfuscation". The central dot being the Portal/Construct..
But I keep thinking Raxxla is obfuscated in the outer rim. May have been discovered near the Bubble and then "moved" away with the help of the new alien tech. Technically, "Raxxla" can be the very Construct, not an entire planet. Like it was on Lave2 moon.
