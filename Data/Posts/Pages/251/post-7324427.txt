What do you think of the theory that you only get access to Raxxla if you have all four elite ranks? Combat - Trade - Explorer - CQC

Because:
Raxxla itself is a feudal world with reptile race with higher technology level than humans. Raxxlans were extremely hostile to every other race. War was what they loved and aimed for. Raxxla itself is not hard to find. Raxxlans will attack without hesitation giving out their location. The closer you get more aggressive they become.
