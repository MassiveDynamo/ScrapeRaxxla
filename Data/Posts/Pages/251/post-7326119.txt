Since you ask so nice, I'll give you one for the Galactic plane as well.

Coma Berenice or Berenice's hair, is an interesting constellation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Berenices

It's named after the legend of Berenice II, queen of Egypt(Greek), that sacrificed her hair to the goods(Aphrodite in particular). This was to ensure the safe return of her husband form war.



Alpha Coma Berenices is placed safely on her brow. It's also known as Diadem. Named to symbolize the jewels in her hair.

There is plenty of parets grief and lovers woe in her story as well. She had her first husband killed while in bed with his lover. The lover was Berenice's mother.
Later she was killed by order of her own son.

Coma Berenice is the home of the Coma Supercluster of galaxies. This contains several large galaxy clusters. There is also a dwarf galaxy in Coma.
In the Coma cluster of galaxies we even have the the Black Eye Galaxy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Eye_Galaxy
Black eyes is a reoccurring theme in the Astrophel and Stella poem.

What about the Ophalos, the galactic plane and the axis then?
Coma Berenice also contain the Galactic north pole.


This is easy to find in game. Just go to Sol and hit 'R', in the Galaxy map. 30 Comae Berenices is closest. 31 Comae Berenices is also very close. This matches RL data.

On a side note, Coma Berenice is constellation number 42 according to size. The answer is always 42, isn't it?

Almost forgot the constellation symbol for Coma Berenice.


It looks quite spirally.
