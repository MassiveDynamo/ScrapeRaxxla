Yeah, I stated something like that time ago here, "Bridges theory". Could be 8 bridges if we add one "up" and one "down". 8 like in Oolite...
m1 to m3 could also be some kind of defenses and the dash/dot line the "obfuscation". The central dot being the Portal/Construct..
But I keep thinking Raxxla is obfuscated in the outer rim. May have been discovered near the Bubble and then "moved" away with the help of the new alien tech. Technically, "Raxxla" can be the very Construct, not an entire planet. Like it was on Lave2 moon.

I think the symbolism already have an up and down. It's the same basic pattern as the Dark Wheel logo, hat also represents a wheel station.
I'm thinking the axis are to be viewed as:


North, south, east and west could be in either the galactic plane or the ecliptic plane.
If you use the ecliptic, you will get Polaris in 'UP' and the Royal stars approximately in NSEW. Down is a bit more questionable.
