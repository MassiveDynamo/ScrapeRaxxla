Easy way to fix possible "disappointment" is to add a rank grind fr Raxxlan ships with amazing explorer/multirole capabilities, not much unlike old specialty ships in the old games. 4 years searching for 5K LY range w/good aesthetics ? Yes, please.

Edit: I made the number relative to E's size, not actually pulled from the old games. To save confusion, i have elaborated.


Iâ€™m pretty sure they would be combat ships.
