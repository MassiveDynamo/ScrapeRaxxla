I think that is a almost neccessary conclusion. In a galactic human bubble with billions of nav computers and exploration databases it is unexplainable, how a static location with known coordinates can suddenly be lost or forgotten. If it moves however... in erratic ways like within a kind of random wormhole anomaly a "place that is not a place" could be easily lost at some point in time.

And it could be neccessary for another reason. Neccessary for solving this problem:
Once Raxxla is found, the hunt for Raxxla will be over.
ItÂ´s going to restart however if it disappears again after 4 months. everyone could try to find it, see it, use it for a while and then the hunt starts all over again.
FDev could need such a thing for keeping the player base hot for at least something..

I've seen this mechanic somewhere before... In a 1980's archive:
