There are no scouces with facts about Raxxla. All we have is the codex, Rafe Zetter’s words in TDW and a few dodgy mission descriptions.
All these are speculative in form. Neither of them claim to know for sure. There isn’t a single word from anyone that has actually been there.

We know it’s in the galaxy, because MB and DB told us. That’s all we know.
