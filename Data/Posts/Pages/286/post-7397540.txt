Considering the raxxlans' supposed supertech, and the fact thst dedicated explorers would be the hunters of similar myths, that would be a ridiculously huge letdown. Multirole or explorer, and should far surpass other ships. They teleported PLANETS, after all.

Speaking of, couldn't Raxxla still, in all theory... just... move?

Oh well, I’ll give you that. Yes, they must have all kinds of supertech including better FTL travel.

What I was trying to tell is, all stories about them includes Elite pilots with good combat skills, they have some trials on combat and such, so my guess is the primary aspect must be combat, though I’d not prefer it to be. Elite combat pilots were known as almost impossible to kill back then, but they had different promotion requirements. So that might have been changed too.
