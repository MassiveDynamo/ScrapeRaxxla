I suppose I should've specified. The lore of the books Raxxla is derived from describe a planet being lost through said rift. I'd always assumed this wasn't coincidental as the planet had two MASSIVE structures on either pole, supposedly the Omphalos rift. It has been a hot couple of years since I perused all the lore, but if you have the books, read them, because it'll take me ages to find years-old posts on reddit, youtube, etc

Which I suppose, to correct myself, doesn't necessarily make it a canonnical event, just like the old "Humans transported to other galaxies" isn't confirmed in E D (is it?)

Edit: That one: Alien World. I got my sources on this one, chief. The ORIGINAL mention of Raxxla, the lizardoid Raxxlans, their wars, and Point-to-Point travel.

Edit (Again): And good luck obtaining the books. As far as I know frontier stopped selling the old lore, and on Amazon copies sell for $100 or more. If anyone can find me the books for a reasonable price I'll directly source clues.
