Oh I know. Just making the point.

Edit - well we also know that according to one of the high ranking ceepers, TDW never found Raxxla. That’s with all the standard disclaimers about things said by characters of course, though in the context the lie/deceit side of that wouldn’t seem to be applicable, so it would probably be more of a case of how correct their knowledge was in the first place, combined with them not knowing whether anything had changed after the CIEP split off from TDW.

I suppose I should've specified. The lore of the books Raxxla is derived from describe a planet being lost through said rift. I'd always assumed this wasn't coincidental as the planet had two MASSIVE structures on either pole, supposedly the Omphalos rift. It has been a hot couple of years since I perused all the lore, but if you have the books, read them, because it'll take me ages to find years-old posts on reddit, youtube, etc
