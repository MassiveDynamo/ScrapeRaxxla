There are no scouces with facts about Raxxla. All we have is the codex, Rafe Zetter’s words in TDW and a few dodgy mission descriptions.
All these are speculative in form. Neither of them claim to know for sure. There isn’t a single word from anyone that has actually been there.

We know it’s in the galaxy, because MB and DB told us. That’s all we know.
Oh I know. Just making the point.

Edit - well we also know that according to one of the high ranking ceepers, TDW never found Raxxla. That’s with all the standard disclaimers about things said by characters of course, though in the context the lie/deceit side of that wouldn’t seem to be applicable, so it would probably be more of a case of how correct their knowledge was in the first place, combined with them not knowing whether anything had changed after the CIEP split off from TDW.
