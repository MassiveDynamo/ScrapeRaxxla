In an effort to find any clues as to TDW, I reset my double elite account to start again!
Not a mistake as it seems. In doing the first training mission on trade this message popped up.
Normally wouldn't think anything if it, but the request comes from a redacted location according to the codex.
The first clue and possibly test of TDW?
Side note, your first sidewinder does now not come from an anon benefactor but the local power in your system where you begin.
Any other cmdr's able/willing to confirm my findings?
