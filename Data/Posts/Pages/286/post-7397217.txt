Long time lurker here. This is my fourth total post.

I had the thought today that all of us are like dogs chasing a car in our search for Raxxla. What would we do if we caught/found it? How will the reality of the in game Raxxla ever hope to live up to the myth? I wonder if Frontier even intends to ever have Raxxla be found? Raxxla could serve more use as an enigma than as an actual in game destination. It’s likely locked behind a permit and it could very well stay that way. I’m not even sure that I hope that I’m wrong about that because the reveal could turn out to be very disappointing.

Easy way to fix possible "disappointment" is to add a rank grind fr Raxxlan ships with amazing explorer/multirole capabilities, not much unlike old specialty ships in the old games. 4 years searching for 5K LY range w/good aesthetics ? Yes, please.

Edit: I made the number relative to E's size, not actually pulled from the old games. To save confusion, i have elaborated.
