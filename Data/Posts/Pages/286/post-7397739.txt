Are the Thargoid maps thoroughly understood? I'd like to exhaust all potential location indicators before I start chasing ghosts in the void.

When you say maps, what do you mean? If you mean the images from the spectrograms, then yes, as answered by Jorki and HZ.

If you mean the spiral galaxy-esque projection from the Thargoid Devices then no, itâ€™s not understood.
