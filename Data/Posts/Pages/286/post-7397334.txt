Iâ€™m pretty sure they would be combat ships.

Considering the raxxlans' supposed supertech, and the fact thst dedicated explorers would be the hunters of similar myths, that would be a ridiculously huge letdown. Multirole or explorer, and should far surpass other ships. They teleported PLANETS, after all.

Speaking of, couldn't Raxxla still, in all theory... just... move?
