"Congrats, you have found Raxxla! Interaction will be available soon."
Hmm...hard to imagine.
Im not under the assumption we will be told we have found it in such a way. And as long as it isnt found it can be whatever they choose for it. It could even be a tesla car with a fake astronaut in it for all we know
