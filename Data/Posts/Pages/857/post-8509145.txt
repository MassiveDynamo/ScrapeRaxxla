In the version ive read He doesnt slay the suitors but beats them in a test of archery by shooting an arrow through a number of axes in a row proving himself to be Odysseus

i think its both, the version i remember reading said it was a contest to string and fire his old Bow, as you said, and then AFTER he wins, a maid washes his feet and realizes who is he from a scar on his leg, and then eventually he kills and hangs and the suitors, and i think 10 maids that we disloyal...
