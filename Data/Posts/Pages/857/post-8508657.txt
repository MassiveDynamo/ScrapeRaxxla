Might be unrelated... but a while ago after doing alot of SAR, I stumbled upon a similar discrepancy with The Pilots Federation.

Being already Allied with the Faction (Shinrarta Dezhra), I was surprised by an unexpected Inbox Message :
"ThePilotsFederation" congratulated me about now being regarded Friendly.

Written without spaces, exactly like that.

Needless to say, it caused a bit of confusion with me (rechecked the ShinDez Rep - and indeed I was still Allied with the Faction since years).
The whole thing made it look like there was a 2nd and completely independent entity to the Founder's World Pilots Federation Faction - now handing me Rep for successfully doing SAR (?)
(unsure if I got a screenshot, will have a look around .... edit .... nope, didn't screenshot that oddball)

I had the same thing the 1st time I went out bug zapping. Handed in my bounties to PF and they congratulated me on becoming an allied. Think it must be a bug.
