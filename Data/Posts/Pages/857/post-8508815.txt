Yes, I pointed this out a while ago.
Seems like there are different spellings (cliques?), e.g. goid hunting bonds is spelt different from that in Shinrarta & seems to have hidden progress bar. I got allied with them by goid hunting in the Pleiades. Perhaps we must get allied with them all? From EDSM searching on “Pilot” in Minor Factions I see:
Pilots Federation Local Branch - Democracy
Pilots’ Federation Local Branch - Democracy
Pilots’ Federation Administration - Corporate
PilotsFederation - suspiciously no detail! -increase rank via rescue missions or Thargoid kills
The Pilots Federation (in Shinrarta) - Democracy.
Asellus Primus Pilots Federation Local Branch Academy?? Cooperative???
N.B. AY Indi (which has population btw) - the only system with Pilot's Federation allegiance that isn't a starter system (apart from Shindez)

That's a good shout. Urrrgh. Why do these things always crop up when I'm nowhere near the bubble!?!?
