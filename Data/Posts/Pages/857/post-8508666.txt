Might be unrelated... but a while ago after doing alot of SAR, I stumbled upon a similar discrepancy with The Pilots Federation.

Being already Allied with the Faction (Shinrarta Dezhra), I was surprised by an unexpected Inbox Message :
"ThePilotsFederation" congratulated me about now being regarded Friendly.

Written without spaces, exactly like that.

Needless to say, it caused a bit of confusion with me (rechecked the ShinDez Rep - and indeed I was still Allied with the Faction since years).
The whole thing made it look like there was a 2nd and completely independent entity to the Founder's World Pilots Federation Faction - now handing me Rep for successfully doing SAR (?)
(unsure if I got a screenshot, will have a look around .... edit .... nope, didn't screenshot that oddball)

Yes, I pointed this out a while ago.
Seems like there are different spellings (cliques?), e.g. goid hunting bonds is spelt different from that in Shinrarta & seems to have hidden progress bar. I got allied with them by goid hunting in the Pleiades. Perhaps we must get allied with them all? From EDSM searching on “Pilot” in Minor Factions I see:
Pilots Federation Local Branch - Democracy
Pilots’ Federation Local Branch - Democracy
Pilots’ Federation Administration - Corporate
PilotsFederation - suspiciously no detail! -increase rank via rescue missions or Thargoid kills
The Pilots Federation (in Shinrarta) - Democracy.
Asellus Primus Pilots Federation Local Branch Academy?? Cooperative???
N.B. AY Indi (which has population btw) - the only system with Pilot's Federation allegiance that isn't a starter system (apart from Shindez)
