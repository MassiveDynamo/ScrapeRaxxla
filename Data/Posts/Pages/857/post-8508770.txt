But the reason I find it even more curious, is because if you check in Drew Wagar's live streams, he himself, is a member of the Squadron "Dark Wheel".
Here's where I know ppl are going to disagree with me the most, but what if Drew is in fact a member of the "Dark Wheel", but has chosen to act as though he is not, in my opinion due to the fact of not having the "Dark Wheel" station as a home base or somthing. But either way, the "Dark Wheel" is and has been, supposedly looking for Raxxla, well, Drew admits hes been looking for it himself and is very interested and invested in finding it....

Yep, he is a member as am I and about a dozen others. Our home discord is The Independent Raxxla Hunters -> https://discord.com/invite/bfMXJr4 under the #dark-wheel-squad. We have a PC and and Xbox version.
