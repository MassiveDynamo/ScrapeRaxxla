OK, has my tin foil just just reacted with my microwave, or did I just find somthing curious.....

I know we all refer to TDW as "The Dark Wheel", BUT i just noticed, that if you check the Codex entries, its not refered to as "The Dark Wheel", its refered to as "the Dark Wheel". Small difference, but the English language uses capital letters in certain ways, and if we take the rules of the language into account, the group isnt "The Dark Wheel" but is in fact "Dark Wheel"....

NOW, that in and of itself, is interesting and could be a missed clue....

But the reason I find it even more curious, is because if you check in Drew Wagar's live streams, he himself, is a member of the Squadron "Dark Wheel".
Here's where I know ppl are going to disagree with me the most, but what if Drew is in fact a member of the "Dark Wheel", but has chosen to act as though he is not, in my opinion due to the fact of not having the "Dark Wheel" station as a home base or somthing. But either way, the "Dark Wheel" is and has been, supposedly looking for Raxxla, well, Drew admits hes been looking for it himself and is very interested and invested in finding it....

hmmmm.... any thoughts?
