Thanks! Ya not really expecting anything - I figured it was about time i wandered out this way... Was kind of working off of the hunch that as the codex and the galactic regions came about at the same time - the references in the codex might relate to the regions. But so far my personal journey has not included any hot sirens.
After you have been out here a while, the bio sites start whispering to you. Does that count? ;-)
