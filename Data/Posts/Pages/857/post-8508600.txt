@simulacrae: you want HOT Sirens???
In Space all Sirens are absolutely cold!

With the recent announcement of Elite Odyssey I’ve been mildly toying with trying to match Homer’s Odyssey to the DW Toast (I imagine FD hints everywhere!) -Odysseus wandered around on his Odyssey journey trying to return home after the Trojan War. He encountered sirens!
Jewel-? Helen??
Whisperer/siren-Circe
Parent’s grief-Anticlea
Lover’s woe-Penelope
Yearning of vagabond hearts-Ithaca/Home

Not checked for in-game references. Busy Questing!

Ok you have sold me on The Odyssey as the toast.. but i still hold that sirens have to be hot!. Also i would say whisperer/ siren is just the sirens. what yelboc said about jewel.... ya Helen might be a bit of a stretch... i mean there was "priams treasure" and the helen cult was conflated a bit with demeter.... but ya especially with the new thing coming out as Odyssey.... might be worth a deeper look.
