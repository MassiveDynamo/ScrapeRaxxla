Might be unrelated... but a while ago after doing alot of SAR, I stumbled upon a similar discrepancy with The Pilots Federation.

Being already Allied with the Faction (Shinrarta Dezhra), I was surprised by an unexpected Inbox Message :
"ThePilotsFederation" congratulated me about now being regarded Friendly.

Written without spaces, exactly like that.

Needless to say, it caused a bit of confusion with me (rechecked the ShinDez Rep - and indeed I was still Allied with the Faction since years).
The whole thing made it look like there was a 2nd and completely independent entity to the Founder's World Pilots Federation Faction - now handing me Rep for successfully doing SAR (?)
(unsure if I got a screenshot, will have a look around .... edit .... nope, didn't screenshot that oddball)

Interesting.... not sure if related, but along the same lines forsure...

I think we need to assume that Fdev is careful when inputing names, to ensue things like Capitals are used and not used correctly.....

In that case, we should be looking for a group of people or a station owned/run by "Dark Wheel" not "The Dark Wheel", which would also point to the group in ShinDez being a "front" or "misdirection", as referenced in the codex for tDW.
