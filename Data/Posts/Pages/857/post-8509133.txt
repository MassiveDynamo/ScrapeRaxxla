It has to be something in space, as it has been around since before Horizons.
This doesnt mean it has been accessible since inception.

It should be also noted that odysseus dresses as a beggar/vagabond before re-rentering his own palace to slay the suitors. The jewel never fitted for me.. otherwise there is a reasonable fit (it was one of my oldest theories..) and if it was a fit, what then?
In the version ive read He doesnt slay the suitors but beats them in a test of archery by shooting an arrow through a number of axes in a row proving himself to be Odysseus
