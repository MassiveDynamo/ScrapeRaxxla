Recently Iâ€™ve been looking at various directional elements, as an attempt at confirming or discounting various theories.

In one of these I applied the Anemoi or Greek wind compass theory. Thanks to the insight of @Jorki Rasalas, regarding Aeolus the Greek god of wind; h welled refresh my memory and I realised there were more of these winds represented in game than simply just North and South.

I had intentionally previously ignored them, because they simply did not correlate to each other, so I discarded them. I only applied the N/S Anemoi recently as a test, and was surprised by the correlation with Norse mythology and Greek mythology.

In an attempt to test this theory for bias I returned to those lesser winds and found I had actually not taken account for another Greek wind compass, Aristotles meteorology, which utilises many of the same points as the Anemoi.


Boreas = N; Zephyrus = W; Eurus = E; Notus = S; Kaikias = NE is not in game; Apeliotes = SE is not in game; Lips = SW and god of winds.




Aparctias = N; Caecias = NE; Apeliotes = E but not in game; Eurus = SE; Notos = S; Lips = SW; Zephyrus = W; Argestes = NW



This is when I noted certain discrepancies, obviously these two philosophies have an historical separation. But my thinking would presume if they were both put in game arbitrarily there ought not be any correlation. The following is both layers combined.



Now; is this random, in error, arbitrary or intentional? What happens if we overlay these with our Greek gods; Yggdrasil theory?



Personally, I still feel the North / South alignment is correct. However Aristotles version seems be in alignment with Artemis and Hecate! I find this most peculiar.
Perhaps Milton's own wavering between the Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomical models might play a role?
