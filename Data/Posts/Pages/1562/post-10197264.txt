They all point to Sol because the survey was conducted using Earth-based telescopes. As Han_Zen says the distance measurements are pretty suspect.
This sort of thing happens frequently. Check any stars you suspect against the Simbad astronomical database (https://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/mobile/) as the in-game names may differ depending on which IRL star catalogue FD used to import the data. Some stars have many, many names!
