Yes, I've bookmarked these systems in-game and cleared away a few old ones to help me see more clearly but finding groups of deities is not helping me right now - e.g. there's Zeus almost next door to Artemis but that doesn't help me know where to search, it only tells me the placement is not likely to be random. The location along the axis in your diagrams that I read as being about one third along from heaven to hell passes through the core systems and is not that far from the new starter systems. I feel that I am not reading the diagrams right. A shame Ordnance Survey do not make treasure maps!

I am still stuck on a route to take from Persephone but the Bridge system is separate from all the deities and off to one side of the Bubble, so I'm not sure that's the right path to take.

I noticed that the Maeve system is very close to Paradiso but there's nothing of interest in either system. Paradiso is empty and Maeve is low population - I mapped and flew by the two ringed gas giants there and found no points of light in the rings.
