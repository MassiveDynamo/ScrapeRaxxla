On that note: Brookes wrote the Raxxla stuff apparently but Allen Stroud weaved the Holdstock stuff with the modern lore. Stroud probably took guidance from Brookes when merging the lore. Brookes ideas are at least in part connected to themes from Holdstock.

Probably worth a read. Any theme that Stroud and Brookes reference is probably worth considering.

Elite Dangerous's core lore person isn't Michael Brookes .. examining the breadcrumb trail of Allen Stroud
This is a repost from Independent Raxxla Hunters discord where someone had mentioned the lore stream and the fact there might be Raxxla references elsewhere. This is my response because it is has become increasingly evident Michael Brookes while instrumental in building the Elite Dangerous...
