Yup what they said. The cataloging of RL stars is not spread across our entire field of view from Sol, they are usually focused upon one small area of scientific interest, Pulsars etc, any stars in direct line of sight are catalogued as well.

FD imported these by hand, they didn’t import everything, and they made mistakes, but failed to identify many of these anomalies in a 3D sense, it’s prominent throughout the game.

There are multiple weird hand placed names in these strings, theres Tycho in Orion which has no reason to be there etc.. but I wouldn’t put it past FD to utilising them to drop hints!

Maybe the system ‘Legacy’ is there because they what you to read Michael Brookes book, because it holds more clues!

Besides our pendant world was fixed from the floor/wall of heaven, and the distance was of no great length.

That specific quote of Milton is open to interpretation, but I always felt it simply states Paradise shone like a star in brilliance, in the void of chaos, but it was small relative to the brilliance and size of the heavens, as like a star is in comparison with the moon seen from Earth.

It’s also generally accepted Milton intentionally blurred his descriptive descriptions, to give us a dizzying sense of incomprehension of the enormous distance he is attempting to convey (which are truly mind boggling for that period).

Plus I may be wrong but the constellation of Orion has no import on Paradise Lost. It was I think used to convey a tempest / storm. But generally these stars existed within the same spherical shell as we did. Outside of that globe was just chaos, heaven and hell… constellations we’re used in the text, but from memory I believe they only were utilised to convey the path of Lucifer when he descended into our sphere, then flew through our universe, down through the spheres!

But nevertheless, great work.
