Context on this:

Find the King of the Grove (TDW) - Underworld

Find Raxxla - back to Eden

Pray you can stop what is coming with the knowledge gained during the Quest.
Interesting - so perhaps The Dark Wheel base is in the Underworld region?!

Thanks for linking the Wikipedia articles; it does make more sense now. Especially with Darik Cavus being an escaped slave!
I am going to see how Artemis lines up with Hecate and other related goddesses (I know Hors, a moon goddess, is in the game as it is permit-locked and needs EDIT: Federal Navy Auxiliary rank to unlock). There may be another triangle, like with Migard-Alioth-Bifrost, that will help to define a region to search.
