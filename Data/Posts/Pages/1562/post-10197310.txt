Just mapped the fates, in relation to the Greek gods and the Greek wind compass the Anemoi. It still corresponds to my minds eye, and the fates triangulate nicely, but their alignment seems off / or does it?


*White denotes the Greek god’s systems linked to the story of Persephone. Green line denotes the Greek north wind compass. Orange line denotes the 3 fates - Clotho, Atropos and Lachesis.

They sit nicely up high with Helios, but don’t seem to sit ‘around’ any common axis?
