Well, not sure what's going on, but am partially convinced - that FD are giving us some kind of clue. I've never seen Raxxla mentioned in a system description before, and if that's not a hint, I don't know what is.

Let the tinfoillery begin!

The system description is from the player faction 'The Order'. I would not put to much in to it.
