So I agree with Sir Mr. Preem Admiral-whatever Rasalas (jks!) and the Codex was obviously empty, as nothing of Raxxla has been found by anyone yet. Maybe that also finally kills the idea that the Raxxla 'system' has been visited in the past(?), as the codex is going to be retroactive to an extent.

Personally I do think there is some significance to the choice of icon they used for it and that should not be discounted in our tin-foiling.

To the poster's point about it being mythical and not existing, FDev have confirmed that it IS in-game, so there is definitely something there somewhere, we just don't know WHAT 'it' is.

The journey is far from over Cmdrs... o7
