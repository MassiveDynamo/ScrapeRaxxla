... FD are giving us some kind of clue. I've never seen Raxxla mentioned in a system description before, and if that's not a hint, I don't know what is.
TBH I wouldn't be surprised if the beta/actual release Codex doesn't have the Raxxla and/or the Dark Wheel boxes, and they were only put in to troll us and promote discussion (which i'd be fine with).

I mean no other faction has a codex box: superpowers; other races; corps; "individuals" (presumably notable people like leaders and engineers); and Colonia (and entire mini-bubble of expanse). TDW doesn't seem in the same league as any of those collections. Rax was meant to be "no hints".
So yeah I wouldn't be surprised if it was a wind-up
