TDW seems also to be confirmed being that tiny little bit obvious thing. And now it has an official emblem. It is NOT a mere minor faction, in ED !!



Is that the Elite rank symbol ? Seems to confirm the relation: Elite Rank/TDW/Raxxla ?

Looks exactly the same (well when not highlighted, this is obviously inversed colours) as the new right panel -> Ship -> Pilot Preferences tab-option:



So either TDW refers to "your personal journey", linking back to your ship and pilot, or maybe it's just re-used assets
