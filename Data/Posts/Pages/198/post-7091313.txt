So you think it's just an ordinary planet, that FDev decided "Okay, Col Sector 18456 A7 is Raxxla. Done!"? Again, it's one of the more depressing and realistic theories I've seen. I sincerely hope it's wrong, but I can't shake the feeling that it could be right.
The obvious candidate for "it's just an ordinary planet" is Ra 10a

10 in roman numerals is X
Ra 10 is the largest Gas Giant in the system - 'extra large', or XL. Coincidence?

So Ra X(XL) a ... or more conventionally Ra 10a ... is Raxxla.
