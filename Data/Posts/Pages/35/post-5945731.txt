Yes I hope so. Despite my various hypotheses about galaxy seeds, etc, I honestly think that the only way to find Raxxla is by actually playing the game. MB said there will be no clues, so why do we keep looking for them? Raxxla is in game, so to find it we need to play the game.

Excep with 400billion stars, & maybe 10planets (a guesstimate!) per star on average, then it's going to be a very long search!
