Didnt sap 8 cores have to be pirated from a fed cargo hold?

Indeed, however not sure sure about only Fed. So far I have 15 Hafnium 178, and 14 Antiquities, still haven't seen Any SAP 8 Core containers. The Type-9 Heavy's with Point Defences are the most difficult for acquisition work.

Convoy Dispersal Pattern, threat 3 & 4 are the ones that could carry the containers. The convoy arrangements I seen so far are:

1 Type-9 Heavy escorted with 2-3 Anaconda's, all may carry fighters.
2 Type-9 Heavy's, one with Anaconda escorts, the other with Cobra MkIII escorts. Wait until Cobra MkIII escort jumps away before engaging.
3 Type-9 Heavy's, one Vulture escort. These are carrying H.E. suits, Progenitor Cells/Performance Enhancers, and Basic Medicines. This pattern is seen in a Threat 4.
