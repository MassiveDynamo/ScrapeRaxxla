However there is a star class in the game called "Rogue Planet" ... or they're not implemented in game yet or there are billions but we've not yet worked out how to find them.

If Braben and Michael have said Raxxla is out there, so in-game and findable, and before Horizons launched, then surely we must be able to get to it with basic tools only.

Question: has anyone tested the Advanced Discovery Scanner to see if it does have a range?
Like jump into an un-honked system, do not honk, fly 1.01Ly (light year) away from the main star / planets, and then honk. Or fly beyond whatever the furthest honk that's ever been successful from jumping, for your scan back.

Maybe the "unlimited" has a range, and rogue planets are outside the ADS honk range?
