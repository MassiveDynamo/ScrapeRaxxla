I recently surveyed the border of Bovomit ( https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...x-Expedition?p=5905104&viewfull=1#post5905104 ) and found no sign of spacefaring civilisations, however I made no planetary landings due to terrain generation and graphical problems (which have since cleared up for the moment). The detailed report I link to provides locations that you might want to check for activity, e.g. Ammonia Worlds. I am waiting on the Sidgoir border for 2.4, having completed my survey there, and will head for Froadik next. I think you have more chance of seeing anything new at Bovomit, as Sidgoir is relatively small (only 200 LY across). Fly safe!

Thanks for the guide!
