Chances are its going to be some lone pilot who plays in solo and has never heard of Raxxla who will find "it". They'll dock, refuel and never look back. Years later they'll mention having once docked at a very unique starport ... but can't remember what it was called or where it was. Oh well.
Yes I hope so. Despite my various hypotheses about galaxy seeds, etc, I honestly think that the only way to find Raxxla is by actually playing the game. MB said there will be no clues, so why do we keep looking for them? Raxxla is in game, so to find it we need to play the game.
