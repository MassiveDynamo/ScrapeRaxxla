fwiw
the stars etc. seem to align mostly ok between EDO and EDH
but each body does seem to be on a different rotation

in horizons, park on a body
relog into EDO and it is a different location but same body and not likely parked

in horizons, park Near a body
relog into EDO and it is has moved by roughly half of its daily rotation
this seems to vary a lot from system to system. hard to measure something that should not exist. need an anchor point. in space. in a moving galaxy.
the rotation gap also seems to be continuously growing.

in Horizons everything looks normal
in EDO everything sparkles, the sand, ice, stars.
you stop moving and most of it stops sparkling.

if there are some sync loops created to keep edo and edh properly aligned, it needs fixing.
it makes little sense that there are 2 sets of bodies, so it has to be the routines used to place things in the skybox
why different between the 2 versions when you can really only be in one at a time for a given cmdr, is just confusing.
I enjoy the sky in Horizons
I dislike the sky immensely in Odyssey. it feels painted, not real, distant. it feels low grade compared to horizons. between that and the new witchspace, feels like a huge downgrade.
and why I spend most of my time in Horizons still.
where it feels like I can easily go and touch any star I see. and the sky is not subject to visual degradation if you move.

and nothing to do with raxxla other than it, we and the twinkles are all in the same place.
if twinkle twinkle little star is a clue to anything, I quit.
