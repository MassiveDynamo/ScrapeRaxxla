If you don't get anywhere with this let me know, I'm up for trying making a map. Let me know.
Thanks more the merrier I say.

I’m currently distracted as I follow in the footsteps of the Morning Star’s journey; across the brow of the crystalline sphere, very likely nothing there.

Then to Delphi and some mapping, taking my jolly time.

My considerations are to better understand the actual ‘shape’ of the exterior and interior, maybe to utilise some colour gradients to better define the shape, or look for repeating structures which might identify its shape where it’s hidden.

The objective is to assess if it is truly hexagonal or octagonal in shape.

The simplest solution is the dot/circle denotes an Omphalos; the 3 prongs the map room; the inner hexagon the interior of the vessel and the larger hexagon the exterior, the six lines potentially interior tunnels or repeating external structures (memory tells me some tunnels were blocked by debris).

Doubtful as my mind presumes it to be octagonal.
