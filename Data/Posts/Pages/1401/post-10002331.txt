I never did any measurements
but, I can fit 3/4 of my conda inside the rear wings, as in to the opening at the bottom side of the Thargoid
and it fits with some room to spare inside the actual main room, the Pilots Chamber, the Thargoid device chamber. length-wise
Height, could probably put 2 maybe 3 condas on top of each other inside.

and that map, is the pathway that goes around the main chamber.

As mentioned before, I was able to get a conda inside to take photos...lotsa room.

the wings, I have photos of my tiny conda parked on one, you can barely see the conda...
but they are separated and not a part of the main ship body.sooo big, like 20 condas long x 5 condas high...
heh feels like cowboy measurements..
