someone asked some days ago about the lights on the antenna, I know myself and many have checked it in many stations for various things long ago
I consider them Citadels. they are huge when you get up close. Like the largest skyscraper in town.. some have billions of people in them.
looks like a lot of effort to design.
anyway, not relevant imo but some stations antenna have a section near the bottom that looks exactly like the large black portions of the Raxxla logo.
never really noticed that before.
