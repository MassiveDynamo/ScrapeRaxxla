Still got around 150 jumps (from initial 254) for Jorki to get to the next candidate gravitational wave source for “comet/Raxxla” search, so second account (young clone Tyko) is going to spend some time going out to a nearer candidate (which on reconsideration may just be a better bet), before Stargoids arrive!
