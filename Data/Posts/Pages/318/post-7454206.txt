I have 5 triple accounts, and I haven't seen anything yet.

PS: Someone on the OA/DJ stream comments mentioned a sighting in Tionisla between 9A/9B, will check tomorrow.

Have some rep for five triple elite accounts- that is staying power compadre!

I’m ranking up my second account at the moment since DW2 is having a short intermission at Sag A*, and I don’t think I ever want to see another courier mission!

Just a thought, but “personal journey” could conceivably also include full Fed Admiral and Empire King ranking.
