Another crazy idea. RAXXLA is so strange name. Was it descripted in old books? This doubled XX and single L... Right arm shoulder shoulder and left arm? No. It is so similar with Roman numerals. And so easy to start thinking about Col 70 Sector systems. That LXX = 70. But what is RA and A? There was "medieval Roman numerals" with alphabetical numerals... No! I should to stop here! Mixing numerals is the wrong way.

Only problem is Raxxla moved. So even if it points to the original location its not there anymore.
