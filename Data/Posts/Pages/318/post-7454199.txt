To begin with NGC 7822 begins nearly on the border of the "Elysian Shores" sector. The Elysian Shores in greek mythology is related to the underworld and hence, persephone, hecate, etc...
From a more scientific perspective, NGC 7822 is part of the Cepheus constellation, named after a Greek figure who was married to none other than Cassopeia.

Not to mention that the Gorgon Research Facility is in the nebula. The Gorgon Medusa's head was used by Perseus to kill Cetus the sea monster to save Andromeda.
