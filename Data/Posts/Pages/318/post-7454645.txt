Checked this morning and Col 70 was on the other side of the moon. The antenna seemed to be pointing in exactly the opposite direction. I suppose it has to do something if it's looking at the wrong half of the sky.

Merely single Elite here, closing in on double (trade), but a long way off triple so I hope it doesn't matter!

Edit:

I wish I'd thought to look for stations controlled by TDW (like Neumann) when I was getting allied! Carto data would have been a lot quicker than data missions and donations from Jamesons.

Nothing special on the mission board at Neumann Camp, btw. Is that how the TDW "Raxxla" missions were offered or were they direct like the Obsidian meta-alloy ones?

They were offered also outside SD, I did get two offered when I was in Apurui on the mission board I did do them successful then Horizons came and they were removed.
