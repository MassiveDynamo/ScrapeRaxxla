Shintara is one of the twelve heavenly generals.

Reading the description of the rare god: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Waters_of_Shintara, it seems Shintara is the name of a Planet. Most likely the name of Founders World.

Shintara the general seem to be the personification of "Universal Worthy" in budism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Heavenly_Generals

This seem like a reasonable name for such a planet.
