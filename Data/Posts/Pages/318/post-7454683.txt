May Raxxla hidden by mixing appearance for the radar and for the world? For example CMDR looking on the object and viewing it as a star. But in the world it is the planet. Or it may be black hole with ELW appearance. Just have read some Galnet news and found that BH background picture for some news themes. BH that looks like the star on the radar model. Then... Nevermind. It was just the old interface and non targeted BH. But I have thought some time about that picture. Found only part of the name on the left mini panel - 11 A. Oh, nothing new. No any "Raxxla was here" ;D
