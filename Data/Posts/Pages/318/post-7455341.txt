Another crazy idea. RAXXLA is so strange name. Was it descripted in old books? This doubled XX and single L... Right arm shoulder shoulder and left arm? No. It is so similar with Roman numerals. And so easy to start thinking about Col 70 Sector systems. That LXX = 70. But what is RA and A? There was "medieval Roman numerals" with alphabetical numerals... No! I should to stop here! Mixing numerals is the wrong way.

Greek numerals work better. You get 101 600 631. That at least looks like coordinates.

Not that I have found anything at any of the combinations or negative number varieties.
