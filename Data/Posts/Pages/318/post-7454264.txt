Neither do I. I constantly go back to Michael Brookes’ comment thtat it “is a little bit obvious”. That comment was made ages ago, before any Codex ‘hints’ and subsequent mythological rabbit hole hunting.

So what is “a little bit obvious” in the game?
To my mind it is either 1) hidden in Shinrarta Dezhra system, 2) the clue is given by the name of “Shinrarta Dezhra”-translates as “life, she saw, hope”, or 3) it is depicted in either the non-Horizons start menu screen or the introductory video. I cannot see that anything else can be said to be obvious (dictionary definition: easily perceived or understood; clear, self-evident, or apparent).

P.S. Someone posted that rare good “water of shintara” comes from SD. Note the ‘Shintara’ not ‘Shinrarta’, might be an FD spelling mistake (not exactly unknown), or might be a subtle clue? Think this has also been in-game from the beginning.
