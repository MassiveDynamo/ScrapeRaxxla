I know its unlikely because of the eight moon around gas giant thing but that's the Dark Wheel station not Raxxla, what if Raxxla is on Triton in Sol, that thing is permit locked for a reason and maybe you get the permit by finding the real Dark Wheel. I don't buy it's locked so FDev can test stuff there's plenty of permit locked regions for them to play about with. Highly unlikely but not the craziest theory I've heard or thought of for Raxxla
