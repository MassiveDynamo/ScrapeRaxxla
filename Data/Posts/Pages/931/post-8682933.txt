The mother of galaxies!

Gaia â€“ Mother of Galaxies
In Greek mythology, Gaia is the personification of the Earth and one of the Greek primordial deities. Gaia is the ancestral mother of all life. She is the mother of Uranus (the sky), from whose sexual union she bore the Titans (themselves parents of many of the Olympian gods), the Cyclopes, and the Giants; of Pontus (the sea), from whose union she bore the primordial sea gods. Earth is the centre of the universe, the underworld and the sky are the sum total of the known universe.

At the time of writing of the Odyssey astronomy followed the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, often exemplified specifically by the Ptolemaic system) which is a description of the Universe where the Earth is at the center. Under the geocentric model, the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets all orbited Earth.
