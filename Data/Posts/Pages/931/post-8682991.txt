and if you put it all together you'll be most likely none the wiser.... ;-)

but here's my go....
To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! - From Earth to Sirius
To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! - To Pleiades to Boötes
The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. - Anticlea (Prism System) to Penelope (no reference in Gal Map… but Arcadia from Astrophel and Stella? - see below) and to Ithaca

Astrophel and Stella
Some have suggested that the love represented in the sequence may be a literal one as Sidney evidently connects Astrophil to himself and Stella to Lady Penelope Devereux, afterward Lady Rich. Sidney and Lady Penelope had been betrothed when the latter was a child. For some reason the match was broken off, and Lady Penelope married Lord Rich, with whom she lived for a while most unhappily. She is thought to be the Penelope Rich, the wife of Robert Rich, 3rd Baronet. Payne and Hunter suggest that modern criticism, though not explicitly rejecting this connection, leans more towards the viewpoint that writers happily create a poetic persona, artificial and distinct from themselves.

The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia, also known simply as the Arcadia, is a long prose pastoral romance by Sir Philip Sidney written towards the end of the 16th century. Having finished one version of his text, Sidney later significantly expanded and revised his work. Scholars today often refer to these two major versions as the Old Arcadia and the New Arcadia. The Arcadia is Sidney's most ambitious literary work by far, and as significant in its own way as his sonnets.
