Fantastic work @Emperor . The first time in a long while I have read a series of posts and though "could be onto something here"

Well it's not all correct and not quite worked out but I thought as Jorki was bored and other's might correct some of the mistakes/missing bits it was worth putting my thoughts out there...

I'm not the first to link it to Greek mythology or the Odyssey, many have however with the next chapter name it is "a little bit obvious" and I thought it was time I should actually look at Homer's work in more detail.... and there are links to Homer's work all over the place (Thargoid names, generations ships, where the Thargoids first appeared, etc, etc).

Other constellations in the Odyssey are worth looking at and trying to fit with some of the toast, and I don't see too much linking to the Iliad (possibly that's viewed as the Thargoid's first war and this is the 2nd part).

And above all there's one thing linking it all to the Odyssey and then working out what it means....

But I bet some people will be off to Ithaca to check that system out... ;-)
