I guess if i were to pick a mythological link to Mother of Galaxies these days it would be Rhea (Daughter of Gaia)

Rhea is the Mother of the Gods... The myth of how she saved baby Zeus from being swallowed by Cronos incorporates both the Omphalos as well as the Galaxy.
Rhea wraps a stone in swaddling clothes and pretends to give it milk ... it spills and becomes the Milky Way... from mothers milk (Galaxias being Ancient Greek for Milk).
The stone Rhea used is apparently often described as the Omphalos stone that became the "navel of the world".

As to the Jewel on the brow... I got nothing .. I suppose it could be the Omphalos itself?

Yes I considered that one too!

Got stuck on the jewel too... and settled on Gaia as the mother of galaxies as it starts from Earth as the birth place of humanity, the geocentric model of the universe at the time and also linked in with Sirius nicely in the Odyseey being the brightest star in the sky at the time (with it's relevance to Elite and expansion of humanity across the galaxy with hyper-drive technology).

I also personally think the "Toast of the Dark Wheel" takes you to their base as part 1 of the mystery and then there's the Raxxla codex which would need decrypting for part 2... for the "To Raxxla" bit...

Not to say Gaia is correct, just seemed to fit nicely and Rhea could be in the next part as "Raxxla is said to hold an alien artefact called the Omphalos Rift"
