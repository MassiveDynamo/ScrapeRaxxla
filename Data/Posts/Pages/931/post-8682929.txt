The siren of the deepest void!

Odysseus must also encounter the Sirens in order to get home and is told how to avoid the fate of the Siren’s calls by Circe by using beeswax to block the ears of his sailors. She advises he can hear the song himself if he is bound to the mast and instructs his crew to ignore his commands to release him until they have passed danger of the siren’s.
