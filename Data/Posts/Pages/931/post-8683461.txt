The mother of galaxies!

Gaia â€“ Mother of Galaxies
In Greek mythology, Gaia is the personification of the Earth and one of the Greek primordial deities. Gaia is the ancestral mother of all life. She is the mother of Uranus (the sky), from whose sexual union she bore the Titans (themselves parents of many of the Olympian gods), the Cyclopes, and the Giants; of Pontus (the sea), from whose union she bore the primordial sea gods. Earth is the centre of the universe, the underworld and the sky are the sum total of the known universe.

At the time of writing of the Odyssey astronomy followed the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, often exemplified specifically by the Ptolemaic system) which is a description of the Universe where the Earth is at the center. Under the geocentric model, the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets all orbited Earth.

I guess if i were to pick a mythological link to Mother of Galaxies these days it would be Rhea (Daughter of Gaia)

Rhea is the Mother of the Gods... The myth of how she saved baby Zeus from being swallowed by Cronos incorporates both the Omphalos as well as the Galaxy.
Rhea wraps a stone in swaddling clothes and pretends to give it milk ... it spills and becomes the Milky Way... from mothers milk (Galaxias being Ancient Greek for Milk).
The stone Rhea used is apparently often described as the Omphalos stone that became the "navel of the world".

As to the Jewel on the brow... I got nothing .. I suppose it could be the Omphalos itself?
