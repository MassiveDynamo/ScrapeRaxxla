Ok, I'll have a look when next in from the Nav Panel. Since it's non-landable, I couldn't see the POIs on the planet as per normal geological, or bases that I've landed at in the past and there were no conflict zones or anything else nearby. I left the game just near the planet, so I'll see if it's a persistent experience or glitched.

Edited: I re-read your comment, and I was thinking of the System Map, Planet details and seeing the POI there. I already did check the Nav Panel looking for these 4 human POIs and nothing appeared nested under the planet, hence the post. I'll re-check both soon anyway.

Thx.

Logged back in and re-scanned the planet.
This time the two Human (2) Notable Signals are appearing correctly in my Nav panel, and also I can select them in-game.
1. Ultimate Mobile Guard Bureau (Security Installation)
2. HR-1183 AMAETHEON-CLASS CROPPER (Megaship)

Nothing on-planet (as it should be for non-landable planets) they're all space signals.

Whew, I thought I was going crazy for a minute, then I realized I'm hunting for TDW and RAXXLA so I must already be crazy!
