There is somewhere a math animation of traveling through Dyson hexagon sphere. With exact number of dashed lines inside.
Posted it some time ago somewhere on the forum. Math rules!

"Bless us, divine number, thou who generated gods and men! O holy, holy Tetractys, thou that containest the root and source of the eternally flowing creation! For the divine number begins with the profound, pure unity until it comes to the holy four; then it begets the mother of all, the all-comprising, all-bounding, the first-born, the never-swerving, the never-tiring holy ten, the keyholder of all"
