From wikipedia on the Dance of the Seven Veils,

Bentley notes that the Mesopotamian goddess Inanna "performed the first documented striptease" when she descended into the underworld in search of Tammuz. Inanna had to "relinquish her jewels and robes at each of the seven gates to the underworld until she stands naked in the 'land of no return.' Oscar Wilde assigned this symbolic descent to the underworld of the unconscious, a ceremony that equates stripping naked to being in a state of truth, the ultimate unveiling, to Salome."
