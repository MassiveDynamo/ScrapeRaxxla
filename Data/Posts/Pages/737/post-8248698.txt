yes, there are very crazy things here in caves, advanced agriculture to be aboriginal people at the time, it is believed that they used boats, worshiped the sun (magek) and things like that, also animals, there are even small pyramids on some islands, they had their legends .... resisted the conquest for 100 years and several generations only with stones and sticks ambushing from ravines, that is now unthinkable, we are a speck of dust on the globe, I think the · "conquest" of America cost less time, some knowledge they should have... but Christianization destroyed almost everything, nor do we natives know their secrets well and most do not know them completely,they spanishized us ,
but we sound less refined talking.

What is also interesting is that the Guanches have been traced back genetically to the Berbers.





Some might recognize the symbols from other iconography

One of the most famous was the Berber Queen Dihya or Kahina. Her title was cited by Arabic-language sources as al-Kāhina (the priestess soothsayer). This was the nickname given to by her Muslim opponents because of her alleged ability to foresee the future.



Of course in ED, we have another famous Kahina or Dihya from Drew Wagar's books https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Kahina_Tijani_Loren



Our Kahina has the Imperial Courier Seven Veils.

And the Salome of old is famous for her dance of the Seven Veils before Herod II.

Even though Drew is not involved with Raxxla, his source materials are so very interesting
