I'm assuming as CQC was added after Elite Dangerous release, in theory, it is not related to Raxxla once we were told it exists in-game since day one.
The argument exists that being in game and being reachable are not the same. That pink background galaxy (Andromeda?) Is in game but we cant get to it, right? Im not trying to discredit you, only pointing out how this could still be involved somehow. I would personally prefer to think its not involved as i get trashed everytime ive cqc'd because it was against ColonelScouse, who i believe to be the absolute best combat pilot in the galaxy. Also im doodoo with all fixed hardpoints
