I decided to take Drews Salome as lore and will no be taking missions or selling data or bonds etc, currently trying to get a Billion in Combat Bonds stored up just to see if it triggers a response from DW, I fink Raxxla search has driven me maaaaaaaaaad!
(Oh and Mick, CQC seems to be fixed on PS4, so if ye wants to boost some points for Elite hit me up, I've only 3 million more to go lol).
