New monster taming game coming out called TemTem, published by Humble Bundle:

"The Archipelago is composed of six main islands, gravitationally locked in slow rotation around the flaming orb called the Pan-Sun. Blessed by its light and warmth, humans and Temtem coexist peacefully in this floating Archipelago. Nobody has ever returned from the depths of Downbelow and nothing is known for sure about the cloudy Highabove â€“ so this is the extent of the known world. "
