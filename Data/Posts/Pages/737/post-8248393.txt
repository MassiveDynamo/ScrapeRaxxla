New monster taming game coming out called TemTem, published by Humble Bundle:

"The Archipelago is composed of six main islands, gravitationally locked in slow rotation around the flaming orb called the Pan-Sun. Blessed by its light and warmth, humans and Temtem coexist peacefully in this floating Archipelago. Nobody has ever returned from the depths of Downbelow and nothing is known for sure about the cloudy Highabove – so this is the extent of the known world. "

wow, I don't know where they got this image, but it looks like an animated cartoon version of the Canary Islands, maybe I'm living in Raxxla !!
There are a few studies that believe that the old Atlantis was also in the Canary Islands, so it could be.

(add some very basic images of the islands, I found similar above all the one below in your image).
