What is also interesting is that the Guanches have been traced back genetically to the Berbers.

Some might recognize the symbols from other iconography

One of the most famous was the Berber Queen Dihya or Kahina. Her title was cited by Arabic-language sources as (the priestess soothsayer). This was the nickname given to by her Muslim opponents because of her alleged ability to foresee the future.



Of course in ED, we have another famous Kahina or Dihya from Drew Wagar's books



Our Kahina has the Imperial Courier Seven Veils.

And the Salome of old is famous for her dance of the Seven Veils before Herod II.

Even though Drew is not involved with Raxxla, his source materials are so very interesting

Some of the biggest defenders guanche culture /traditions on the islands call themselves Amazigh (singular Berber).

That we were a Berber tribe it is the most widespread theory ,but then I think there are things that don't fit or they experts say ,because it is believed that the Berbers did not know how to navigate or something that. (I'm not an expert in the Guanche culture).

I hope to read Drew's books someday.
