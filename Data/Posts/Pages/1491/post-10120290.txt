The codex is a funny thing, the majority of it goes towards establishing that there actually is no way to contact the DW, also that the DW faction we know of is very likely bogus (which we know via DW is likely true), it essentially says don’t bother looking because there will be no confirmation.

But then it goes and gives us new information, the possibility that it exists as a dark (low power) station, a toroid type, then it it was situated around the eighth moon of a gas gus t (maybe).

The existence of new information would propagate the hypothesis it is out there, but we have no clue where to look (except for the codex)… so it might logically be down to finding it randomly?

One idea I had was it’s just out there as a dead station, a wreck, with audio logs which provide a backstory, possibly additional clues to other things, I don’t necessarily feel it’s an active society we can engage with directly…

It might be named “Raxxla Station”!
