So in the codex it mentions how some people try hard to exclude their offspring from its membership because its dangerous - ofc thats Robert and Jordan Garry, and quite possibly Jordan was a Ryder. So the codex is consistent with AHTW - almost telling us where to look. Robert Garry is still alive at the end of the book, having retired to unknown destinations.
Oberon was Robert’s grandfather; not sure if gender of his child(ren) was made clear in AHTW. Either Jordan was Oberon’s son & had changed his surname to Garry to escape CIEP, or he had married Oberon’s daughter. Long time since I read it, must reread. Seem to remember something about Robert trying to find his mother’s burial location but wasn't where he’d been told...is the implication that she was Oberon’s daughter & grave was actually on Soontill?

But the similarity of AHTW’s Hamer the Fisherman and Legacy’s Hammer (the pirate hunter) is interesting. From AHTW CIEP clearly hated pirates... Two books to reread!
