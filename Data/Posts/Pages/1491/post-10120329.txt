You say that jokingly but it is definitely a possibility that the object itself is very unlikely to be found by normal search (like any other random thing that would not show on scanner and would only be visible from a short distance), and that a message leading to it can be only received from someone with sextuple Elite or with some special triggers.
As player progressed through the ranks, the requirements may have been upped too.
Sorry to pop your bubble but I'm 6 x Elite V and I haven't received any message leading to Raxxla
Nothing.. not even a postcard from Braben hahaha
