Permits are unlikely I presume, because we know many of them already, and those we can’t access are narratively locked.

Being devils advocate I doubt Raxxla is narratively locked, simply because the existence of the codex renders such a narrative gate illogical.

We know from FD that the older EF/DW missions were removed. We know the Trinkets are potentially linked, and are also part of a story, confirmed by FD to have been paused (notes in this thread), it was hinted it could be turned back on!

Is it outside the realms of possibility that Raxxla was in game, but locked behind a narrative, only for that narrative to be paused following a certain person’s departure, is it plausible that Raxxla storyline could be activated in the future? Who knows?

But again the existence of the Codex and FD public statements that something is out there is counterintuitive. If found to have been narratively locked for almost 10 years FD will only shoot themselves in the foot with another PR disaster, unless they wipe the evidence from this thread . Considering their track record either might still be likely!

Presumably if there has been any significant change or error, it would have been better for them to simply bin the wider content (story) but then leave or insert an asset in game for general discovery… which in itself could be utilised as a trigger to reopen any paused narrative, if fixed. IMPO.

Either way, you have to ask yourself why explore if there potentially isn’t anything there?

I do so because I enjoy exploring generally and Raxxla gives an otherwise stale process context, and it’s a a good mystery too, and from what I’ve observed there are things out there which warrant such investigation so it’s not totally imaginary.

Rant over
