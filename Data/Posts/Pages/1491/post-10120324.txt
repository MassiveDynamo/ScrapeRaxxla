And this is why you'll never find it.......the dark stations lights only come on to those who have Elite in everything.
You say that jokingly but it is definitely a possibility that the object itself is very unlikely to be found by normal search (like any other random thing that would not show on scanner and would only be visible from a short distance), and that a message leading to it can be only received from someone with sextuple Elite or with some special triggers.
As player progressed through the ranks, the requirements may have been upped too.
