Is it the same music if you zoom into it on the Galaxy Map? (Or out if you are Han Zen). All the systems have music on the Galaxy Map. I haven't really played since they introduced that FSS mini-game/time sink thing other than trying unsuccessfully to get any of it to work for a brief, drunken period of time. I'm taking a wild guess they reused the same music.
The FSS has great sound. All volcanic planets say: 'Speak to me'
