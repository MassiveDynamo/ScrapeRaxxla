Yes well, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. All I can say is mythology will lead you a long way and then sift out the finer details with science. In fact, that is really what mythology & religion is, a lower level of science before we had codified rules, better facts and better equipment to help us peel back the edges of the fog. Even though Gan Romero or the Winking Cat is not interact-able, it should still make sense. Well at least for how I approach the story anyway. Perhaps it is confirmation bias for me but with incomplete information, sometimes we need a leap of faith.
Consider that...
A. Most, if not all these myths have a common point of reference.
B. Contemporary humans aren't the first 'intelligent' Earth species.
C. Current 'science' is deliberately ignoring evidence to avoid panic.

Over very long periods of time, the highly corrosive gas we like to breathe (Oxygen) is well capable of sweeping a vast amount of evidence clean off the face of the planet and all that remains is the "Masonry", the stone work that we're not capable of dating with any accuracy, yet. So the so-called and self proclaimed experts make stories up to suit their preconceived ideas of what happened.

We still can't replicate the scale or precision of much of this observable truth. Who built it, how and when?
