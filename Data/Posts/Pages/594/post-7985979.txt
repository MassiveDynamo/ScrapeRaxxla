Interesting mention in that vid around the 01:56 mark...
MB checks his notes to confirm humans first migrated to Tau Ceti in 2150...

This is ~19 years ahead of a rare Solar phenomena when Sol is actually sitting in the centre of the system due to a heliocentric alignment in ~2169 when Jupiter is on one side of the Sun and the other three gas giants, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are opposite.

Was this event a possible exodus in case of a 'changing of the ages' micro-nova or some such that might pose a serious threat to human kind, was it written into lore accidentally or are DB / MB aware of the "Solar Barycentre" and how this might effect life here?

[Edit: Oh yeah, and the Salome time travel thing - was this an important event?]
[Edit, edit: Handy to be aware of the ~25920 year "precession of the equinoxes"]
[Math: 25920 / 12 = 2160 years. If the last transition was 0AD the next is ~2160.]
