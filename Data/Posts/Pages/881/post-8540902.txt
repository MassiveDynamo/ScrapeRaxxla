This is what happens when I start to rehash things in my head... Hopefully it makes sense before I wander off into sillyness

SPOILER: TLDR












Construct is one of those 'Elite' words. It first shows up in the Dark Wheel novella, when Rafe Zetter describes Raxxla: " on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes".

Another 'Elite' word is Imprint. It's the name of the novella that came with Elite +: http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/elite/books/imprint/
It's the name of one of the musical scores, in Frontier Elite 2 (and FFE) and its the name for the large Thargoid sites in ED.
