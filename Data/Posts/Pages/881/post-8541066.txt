Oh, where did the use of “Imprint” for the large Thargoid sites come from? Not spotted that one!

P.S. I’m convinced those large “surface sites” are the Thargoid mother ships that crashed as a consequence of Jameson’s mycoid attack.
It's from the old stats page(Right-Panel).

SPOILER

Probably the same in the new codex commander log.
