Do note that the ship which was attacked by Raxxla was not built in the bubble. It was built by the Dark Wheel in their colony system at Sector 9. The Dark Wheel was to willing to expand into "forbidden area" by Raxxlans. - The thing with the ships today is that we can pretty much irritate the Raxxlans by taking our ships and fleet carriers into their "territory". Since they do not like humans to settle there in great numbers the reaction will be obvious. We know the reaction number is 100 due to agreement of max Elites... - Or they are smart enough to back off. Will they? --

We do have a way to be real pain in the whole galaxy now. - We have more advanced technology today... So... If you really want to irritate Raxxlans like bees out from their nest, then move the fleet carriers into zones that will enforce them to react. Shaking their nests will cause reactions. - The balance has been broken once by a one single ship. Chess pieces are moving. - If we move our military into their systems the result is war. But, then we know where they are. - Historically... They consider themselves to be the "owners" of the Galaxy... How about we test this tolerance? - To cause reaction, break the rules since they must enforce it.

This is a scenario... I just don't know if it will work.
