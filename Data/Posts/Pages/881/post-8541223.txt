Construct is one of those 'Elite' words. It first shows up in the Dark Wheel novella, when Rafe Zetter describes Raxxla: " on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes".
I had to look up other occurrences... To be honest I find it interesting that the other uses of 'construct' as a noun consist of a great crystalline tomb, a multi dimensional fractal that encompasses 'all the humans who are and ever can be', as well as a bit of math which describes a multidimensional universe involving the higher organisms in a close-knit whole.... to say nothing of the fact that it is being used to describe the Raxxla Gate, a gate way to other universes....

SPOILER: ALSO IN DARK WHEEL

SPOILER: IN FFE
