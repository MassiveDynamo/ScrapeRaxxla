Okay, adjust your tinfoil...

I was just playing around with this idea of gen ships being attached to the toast before turning in for the night.

1. To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
2. To the whisperer in witchspace, - Thetis
3. the siren of the deepest void! - Epimetheus
4. The parent's grief - Pleione
5. the lover's woe - Atlas
6. and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. - Odysseus

(Thetis could apply to both lines 1 & 2)

What do we get if we just simply take the first letter of each ship? TEPAO or if you scramble that to make sense..... A Poet

Super simple I know and very unlikely to be anything but I thought it was at the very least interesting, I'm stumped as to which poet from ancient Greece it could point to if any, there are of course so many poets in Greek myth and civilization.

a poet could be sir philip sidney.... but that just leads back to astrophel and stella.
