I doubt it's as simple as visiting the ships in that order but i think your right about some pattern or triangulation.

Triangulation is wonderfully satisfying, like back in the days when all we had was primary sensor 1 (eyeball)....

Cant recal which gen ship it was, but I was mapping some obscure constellation, an age ago, really tiny one, and right slap in the centre was a system with a listening post for one of the gen ships, it had been long discovered but finding it through triangulation was genuinely very satisfying.

Who knows... always worth a shot, if not then at least its ruled out.
