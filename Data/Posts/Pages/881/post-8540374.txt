I'm back investigating TDW/Raxxla after being stuck too busy IRL to play, and noticed an interesting reputation flag in INARA associated with some of the Engineers.

I haven't even unlocked all of them, but on INARA only these four are listed as having a recent reputation change:
Lori Jameson (Discovered) = Hostile (-100%)
Bill Turner (Invited) = Hostile (-100%)
Col Bris Dekker (Undiscovered) = Hostile (-100%)
Lei Cheung (Grade 5 Access) = Allied (100%)



Can someone else please have a look and see if they have recent Hostile / Allied for the Engineers and see if recently changing alliance (I picked Hudson just before my absence which aligns with Lori potentially getting annoyed) has any influence on their reputation?

I'm curious since 'The Sarge' is also undiscovered but doesn't appear at all on my list as Hostile or Allied, and I have a few others that are Invited, or Grade 5 access that also haven't obviously altered their state since Jan 2020.

I'll see if altering my alliance has any effect on their reputations, but I'm seeking to broaden the investigation a bit as it may be an influencer on getting an invite to TDW?!

You haven't been invited by The Sarge? You really should work towards that. There's nothing quite like having several fixed grade 5 overcharged cannons on your spacecraft, combined with either plasma accelerators or a multi-cannon. Put them on a Federal Assault ship for example, or a Dropship, and then fly around in places like Beta Hydri blowing up stuff in space. That's what I call living, Federation style. Chase your dreams (and other spaceships).
