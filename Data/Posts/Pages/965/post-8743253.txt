Ya I am not sure about East - Its more of a Prime Meridian for Right Ascension measurements. Its measured at the Vernal Equinox and I keep trying to figure out if something relates to Project Equinox... but ya glad it helped

Mmm, interesting. A few of us thought there was still Project Equinox stuff to be found and conducted a search around 3 years ago (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/gcs-sarasvati-early-thargoid-lookout-megaship.380074/) for the implied sister ships to Sarasvati, and the missing data archive, without success; but strangely I don’t remember anyone exploring any hypothesis relating to the Equinoctial positions themselves.
Good thinking!
P.S. might be worth pursuing this hypothesis in that thread, or a successor, since it doesn’t seem to be tied to Raxxla or TDW; I’m game.......would be nice to search for something a little more concrete!!
(Although I have a new TDW hypothesis currently pursuing )
