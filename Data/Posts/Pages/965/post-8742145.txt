Hello Koben
You could open up your galaxy map, then use the Q / E keys (yaw left / yaw right) to orient gridlines so North is straight up then use the D key (right) to scroll east and select a system at whatever distance you are looking for. This is assuming you're on a computer, I would guess consoles will have different controls but if you use whatever corresponds to the bracketed parts above it should work.

Sorry if this isn't what you are after but I've not seen a game reference as you mentioned.
