Raxxla in Star Citizen? That's just silly. They haven't even got Earth out there, no Africa, no Qalb ar-Rīšāt, for the eye is the door that is also the key.
(Also there are Phoenician Moon bases, interstellar travel began with inflating pig bladders with methane gas, and solar sails made out of fine copper sheets to exploit solar radiation pressure. This is why eating pigs is a taboo in many cultures even today, for they were reserved for an emerging space industry.

Provide ships or sails adapted to the heavenly breezes, and there will be some who will brave even that void.)
