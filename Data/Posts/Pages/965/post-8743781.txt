Hmm... That Thargoid encoded message from the bases. Left system is something in Pleiades. Right? Right one is something in Col 70 area. That curve near the left star. Is it asteroid belt? And star symbol itself is solid. There are three curves around central object on the Raxxla logo. Three belts? And hollow (not solid) star... Black hole with three belts?

Probably I shouldn't use Thargoid theme in my Raxxla searching.
