It helps a LOT! Many thanks! But why does it seems like 28 Omega Piscium is towards "left/west"?
I'll post it here later on the reason behind the question and maybe it will make sense...

Ya I am not sure about East - Its more of a Prime Meridian for Right Ascension measurements. Its measured at the Vernal Equinox and I keep trying to figure out if something relates to Project Equinox... but ya glad it helped
