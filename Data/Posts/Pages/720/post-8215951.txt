Well IRH is still trying to shift the Tionisla Historical Society back into Tionisla using powerplay as a form of emergent gameplay. We'd see whether that triggers any assets from FDev.

There are a few of us working on this. It's a long hard slog, and the main thing the Discord tries to make clear is that it's not to trigger the Graveyard. We don't want anybody's hopes up. The goal of shifting the THS to Tionisla is to... shift the THS to Tionisla

Personally I'm sure there will be the Graveyard in Tionisla. It is so much part of the Elite lore. I don't think our efforts with the BGS will influence FDev's decision to put it there one way or the other. But there's going to be a major update to the game soon, and that would be an ideal time for new features
