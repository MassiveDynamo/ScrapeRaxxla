Thats all good for when it happened right now if you were new you wouldnt know it was there or that it mattered for whatever reason. I wouldnt have had any knowledge of the zurara...

100% Agree with this angle. Im new this year, only started looking on YT for weapons loadouts after a month or so and apart from Felicity getting in touch the rest was me finding it and not knowing what it meant, done the same recently, found a beacon, followed it to a dead end, looked on Canonn and had missed the first 2 beacons in the chain with probably the actual story. On the flip side I know too much about the Zuara and haven't even been to the Rift yet. Its hard keeping yourself in the dark.

DB says he doesn't want 'to feel like I'm on rails'. Now while I agree with this it would be nice to know there might be a train there at all and perhaps have a direction to one or two of the stations to get me started. Not the major stuff, just some lore tales in game so we can catch up.

Im hoping DW Lore Tour if it works out will be the missing link for all of this or at least a damn good starting portfolio coz the game needs one.

Raxxla still works the same way though, spoke to a guy the other day, been playing 3 months first time in Open and chat, knew about Raxxla and the mystery of it just from the Codex...just reminded me of me reading The Dark Wheel all those years ago, the best stories are the ones we make up in our heads....but I still want a physical Graveyard I'm not letting that one go!
