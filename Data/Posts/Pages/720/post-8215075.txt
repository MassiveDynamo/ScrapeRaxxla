Would appreciate if you could pm me the source, after stripping identifiers of course.

Considering the denial of the author plus the station was in place at least by 2016 and the book was published in 2018, it is most probably a coincidence. (Edit: In addition, it can't be a fan of the books)
PM sent with link to image of email.

Correct - its highly unlikely to be a 'fan' I agree, so the only liklihood is its a coincidence, that the engine put that rather poetic title together, and a controlling faction leader too linked to the mysteries.

So it is odd. Not improbable I agree, but still very odd.

I of late can't locate any other links to the Arcadia, this system, or the Codex, other than this title....a fools errand probably but a very interesting one none the least.
