So... I had been doing lots of missions for confederation of muriges who have the leader named Persephone. Nothing different in the missions as far as I can tell. How ever when you get allied the faction leader has a set of numbers behind her. They kind of jump out at you after you notice... Probably nothing but anyone seen similar faction portraits?
