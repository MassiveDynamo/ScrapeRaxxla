'Tip-off' Missions/ Listening Beacons / occasional GalNet hints 'strange signal in Upaniklis that needs investigating'
Thats all good for when it happened right now if you were new you wouldnt know it was there or that it mattered for whatever reason. I wouldnt have had any knowledge of the zurara if it wasnt for youtube or if i hadnt read TDW novella and went looking for tionisla oribital cemetery and found the beacon with the cobra 3 riddle. Realistically youtube explained that to me because i hadnt read any of the corresponding literature. Not really the same as an in-game of mission giver leading you to these things eventually
