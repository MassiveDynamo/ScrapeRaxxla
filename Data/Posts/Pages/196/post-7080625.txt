Jameson Memorial as a station is immune to Lockdown and other effects because its controlling faction (Pilots Fed Local Branch) is a non-influence faction and so can't have BGS states. Same applies to detention centres and engineer bases.

The SD system as a whole is also separately restricted - factions can't expand into it, and factions already there can't have conflicts to change station ownership within the system - but BGS states can otherwise be applied normally. TDW are currently in Boom, for example, so should be able to get Expansion too.

And if enough enterprising Commanders would adopt TDW as a charity case it shouldn't take too much effort to find out.
