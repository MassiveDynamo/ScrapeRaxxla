is not Raxxla. Went to KASUAE XM-W D1-0. Definitely a galaxy. There's no longer any stars between me and the blue galaxy. Still not quite sure what galaxy it is tho.

Presumably would have to be one of the Local Group, not that that narrows it down any. Looks like it may be two galaxies colliding, or a remnant moving out after a collision from the larger galaxy? At the risk of restarting another doomed Cassiopeia search, dare I say it looks like IC 10 perhaps if the smaller object (of the two on the right) is the nebula in the image from the link below?
