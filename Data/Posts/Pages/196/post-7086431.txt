Aaah. My bad. I thought that was a speck of dirt on my screen, didn't even notice it until you pointed it out. I haven't been playing since the spring, and only check in here every month or two or more sometimes so haven't been religiously following the latest pointless searches for objects and conspiracy theories that will never be implemented by FD.

Hmm, traveled 56KLy for that speck of dirt...



One way...
