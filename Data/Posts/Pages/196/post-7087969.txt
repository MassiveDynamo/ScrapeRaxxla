I hope not. That would suggest that Raxxla is findable through mere exploration. I still hope (just a tiny little bit) that it will require some sort of Quest completion. Some story line.

Didnâ€™t DB say that it could be found fortuitously by an explorer? Or was that DW about the FRift mystery?
I have lost track....
