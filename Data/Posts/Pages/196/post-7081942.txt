There be dragons...

I personally consider Trinkets of Hidden Fortune burial items, a reliquary of sorts, for commanders lost in combat. Practise was described in Elite: Legacy, but this item was not mentioned by name, so it's speculation. They are not that rare in anarchy systems, unless something has changed. Data crystals were probably Guardian origin.

SD factions have some states locked, it's a curated system. I guess Sol, Alioth, Achenar are like that too. Neumann camp has been succesfully UA bombed though. I suppose Jameson Memorial cannot be UA bombed. Factions are a bit weird, they used to be able to have states, maybe homesystems too, even in case of not being presented anywhere in game. Galnet famine/outbreak reports used to have factions in them that were nowhere to be found in game.

I think the star decal is common in independent planetary settlements.

Do permit locked regions have different warning messages when trying to jump? Systems and permit locked landable planets do.

Edit: I never understood what was this french thread and/or video about, what was the interesting thing about it?
