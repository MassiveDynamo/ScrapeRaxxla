Presumably would have to be one of the Local Group, not that that narrows it down any. Looks like it may be two galaxies colliding, or a remnant moving out after a collision from the larger galaxy? At the risk of restarting another doomed Cassiopeia search, dare I say it looks like IC 10 perhaps if the smaller object (of the two on the right) is the nebula in the image from the link below?

I don't think macros is referring to the colliding galaxies - rather, the "blue dot", center-right of the image. It's been focus of many chat in this here thread.
