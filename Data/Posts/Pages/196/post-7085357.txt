is not Raxxla. Went to KASUAE XM-W D1-0. Definitely a galaxy. There's no longer any stars between me and the blue galaxy. Still not quite sure what galaxy it is tho.

Well, if it’s blue-shifted then it’s coming towards us. So in a few billion years We’ll be able to explore it in-game; perhaps we might have found Raxxla by then!
