As an aside - I hear they changed the Codex on TDW Universal Carto from Omphalos Infortech to something else in the latest update - haven't checked myself . Are there any other changes in the codex text? Like the Mother of galaxies for instance, or changes in other translations?
I'm off-line for a while so can't check..
