This is not unusual now.. in Sol, you often get missions offered from a type 9 - if you look around there will be a signal source..

This happened to me when trying to validate GURU's child NPC trail, and it sure seemed strange to have a 'mission objective detected' when you had no missions. Seems like if you lurk around in a system long enough then they pop up, but there may be other mechanisms in play

This popped up before in this thread and we asked Fdev if it was a bug - they said 'no, but let us know if it happens a lot'
