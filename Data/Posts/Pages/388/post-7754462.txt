Please explain why Gemini from your picture - her brow is much more in the top right corner. Also how did you choose which direction/time of year/day for the milky way position?

Please see this article for the astronomical explanation. Page 25, article Simulation I: Nut and the Birth of Ra.

Edit: Not just Gemini, I assumed somewhere around that region of the sky because I couldn't find any precise depictions of her head. Just now I have discovered that her mouth is in the Gemini constellation.
