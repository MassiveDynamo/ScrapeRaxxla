I made a post about this, a while back. Can't find it now, because neither forum search nor Google advanced can find old posts in the new forum.

Anyway, the essence was that Castor is Alpha Gemini. Short form is aGem. A Gem is close to a jewel.

Didn't find anything in Castor though.
The only interesting thing I have found so far in that area is a civilian structure orbiting the 8th moon in one of the nearby systems. I tried hacking 2 Data Transmitters there, without any results. An NPC there was announcing that they're preparing for a jump, but they didn't jump anywhere.
