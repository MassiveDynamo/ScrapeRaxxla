Please explain why Gemini from your picture - her brow is much more in the top right corner. Also how did you choose which direction/time of year/day for the milky way position?

The position of the head isn't precisely defined in old Egyptian drawings. It's usually on the Gemini side as the great rift near Cygnus, often represents the reproductive bits.
Alpha Cygnus(Deneb) often symbolizes the world egg, that spawned the universe.

There are examples of Nut being drawn the other way as well.
