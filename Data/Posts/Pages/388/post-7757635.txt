Something like that.
Did someone try to plot the icon on the GalMap centered on Sol /Tau Ceti/SD with "R" pointing to the brow...err..I mean the top of the MW ? Then veryfy what constellations/clusters/stars the other 5 are pointing at and look for a relation with the corresponding toast phrase ?
I mean if we make "R" to point at, let's say Polaris or Berenice, where does point "A" at ? Something which could be related to the corresponding phrase ?
The icon would be some kind of compass giving general directions of interest. Not saying it shows Raxxla position, but has his own meaning.

Something like:
R => Polaris, Berenice/Sgr A* (brow, top, crown in diferent localizations..), A=>Guardians clusters, AI (whisperer,),... X=> Thargs regions, Pleiades (sirens, Pleione was a sea-nymph),... X=> Andromeda (parent's)... L=> H&S/Rift/Perseus (lover's)... A=> ...Colonia ?(the vagabond: Jaques. Any other "vagabond" candidate in that direction?)
And finally "to Raxxla". The toast would be for every superlative star/region in the MW.
Just an example ^^^, but it fits, doesn't it ?

SPOILER
