Something to think about.... This section about the childrens story

SPOILER: CHILDRENS STORY PARAGRAPH






A children's story: Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars

Aesops Fable ..... Astronomer falling into a well (could that be chthonic ?)

The lesson learned from the astronomer falling into the well was he got all wrapped up in the stars and wasn't looking where he was going.


A basic issue with Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars is that it has to have been written sometime after the existence of Raxxla was discovered... possibly after the Martian discovery? Otherwise how could he cunningly conceal facts about the mysterious locale ....

So either there is a text of this story out there somewhere ... or the clue is the name of the story itself.

Maybe there is info about this book hidden somewhere perhaps in an unknown tourist beacon or a local paper ?

Or could it be as simple as a female astronomer who studied the rotation of galaxies... Vera Rubin? .. her work lead to "an early indication that spiral galaxies were surrounded by dark matter haloes." a dark circle you say?
