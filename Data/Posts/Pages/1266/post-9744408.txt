At the very start of this thread there is a video of a guy talking about a developer that specifically stated that a commander jumped into the system where Raxla is located, scooped and jumped away. But that was years ago now. The statement at that time was “it’s been visited at least once”.
I remember that being debunked, I think Drew was one of the ones debunking it.
