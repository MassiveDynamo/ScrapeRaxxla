I was under the impression that The Dark Wheel is also near Sol? possibly in one of the core systems. how many players do you think float around looking for stations visually? I'd say 0. If it won't show up on your navigation panel or in system map, then nobody would notice.
I'm not sure what you mean by using to find stations that are not in navigation panel or system map, you mean hover around the moon where TDW could be and then use too look around?

I also went thru the systems that are in both, Elite 1984 and ED. Ra system has gas giant with 8 moons and Tionisla has 7+1 (which I doubt is correct).

I haven't done much research oh TDW, so not sure about it. Only line I know is that it orbits 8th moon of a gas giant.



Anyway in case people missed what I suggested about Raxxla in my previous post, I quoted out my own messages that might be significant clues to finding Raxxla.




Also I just visited the beacon in Tionisla and it says that some of the message is encrypted with unknown encryption and rest is in plain text "The vain queen rides a giraffe that remembers her daughter's hero".
Did this message refer to where to find Zurara? I read something about, that "Vain queen" is apperently Rebecca and "giraffe" is some kind of sign and it apperently points to something.

But what caught my eye, is the encrypted message. Where is that encrypted message?
If this beacon was clue to find Zurara, then there's a high chance that "hexedit" directly refers to decrypting this encrypted message, but where is it?

The Vain Queen refers to Cassiopeia, the Giraffe refers to Camelopardalis, and the Hero Refers to Perseus. All those Constellations are in the direction of the Rift as viewed from our sun.
