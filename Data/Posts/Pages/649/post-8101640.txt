Thatchimo - Spoiler? as you give lot of info about RT missions...which I haven't done yet.

IF its neural-connections 'radio waves' I can just about live with that, cheesy as hell but completely different to 'visions' from within.

tbh Ive read all those GalNet articles and all the logs so far about 'visions', 'lights', whispers' etc as clear signs of mental ill health or even a total breakdown as thats exactly what they look and read like. You have to apply a 'vision' filter through rose-tinted galsses to get anything alien or unusual at all. If you met them on the street youd think 'Crsis' not 'OMG this person is in touch with aliens'
Apologies for the unspoilered spoilers. It’s all pretty old news now, and we’ve talked about it in this thread before, so I hadn’t really considered that it would constitute a spoiler for anyone.

Not really sure how we can proceed in this particular discussion without talking about that stuff I’m afraid.

SPOILER











The last point has been largely confirmed by the Codex.

If you’ve not read it yet, the Codex section on The Guardians would be good to read.
