I've completed all the Ram Tah missions a couple of times and the data you get while doing them is confusing at best because you tend to collect it out of order, completely overwhelming at worst. If you hunt around a bit there are guides, maps and complete sets of all the information in the correct order.

The Canonn site might be a good place to start, I forget where I found and collated the run data.

[Edit: Some of the sites appear to have underground bunker entrances. Maybe we'll get inside?]
Yeah, there’s a lot of info on the logs.

They’re written as (semi)sequential messages from Ram Tah including his comments and thoughts on the data uncovered as each new piece of data is sent to him.

Essentially, they need to be collected in their entirety, the first message identified (think it’s Language 1 IIRC), then a first pass made reading through it all from that starting point.

Following on from that, for any particular point of interest from one of the logs, a second pass needs to be made through the entire set to pick out all the pertinent related info from other logs.

Then a third and fourth pass through to catch the missed bits and re-check all the cross references, get the correct sequence of info and understand where things have been preceded and superseded and get a final picture of things as a conclusion of all the information.

It takes a fair old bit of doing!
