For those interested in Operation Less Than Three, read on:

I've been continuing my likely futile classification of data from The Dark Wheel missions provided from Jameson Memorial in Shinrarta Dezhra, as per "Operation Less Than Three" that was originally proposed by Macros the Black.

My focus has remained on only doing the 'Founder or Elite' rank missions for TDW. Whilst my initial supposition that duplicate missions weren't being supplied for the same goods, to the same target destination, for the same faction - this has turned out to be a false assumption as I completed more missions and more data became available.

Interestingly it still does appear that once you become 'Allied' with a faction by doing these mission types, the majority of 'new' missions supplied are for a faction that you aren't allied with. Not to say you won't get an occasional 'top up' mission for a previously very active faction, but certainly the focus switches priority and the previously active faction missions are often flagged as 'Elite' not 'Founder or Elite'.

This may be due to BGS style changes in TDW's allies, but this is something outside my data collection framework.

I'll continue my investigations as time permits, as the missions are quick and quite lucrative (3-6M mostly for a quick 10 minute hop). Not really holding out much hope that FDev have planned this way to gain an invite for TDW, but meh, it's fun flying a spaceship and being interdicted every second trip for a bit of pew-pew.

Fly Dangerously.

Not much movement on o<3, contemplating getting Allied with the rest of the factions even if they've only received non-benevolent missions from TDW until now.
