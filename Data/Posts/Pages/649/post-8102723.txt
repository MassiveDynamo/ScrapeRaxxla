Concerning those 'dreams / visions' I always imagined them as the humans mind attempt at trying to contextualise an alien experience or a 'signal' into everyday reality.

Their minds acting as receivers.

Were any sectors mentioned in those statements? (I dont recal there were).

If that was the case (I doubt it is) then it could indicate points of reference to search or triangulate a sector.

But like most things in ED its likely tumble dryer fluff.
