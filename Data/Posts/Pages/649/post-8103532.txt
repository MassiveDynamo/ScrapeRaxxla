Not much movement on o<3, contemplating getting Allied with the rest of the factions even if they've only received non-benevolent missions from TDW until now.

Might be an option to try.
I'm plodding along getting allied with the factions doing these missions only. I'm interesting in seeing if they dry up, or alter once I've worked through the aligned factions.
