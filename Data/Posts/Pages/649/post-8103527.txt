Transposing this to current facts, at Delphi we can find a station called The Oracle (which is the protector of the Omphalos)... and there's a Thargoid base just below it. Guess what's inside the Omphalos (Thargoid base)... a representation of a galaxy with the Thargoid device at its centre...
Which two or three other sites did that one point to (the locked one?) and were they active?
Despite the work that was done to catalogue the *unknown links, did we not miss anything?

[On the "Old" Canonn Thargoid map and it doesn't seem to be showing the Delphi rename.]
