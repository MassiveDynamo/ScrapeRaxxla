The permit was there, I remember this moment when I explored different possibilities to look at the systems about two years ago. In particular, Witch's Rich still have this permit, while Polaris is gone. it would be interesting to look at the log that led to such an event, perhaps something is happening there
Possibly it has to do with how it is listed in the database. I still suspect this is a lore-lock that will ultimately open up via in-game event.
