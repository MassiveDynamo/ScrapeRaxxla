Possibly it has to do with how it is listed in the database. I still suspect this is a lore-lock that will ultimately open up via in-game event.
In past games, this system was linked to the Thargoids, where it was possible to take control of a Thargoid ship if the player refused to destroy the hive. Considering there are many videos on YouTube, when the first modified Thargoid ship was discovered, at the former base of Professor Palin, you may be right
