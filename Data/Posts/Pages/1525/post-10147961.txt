Yep, had to hollow tine aerate, moss killer and scarify, then overseed and fertilise mine after last summerâ€™s drought then winters deluge with a large copawlot running all over it. Looks much better now, but needs cutting every 3 days.
Perhaps I should name it Raxxla, at least I can find it!
I use a robot cutter at the cabin. There's about 1000 m3 of lawn there. If we don't go there for a couple weeks, it gets totally unmanageable. The robot works at night and keeps the grass short.
When the grass is short all the time, the dandelions and the moss doesn't get a foothold.
