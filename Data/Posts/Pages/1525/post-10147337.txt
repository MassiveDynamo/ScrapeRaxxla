Okay, wasn't me originally but a user on the IRH discord called Mr. One Six posted about Gallifreyan (language of the Time Lords). V Clara who has been doing a lot of work on Guardian sites thought it may possibly be linked to the Alpha Guardian sites. However, not sure if this has been followed up on (first mentioned in the off topic chat). I did find a guide for it so maybe this will help. I do know Guardian sites have stuff that looks similar. Here's the PDF about it if you are interested.

Gallifreyan (language)
Gallifreyan was a Gallifreyan language used by the Time Lords. There were several forms of written Gallifreyan. By the time of the Doctor, the archaic Old High Gallifreyan language used in the days of Rassilon had changed considerably. (TV: The Five Doctors) TARDISes' translation circuits...
