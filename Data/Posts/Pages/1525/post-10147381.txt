I see the same thing on INARA when looking up Polaris. So, they apparently goofed. I will report it to them.
The permit was there, I remember this moment when I explored different possibilities to look at the systems about two years ago. In particular, Witch's Rich still have this permit, while Polaris is gone. it would be interesting to look at the log that led to such an event, perhaps something is happening there
