Same problem- i made the mistake of giving the lawn weed and feed… filthy lawn wont stop growing
Yep, had to hollow tine aerate, moss killer and scarify, then overseed and fertilise mine after last summer’s drought then winters deluge with a large copawlot running all over it. Looks much better now, but needs cutting every 3 days.
Perhaps I should name it Raxxla, at least I can find it!
