Well i did some astroid ring running around saturn past couple nights. Ya the fields are wide and no idea where to look. So far zilch to report.
I decided to try a different spot but had some chores to do (why cant grass grow 2‚Äù high then stop?). Finally got in-game, dropped into the spot and immediately got an npc arrival-in a DBX named Destination....mmm thought I, so I followed it....for about 10 minutes....and then the kids next door rang the front doorbell to ask for their football back. Sigh!

At least I got the lawn cut!
