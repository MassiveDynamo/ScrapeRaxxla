Felicity’s engineering comments mention she went to the Coalsack Nebula in her engineered Asp Explorer, and she talks about crossing dangerous rifts with pilot courage being the only limitation, phrasing that is reminiscent of the Dark Wheel membership requirements ( Codex entry “only a handful of the bravest and most competent pilots of each generation are honoured with an invitation to join”).
Jorki, just curious - where and how long ago did you find that quote? Her entry in Engineers only says she is a legendary explorer with an Asp, and she is not listed under individuals in the Codex. She is quoted in The Dark Wheel entry but it is entirely different. Nothing about Coalsack or dangerous rifts and pilot courage that I can see. Or does it show up only when you visit her station?
