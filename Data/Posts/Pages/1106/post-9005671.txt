So about those NHSS Threat 5's being almost always a Cyclops and non-aggressive - just dropped into one with four Marauders and two Regenerators who started hammering me instantly. Got out with no shields, again, barely. 50% hull this time (96% last time). Off to one of those new-fangled Alliance stations, think if I continue the Soontill Relic experimentation it will be in a system with one of those stations close by in case my life support goes before I frameshift.
