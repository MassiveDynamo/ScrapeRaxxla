Jorki, just curious - where and how long ago did you find that quote? Her entry in Engineers only says she is a legendary explorer with an Asp, and she is not listed under individuals in the Codex. She is quoted in The Dark Wheel entry but it is entirely different. Nothing about Coalsack or dangerous rifts and pilot courage that I can see. Or does it show up only when you visit her station?
Check out her L3 and L5 upgrade descriptions!
Havenâ€™t got a link, but if you go on IRH Discord ScolioTheMost has a pic (22 March 2020)of her upgrade messages on the #engineer-profiles channel.
