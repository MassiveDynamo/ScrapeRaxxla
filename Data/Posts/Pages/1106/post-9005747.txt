Wondering if the immediately aggressive Thargs are Klaxians and the less aggressive ones Oresrians...

Yup - see the various ones being compiled here, among other places (scroll down the page until you see the images): https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...rgoid-ship-logograms-compendium.379844/page-2
Mm, interesting thought about Oresrians vs Klaxians. Did you get any pix/video to check their logos?
If the logo is a hive/faction marker there should be a difference, presumably of the central part which has been common so far. Of course the Alliance could have squished their nests during terraforming the Coalsack Ammonia Worlds!

Think there are 3 types of Goid Scout: normal, marauder & regenerator. The latter make the others stronger. Marauders are always very aggressive, if youâ€™re hunting them then those are the ones to take out first, then the regenerator.
