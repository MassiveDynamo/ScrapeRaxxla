No Thargoids around Lupus Dark Region or Lupus Dark Region B that I can find anyways. Seems to be just the Coalsack Nebula (and not necessarily the Coalsack or Musca Dark Regions, which makes sense based on behaviour at the Pleiades I guess). I'm going to take a spin out to Seagull Nebula for fun now that I can't do my experiment any more, maybe I'll come home with some Trinkets to play with. Also want to be out Barnard way when Odyssey drops in case all those permit locks are lifted...
