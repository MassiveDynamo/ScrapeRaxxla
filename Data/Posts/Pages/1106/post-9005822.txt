Hey Drew,

It’s come up before, but just wondering if you could clarify - was it specifically no anti-gravity that was the rule or was it no artificial gravity (except via acceleration)?

I posted a quote from DB which covers the artificial gravity situation for ED, but am just wondering if the writers got told that and also got told no anti-gravity, or if there was a conflation of the two.

(I’m sure there’s an MB comment on Time Travel somewhere, but it’s interesting that no Time Travel wasn’t stipulated to the writers.)
Artificial gravity is fine. Db has a problem with antigravity tech that breaks newton's laws. I dont see why really... we have magic force fields, some kind of inertial tech for ship collisions, magic ftl drives, magic comms, magic lasers, magic Thargoids, magic guardian ships etc...

DB likes scientific realism... except when he doesn't.

Cheers,

Drew.
