Nope, I’ve had a bash at a Homer’s Odyssey-based hypothesis in the past (search this thread)...

now testing out on a different hypothesis which may be my last, cos I’m getting fed up with looking for something though I don’t know what it is!!

Coupled with my ongoing hand problems (actually worse, after some physio two weeks ago) it is all getting a bit much.

But good luck with your interpretation, you never know, it might be the right one! which you can only tell by finding Raxxla (though we dont know what it is, so how do we know if we find it?)
