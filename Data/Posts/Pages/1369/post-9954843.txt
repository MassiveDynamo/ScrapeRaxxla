Yes - similar to the concentric spiral project I under-took some years ago, it could roughly say identify the X and Z axis but that left a large Y axis field to search, which was several hundred light years deep.

Then the X; Y axis were not accurate either so the Y axis was maybe a few light wide, given the technology it was a very rough search pattern and not very practical.

An amusing distraction but ultimately one has nothing definitive to go on, it could have been anywhere…then there’s the issue of not knowing what to look for… is it a honk and ‘boom’, or is it a station mission or an asteroid field?

Again without a definitive location you’re field of searching is too wide, so the probability factors go off the charts. I’m getting too old for wild goose chases, that’s a job for the new tin-foil Cmdrs, we something that correlates and matches the codex.

I’m hoping FD utilise some form of triangulation in game, I’ve seen this in relation gen ships… eg I mapped a tiny constellation once and then triangulated it’s common centre (just for fun), low and behold there was a gen ship there (already discovered), I’m pretty sure this was a fluke however.

I had to take a look at this alignment, because it's so pretty.


It's at least interesting that the letters line up almost perfectly, by putting 31 Coma Berenices in the missing X spot.
31 Coma Berenices is a star that is very close to the galactic north pole. It is one of several possible Omphaloos points, in the sky.



Here is 31 Coma Berenices right next to the NGP (marked with a nice X).
