I had to take a look at this alignment, because it's so pretty.


It's at least interesting that the letters line up almost perfectly, by putting 31 Coma Berenices in the missing X spot.
31 Coma Berenices is a star that is very close to the galactic north pole. It is one of several possible Omphaloos points, in the sky.



Here is 31 Coma Berenices right next to the NGP (marked with a nice X).

Synchronicity detected: Passed through 31 Coma Berenices yesterday.
The name stood out amidst all the other stars up there.
Also happened to find the "true north star" tourist beacon.
Didn't look for Raxxla up there, though, except for listening for any whispers during jumps.
It was just a relaxed short trip with the goal "as high as I can go" - without using the carrier.
