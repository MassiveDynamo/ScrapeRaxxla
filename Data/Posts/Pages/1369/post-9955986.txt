Synchronicity detected: Passed through 31 Coma Berenices yesterday.
The name stood out amidst all the other stars up there.
Also happened to find the "true north star" tourist beacon.
Didn't look for Raxxla up there, though, except for listening for any whispers during jumps.
It was just a relaxed short trip with the goal "as high as I can go" - without using the carrier.
31 Coma Berenices is the RL star closest to the GNP. In ED, 30 Coma Berenices is actually closer. With the coordinates -0.875 / 303.09375 / -0.15625, it is less than 0,9 ly from true galactic north (in-game).

This one isn't to bad
