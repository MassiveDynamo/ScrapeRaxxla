Michael Brookes’ phrase “its a journey we all must make” (djtruthsayer interview?) and his tattoo, which appears to represent a journey ending at the gates of paradise (see Scytale’s message with that picture and subsequent discussion around in-game systems that might be relevant), and his professed love of Milton & Paradise Lost all makes this an interesting hypothesis. Ive tried it in the past but had no luck. Perhaps someone with more detailed knowledge of Paradise Lost would have more success. I seem to remember there’s a system named Sin, and with Pandemonium etc it is tempting....but does that mean a journey between all the relevant systems to fill up your journal file which then causes the game to be triggered to reveal Raxxla?? Or is it all just mythological obfuscation?

A long time ago I did do some investigation around Eden in Alpha Centauri (best part of an hour in SC to get there, a very long journey and I didn’t even get a Hutton Orbital Mug!). You might like to check out my post on Paradise Lost.
