Yes... the biggest gap in my theory is that it requires Frontier to be able to pull something like this together which is not something that they've proven themselves to be adept at. But heck. I've chased Cassiopeia A. I'm willing to pursue another phantom if need be.

Thanks for the heads up Jai. It’s not that unlikely that RH came up with the Raxxla/Sirius connection. FD may just have added meat to his bone.

I’m of course bias towards this link, because I’ve spent quite a bit of time on it.
