Yes, I did 1917 and Stellarium has Mt. Wilson observatory programmed in as a default location so it should account for altitude. Vega would have been on or below the horizon until about 30 minutes to an hour after the observation was supposed to take place.


I'm honestly not sure how to proceed.


I certainly would at that.

Thanks Jaiotu, had to check not having the stellarium myself.
Also thanks for the tinfoilery; your ideas always add some direction to my aimless bumbling around in game.
Sirius has had my vote for being involved for some time (though I have no evidence)
