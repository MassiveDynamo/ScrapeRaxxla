"... on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life . . ."

"there are people on Raxxla already. This is only a guess, mind you, but from what happened to Jason I'd say it was close to being right. We've long suspected that a corps of Ã©lites lives there, and are exploiting the gateway. They're powerful, twisted men." - Rafe Zetter.

The only thing special about Raxxla itself is the Gateway. All the really good stuff is on the other side of Raxxla, beyond door so to speak.

Raxxla itself is already occupied. By powerful and twisted men. Elites who are exploiting the Gateway.

Let's listen to Rafe one more time:

Remember the Antares? Vice President Nigel Smeaton? Assassinated when he got to close to the truth behind the Antares. It looked for a time that Core Dynamics might have been behind things. Over a year ago (on the Rift Thread) I shared my suspicions that Core Dynamics is nothing but a front for Sirius Corporation.

Sirius Corp, whose tech sometimes seems to leapfrog the rest of the industry is a pretty good match for Rafe's description of the people occupying and exploiting the Raxxla gateway.

Makes sense, Doc.
Do you suggest an exhaustive survey of Sirius Corp ships movements ?
Do you think Sirius Corp fits somewhat in the 'tiny little bit obvious' - thing ?
