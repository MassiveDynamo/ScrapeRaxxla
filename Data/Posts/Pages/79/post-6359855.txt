Thanks Jaiotu, had to check not having the stellarium myself.
Also thanks for the tinfoilery; your ideas always add some direction to my aimless bumbling around in game.
Sirius has had my vote for being involved for some time (though I have no evidence)

Thanks for the heads up Jai. It’s not that unlikely that RH came up with the Raxxla/Sirius connection. FD may just have added meat to his bone.

I’m of course bias towards this link, because I’ve spent quite a bit of time on it.

Out of rep at the moment. I've often thought a lot of these things point to Sirius. The most recent (in terms of emergence) of these is Sirius as the corporate benefactors (& ultimate recipients) of a lot of the R&D and retroengineering done under the INRA banner.

Having said that, on the INRA front, if the logs are genuine and the supposition that the corporate entitiy involved is Sirius then that would provide the source of much of Sirius's leapfrogging the rest of the industry and it reduces the likelihood of it being Raxxla related.

My concern with Sirius as a candidate in general is that I kind of feel as though everything points a bit too easily at Sirius. It could be a double bluff admittedly, but I tend to think that Sirius and the ECoPTM are different.

Could be an entirely wrong tangent but still fun to speculate
