Triggered by this post I contacted Mount Wilson and asked them if they knew what star was honoured to be the "first light" of the 100-inch telescope that night.

The answer came in just now (this thread goes waaay too fast already):

From: Mount Wilson <mountwilsoninst@gmail.com>
Re: Contact New Form submitted on Mount Wilson Observatory

Although it is not recorded in any written record we have encountered, "word of mouth" passed down over the years has "Sirius" as the target, although "Vega" could also have been.

Best regards,

Can't be Vega it's too low so Sirius it is.

Obsfuscated by Sirius

An Sol-Sirius line out to the outer Rim, possibly a dark system out there?
slope and rise calculation method?

They wouldn't go that way twice would they?
