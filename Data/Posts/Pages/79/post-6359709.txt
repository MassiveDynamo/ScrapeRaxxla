"They're powerful, twisted men. Powerful enough to hire an assassin to kill the threat to their dominance." - The PewPew Crowd

Dedicated whining sociopaths determined to get their way who'll never stop, never give-up and never end.

When Brooks and Braben left, the terrified staff stormed their offices and ripped the story boarding off the walls, dumped it all in the recycle and then set fire to the dumpsters, finally free to spend all their time trying to satisfy the insatiable and freeing us all to persue our "personal narrative". You're on your own mate.

As for stellarium, you'd probably be better off attempting to contact the estates and descendants of the principles at the observation and beg to rustle through their papers. Or ask Brooks, "did you do this?"

Fine gold-leafing there, tinfoil is so yesterday.

Yes... the biggest gap in my theory is that it requires Frontier to be able to pull something like this together which is not something that they've proven themselves to be adept at. But heck. I've chased Cassiopeia A. I'm willing to pursue another phantom if need be.
