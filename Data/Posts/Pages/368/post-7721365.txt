One of the by-ways in my notes is about Carl Sagan's 'Contact' novel - Qixi - the chinese festival is apprently mentioned in it and Vega plays a pivotal role in the plot. Before I add this to my burgeoning reading list, anyone read it in enough detail to be able to give chapter and verse?

The story includes all sorts of stuff, like numbers hidden in pi, and whatnot, judging by the wikipedia entry, and there are dodec space ships. We have in game Sagan references, such as Sagan class ship etc.

btw - yes there is quite a frenzy on Scolio's discord channel - I hope it doesn't just turn out to be ear candy..
