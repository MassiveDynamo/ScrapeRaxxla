Have a watch of this video from the early planning stages / kick starter.
Toward the end David states they'll be locking areas for newer content.
MB confirmed Raxxla IS in the Milky Way, but not if it's in a permit area.

Seems likely the trail will lead to permit locks, like the Thargoid links did.
