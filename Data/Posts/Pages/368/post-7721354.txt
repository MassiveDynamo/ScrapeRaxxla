Since I have thousands of bookmarks this may take while...I have a picture somewhere deep in my archive.

A guy was re-posting some (three IIRC, cca 6 months ago, elite unsolved misteries title?) unsolved stuff from the game (not his findings).
One was audio signal with image similar to yours.
No reference from where it come, but I recall this signal was first mentioned few years ago (unsolved, luck of interest).

IIRC, there is another old audio signal from somewhere with FD message inside mentioning elite with letters (that one looked like a devs joke to me at the time).

There is no lack of interest is the Independent Raxxla Hunters discord where the investigation is still ramping up. https://discord.gg/pgebTcr
