If it were to be permit locked there is a lockd system (unpopulated) about 15ly from Shinrarta, cant remember the name. Spotted it on galmap a while ago. No population, so no factions, so no known way (currently) to get the permit.

I’m not so sure nowadays that it is so close to the bubble. I posted a couple of weeks ago about the first rumour date with some handwavium hypothesising about possible fsd range at the time. That suggested it could be a long way out assuming it was TDW (a band of “dedicated explorers”) who found it, they could have been exploring for a long time before its discovery.. And if its a station of some kind (e.g. Guardian generation sphere) it may not be detectable until you’re very close-1000ls is already used in game, so perhaps 10ls for this? So you wouldn’t find it by scanning alone, you’d have to trip over it..

it to be a Guardian generation sphere then with the accretion of millenia it might appear to be a small planet/moon....

Strong with the tinfoil this one is...
SPOILER
Edit: Closest permit to Founders looks like Hodack, about 20Ly away.
(eddb.io won't do a permit search on unpopulated systems for some reason)
