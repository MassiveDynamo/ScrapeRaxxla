I am doing the Cassiopeia run. So far found Alpha, Beta, V640, Gamma, Rho and heading to two others though it is one hell of a trek. Anyone else on this? Also, this signal from the centre of the galaxy that looks like mountains. Does that look like the constellation of Cassiopea? The jewel that burns on the brow of the Mother of all Galaxies.
