That's correct and what I was alluding to, they didn't find anything... I was postulating the question. Is it? Do the clues resolve to the lady in the chair to the nova or something else?

Probably not but Astrophel as a clue is pretty weird and discounting the romantic prose Sidney was a pretty clever chap and loved to reference and hide meaning with his text...The Odyssey and the links for Penelope all stem from Astrophel and seems to point to Cassiopeia.
