Have a watch of this video from the early planning stages / kick starter.
Toward the end David states they'll be locking areas for newer content.
MB confirmed Raxxla IS in the Milky Way, but not if it's in a permit area.

Seems likely the trail will lead to permit locks, like the Thargoid links did.

Plenty of permit locked areas in the verse. I dont think Raxxla is in one, there is no evidence for that hypothesis either way. Seem vaguely to remember that somebody at FD said they were surprised it’s not been found yet (but haven’t the foggiest where that came from, may be incorrect).
