We have been there before Tigorath, but its tough when there are 368 (very long) pages of this thread. Please don't ask me to find it.. Maybe the august members of this thread will show you where..

Several CMDRs have search Cass in some detail, but to my knowledge, nothing significant was found there. Also she is the mother of Andromeda - in myth not a galaxy as they didnt have galaxies then (in fact not until the 20th century) - and only one galaxy not plural galaxies (in every language translation its plural). The Andromeda galaxy was known as 'The Great Nebula in Andromeda' until relatively recently.

I suspect we've all missed this clue which lies in a different vain, away from Greek mythology and the constellations, and if we crack it then I suspect sudden progress will occur. Gotta think differently..

However I could easily be completely wrong, so don't let me dampen your enthusiasm...go search - maybe you will see what we've been too blind to notice.
