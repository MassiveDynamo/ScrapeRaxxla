Tycho A, B, seven planets and one moon already tagged and mapped.
Note: Currently hiding about 22Ly from the Orion Nebula Visitor centre.

It is a run-away star...

(though strictly it should have move 80km/3e8m*(3305-2019)=0.34ly from now to 3305...)

Of course Tycho G is the supernova star in Cass. and it isn't in the older star catalogues such as HIP so maybe FDEV were being straight..
Its catalogue number is MASS J00252358+6408019, [RCM2004]+Tycho G
