Is Tycho's star Raxxla and its hidden from the gal map?....I understand some honoured Cmdrs mapped that location, but what if you cant find it through the gal map...what if you have to eye ball it!

Been adrift now for so long...maybe its time I returned to dock and sobered up this space madness...

Tycho's star!
Search on EDDB.io or in the galmap
Tycho A, B, seven planets and one moon already tagged and mapped.
Note: Currently hiding about 22Ly from the Orion Nebula Visitor centre.
