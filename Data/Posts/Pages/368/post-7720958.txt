Plenty of permit locked areas in the verse. I dont think Raxxla is in one, there is no evidence for that hypothesis either way. Seem vaguely to remember that somebody at FD said they were surprised it’s not been found yet (but haven’t the foggiest where that came from, may be incorrect).
That sounds vaguely familiar and I'd be inclined to agree considering the range limitations imposed by earlier drive technology. If we're dealing with a system within 100 Ly of Sol, surely someone has stumbled into the right system by now, and if they haven't there must be something preventing entry?

The Pilot's Federation have some level of control over the permit locked systems and it would make sense to select Elite CMDRs from within their ranks to promote into more clandestine operations like Raxxla hunting with TDW but I'm not so sure FDev is ready for their prize mystery to be solved just yet.

If The Dark Wheel (84) novella is correct about Elite rank, Shinrarta Dezhra still seems like the best fit due to Farseer's comments about the faction and the qualifying unnamed gas giant and moon. Maybe the new mission server / dev crafted CG system will bring back the Raxxla related TDW missions?

It's possible some of us may have already triggered the entry requirements...

Edit: On the subject of permit locked regions I spotted something way too geometric in the star density around Barnards Loop. Bookmark these four systems and see if you can spot the corners of a cube:
