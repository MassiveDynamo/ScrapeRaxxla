Hi, I am CMDR KeyboardNinja27 and I would like to join the search.
So far I've read a portion of the thread. However, it is taking a while.
How can I be of service?

Welcome, KeyboardNinja27, the best thing you can do until suggested otherwise is try and catch up, and watch the forums. People occasionally come up with a "can someone check out [x] system?" or such. If you're free fly over and join in the fun.

I've been at this since the start of the game and I don't really know anything more than you, so get reading and come join in the fun!

Aside: Stock up on tinfoil and biscuits and you'll be fine...
