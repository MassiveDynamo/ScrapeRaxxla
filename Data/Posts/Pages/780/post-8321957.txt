I think the penguin got him. they both disappeared around the same time

I saw a post from the ninja penguin on another thread very recently (possibly the one that led to DWagar leaving the forum), so heâ€™s still around somewhere. Perhaps he just got fed up with the Quest, or maybe he found Raxxla, or has been inducted into TDW.

On the other hand, you can never be sure where the penguin really is-he is a ninja, so may be creeping up behind you!
