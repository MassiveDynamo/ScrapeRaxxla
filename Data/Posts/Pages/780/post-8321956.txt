By the way, did someone try to insert the hearts of the targoids into the base of the Targoids?
I heard that there are Targoids who do not attack and you can come into contact with them by yawing, someone tried to throw them the hearts of Targoids?
I do not have the opportunity to test, if they did not, can someone try?
I saw video guy tried to insert guardian relict on base. Everything went crazy and hostile around.
