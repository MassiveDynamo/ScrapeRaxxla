Dunno @SkyRock I aint killed one yet but if I do it will be for the bobblehead. Probably someone has at some point, a lot of people have tried a lot of things with Hyperdictions to try and 'communicate' with the friendly Thargs who are usually the hyperdicting ones (new word just invented, you saw it here first) but no results so far. Belief is they 'cant' respond, they have no facility or function to do so....atm. Personally I just dance with them, they like to spin so I waltz with them, no apparent response so far

@Jorki - did you see DW latest livestream, might even have been last night, talking about Elite from 1984 - today? Seemed a lot more upbeat in general and much more relaxed about ED and looking forward to the Lore Tour again so seems like all good there he may just stay off these forums. I can foresee a 1000 Cobra Mk iii doing that tour, mine will be.

When does the lore tour depart? Would like to do another expedition, but wrapped up in the Quest at the moment.
