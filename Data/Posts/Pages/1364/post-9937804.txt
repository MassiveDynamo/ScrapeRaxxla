rogue is a thing I have not seen, interesting.

wanted to say, I turn the orbit lines off when they act stupid as in too much flicker. it is rare
but I have them on normally because I want them on so I can see where I am flying.
I don't use auto pilot and I have flown soooooo much. I am either slow driving and don't care, or usually bored of that and need to dock, so fly at the speed of 6 -5 seconds most of the time, pushing to 4-3 often
to do that and not have to do a loop of shame, it really helps to see before you feel all the G wells around you. or some places I use that to slow me down at the right time.

more importantly is if you see them and no bodies or stations, a question should be asked. but if the orbit lines are off, you would not notice.
many things hide this way.
