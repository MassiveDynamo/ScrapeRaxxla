Yes, the same, though I downloaded 15.1.2(?) update Saturday I haven't installed it yet. But I dont think the version of EDD is relevant here, the problem is ED and the journal file for Beta Hydrae.

Have you looked at your journal file entry for the system? Are you a new visitor or been there before?
First visit there. Looking back over the journal files but to be honest I'm not certain what's significant. There are certainly mentions of bodies A B C but since I've left the system now I can't tell you what was there initially or not. I had hoped to be a useful additional data point here but I should have gone in with a better process!
