there are like 100000 hand-authored systems - any RL catalogue star or sector, any system with a name instead of the SF name, you know the Pre-Euk...xxxx ones.

So nothing noteworthy in itself to be H-A - its a real life catalogue star.
I don't think that's quite right. There are a huge number of catslogued stars, but the systems aren't all handcrafted, they are still mostly subject to the proc gen for the bodies within the system.
