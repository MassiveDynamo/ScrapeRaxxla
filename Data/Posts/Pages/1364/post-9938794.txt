Can't say I'm seeing the same result on EDD. They all showed up when I honked. Are you running an up-to-date version? I'm on 15.1.1.0
Yes, the same, though I downloaded 15.1.2(?) update Saturday I haven't installed it yet. But I dont think the version of EDD is relevant here, the problem is ED and the journal file for Beta Hydrae.

Have you looked at your journal file entry for the system? Are you a new visitor or been there before?
