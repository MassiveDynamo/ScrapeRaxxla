I'll defer to your knowledge on these mechanics, but this still points to it being a hand-authored system, doesn't it? That's a curiosity if nothing else.

Dropped into Beta Hydrae.
Charged on the NS, galmap won't let me plot a route taking the range into account. Might be because the NS is not the primary? Galmap isn't perfect when it comes to NS's...
No other funniness with the supercharge. Registers the damage immediately, not lost it yet.

Flew into the BH for a while... Jumped to Spica on a whim.
there are like 100000 hand-authored systems - any RL catalogue star or sector, any system with a name instead of the SF name, you know the Pre-Euk...xxxx ones.

So nothing noteworthy in itself to be H-A - its a real life catalogue star.
