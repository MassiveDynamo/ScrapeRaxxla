weird system!!
Signs point to some handcrafted element in the system throwing off normal interactions then.
If not that, then what? Doesn't make sense unless it's a really obscure bug which only affects this system, but in that case still indicates a possible custom system, no?
Maybe file a report!

I'll pop over there to play around with it also. Has me interested.
