I dont yet understand. How are these Rogue Signal sources being found? Are they the incoming Stargoids? Are they left behind by the Stargoids? Detail is lacking!
it did appeared while i was hunting for comets/ Hyperbolic Orbiters in the Anomaly System. the HOs seem highly correlated too the Anomalys.
As i got close to the HO for the System the anomaly was suspected to fly by it appeared in the NavPanel.
Others also found this Signal just by flying in the general direction of the Anomaly. (without targeting via GalMap)
exiting SC at them seems to fail to load some asset and causes a Game crash. (huge Spoiler assets look in crash dump for yourself if you are fine whit spoiler)

It looks like non of it is Raxxla related. Only the build up for a new narrative in the Thargoid stuff.

Something new to pewpew at.
