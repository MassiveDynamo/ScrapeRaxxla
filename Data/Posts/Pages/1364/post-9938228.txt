Yes, thanks!
I thought it was all Thargoid-related, didn't expect it to be Raxxla-related. just didnt understand how the new signal type was being found.
it seems the RSS lacks behind the Anomaly. even though there is a big discrepancy between, were the Anomaly is, and were the RSS is. the anomaly#2 passed the Star before the RSS.
So far all sighs lead to the same conclusion:
this is not fully implemented stuff. And will lead a lot of people into hunting ghosts.
