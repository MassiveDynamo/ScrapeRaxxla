In my humble opinion, this is the mindset, commitment and understanding of a CMDR who will find R.
A great read.

I think we got that from your reveal post. It's like trying to get into the mindset of a kid (Braben), in order to figure out the cipher he invented, where common nouns and verbs are instead replaced with names of persons-of-mythological-interest. We have to become hyper-sensitive to "hmm, that's peculiar".

But there are two problems:

1. BUGS are also peculiar.

2. Not everyone wants to be that hyper-aware all the time. It's very similar to "not everyone wants the adrenaline rush of PVP all the time". You went crazy from it.

So it's a bad system to implement, really. Not "fun". Which is why, we're looking, but mostly half-; only a couple people have reached the level of autism / OCD required for the kind of search that's required. Which brings me to the third problem:

3. Putting in the effort, hyper-awareness, etc., doesn't guarantee success. You don't even know if you've succeeded.

Anyway, thank you again for that bit of info in your last post: Whatever Raxxla is, IT'S NOT LABELED AS SUCH. If you're deep into Greek mythology, you may think you're looking at whatever Greek deities correspond to it, but it's up to you to believe, or not.

So, TLDR:

1. Must be triple elite.
2. Must pay attention to odd NPC behavior or names, related to several pieces of Greek mythology that have been posted (thank you).
3. It's a long string of events that requires perseverance (and combat).
4. Raxxla is not labeled Raxxla. You may believe you've found it, or not.

EDIT: I'm not criticizing CMDR Guru 951, I'm criticizing the implementation of this "mystery", that is, the FDEVs or whomever decided to do it this way.
