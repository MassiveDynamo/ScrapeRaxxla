Going in that direction Gaea would also be a candidate, in myth she created the whole of the universe from chaos. Havenâ€™t checked to see if there is a system Gaea, but if not the only thing that we have in game that is Gaea is Earth.

My point is considering "mother of all the galaxies" as being the apparently largest one.
As many people used to say, in a perfect English:

1. Saddam Hussain's reply to the coaltion's ultimatum was that 'if any army set foot in Iraq that they could expect the mother of all battle's'.

2. If you don't get your finger out you are going to get the mother of all bollockings from the boss.

3. Are you going round to Geordie's tonight? they say he is going to throw the mother of all parties.

The jewell that burns in the brow of the mother of galaxies

There is a difference, though, and it's the "all" term lacking. But not in every localisation.

FD inconsistencies transcend even the language in the game ! [haha]
