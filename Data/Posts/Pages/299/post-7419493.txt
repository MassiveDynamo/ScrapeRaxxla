Did nobody check out the galnet report of a stealthy lunar base found by Fed Navy by its distress beacon?

It may be false news & not implemented in-game, but if it is then it could well tell us something about this station stealth technology (e.g. how close you must be before it shows up on sensors/fss)

There has been talk about it yeah. If by lunar they mean our moon then we know where to look, if not, who knows. I don’t believe it’s a base we can detect ourselves in game, so idk how much we can learn from that as far as how to detect stealth tech, since the moon isn’t landable, and we can’t discover a base there ourselves.
