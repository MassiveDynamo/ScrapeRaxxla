Looking once more at the Alleged Toast of TDW:
The first two sentences begin with 'To...', suggesting that those steps - if indeed this is a way of finding either their base or Raxxla - involve a journey, but the third sentence does not. Perhaps 'the parent's grief' (note that the apostrophe indicates the singular case of parent), 'the lover's woe' (also singular) and 'the yearning of our vagabond hearts' are things we need before we can then make the final journey - to Raxxla.
.
These clues are all tricky to interpret because there are a multitude of mythological sources potentially involved. We're assuming mythological inspiration for the Toast but there is nothing in the Toast itself to confirm or deny this, so it is a risky assumption. Even using constellations is risky because of their Sol-centric nature.
.
My current thinking is that the first sentence is intended to lead to a particular system, although I'm a bit worried that this may be too simplistic but it's a starting point at least. I then interpret the second sentence as meaning that we need to make a hyperspace jump from that system. In order to get to Raxxla, we would then need the ingredients mentioned in the third sentence. These might be things we need to find or collect but I would not exclude the possibility that a data material could be one of them. Making the hyperspace jump in a certain direction - or perhaps any jump in any direction from the system referred to by sentence 1 - will perhaps trigger a 'misjump' or cause us to jump to the location of Raxxla.
EDIT: an alternative explanation for the third sentence might be that it is referring to the three primary Elite rankings, suggesting that once you reach the right location, a Triple Elite pilot can then jump straight to Raxxla.
