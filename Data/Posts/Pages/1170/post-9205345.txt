What if the Omphalos Rift isn't only about the Omphalos but also about the Rift? We have this thing called the Great Rift in the Milky Way. What if we would take the Omphalos of that? Take the 2 edges of the Great Rift, find the middle and find Raxxla there?
Yep i thought and posted the same, but its a long trip on a gamble
