New theory, what about Beta Lyrae. It sais there are clues in the story Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars. Beta Lyrae had binairy stars in the old elite games and it crashed if you went there because of it (it was not an intended feature but a bug) Now the system is in Elite Dangerous, has no stations or is under any superpower. So might be interesting.
