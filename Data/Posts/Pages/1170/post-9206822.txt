Ok... So the colonia logo, the raxxla logo, and the odyssey logo all share a simplified eagle symbol thing... So maybe you have to walk around on a planet in Colonia... Just a random thought... Probably nothing.
Garuda might be worth a look out there - It is a mythological Bird... also if i remember right it has a planet with 8 moons. Havent visited since odyssey myself.

Does anyone know if research has been done to cross reference Annunaki related names with star systems?

I think there are a few associated with the old constellations ... but would be worth looking into
