Garuda might be worth a look out there - It is a mythological Bird... also if i remember right it has a planet with 8 moons. Havent visited since odyssey myself.



I think there are a few associated with the old constellations ... but would be worth looking into
Cool. I started to hypothesize what if guardians were actually Annunaki and ran down a yt rabbit hole on them. (Not ancient aliens as source material)
