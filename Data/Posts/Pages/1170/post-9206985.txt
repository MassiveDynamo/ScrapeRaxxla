Presume you mean this bit?

It just isn't known by that name to the rest of the Universe. The common name for the planet is ****** **** **. Edit - Oh... that's in the swear filter!

(Had to remove the sentence breaks so it went into quotes)

I think thats just a joke by that person Anyway if its called something else is it really Raxxla at all? Theres a suggestion by Drew in that thread that MB upcoming book may have some clues, this is possible as he was one of the few who actually knew where it was but dunno if theres anything in that. Cant be too obvious or someone would have found it but maybe if its found some links can be made with hindsight.
