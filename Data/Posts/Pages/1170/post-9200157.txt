for the low price of 3000 British pounds, it could have been named by someone arbitrarily.

Or sadly it’s equally probable that it’s just placed arbitrarily, filler, an afterthought, or just placed in the wrong location altogether, or part of something else entirely unrelated, which itself may be bugged or discarded. We shouldn’t take everything FD do as written in stone, nor reliable, that alludes to an assumption they had a plan, or that someone no longer involved in FD had a plan, because it’s as probable those plan/s may have been overwritten or even discarded intentionally.

We know nothing. But it’s as good a start as any, in a galaxy of needles in one haystack.

Axi Mundi is interesting, because there are other ‘axi’ in game such as Delphi/Donars Oak, Yggdrasill and the 4 Roman gods of the winds. Which themselves are interesting and purposefully named and placed.

I wonder how Axi Mundi aligns along with any of these.
