Ok... So the colonia logo, the raxxla logo, and the odyssey logo all share a simplified eagle symbol thing... So maybe you have to walk around on a planet in Colonia... Just a random thought... Probably nothing.
Could be a simplified Pilot's Federation logo (the Griffin), but the Dark Wheel logo has the same centre symbol so might be a hint Jaques is in TDW.
