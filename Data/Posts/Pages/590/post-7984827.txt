But for those looking for the DW invitation, my thoughts are:

From Premonition I infer Luko, Rebecca, Elyssia and Salomé were all members of Dark Wheel. Luko left TDW medallion engraved “Salomé” in her ship. Luko said to Hassan about Tionisla Orbital Graveyard “They say it was once the headquarters of the Dark Wheel”; Rebecca’s ship was interred there, that’s where Rebecca and Elyssia met Salomé & that’s where Rebecca was killed by The Club’s minions (no, not the yellow cuddly kind who like bananas!). So, if anyone wants to get the TDW membership invitation I think they probably need to continue Salomé’s work (looking at the ninja penguin & Scytale here! )

Which part of Salome's work? The original 'scary stuff in the Rift' or the X-Files tribute-act known as 'The Club'? There was so much retconning of that story that it's difficult to know what's relevant/accurate, unless Reclamation is no longer canon. Also, even Other-Drew admits that Luko was full of , so I wouldn't trust anything he said or did - especially if he said it to Hassan.

That reminds me, I need to add to my sig.
