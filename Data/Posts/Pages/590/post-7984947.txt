Which part of Salome's work? The original 'scary stuff in the Rift' or the X-Files tribute-act known as 'The Club'? There was so much retconning of that story that it's difficult to know what's relevant/accurate, unless Reclamation is no longer canon. Also, even Other-Drew admits that Luko was full of , so I wouldn't trust anything he said or did - especially if he said it to Hassan.

That reminds me, I need to add to my sig.

Reclamation is still lore. It or any of the other official ED novels probably have nothing to do with finding Raxxla or TDW. MB once said the Raxxla narrative would unfold in-game. The codex is probably part 1b (the discontinued missions being part 1 ) . It seems that none of the writers have any more info regarding Raxxla / TDW, than we have.

Even if Luko knew The Dark Wheel, it doesn't mean that DrewW does.
