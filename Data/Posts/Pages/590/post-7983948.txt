Hello everyone forgive for the language but I use the translator, I have been following this post from page 300 and I am more hooked than the TV novels of the 90s, thanks to all for all the theories and conspiracies that I could read I do not have so much head to connect things like you.

I love my theory and if Raxxla is a physical place on earth and we have to locate it by geocaching, that is why everyone must follow his path and in a hole there is a chest where he says the coordinates thanks to everyone and greetings from Spain.

Pd: I wear the aluminum foil hat.

Nice theory. I think I know where you are coming from and if so, it is probably 1. Unreachable 2. Off limits.
