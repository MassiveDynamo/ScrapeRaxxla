I wonder if we can estimate the number of people who kept within the bubble and those who explored just outside and how far they will go away from the bubble.
I know when I started in 2018 I didn't bother going any further from the bubble unless it's straight to Pleiades sector.

Seems like this could of been found if every system was catalog very strictly with time, date, systems,
