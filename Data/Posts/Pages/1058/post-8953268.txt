Regarding space-dust biting theories:

I'll try to finish the Isis-puzzle although I'm a pessimist about it being related to Raxxla. Drew appearing in this thread kind of makes me think that he had a hand in designing Isis.
There's still the obvious possibility that The Club is the cabal as mentioned in the Raxxla-codex.

For now my biggest hope is the Dahan-system, which others already failed at decoding.

Otherwise there are some mysteries like the disappearing ships in Ququve/Zelada/Aimyia and of course the creepy Generation Ship Thetis, where I'm currently trying to decode the audio (ring modulation seems to be a promising approach).
