CMDRAscorbius claims to have been there and heard it directly from Michael Brooks at Lavecon in a Q&A. The full video from twich seems to have gone, but someone clipped the important bit here in an earlier post: https://m.twitch.tv/clip/SnappyScaryMousePupper

Just in case that disappears (or if Jorki is on his iPad ), I've done a quick transcript below (I left out the thanks for his additional followers as it's not relevant).

"I was in the room when Michael Brooks said the thing... the system where Raxxla is has been entered at least once by a commander, they just jumped and off they went. ...They either scooped and gone...He didn't say anything else but the system where Raxxla is has been visited. So it's not in the 99.99999999% of the rest of the galaxy... we have been there. Whether you trust my word or not.... is.... that's a thing... but I was there when he said it, because he said it at Lavecon and it was in a Q&A. Erm so it's not in a locked system but we just don't know how to find it or what even it is... or what even it is.... I do think the Dark Wheel have something to do with it..."

Whilst there is speculation in the statement, he does claim to have been there at the time and heard the comments directly.

Well that narrows the search for RAXXLA a little. By my reckoning, at least a couple of millennia.
