Well ...maybe that was old days so. Now "honk" automatically puts name on all stars in system. Even without honk, just scooping - star will be mapped 10-15s later.
I play 1 year about, so dunno how was that initially.
And there's your answer, obviously the explorer didn't honk near the star in the old days.
