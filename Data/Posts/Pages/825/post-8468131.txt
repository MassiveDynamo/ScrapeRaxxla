That there are two seems suggestive of a Magellanic Clouds visual artefact, but with only two system samples it is not possible to draw a conclusion, however the fact that it takes about a minute before they start to show then seems very odd, possibly (though I am no graphics expert) suggesting they are not a graphics artefact? Did you raise a bug report on this and if so what was FD reaction?

Their appearance seems suggestive of something designed. Is their shape fixed or does it change with time once they appear?
Do they show on FSS once they appear in the system map?
Did you try to hunt them down in system to see if their position in system map changes as you move around the system? Would be a slow job if you have to wait a minute after every localisation run...

I don't think they have anything to do with the Magellanic clouds. The angle and distance between them are to different in the two systems, to make any sense.

They look designed. I have seen them close in VR and they have a deliberate shape and animation. In the map they are located in a plane between the planets / stars and the background stars. When you pan the map, they move about half distance of the regular bodies.

The animation is a fade in / fade out sequence. They show up after about a minute, grow for a few minutes and then fade out again. In the middle of the animation, a brighter central dot shows.

From Deneb(small dots are background stars):


Their position is fixed in the system map. Once the system is scanned, you don't have to be in the system to see the effect.

If this is a bug, I would guess it's something that spilled over from the VR system map. That one has some similar (not exactly the same) effects and no background stars.
