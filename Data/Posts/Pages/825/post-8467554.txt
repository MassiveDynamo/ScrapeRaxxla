This is oft stated, but there is little evidence to support the statement:

It should be first noted, that although our drives are restricted to jump only to stars, earlier tech had no such restriction in lore, and thus if you wanted to plot a route somewhere, you could do so as long as you had fuel etc. This means that 8ly jump range is not a problem for deep space exploration (please see the original novella, where the young Ryder jumps to Rafe's ship in the middle of nowhere )

We expect to get somewhere in a matter of hours. In the original novella, Ryder senior had been away for months, and possibly longer. You can get a long way in months at 8 ly per jump.

So I think it is not reasonable to expect Raxxla to be close to Sol. - TDW station has its own reasons to be in the bubble - mainly that you need to be where the action is, but for Raxxla, it could be anywhere in the M-W.

I'm not disagreeing it may not be in the bubble. That is based on lore based clues and the belief is shared by others (i.e. Drew who recapped this in the livestream, which is why I called it out in my livestream summary.).

However, isn't it also true before 3290's with the new FSD technology, FTL jumps took time. I.E. there are several historical statements stating that a jump of 'max range', which was 7 lys in a Cobra, could take week(s). If the time factor was still in play, Ryder didn't make it that far in months. Or is this no longer cannon?
