Was thinking that your system map anomalies might actually be some form of spatial anomaly rather than a rogue planet. Either that or they’re visual artefacts of the Magellanic Clouds? Have you tried the FSS in these systems to see if they’re detectable? Have you tried SC towars them to see if they resolve/disappear? Is the sightline towards the Magellanic Clouds? Is there one or two or more of them in the system map? Just haphazard thoughts!
The only two systems I have found them consistently are Alpha Cygni(Deneb) and Star of India. There are two of them in each system. In Deneb they are quite close to each other, in the bottom right part of the map. In SOI there is one center / top of the star (it's behind the star unless the sysmap is zoomed out a bit) and one low left.

It takes about a minute in the map before they start to show.
