Well, it's just a star. Why would you scan a star? I once discovered a patch of white dwarfs above Barnard's Loop, scanning icy rocks like crazy, purposefully leaving the white dwarfs unscanned. They're just electron-degenerate matter, basically just canned plasma soup gone bad, ew. I believe PF made me elite for doing stuff like this, or somebody at the office made a mistake or something.
Well ...maybe that was old days so. Now "honk" automatically puts name on all stars in system. Even without honk, just scooping - star will be mapped 10-15s later.
I play 1 year about, so dunno how was that initially.
