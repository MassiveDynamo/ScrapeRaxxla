I'm not disagreeing it may not be in the bubble. That is based on lore based clues and the belief is shared by others (i.e. Drew who recapped this in the livestream, which is why I called it out in my livestream summary.).

However, isn't it also true before 3290's with the new FSD technology, FTL jumps took time. I.E. there are several historical statements stating that a jump of 'max range', which was 7 lys in a Cobra, could take week(s). If the time factor was still in play, Ryder didn't make it that far in months. Or is this no longer cannon?
A max range jump took one week, in the old games. If your max range was 7 ly, it took a week to jump 7 ly. If your max range was 100 ly, it took a week to jump 100 ly.

The 7 ly limit from Elite doesn't mean much, I think. That limit is for a specific Cobra Mk III, with GalCop setup. It was an artificial limit.
