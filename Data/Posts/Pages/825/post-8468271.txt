I don't think they have anything to do with the Magellanic clouds. The angle and distance between them are to different in the two systems, to make any sense.

They look designed. I have seen them close in VR and they have a deliberate shape and animation. In the map they are located in a plane between the planets / stars and the background stars. When you pan the map, they move about half distance of the regular bodies.

The animation is a fade in / fade out sequence. They show up after about a minute, grow for a few minutes and then fade out again. In the middle of the animation, a brighter central dot shows.

From Deneb(small dots are background stars):


Their position is fixed in the system map. Once the system is scanned, you don't have to be in the system to see the effect.

If this is a bug, I would guess it's something that spilled over from the VR system map. That one has some similar (not exactly the same) effects and no background stars.

Mmm, Was thinking perhaps FD had implemented Dark Matter lensing of the Magellanic Clouds!
No, if they’re animated then don’t think they can be graphic artefacts. Possibly a hint to the existence of anomalies? But in that case don’t see why they’re only in two systems, and presumably when you fss they don’t show as such in-system? But then weird they don’t show until the system has been scanned? As you say it might be a bug carried over from VR, definitely worth people raising bug reports to see what the Dev comment is.
