Hmm... well even if he was on a tour for a long, long time - that does not really have to mean that it's outside the bubble.
In the end he was also searching for it in this time right? I don't own the books and just know the bits of information that got thrown around here, so sorry if I'm completely wrong.
But if he had to search it, it could be close or far without a problem, imagine you'd have to search every bit of space close to SOL, it would take time for sure.

The only two systems I have found them consistently are Alpha Cygni(Deneb) and Star of India.
That's actually pretty interesting, I'm on my way to Colonia right now and I've scanned a lot of systems but never noticed anything like that while doing so. So maybe, even if it's not related to Raxxla, it could mean something else? Those blue spots appear when the scanner finds some signature in the end right?
