So I was staring at the Codex Map today and noticed the grid was centered on SagA* (in my mind how it should be) not Sol - looks like it has the PM going through Sol though. So I cleaned it up a bit and tried to figure out the numbers they were using. Dont know if someone has already done this , but..
Here is the Codex map
SPOILER: CODEXMAP

Here is what I was able to see
SPOILER: GALAXYMAP

Does make for an odd 93 slices, and probably meaningless... Just thought it interesting.
