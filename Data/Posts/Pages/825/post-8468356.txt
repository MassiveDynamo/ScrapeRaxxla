Just a stab in the dark question or two here.
Does "RAXXLA" exist in previous Elite games?
If it does exist in previous games then woundn't it be better to search there as a starting point at least?

I have been pondering this since the confirmation that it exists "in the game". I thought does that mean "Elite Dangerous" as "in the game" or "Elite" as a games series.
After all "RAXXLA" is been there from the beginning hasn't it?
