Well, it's just a star. Why would you scan a star? I once discovered a patch of white dwarfs above Barnard's Loop, scanning icy rocks like crazy, purposefully leaving the white dwarfs unscanned. They're just electron-degenerate matter, basically just canned plasma soup gone bad, ew. I believe PF made me elite for doing stuff like this, or somebody at the office made a mistake or something.

Part of the problem of covid lockdown is trying to devise menu ideas (without much effort since I’m not into cookery), especially lunch ideas. I’m getting fed up with cheese sandwiches, paté or scrambled egg on toast. Did have a quiche the other day. But now I’ve got a new lunchtime menu idea...
Tin of cold plasma soup! (Used to have a Spanish girlfriend who got me hooked on gazpacho). Now does condensed matter go well with a garlic baguette??
