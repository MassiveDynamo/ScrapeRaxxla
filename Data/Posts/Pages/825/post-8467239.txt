That just means that the Millenium Falcon had great jump range and Han didn't have to zig-zag his way to Kessel.

Almost, it’s because he actually took a shorter route via the Maw black hole.

Was thinking that your system map anomalies might actually be some form of spatial anomaly rather than a rogue planet. Either that or they’re visual artefacts of the Magellanic Clouds? Have you tried the FSS in these systems to see if they’re detectable? Have you tried SC towars them to see if they resolve/disappear? Is the sightline towards the Magellanic Clouds? Is there one or two or more of them in the system map? Just haphazard thoughts!
