... which reduces quite a lot the area of search.
Start of with Styx. It's the only one with a Greek theme. Then make sure that there are no location in the system that you haven't been within 1000ls of. If you don't find, it's time to do the same in the other few systems.
Brute force super cruising is the way to go. Gamma pill is next. Only a few hundred systems, I think.
