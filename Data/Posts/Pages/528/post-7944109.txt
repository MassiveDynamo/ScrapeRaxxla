It's not the only confirmation. DB has said it exist in other interviews. MB went as far as saying it's in the Milky Way. Raxxla's existence in the game has been confirmed several times. The codex quote "Raxxla is a definite place and that it holds a mystical secret." probably describes it best.

We have never had confirmation that Raxxla is:
Not permit locked.
Scannable
Reachable with current equipment
Recognizable when found
That would have been nice to know.

As far as we know, DB has only had one other "interview" where we could say he confirms Raxxla's existence, but there's pages of argument in this thread alone debating if he was actually answering the question or not. (I personally think he was, but even then, all he said was "of course (it exists)".

MB has definitely said it is in the milky way and it's a journey everyone must make for themselves. This could mean that Raxxla is in his closet at home.

As for the codex, the context around your quote makes your presentation as hard evidence a bit disingenuous.

I'm not denying that Raxxla exists, just that we ought not assume it is a physical thing in game to discover. We have to be pragmatic and accurate with the info we're given, which has been purposefully phrased to be ambiguous. I'm only supplying proof that our least ambiguous confirmation isn't as solid as we thought.
