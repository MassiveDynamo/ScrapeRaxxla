Styx would be quite close to MB’s “that’s a journey we all must make”. The journey through life to death....

But the lore says Raxxla was found much earlier, so not so sure it has to be all that close to the bubble.
I agree. The colonization of Achenar in about the same period as the first mention of Raxxla tells us that they could move, even back in 2300.

If you can get a full colony to Achenar, an exploration expedition should be able to do a few thousand ly.
