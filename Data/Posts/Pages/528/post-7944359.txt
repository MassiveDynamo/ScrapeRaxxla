System DROKIO LS-A B33-0, Outer Orion Spur sector.

This was posted in a PS4 community. I think it has some potential for the former menu screen people were thinking might have housed the dark wheel station.

Not in game to check that system’s stars, but the Horizon menu screen that I hypothesise over ( a harmless hobby at my age!) has an early Orbis wheel type orbiting low over an ice moon with another ice moon close by. The stars are bright blue white, so I’ve been looking in dual O, B A, F systems. The earlier non-Horizons menu had a Coriolis octahedron type in a system with twin yellow stars. Think FD probably updated it to make it fit the Dark Wheel station narrative.
