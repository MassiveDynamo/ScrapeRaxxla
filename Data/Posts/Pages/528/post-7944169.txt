In 2014 ?
Must be very close/inside the Bubble/SD..

I thought the game didn't release until mid/late 2014? Was this a sensible thing for DB to say at the time? So what was the max jump range achievable in 2014? I think end of 2015 when I started playing it was around 24ly in an AspX from what I remember when I started FRifting; I do remember it took me a lot of jumps to get out to Zurara. So maybe 35-40ly in an unshielded stripped explorer annie? This estimate needs confirmation from someone with a better memory than me. Unfortunately my first 6 months or so game logs were lost in an update so can’t get back to check.

But how far is feasible for a dedicated band of explorers and adventurers like TDW, or the original Ryder expedition? Since an expedition was required in the original novella I don’t think it’s all that close to the bubble. This lore would presumably have influenced DB’s thought processes on this. I still suspect out as far as Heart Neb region is feasible for DB to place Raxxla (assuming it is findable, but then anyone who doesn’t think so is wasting their time in this thread). I do think it’s likely to be near something notable in-game, like a famous black hole (not Sag A*) or big nebula.

Edit: didn’t some of the early lore say the goids were also looking for Raxxla?
