I agree. The colonization of Achenar in about the same period as the first mention of Raxxla tells us that they could move, even back in 2300.

If you can get a full colony to Achenar, an exploration expedition should be able to do a few thousand ly.
Yep. And that's just the manned stuff. We also need to take into account all the unmanned stuff, which would have constituted the majority of exploration in early days.
