I thought the game didn't release until mid/late 2014? Was this a sensible thing for DB to say at the time?
I bet FD thought that the open beta testers, who mostly were fans of earlier Elite and knew about Raxxla lore, would find it in no time.
Something happened and turned it out in a different way. Then that ".. why it hasn't been found " statement. There was a reason and FD knew it.
Raxxla was bugged. Just like pretty much everything at that time.
Then came the E/F missions and Raxxla became a major feature of the game (no longer an eye wink to the early fans), but too smart players, like The Boss, came too early too close to solving the Quest and spoil all that stuff. E/F missions out !
And now, well, we all know what we are left with..
Imho.
