I can't just imagine FD putting Raxxla in/near the Rift and then telling DW to write a story unfolding there but without touching Raxxla...
Or can I ? Oh yes, after all I can. They even could have done all this expressely...

Indeed- could have been the original obfuscation. Didn’t DB also say something like he thought it would have been found by now?

Can’t remember how far Heart is from bubble at the moment, but was thinking if the goids are also after it then perhaps Barnard’s Loop, Running Man etc; maybe also Cave Neb, NGC 281 ....
