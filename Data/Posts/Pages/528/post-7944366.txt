Start of with Styx. It's the only one with a Greek theme. Then make sure that there are no location in the system that you haven't been within 1000ls of. If you don't find, it's time to do the same in the other few systems.
Brute force super cruising is the way to go. Gamma pill is next. Only a few hundred systems, I think.

Styx would be quite close to MB’s “that’s a journey we all must make”. The journey through life to death....

But the lore says Raxxla was found much earlier, so not so sure it has to be all that close to the bubble.

Edit: sigh. Jorki’s docked in Rohini & Tyko’s mooching around near Altera’s Eye. Do I really want a second clone to investigte the bubble? With all that roads to riches & ship engineering effort
Meh!

Does Styx (or any of the other bubble systems) fit the Codex toast? Omphalos? Astrophel & Stella? As well as “journey we all must make” etc?

I think the E/F missions were “obfuscation on the outer rim”- “SD thrumpberry juice deliveries” and FD took them out because of all the salt farmed after the Salomé event; they didn’t want that level of adverse publicity over Raxxla.
