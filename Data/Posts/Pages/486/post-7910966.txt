I'm going to have another look for the Mayflower 97. I've plotted an economic route from Tau Ceti to 49 Ceti (iirc) which is the last inhabited system in that direction. If I find nothing I'll continue on to HIP 8178, then try a more direct route from Tau Ceti to HIP 8178 if that turns up a blank....

Went to hip 8178. Nothing and nothing in betweem though I must admit 30+ ly jumps.

I also checked HIP 8178 and surrounding systems a few weeks ago - sorry for not reporting back the negative results!
Thought I could at least share the distance sheet I have created, for those of you who haven't done this already by themselves.
It shows the coordinates for the route (vector) from Sol to Tau Ceti elongated up to a distance of 725 lightyears and makes it easier to check whether you are still on the right track. For a better overview I chose steps of 15 lightyears.
