Personally I think that Princess Astrophel and the spiraling stars simply points to this region of the sky:


Vega being princess Astrophel and the visible Milky Way are the spiraling stars.

Raxxla is somewhere in the triangle, I guess?
Did a hike out that way maybe 200ly or so, nothing popped up on FSS, but didn't scan all the systems (most were expectedly discovered)
