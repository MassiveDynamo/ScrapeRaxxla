As a long shot, regarding Vega and Tau Ceti, I spent some time on the course from Tau Ceti to Vega in supercruise until I got to about 1300c, (about 660 Kls travelled), at which point I thought I was too likely to miss anything I might encounter. I did the same for Tau Ceti to Sol. Nothing found either way.

I'm going to have another look for the Mayflower 97. I've plotted an economic route from Tau Ceti to 49 Ceti (iirc) which is the last inhabited system in that direction. If I find nothing I'll continue on to HIP 8178, then try a more direct route from Tau Ceti to HIP 8178 if that turns up a blank. I'm not that hopeful, as the Generation Ship Lycaon (in Alaunus) is broadly on the same course and I don't see two Generation Ships following such a close route (then again, the Lycaon was the one following the Mayflower's course...).
