Has anyone tried lowering their rep with TDW in SD? Maybe if they’re a fake group, standing up to them might yield the attention of the real group.

But they’re not a fake group; as Felicity said in the Codex DW fakes are quietly shut down but they’ve been in business for several years. A DW member says in Elite Premonition that DW is a consortium, wheels within wheels, and SD DW is just the outer rim.

But try it by all means..
