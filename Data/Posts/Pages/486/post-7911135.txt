These discoveries were made long before the 3.3 beta. (At that time I was shadowing The Boss and his mean gang of DECE throat-cutters in the outer rim, in order to prevent them finding Raxxla and then keeping it for themselves. And also, I must admit, because he is well known for setting up great campfires with nice music, tons of booze and a dozen of nude girls jumping over the fire... Very funnier than wishy-washy Dr Kai's and Co... Aaah... happy past times.) Yeah, some sort of corruption of the database, must be.Almost all of these red dots are systems I discovered, tagged and sold. The system map icons appear in white and I can open them.Funny!
SPOILER
That red/blue dot feature just doesn't work in my game, at least with long time visited systems. Nobody else has the same issue?

If so, there are tons of Raxxlas then...

I would say yes. There are tons of potential raxxla. Each one has a 50-50 in it either is or it isn't. Us siths deal in absolutes.
