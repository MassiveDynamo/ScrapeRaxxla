at this point... feels like one of the hidden eggs in Ready Player One. I've gone back and reviewed every video interview of David Braben, making notes, and even reaching out to Ian Bell.

I wish we could verify Raxxla actually being somewhere, with more than David Brabens bar chat with Drew Wager. I know Raxxla has zero relevance on the game or game play. For example: reaching King/Admiral did nothing for game mechanics. Finding Raxxla will be a whimper and not a bang. (unless it explodes?! See my previous post with possible Raxxlan bombs) However, finding Raxxla, will ease our decades of search, and sleep at night would be good.

The group that finds Raxxla may get a free round of beers for the next 20 years of FDEV conventions. Or some Elite Commemorative socks.

But honestly â€“ we are more likely to first discover the great monuments and grave sites of Robert Holdstock and Ian Bell, casting a shadow longer than whatever is discovered on Raxxla.

I sent Ian Bell some very specific science papers i knew he would like last year, thought about sending him some books off his amazon wish list. I know DB and him had a falling out, and the last version of elite they did together DB shutdown after only a year, releasing a new version out of their final contract. But, I really think there was a magic with the two of them with their hearts and heads in this world. Sadly, time determines who our friends are.

We should do a kickstarter, raise money for an IAN BELL DLC - he would probably refuse and respond with some Plato quotes...

But in my head, the project would be amazing.
