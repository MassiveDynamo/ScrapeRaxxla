Do we have any in game lore for the origin of the human species?!

Here is a funny hypothesis. We side with the guardians to only later find out that raxxla is their means of escape and earth is the gate. The kicker is, in order to use the gate, they have to smash the moon into the earth to activate it again and destroy all mankind(on earth at least). And they are hellbent on doing it. Even funnier if they put us on the planet for some reason.

Maybe it turns out the thargoid vs guardian is like god vs fallen angels. Which one would be the fallen angels? I'm not that familiar with it. IE, which one is the older group and which the offshoot?

That sounds like a heck of a button.
