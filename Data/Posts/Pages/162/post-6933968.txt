Do we have any in game lore for the origin of the human species?

I'm sure Guardians would have noticed Earth, perhaps even visited the place, and considered it pretty basic ELW. Or maybe they liked watching giraffes and had some tourist beacons. It would have been very long time ago anyway. Earliest human species started appearing about two million years ago, so it would fit the timeframe though, so who knows..

Mars however, I think that place is something totally different.
