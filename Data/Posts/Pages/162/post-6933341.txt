Raxxla Origins

Are the Guardians waving to us from the Andromeda galaxy?

Who built the gateway? An Alien race obviously. The Thargoids? I don't think so, legend tells us they found it and kept it's secret safe. The Guardians? Well they're certainly alien, and they may have had a very good reason for building it; to escape the Thargoid enemy that was wiping them out. So did they escape to another galaxy, and that't why we're only seeing ruins now and maybe a Guardian station/mega-ship, if the new trailer can be believed.

Let's forget the Guardians for a (little) bit. Where would an alien race build a gateway? One guess is in their home world system for easy travel and perhaps even mass evacuation. So one would search for an Alien home world, but where to search for such a place?

I had a look at the galactic map on edsm.net, and there's currently 3(5?) guardian sites (Col 173 Sector) relatively close to SOL. Would an Alien race not build more bases close to home? This area may be worth a closer look. I know, it has probably been searched extensively, but there's probably more non-visited systems our there, just widening the search area a bit.

I counted 7 question marks in the ramble above, but hey, remember this is a quest

Btw: Raxxla Origins would a cool title for a book, Drew? (8, I know)
