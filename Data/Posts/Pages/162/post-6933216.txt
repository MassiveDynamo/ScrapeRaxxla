on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and lifeâ€¦"
That quote sounds like a pretty classic case of breaking the 4th wall. "Alien device" is your BBC Micro, Acorn, NES, PC etc. It was 80's.

That of course would be boring, and since Raxxla was supposedly added into the game at some point during developement, likely untrue also.

Perhaps these new Guardian orbital installations could reveal something new and interesting to tinfoil about. You know, something like, "while mapping all star systems and objects of mass, Guardians detected an anomaly in our galaxy, an error in calculation they could not identify, only a few isolated areas with unexplainable energy fluctuations.." "An object with unnatural stellar dynamics, undeterminable age or origin, presumed an artefact of some far older civilization.." "The organism was still creeping in the newly built network, where it had evolved and thrived, and could no longer be stopped. Shutting down the dimensional loop was no longer a possibility, so the AI had to shut down itself."

This is the minimum level of weird I'm expecting from new logs, if there are any, otherwise I might stay with reading books and drinking tea at the Gnosis.

I don't understand why you keep bringing up the tattoo, its just a tattoo.
