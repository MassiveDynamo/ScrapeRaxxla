They will find Raxxla only when FDEVS let them to do it. Waste of time

Nothing in ED is a waste of time (technically, it's all a waste of time; it's a game!) It's not finding Raxxla that's important it's what you're doing in the game to find it (ie playing the game).
Hence, why this thread is still worth visiting even with no clues as to Raxxla
