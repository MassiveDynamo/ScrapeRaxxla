Had a fun 5 min in game this morning, ship stationed by nav beacon at Artemis, and remembered they emit a morse code of the system name. Popped an App on phone and saw the audio signal graphically scroll, then the algorithm translate it in real time…ARTEMIS…

Moments like that are priceless in this game.
