Something that has been giving me pause for thought this week is that The Dark Wheel missions disappeared as Horizons came out and we got access to planetary surfaces. I wonder if Raxxla was changed at that time to be a surface location rather than space-based.

An Omphalos Rift at the 'navel of the world', might suggest looking in a conspicuously large impact crater. As to what is there, perhaps the inverted pyramid suggested from the story of the Oisir-Raxxlans? Or at least an obviously artificial structure. This would give a bit of extra focus when searching systems amongst the lost realms.

At the moment I'm out on the perimeter of Barnard's Loop looking for more Guardians sites and will likely be there for the weekend but I should be back in the Bubble early next week.
This is quite likely and was probably the plan from the start. There are quite a few indicators that FD kept the original idea that Raxxla is a planet.

1. Rafe Zetter: "Your father was chasing the mythical planet Raxxla" (original)
2. Mission 'Answering the call of adventure': "a certain celestial body". Door, key, myth.
3. Letter from UC:
SPOILER: LETTER
4. Codex: "Raxxla has been suggested to be anything from an unremarkable moon to a state of cosmic enlightenment."

If FD wanted to be as close as possible to the original, it fits to put the 'alien construct thatâ€™s a gateway to other Universes' on the ground.

Another option is that FD used their original Raxxla idea for the Guardian sites and had to make a new Raxxla concept. This would have made the missions redundant.
