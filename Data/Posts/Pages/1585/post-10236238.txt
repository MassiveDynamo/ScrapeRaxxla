Pondering the following text from Paradise Lost:

‘He views in bredth, and without longer pause Down right into the Worlds first Region throws His flight precipitant, and windes with ease Through the pure marble Air his oblique way Amongst innumerable Stars, that shon Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, Like those Hesperian Gardens fam'd of old, Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there. He stayd not to enquire’ John Milton Paradise Lost.

Context: Satan has left hell, made his way up through the realm of chaos, then finds and is directed by the characters Chaos and Night (from their thrown), up towards heaven, then he finds the pendant globe, alights upon its surface, wandered lost towards its apex, guided by the light of heaven (for it was gods will he found Eden) and then from the golden chain/stairs flew into it and down towards Eden, down through the spheres where he observed ‘other Edens’ before settling down upon the surface of our sun.

In the text these other Edens are described by Milton as much like examples of the ‘Hesperides’ and of that of the ‘Fortunate Fields’, concepts of utopias similar to that of Elysium.

This strikes me similar to that in the writings of Holdstock, where he described Eden as a ‘Lost Realm’, comparing it with the said fortunate fields and the Hesperides and others alike, not far-fetched being that both utilised classical references.

But considering those systems I identify as being in the lost realms area in game, could we consider that Brookes intended to build that area of systems, not only as a reference to Holdstock, but also as a reference to Paradise Lost - ultimately combining the two texts into his own creation.

If that were true then do the Lost Realms in game equate (from Brookes presumed perspective) to be the said ‘other Edens’ as they were equally compared by Holdstock to be similar to ‘otherworlds’, that these other Edens were the same observed on Satans decent, - then does this potentially go towards further, establishing the Lost Realms being ‘above’ Raxxla, and it hanging below it like a pendant world?

Again this is my personal hypothesis and a creative analysis of both texts in relation to elements in game, in the absence of any real evidence to the contrary; this equally could be wrong, but it makes a beautiful analogy of what might be in game!
