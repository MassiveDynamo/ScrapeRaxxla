Had a fun 5 min in game this morning, ship stationed by nav beacon at Artemis, and remembered they emit a morse code of the system name. Popped an App on phone and saw the audio signal graphically scroll, then the algorithm translate it in real time…ARTEMIS…

Moments like that are priceless in this game.
That is cool. Have you tried if the app manages to decode the Thargoid morse as well?

I almost died this morning. Forgot to log off yesterday and was nearly out of fuel.
