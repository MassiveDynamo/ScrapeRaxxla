Given the multiple potential paths, has anyone been going to these systems and DSS scanning any airless bodies that are landable to see if certain POIs types are more common in certain places. Based on rumors, certain systems should have significantly more interesting types of POIs if they are near parts of the infrastructure for parts of Talmor/Raxxla (including nearby uninhabited systems). Raxxla likely isn't just the Omphalos Rift itself. Though, I would certainly love to be able to travel to satellite galaxies and/or Andromeda. I know in my explorations, I have grown to realize certain star types or orbits can have an impact on stuff observed in the system.
