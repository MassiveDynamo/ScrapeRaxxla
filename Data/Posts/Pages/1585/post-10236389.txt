I have my own copy now of Paradise Lost, so I'll read up on the context of that quote but I'll have a look for the lowest named system around the Lost Realms region, now that I've returned to the Bubble. Additionally, I want to take a look along the Sol - Axis Mundi line and visit some of the systems close to it, though not going too far down.
