Something that has been giving me pause for thought this week is that The Dark Wheel missions disappeared as Horizons came out and we got access to planetary surfaces. I wonder if Raxxla was changed at that time to be a surface location rather than space-based.

An Omphalos Rift at the 'navel of the world', might suggest looking in a conspicuously large impact crater. As to what is there, perhaps the inverted pyramid suggested from the story of the Oisir-Raxxlans? Or at least an obviously artificial structure. This would give a bit of extra focus when searching systems amongst the lost realms.

At the moment I'm out on the perimeter of Barnard's Loop looking for more Guardians sites and will likely be there for the weekend but I should be back in the Bubble early next week.
