A personal theory of me is the following. A lot of greek mythology is inside Elite Dangerous. A lot of it however is "unintentionaly" because a lot of stars have names from greek or roman gods. Like Atlas, Zeus etc. However there are some systems that are deliberately named after mythology. For example Delphi and a system called Axis Mundi (Axis Mundi refers to the centre of some things, Omphalos Rift just saying). It also seems that they made Merope an important place for the Tharogoids. It's late and I don't remember why but I made some connection to this and the story of the Seven Sisters. (https://theconversation.com/the-wor...ers-stars-may-reach-back-100-000-years-151568). It's also a mysterious story that has been told in many ways and is in different cultures (where they tell it differently). Perhaps this is our Princess Astrophil story.

Sorry it's late and I don't have the will to go deeper into this but I just want to make a point that there is a lot of (mostly greek) mythology in the Raxxla myth and generaly in Elite Dangerous. Delphi, Omphalos Rift, ...
