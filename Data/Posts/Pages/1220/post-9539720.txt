I think I might have found the location of Raxxla. It might be in Axis Mundi. Axis Mundi is something from many mythologies, each saying Axis Mundi is the Omphalos of something. Omphalos Rift. It's a system in game with 2 stars (Princess Astrophil and the Spiraling Stars). It's not a real star, it does not exist in real life. So Fdev has specificly named that Star system Axis Mundi. It is a system with only 2 stars and one of has an exact star mass of 1. They chose to name that system that way. Now we just need to find it there.
