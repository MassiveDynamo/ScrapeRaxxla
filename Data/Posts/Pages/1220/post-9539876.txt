No no, Axis Mundi is an actual system in game. It's close to Sol (122,91 LY). The system has 2 Binairy stars. (https://www.edsm.net/nl/system/bodies/id/23599/name/Axis+Mundi)
I know that, and by using that system as a reference point being "centre" we found the centre of the galaxy using that as a reference Juenae HJ-G c27-4013 and the others following, unfortunately nothing resides in the system itself unless a point in a direction in supercruise and go is the way we are supposed to find anything
