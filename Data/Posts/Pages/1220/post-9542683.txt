The name of Ariel can be attributed to the Archangel Uriel (John Dee).

Within John Milton's Paradise Lost, Ariel was another rebel angel who fell with Lucifer; whereas Uriel was an Archangel who was 'Regent of the Sun' who directed Lucifer to Earth.

As the moon of Uranus it obviously brings up the association to the muse Urania and the Silent song of the spheres, essentially the outer rim of Milton's pendant universe?
