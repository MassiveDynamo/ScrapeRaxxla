what is 'a tiny bit obvious'?

Well for me I have a problem with the word 'tiny'.... MB is an author and most likely scripted his answer before the interview as he knew he was going to be asked about it. When I heard him say 'a tiny bit obvious', I didn't raise an eyebrow but when I see it in the written form it bugs me as I would expect him to say "a little bit obvious" or just "a bit obvious"... probably nothing but we look for clues anywhere.... ;-)
The tiny bit obvious thing I just keep hearing the Mars relic when its mentioned, found in 2280, Raxxla first apparantly mentioned in 2296 then Mars completes a near impossible (by Elite own standards) terraforming completion date shortly before in 2291....11 years they completely terraformed the planet yet todays terraforming process takes 100+ years, the Dark wheel "had Raxxla but lost it" could refer to the people who had the Martian relic before the feds confiscated it from them, after this there was a huge push to Achenar against the feds later known to become the Empire, 9The Empire once held many Dark Wheel members...apparently)
