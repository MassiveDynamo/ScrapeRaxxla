Me and a good few more where working on this for a good while, also lead us towards the absolute true center of the galaxy which isnt Sag A, Juenae HJ-G c27-4013 is the system closest "True Centre" for those wanting to know or Stuemeae OW-A c27-6347 in proportion to Sag and is near direct center between Sag A and the G2 Dust cloud, or if we where to go by the grid reference, x,y,z the coords would be 10, -985, 25895 Juenae WZ-Y d5983 and 1 or two more circle it
No no, Axis Mundi is an actual system in game. It's close to Sol (122,91 LY). The system has 2 Binairy stars. (https://www.edsm.net/nl/system/bodies/id/23599/name/Axis+Mundi)
