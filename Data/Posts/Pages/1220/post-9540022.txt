Not sure how the system Axis Mundi refers to the center of the Galaxy ( I do like the idea though)... but it is kind of close to Achenar. Which does bring up a different axis.... Drawing a line between Achenar and Alioth ... about 3/5ths of the way there you pass by (almost between) Sirius and Earth. The axis mundi system doesnt line up with earths axis or the axis of the solar ecliptic... but the name is definitely intriguing.

Edit: the Axis Mundi system is a real system just renamed for Elite: HD 8821/ HIP 6693
