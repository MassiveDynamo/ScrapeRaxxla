I think I might have found the location of Raxxla. It might be in Axis Mundi. Axis Mundi is something from many mythologies, each saying Axis Mundi is the Omphalos of something. Omphalos Rift. It's a system in game with 2 stars (Princess Astrophil and the Spiraling Stars). It's not a real star, it does not exist in real life. So Fdev has specificly named that Star system Axis Mundi. It is a system with only 2 stars and one of has an exact star mass of 1. They chose to name that system that way. Now we just need to find it there.
Me and a good few more where working on this for a good while, also lead us towards the absolute true center of the galaxy which isnt Sag A, Juenae HJ-G c27-4013 is the system closest "True Centre" for those wanting to know or Stuemeae OW-A c27-6347 in proportion to Sag and is near direct center between Sag A and the G2 Dust cloud, or if we where to go by the grid reference, x,y,z the coords would be 10, -985, 25895 Juenae WZ-Y d5983 and 1 or two more circle it
