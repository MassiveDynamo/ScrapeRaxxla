I gently pointed out, quite politely, that there was no evidence for his conspiracy theory (indeed there could be no such evidence since it would need access to the communications between NPC within game which clearly only FD have; it could not be a conspiracy by FD, since instead that would be a game design decision. FD Support responded to him along the lines that it was the latter, but the conspiracy was still being pushed). So he was effectively just disseminating misinformation. I got a very salty response. At that point I deemed him a troll and added him to my ignore list. It has grown quite large over 7 years of playing!
Interesting that you managed to reply to me quite a few posts after that regarding the comet galmap hacking matter. It seems like it was actually after that that you blocked me because I disagreed with your 'hacking galmap is the way to do it' approach, eh?

Interesting.. hmmm.... not so clean cut eh??

TBF, I am totally annoying
