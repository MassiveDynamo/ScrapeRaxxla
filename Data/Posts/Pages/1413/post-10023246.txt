Did you? that's really interesting! Was it the same sort of brown planet, like the one above and this one from 4 years ago:

Whoah, this one frame is something else... full blown jumpscare.


Although that video does highlight how Elite has every other game out there beat for "Prettiest server desynch animation"


To answer your question, in my case the details are hazy as it was well back around the time of the great beigification. But if I recall correctly, my ghost planet looked somewhat like this end of the metallic range.




In my case I had just dropped into the system at the star, honked, didn't see any particularly interesting planetary arrangements like nested binaries and the like, so was jumping right out to the next one on the way to my destination. I do wonder if this is a bug they left untouched precisely because it leads to these kinds of old spacers' tales.
Would also not put it past them to mean this glitch any time they say "Raxxla is ingame".

Still not the most shocking thing I've seen when jumping though, that was probably the time I dropped out of a jump and nearly flew straight into the planet that was suddenly directly in front of me between me and the star filling most of my screen, inside the fuel scooping range. That image was immediately screenshotted and made its way onto my Distant Worlds 2 commemorative mug.
