Does anyone have a list - or know anything about - the numbers on Stations?

I know there's the famous old DBOBE quote about making a note of the numbers, is there anywhere that has done that?

I ask because I'm still thinking that the Raxxla logo itself is heavy on the 6's, as discussed (6, 6 sided shapes around a 6th 6 sided shape with 6 gaps between it) I wondered if there's a numbered station that might somehow be called 666 or 66666 maybe... it's a long shot

I doubt there will be one, but if someone knows of a list somewhere then I can just have a look and debunk this one pretty easily

thx
