Does anyone have a list - or know anything about - the numbers on Stations?

I know there's the famous old DBOBE quote about making a note of the numbers, is there anywhere that has done that?

I ask because I'm still thinking that the Raxxla logo itself is heavy on the 6's, as discussed (6, 6 sided shapes around a 6th 6 sided shape with 6 gaps between it) I wondered if there's a numbered station that might somehow be called 666 or 66666 maybe... it's a long shot

I doubt there will be one, but if someone knows of a list somewhere then I can just have a look and debunk this one pretty easily

thx

Regarding the numbered stations; Michael Brookes resolved this one himself; it was ‘number stations’ David said it wrong, he was discussing those fixed probes which emit code that point to various mysteries eg Gen Ships etc.

The numbers in the space ports were confirmed much later by FD to be not related, there is a basic seed that generates them, but only for Feds, it’s just ‘flavour’ according to FD.
