They really look alike.
It's not like it is a trivial task to render/generate a Planet in ED.
I totally agree. Below is everything I have, I'd love if it we can go Mythbusters on this one

Note: these are not all planets, I've been trying to collect evidence of anything weird in witchspace. Again, the goal here is prove/disprove. I've only collected two confirmed planets, plus now the anecdotal evidence of three more (two you've seen here in this thread).

The below from my notepad, I've not got any real thoughts other than cataloguing them so far, make of them what you will. I'd love ideas and help on this. @Yuki Estelle (Ithink that's right?) and @MrShinyTorterra and @Chaparral was also interested in Witchspace ideas.

Note: Can't find any of these bug reported?? Doesn't look the same as a braben tunnel or other jump issue? something new? bug??
Note: contacted Bro Jamgles from 1st vid to see what he was doing at the time, no reply.

Really long weird jump - PLANET!

FC sees PLANET in Witchspace and ends up off course (Debunked Misjump, the destination name is weird, the system has 2 names in Galmap)

"Green tunnels" are not a known bug (not in the bug reports system, nothing in Fdev patch notes)

Note: have experienced many witchspace connection bugs myself. long tunnels are not significant. CTD results from a hard disconnect, not significant. Can't replicate green tunnel??

connections:
Jaques?? Antares? Halsey? - all misjumps/jumps gone bad. Are there others?
Were these clues to consider witchspace?

How did Jaques jump 20k ly?? He was an explorer and came back to the bubble before making his last jump, heavily modified his station, how??... Jaques station randomly placed? why would it be there specifically? signficant?
