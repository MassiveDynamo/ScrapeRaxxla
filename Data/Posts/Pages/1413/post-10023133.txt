Regarding the number stations; Michael Brookes revolved this one himself; it was ‘number stations’ David said it wrong, he was discussing those fixed probes which emit code that point to various mysteries eg Gen Ships etc.

The numbers in the space ports were confirmed by FD to be not related, there is a basic seed that generates them, but only for Feds, it’s just ‘flavour’ according to FD.
Ahaaa... well another idea down in flames
Thanks muchly
