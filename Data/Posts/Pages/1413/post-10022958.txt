While I was going to look for Guardians components, on the way back, I come across a gas giant with 8 moons.
Synuefe DN-H d11-8. Immediately I thought about Raxxla

As I approach the eighth moon, I discover colors that remind me of those of the Omphalos. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalos

And on top of a small mountain, at 36.1/-88.1 some weird marks.


I didn't have time to explore this moon, but one thing is sure, I will return.
