So I can think of a couple basic ways.
1) a hyper jump that requires you to jump with low fuel to get there making the return jump a risky bet.
2) a designation in a star system that requires so much fuel during SC that, once there, a jump out to the nearest star is a risky bet.

In both cases you could die yourself back to your last dock though.
Which could explain how cmdrs may have been there but don't know where, because their explore data went poof.

Interesting. I have never tried to set a hyperspace jump such that it my reticles are dead head straight on a black hole. I assume unless FDev made a special case exemption, that the jump would get rejected for being blocked ("destination target obscured").
The actual black hole is, as I understand it, incredibly small and the visible stellar object is only gravitationally distorted light. So idk if that would get in the way or not.
