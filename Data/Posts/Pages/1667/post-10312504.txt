The path "North" from Aquilla (the Eagle) on the horizon, across the magpie bridge past Vega and Draco, to Ursa Minor and Polaris, could be significant in some way?
Even in Holdstock and Malcolm Edwards book on legends it mentions that Ursa Major is visible. I will put a proper post together in a bit. That has some interesting influence in search area. It cannot be in Alliance territory.
