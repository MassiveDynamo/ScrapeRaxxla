The part that troubles me is that Raxxla is apparently in a system that has been honked but not discovered. Is not virtually every system in the bubble discovered? I could be wrong since I have spent very little of my time in the bubble but, from the little I've seen it seems like the bubble is fully discovered. No?

A few years back FDEV did state there was still one unvisited system in the bubble....that is a single system, so it's highly unlikely that now, several years later, that is still the case.
