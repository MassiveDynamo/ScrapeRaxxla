There is no point in speculating that Raxxla might be located within an area of influence, in the bubble or not in the bubble.
There could be more than one Raxxla or a distributed Raxxla consisting of several locations - and there could be something in the bubble and somewhere else at the same time.
Maybe it is distributed over several locations and the one(s) in the bubble are locked and you first have to find one or more locations outside of the bubble to be considered worthy to use it and obtain the permit for the location(s) in the bubble.
Maybe it is not at a location but a certain sequence of actions (geometric pattern formed by sequence of jumps, pattern of star types) and maybe it could be found more than once, anywhere.
Even if there is only one Raxxla and only one part of it: Maybe it was in the area of influence, but it moved on - maybe Jacques took it with him and in order to access it, you must first persuade the barkeeper to sell you drinks.
