rabbit holes are way too deep, its simple on the surface.
"Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" -- Star-lover and the Spiraling Stars, so we're talking stars. Particularly spiraling stars.
Star 1: Jewel that burns on the brow of mother of galaxies. So what's a star with a high temp that is just short becoming a black hole?
Star 2: Whisper in witch space, siren of deepest void. What star gives off sounds that sound like whispers in SC, and entices sailors to make a dangerous journey that may strand them?

I know two of the things I'm looking for....
1. I am fairly certain it is in the serpentis region.

2. "The whispers in witchspace" is already being analysed: there is a spectograph a bit earlier in the thread that shows a symbol that needs clearing up.
(it's when in the hypertunnel the sound can be heard northwest in the cockpit IIRC)
