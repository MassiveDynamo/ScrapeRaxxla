Im pretty convinced that Raxxla (the key to it not necessarily the place) is in the bubble.
Why? mainly because of what Drew Wager said about the very first Elite system and some of those planets now being in our current Galaxy, i also think that the 7LY range on ships back then has a relevance.

I still believe Raxxla itself is not in our Galaxy but the bridge/passage to it is (re The Alien World book).
