A few years ago there were some undiscovered systems in the bubble, but since then certainly this is far less a reality.

There likely is some missing component to the mystery which FD may have promoted but we haven’t picked up on.

Simply finding the location on its own makes the mystery rather simplistic, unless said system is very far away or if said element is hard to find.

In the past certain features could not be found without direct interaction. Eg the Mki eyeball scanner snd close proximity flying. Therefore there was a period of time when said systems would have been discovered but possibly not wholly mapped. So the presumption exists that any discovered system is 100% explored; this might not be the case entirely.

The mystery also could very likely be tied to factions.

There maybe a singular faction or a string of factions which need to be unlocked. Or applicably a series of missions found?

I do suspect Brookes was hinting a lot about Raxxla, especially in his public blog with his Drabbles, possibly alluding to an area of space close to Shamash etc. but I don’t feel he was being entirely specific.

What too then of other official FD posts?

For example who or what or where was Ethel Moonshot, how was the Winking Cat involved; what was mentioned in which copy of Sagittarius Eye shown in that CM Chan 4 broadcast!

Again singularly I don’t believe they point anywhere specifically, but collectively they hint at something more environmental?
