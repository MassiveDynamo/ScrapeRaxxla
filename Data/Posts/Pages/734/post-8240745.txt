I’m trying to go with the “it has to be obvious” quote because it seems to be the best guide..

so is there anything im missing that is blatantly obvious?

only two I can think is

Princess Astro and Spiraling Stars
Delphi / Omopholus Rift

those are the only two “obvious” things they’ve given us , but sadly I haven’t turned up anything on those threads

also I’m super convinced someone(s) has already found Rax and is keeping it hush hush...I’m not paranoid your paranoid...
