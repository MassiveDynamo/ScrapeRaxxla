Well now I'm confused... who's side do I take?!

I was doing some more of my Operation Less Than Three missions for TDW > NUENETS (V886 CENTAURI FUTURE) and receive a follow-on mission to assassinate a pirate from TDW from the very group I just delivered too?!

(and I also received a new tip off mission for HIP 1742 B5a).

I think I'll take the mission to kill the pirate to see if my rep declines for TDW in SD since I've never received an assassination mission against TDW before.

Took the mission, killed the pirate, TDW faction declined in LFT 926 and I lost a bit of rep. When I got back to SD, I noted that I was no longer 'Legendary' with TDW faction broker offering missions. Wish I had taken a prior screen shot, but after ranking back up to >100% allied this is all I get... I'll have to keep plugging away to see if I get back that Legendary comment.

By, "legendary," do you mean allied status or is there some other status I've never heard of?! That would be quite interesting.
