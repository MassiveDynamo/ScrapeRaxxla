sitting on a bench in winter, ate dinner and washed down with vodka, a bear sat next to him and played the balalaika, when suddenly I understood everything.
everything is according to canon =)but seriously, what we are looking for should be found very easily, and you ....
Raxxla being inside the bubble, they said that you can get there on a cobra. as I understand it, at that time there was no FSD and Fuel Scoop, the year 2296 was the first mention, and during this period there was only sol and tau ceti. the first line of the toast indicates sol, what do you think?
I think Raxxla wasnt found in 2296. I think they found something (possibly the omphalos rift) that indicated its existance and this whole thing about it having to be reachable in an ancient cobra is a fantasy. There is also no date for the toast... so that could be and was most likely created later. That said there is no reason it cant be close to sol (omphalos might indicate it is) except there are also clues such as "obfuscation on the outer rim" .... i suspect there are a few things to find possibly in different places.
