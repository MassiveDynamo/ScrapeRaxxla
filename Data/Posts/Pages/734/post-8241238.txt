sitting on a bench in winter, ate dinner and washed down with vodka, a bear sat next to him and played the balalaika, when suddenly I understood everything.
everything is according to canon =)but seriously, what we are looking for should be found very easily, and you ....
Raxxla being inside the bubble, they said that you can get there on a cobra. as I understand it, at that time there was no FSD and Fuel Scoop, the year 2296 was the first mention, and during this period there was only sol and tau ceti. the first line of the toast indicates sol, what do you think?
There is a fair chance that Raxxla is in or close to Sol. The systems that were inhabited in 2296 were at least Earth, Tau Ceti, Delta Pavonis, Altair, Beta Hydri.
Other close systems, like Alpha Centauri and Sirius were of course also well documented.
Hyperspace capable ships did exist. Their range is unknown.

If Raxxla is in any of these systems, it means that it does not show up on FSS or ADS scan. That would mean we would have to see it, hear it or know the direction, to find it.
Knowing the direction is most likely.

The DW toast may have directions. DW have however not found Raxxla, so either the directions aren't very good or the toast originates from outside the organisation.

The other option are to get directions from an Omphalos point. A natural axis of some kind.

For the direction thing to work, Raxxla needs to be far enough out from the system center to not be in an orbit. Otherwise it would move out of position, rather quickly.
