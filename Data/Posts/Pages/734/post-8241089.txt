This is one of those mysteries i would like to know. I would really like it to have more meaning than just a way for the playerbase to find the barnacles.... And it seemed at the time that there was something we were supposed to find or realize... but it didnt happen... so who knows. Its probably broken now...

I was hoping for another sphere around the witch head nebula but didnt see one. Anyone else look?

I remember people looking for other UA spheres all over the place, you’d have to ask Canonn since the threads were “cleansed”. I seem to remember people looked in WH neb at the time, but may be fooling myself.
