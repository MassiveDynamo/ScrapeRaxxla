And WHY do UA point to Merope and UP point to Merope5C in particular? Clearly there should be something special in/about 5C, but weâ€™ve searched and scanned it ad nauseam with no findings.

Tinfoil time: lore might suggest that 5C is a thargoid planet-sized ship that has become covered by cosmic detritus over millennia, but surely the fss should indicate that since it can indicate mineral composition and presence of human/other presence?????
Fss does only what fdev wants it to do. If fdev wants something to not show up....

Idk why the system name for the permit was omitted, but if anyone is interested a google search would fill you in. Assuming everyone searching for raxxla has already ranked up in most things its not really necessary, and not necessary to obscure for the same reason.
