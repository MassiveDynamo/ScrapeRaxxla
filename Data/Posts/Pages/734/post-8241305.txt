sitting on a bench in winter, ate dinner and washed down with vodka, a bear sat next to him and played the balalaika, when suddenly I understood everything.
everything is according to canon =)but seriously, what we are looking for should be found very easily, and you ....
Raxxla being inside the bubble, they said that you can get there on a cobra. as I understand it, at that time there was no FSD and Fuel Scoop, the year 2296 was the first mention, and during this period there was only sol and tau ceti. the first line of the toast indicates sol, what do you think?

All known facts on Raxxla are itemised on the first age of this thread.
We don’t know anything about the location of Raxxla other than it’s in the Milky Way (Michael Brookes), nor what it is (David Braben).
FD never said Raxxla can be reached via a Cobra-that’s inference and from the Salomé/Zurara storyline.
There must have been an fsd to be able to get to Tau Ceti and the other initial colonies, though lower range than current drives.
