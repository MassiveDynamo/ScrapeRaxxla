Well, went to Celaeno. Found NHSS threat 3 quite close to the station. Dropped in & killed two Berserkers. Video recording still u/s so no holiday pix!
Yep ...go into 4 it is 3 of them there and a lot of 4 too. 3 is rare enough.
Also you may try 5 - it is upto 8 berserkers or friendly intreceptor ... my best - managed to kill 2 hearts >:

And trick is, why to use this system, leave fighter on station and go back using exploring ship. Delivery takes 75 mins from jameson to there. So next time you just come and swap ships.
