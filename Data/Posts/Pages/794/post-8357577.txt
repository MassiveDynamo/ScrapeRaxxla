@Jorki Rasalas , sorry i dont mean to argue, but it certainly appears that the Club have broader intentions than just Project Dynasty. As far as we know, they are still in control of all human events in our galaxy. But again, the connection i am interested in investigating is why the Dark Wheel are so strongly opposed to their efforts. Salomé issued her Requiem as a DW operative.

Im interested in discovering more about the Club in order to glean more info on the Dark Wheel, because we dont currently understand ANY of their (DW) motivations except that they are searching for or protecting Raxxla and that they oppose the Club.

Oh, argue away! That’s what this thread is all about (since we don’t know what we’re looking for, where it is, or anything else about it other than “it’s in the Milky Way” and it involves a journey of some form!)
Any more information on either faction would be of great interest to us all! I didn’t mean to argue against your hypothesis, just saying I’m not cuurently aware of any supporting evidence for it. Please prove me wrong by finding some, I’d be delighted!!!
