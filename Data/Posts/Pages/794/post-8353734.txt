And, as far as we are led to understand, Raxxla is not related to The Club which was the point of the Salomé/Formidine Rift storyline; however there is a caveat to that, in that Drew Wagar said The Club was an idea of David Braben’s, so perhaps.........?

After two weeks I have progressed from 30%Dangerous to 0%Deadly. Think I need bionic hand replacements, they hurt!!
The Club have a very strong relation to the DW, and, by extension, Raxxla imo

Edit2: at least one of the DW's main missions in recent times is to directly oppose the Club, as seen in the books.

Edit: the main reason i'm interested in the club angle is because it's one piece of the raxxla puzzle (however loose) with the most actual in-game assets and confirmation.
