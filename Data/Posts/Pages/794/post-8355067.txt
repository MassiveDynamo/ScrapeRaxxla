Viewed a YT vid that implied each goid scout equates to 4 elite pilots for combat ranking. If true that would require 445 scouts to get from 0% Deadly to Elite. May be worth testing, methinks a trip to the Pleiades is due! Must be better for my arthritic hands than a CNB!

Edit: nope, 16 scouts per 1% rise in Deadly rank!
