Operation SAR is nearing the completion of it's first phase; The Gathering. Sent a CMDR to Colonia to acquire the only missing rare; Jaques Quinentian Still. Bought 64 tons. Now waiting for Shield generator and Shield boosters to arrive to ensure a safe(r) return to Shinrarta Dezhra.
Are you buying all possible rare commodities ? Cool.
