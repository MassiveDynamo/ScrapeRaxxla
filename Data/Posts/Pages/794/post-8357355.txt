@Jorki Rasalas , sorry i dont mean to argue, but it certainly appears that the Club have broader intentions than just Project Dynasty. As far as we know, they are still in control of all human events in our galaxy. But again, the connection i am interested in investigating is why the Dark Wheel are so strongly opposed to their efforts. Salom√© issued her Requiem as a DW operative.

Im interested in discovering more about the Club in order to glean more info on the Dark Wheel, because we dont currently understand ANY of their (DW) motivations except that they are searching for or protecting Raxxla and that they oppose the Club.
