I don't know if it has increased since I wrote a guide on it last year, but I killed ~1600 scouts to go from 0% deadly to Elite.
That's still about 20 hours of grinding AX conflict zones.

The wiki on Combat says that it takes ~1500 Elite kills to go from deadly to elite, so I don't think they are worth 4x.
However, unlike a CMB, every single scout is elite, they die in only a few hits and their fighting tactics are pretty basic, so it's much faster.

Yes, I thought 1600 was the correct figure, 16 for each 1% increase. Don’t know where the Fandom Wiki got 1780 from: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Combat

This afternoon I’ve flown out to Asterope with krait 2 rigged with AX Rapid build (

), but got diverted since Nvidia Experience has stopped recording my video/snapshots. Updated it but still nothing. Deleted it and replaced with MSI Afterburner, which records screenshots but still no video.
Sigh!
