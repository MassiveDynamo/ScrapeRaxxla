2 hrs per jump at least. 240 hrs plain jumps to beagle not counting each 2 jumps u need dock ur FC, swap ships to miner and go mine 500T of tritium somewhere around (if lucky).
So moving that to edge will take 2-3 months at least ... nice try. Just to see that 500ly away system ...and stuck there forever because it does not have icy rings to mine fuel Will u self destruct 5 bil FC ?
Sounds like a wonderful exploration squadron adventure! Amazing!!!!!
Would make a great series of movies too.
