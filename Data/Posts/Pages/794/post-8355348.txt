Viewed a YT vid that implied each goid scout equates to 4 elite pilots for combat ranking. If true that would require 445 scouts to get from 0% Deadly to Elite. May be worth testing, methinks a trip to the Pleiades is due! Must be better for my arthritic hands than a CNB!

I don't know if it has increased since I wrote a guide on it last year, but I killed ~1600 scouts to go from 0% deadly to Elite.
That's still about 20 hours of grinding AX conflict zones.

The wiki on Combat says that it takes ~1500 Elite kills to go from deadly to elite, so I don't think they are worth 4x.
However, unlike a CMB, every single scout is elite, they die in only a few hits and their fighting tactics are pretty basic, so it's much faster.
