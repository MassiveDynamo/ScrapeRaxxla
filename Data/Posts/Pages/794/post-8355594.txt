Viewed a YT vid that implied each goid scout equates to 4 elite pilots for combat ranking. If true that would require 445 scouts to get from 0% Deadly to Elite. May be worth testing, methinks a trip to the Pleiades is due! Must be better for my arthritic hands than a CNB!
Problem is .. its 3-5 of them, then jump next signal ... no waves now as cmdrs killed all >: Good system to hung on Celaeno. They spawn 20ls from station
