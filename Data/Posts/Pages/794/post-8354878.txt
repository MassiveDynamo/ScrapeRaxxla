As a hypothesis it’s as good as any, but I don’t think there’s any evidence either in-game or in books to support The Club having any relation to Raxxla. They just want to save their own skins (and I think society “elite”) by running away to hide in 3 separate areas when the Klaxians invade the bubble.

TDW are a band of adventurers who have been looking for Raxxla for a long time. They used to, & may still, have an abandoned station. There’s no evidence to say they ever found Raxxla.
