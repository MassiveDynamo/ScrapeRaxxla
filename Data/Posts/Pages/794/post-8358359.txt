Anyone going for a Raxxla exploration Fleet Carrier?
I don't see any use of FC at all. It is none.
There is only 1 new function there - personal bank. All others are same as NPC do next door cheaper.
And personal bank ... I have no reasons to collect anything. Well, I would need bank to collect items to unlock engineer, but it is 1 time need.
