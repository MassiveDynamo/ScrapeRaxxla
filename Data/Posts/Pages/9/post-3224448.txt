Cmdr R1nzl3r In Deep Trouble Again

Dang, Cmdr R1nzl3r in deep trouble again, if this keeps happening, Cmdr R1nzl3r will never get home in time for the shadow Distant Worlds departure.
SPOILER

And that's not even the worst part, it's inside a neutron star field!
I really have no clue as to how he got inside that field, must have been a nav-computer malfunction.
