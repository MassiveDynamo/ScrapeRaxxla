Y dwarf systems should be dark. I've been to many that have surface temperatures of your freezer.

Fdev has decided in their infinite wisdom to portray dark systems as bright purple
Brown dwarfs do glow a little bit faintly. Some are sub zero and some are a balmy 70°F or a few hundred etc. but even those low temps are HOT compared to space. They don’t sustain constant fusion helium so they’re usually considered sub stellar but they’re bodies with “stellar properties” and do emit. Even Jupiter which is small compared to a Y has some stellar properties, it emits more energy than it takes in from the sun, which would mean at its core it’s got a little crunching going on.
