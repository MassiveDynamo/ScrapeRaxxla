The permit-locking is determined by the Pilots' Federation but the navigation systems of modern ships are all made by the Achilles Corporation.
Unless there is an in-game-legal way to circumvent a permit lock (I think in Elite: Premonition Luko uses a manually-calculated jump to reach Col 70 Sector but this is not an option for us), which would be cool if it existed and hadn't been talked about, then I'm afraid I'll confine my attention to accessible systems for the time being. I've been doing racing the last week but before that have been spending time close to the frontier of the Bubble, where there is no shortage of unmapped 8th moons where The Dark Wheel station could be hiding. They might not know where Raxxla is, but they might have more of a clue than we have now.
