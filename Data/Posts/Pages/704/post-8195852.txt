Another bit of tin foil for your hat.

The pilots federation control Galnet and has locked your FSD to restrict what you are told and where you can go. How did they get this power over all of humanity? (Raxxla)
Turn against the pilots federation, incur the wrath of ‘their’ galactic empire, sabotage their installations. Destroy their cargo transports.
Imagine a FSD that isn’t locked to pre-determined stars. Imagine being able to jump directly to a planet, without a fuel use limit.

Fight the power, manifest your destiny. Take control.

Yeah it’s Dangerous, are you brave enough?
