I'd like to backtrack to the installation found in lft 9 to 6 b a belt cluster 1. So I decided to stop and check this out myself for the first time. The installation proved to be less than exciting. The real excitement came when I turned around and looked back towards the star. Can't remember if this was mentioned or not I feel like it might have been and I may even have commented on it but this belt cluster is super cloudy and I can't see anything at all. Also once you get towards the denser part of the clouds these don't even look like normal asteroids. I have a gut feeling this might be a shattered planet. it reminds me a lot of the way I pictured the real soontill from 'and here the wheel' after it was all said and done.

I will be the first to admit my exploration experience in this game is novice at best. anybody with experience that hasn't been here to check this out yet I would encourage to go look at it cuz even if it's nothing it still looks really cool especially when looking at the class L star from inside the clouds
Hmm I didnâ€™t really notice it being cloudy when I was there. Could possibly be that there was some core mining going on there when you visited? That has a tendency to create big dust clouds. Is a really cool visual effect actually.

Edit: You can see one in the background of this pic from a distance;

SPOILER: DUST CLOUD

Do you think it kind of looked like that?
