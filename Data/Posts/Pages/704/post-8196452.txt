It would be cool if they implemented misjumps and manual keying of coordinates like in bsg/wing Commander (movie). But a lot of things would be cool but aren't.

The dark wheel will have nothing to do with raxxla since they don't know where it is at. Raxxla wouldn't be a generation ship since that would be a matter of record, and it would conflict with the central lore of raxxla as being the source of treasure in the form of tech/info/resources.

If anything the most the dark wheel can tell you is where it isn't. They've been looking for it for a long time and haven't found it.
