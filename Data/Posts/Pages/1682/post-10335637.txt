According to some reference Ive browsed this afternoon after the expulsion of Adam & Eve God moved Paradise from Earth to Heaven...
Just taken two more pix inside Li Qing Jao station, the docking light and the statue- might this represent Adam & Eve reaching for the Forbidden Fruit on the Tree of Knowledge?
