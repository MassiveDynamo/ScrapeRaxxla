OK, at Sol/Earth/Li Qing Jao (Station)
"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!
The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!"
" Sol is the birthplace of our race, the shining jewel of our galaxy" Simguru Pranav Antal, Galnet 14 JUN 3301 (a very early clue! MB making "things a little bit obvious")

So, my current interpretation is:
Jewel=Sol/Earth
Whisperer/Siren of deepest void (i.e. Space)=Li Qing Jao (inventor/expert in esoteric knowledge/=whisperer") of FSD, which enabled space travel via witchspace)
Li Qing Jao has the gardens, one of which contains a representation of Milton's Paradise Lost cosmology and rest of that garden may be a map to finding Raxxla.
(God the Father's grief at Adam & Eve's transgression & their woe on expulsion (they became homeless vagabonds) from Garden of Eden

Other clues we know of are from the Codex and as @Rochester has shown relate to Milton's cosmology.
