Going from the @selbie post (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10334951) above I was wondering if the central part (four circles) of the Paradise Garden might represent Underworld, Earth, Garden of Eden (which I thought was supposed to be on Earth) and ????.

From Wikipedia "In the poem, the Garden of Eden is both human and divine: while it is located on earth at the top of Mt. Purgatory, it also serves as the gateway to the heavens." The rightmost small circle, almost out of the central large circle, might be the gateway??

I'm trying to decide if the central and rightmost parts of the design are actual location clues, or just further allegory.
