Ah, but is the rightmost circle of that middle part, lying on the perimeter of the circle, actually meant to represent Heaven's Gate and the rightmost part of the Garden meant to represent Heaven and God's Throne?
No in my opinion - no. But it might - it depends upon your interpretation of the text.

Heavens gate in Paradise Lost from my understanding, was on the West side of the Empyrean (Heaven). The pendant globe hung just off from that location but not from my understanding directly under it.

The gate could only be entered via a long retractable stair. They were not directly over the pendant globe. The globe hung from the brow or ridge that encircled the Empyrean.

Gods throne was a mountain at the centre of the Empyrean, it had roads, lakes rivers, and archangels even had houses and days off (I sh*t thee not - it’s really in there - crazy right).

Paradise aka Eden was a construct that existed always ’outside’ of heaven.

So in my opinion the garden design is of a system, which sits somewhere technically below the zone ascribed in game as the Empyrean, either upon the outer rim of Chaos (the storm gods) or just inside it.

But that’s my academic understanding of the text taking in several contextual references by various authors - that seems to be the accepted version. Brookes however, could have interpreted it completely differently.
