I don’t believe FD has replicated the pendant globe precisely, that part may just be allegorical in game.

Technically the globe was our entire universe held within with an outer sphere, a solid crystalline shell, with an opening at its apex. Inside was another sphere which effectively was the entire physical universe we know of, filled with other stars and even other life giving planets called other Edens. Then the solar system at its centre, denoting the other classical spheres our planet’s. Then at the centre the Sun.

Milton was brilliant because there are verses that describe Satan orbiting the Earth, seeing the sun set and rise respectively as he orbits. It’s rather astonishing.

I do believe the second circle denotes the system where Raxxla is. I feel the lights are a metaphor for these spheres. The way the circle is recessed into the ground, denotes a person would set down into the location. Much like Satan did at the apex portal.
