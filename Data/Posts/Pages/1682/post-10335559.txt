The Paradise Garden central/right-hand parts might be intended as system layout, but a thought has just occurred that the wide outermost ring/path of the central part (illuminated by 10 lights) might be viewed as a star or might be viewed as a partial cut view into a "golden pendant ball". Does that golden ball have any matching internal structure according to Milton? (I'm really not into mythology or poetry!). MB said "Raxxla is very difficult to find", so I wouldn't be at all surprised if this garden design turned out to be solely a clue to Milton's cosmology and then we are supposed to pursue that through MB's implementation in the ED game (system naming/placement).
