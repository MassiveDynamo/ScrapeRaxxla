Nope. But free-cam mode allows you a great deal of freedom. As posted by others, itâ€™s evident these gardens up close, have a limited level of definition, so likely only ever made initially to be viewed from a distance?
Yep, since it's been in-game from gamma (or so) Raxxla ought not to be on planetary surface, since landings only came in partly via Horizons and more so in Odyssey. So makes sense for any potential map to it to be intended to be seen from a ship.
