Technically the earth was there, although it’s not directly expanded upon centrally, just commonly accepted I recall? At the centre of the pendant globe theres our solar system, Earth was a planet as Satan is described as orbiting it.

Think of the pendant globe like a galactic sized Tardis.

Eden was a sort of mountain or hill, originally the true North Pole, where the chain took root, it was surrounded by a raised area, a natural wall in which Cedars grew.

Satan landed just outside of the garden on Mount Niphates, left his shield and then jumped over the wall.

After the second fall God moved paradise off the Earth and into and above the Empyrean, which was his plan all along, Eden being the new heaven. Earth was left behind, only linked to Hell by Satans viaduct.

Personally I feel the second circle represents the system Raxxla is in, the system is the pendant globe.

Raxxla is Eden inside that system, denoted by the ring of Cedars… in Paradise Lost, Eden is actually described as being encircled by Cedars!

The last circle I believe is a body… from there - I don’t know. But I think the biggest element is the second circle. As it might help identify how many bodies are in that system.
