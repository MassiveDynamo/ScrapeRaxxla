According to some reference Ive browsed this afternoon after the expulsion of Adam & Eve God moved Paradise from Earth to Heaven...
Just taken two more pix inside Li Qing Jao station, the docking light and the statue- might this represent Adam & Eve reaching for the Forbidden Fruit on the Tree of Knowledge?

Brilliant, I never would have made that particular jump regarding those statues and yes God relocated Eden after the fall. Eden was always to be the ‘new heaven’. Paradise was always portrayed by Milton to be an earthly pastoral paradise.

Really hope all this is actually what this all means. This sounds totally genius.

The tourism station I was in last night, I can confirm those statues were not directly under the spire in my instance, but still there is no reason why they can’t be, except those statues are wearing Remlok suits.
