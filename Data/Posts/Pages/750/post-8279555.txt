In the DB video “ED has a story that "embraces all the players" he talks about invitation to join a secret organisation as being an event that happens at a certain point in a player’s progression/journey through the game. When asked by DJTruthsayer “where is Raxxla?” MB said ”Well, It's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where at this stage, it's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves". You have always said there will be no clues "that is true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious just so that people know what they are doing, there is nothing to be revealed at this stage".

I’m firming up on the hypothesis that Raxxla and TDW are related, and neither can be found until a player reaches that critical point. I suspect we’ll find TDw first and that will be the start of the endgame to locate Raxxla. Obviously related to reputation. Is there only rep with minor factions, or is there a hidden rep scale?

Though I have a niggling thought that DB said early on he was surprised nobody had found Raxxla yet, or am I misremembering & that was DW re Zurara??
