Yep ... but I think until AXP (I think it is atypical xray pulsar) spins it can remain NS for couple tens thousands years, I think i heard that during some lecture ... but can't be sure yet. Can't find written info. Also other namings wiki proposes are absent in game.
Asked on explorers subforum to check for heavy NS.

No, all NS rotate, at high rates due to conservation of angular momentum from the parent star. The mass of this one is a bit high, but as Han_Zen said it may be in a transition phase. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star
