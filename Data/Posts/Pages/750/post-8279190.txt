Im so jealous of you guys that have actual educations. I learn most everything from science channek, discovery channel, @GURU-951's threads/yt and what you all have shared on here. Its sad to think most of my coworkers think im one of the brightest guys they know lol.
Well ...not me really ... I liked stars since I recall meself, so was reading big old book (700+pages) for university about stars when I was 10 yo. Found it in my uncles's books. 30 years later I recalled that and started to watch youtube +some telescope when city's sky allows. Right now, I play Elite. 20000 ly trips - nothing to do - I keep watching astro lectures on pad near.
So it's simple. If you want to know - you dont need special education. At least to some degree.
