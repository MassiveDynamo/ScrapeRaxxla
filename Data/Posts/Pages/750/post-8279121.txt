Yep ... but I think until AXP (I think it is atypical xray pulsar) spins it can remain NS for couple tens thousands years, I think i heard that during some lecture ... but can't be sure yet. Can't find written info. Also other namings wiki proposes are absent in game.
Asked on explorers subforum to check for heavy NS.

Im so jealous of you guys that have actual educations. I learn most everything from science channek, discovery channel, @GURU-951's threads/yt and what you all have shared on here. Its sad to think most of my coworkers think im one of the brightest guys they know lol.
