guys ...that my NS must not exists. It is 8 solar masses, anything over 3 is BH. Is it how real magnetars work?
No. It's to massive. At least according to current science.
2.16 solar masses is the current theoretical limit.
No one knows how they will behave in a transitional phase though. If an NS eats a large companion star, it may take some time before it fully collapses. These things rotate extremely fast.
Neutron stars can even exist inside a larger companion star, for a long time.
Bizarre hybrid star found, it's a supergiant with a neutron star inside - Geek.com
Scientists have confirmed the existence of a type of hybrid star first proposed more than 35 years ago: a neutron star swallowed by a supergiant.
