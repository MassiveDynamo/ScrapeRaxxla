Strangely enough I think this may be how Raxxla or the DW Station appears, as an unresolvable FSS signal or something, no real reason just a thought and I keep an eye out for this behaviour just in case (its a long list of just in case eye keep an out scenarios lol)

That’s what I wondered when I saw the GG was missing, though I seem to remember this sort of thing happening infrequently over the last couple of years (but didn’t get terribly excited as I don’t think Raxxla is a GG). Think it’s probably a hiccup in Stellar Forge system generation.

Edit: the alternative is a bug in the fss!
