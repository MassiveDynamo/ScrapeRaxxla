No. It's to massive. At least according to current science.
2.16 solar masses is the current theoretical limit.
No one knows how they will behave in a transitional phase though. I an NS eats a large companion star, it may take some time before it fully collapses. These things rotate extremely fast.
Neutron stars can even exist inside a larger companion star, for a long time.
Bizarre hybrid star found, it's a supergiant with a neutron star inside - Geek.com
Scientists have confirmed the existence of a type of hybrid star first proposed more than 35 years ago: a neutron star swallowed by a supergiant.

Yep ... but I think until AXP (I think it is atypical xray pulsar) spins it can remain NS for couple tens thousands years, I think i heard that during some lecture ... but can't be sure yet. Can't find written info. Also other namings wiki proposes are absent in game.
Asked on explorers subforum to check for heavy NS.
