The first thing Rafe Zetter does is train Alex to kill the guy that killed his dad. That sounds like an assassination mission to me. In fact correct me if I'm wrong but, isn't that the entire plot of the story? and then the story ends happily ever after when he completes that mission.

Had another scan through Holdstock’s TDW. “
Jason Ryder was convinced that Raxxla existed. That's why he trained for, and became a part of, the Dark Wheel, the legend-seekers.
”
So Jason was himself a member of TDW, & Rafe said
“
Because there are people on Raxxla already. This is only a guess, mind you, but from what happened to Jason I'd say it was close to being right. We've long suspected that a corps of élites lives there, and are exploiting the gateway. They're powerful, twisted men. Powerful enough to hire an assassin to kill the threat to their dominance.
”
N.B. “we’ve long suspected”! I suspect Rafe was also TDW, he was elite himself). The “powerful, twisted men” who inhabit Raxxla are antagonistic to TDW. I’m guessing it’s The Club!! Or CEIP (which might be the same as The Club).

And “
One thing's for sure,' Rafe went on drily. 'Unless you get there, unless you become élite, you'll never get to Raxxla.
”
So elite is a prerequisite part of the journey to Raxxla. Must start boosting my combat ranking! Dont think FD will have retconned that requirement.


Time to walk copawlot!
