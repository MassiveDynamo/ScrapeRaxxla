There is an interview with current community manager Arthur Tolmie where he does directly state when asked ‘where is Raxxla” at the 0:25:00 mark:

AT “It’s there. Clearly it’s there. I’ve said this in another stream, I’ll say it today, it’s been going a longtime. The payoff would have to be great, and that’s all I will say on it”.

The interviewer tries to trick AT with a little psychological game which maybe shows Raxxla is a big deal, not some fluff. AT also used the same references around ‘the payoff is going to be great’ concerning the current storyline relating to the Adamastor, which is a slow burner, read that into what you will, but we certainly have another FD employee confirming its existence.
