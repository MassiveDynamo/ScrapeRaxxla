Im interested to find this ‘other’ stream where AT apparently discusses Raxxla?

Hes done 3 recently, 1 in a seemingly vain attempt to help The Pilot who stopped shortly after, 1 with RossP linked on PS thread 'Elite Week Guest Really Speaks My Mind' or similar and one with err, oh blooming heck Ive forgotten his name, Cow something maybe, GrinningCow?, linked a few pages back by me. The last one was a proper delve into lore and probably the most relevant to all of this stuff.

The Adamastor and Hesperus events were good but a tad short

Yes they were, if they hadnt 'helped out' by moving the darn LP we'd have been at it for months but we'd have got there in the end, but GalNet needed it solved and friends were assisted.

or it might be introduced later as a major narrative arc pushed by the devs.

My biggest fear. But Im beginning to doubt it will be, its too good a mystery to waste on a story.

for example the canonn research group

Ive heard rumours the forum helped as well and indeed got the answer first in at least one case, and also helped to fill in the Canonn spreadsheet, but we didnt get the same level of assistance off the CM's. 14 hrs they were on Canonn Discord giving assistance including telling people to 'turn around youve gone too far' to help them narrow it down. Bad times lets hope they dont repeat it.
