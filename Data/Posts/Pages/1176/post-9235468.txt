I did the same. But FDev did not fix it, maybe this is not a bug, but a feature? But now they can be highlighted in the target, through the system map
Yes, always could. Iâ€™ve wondered if it is something real or an artefact. It could be that they wanted to represent the asteroid belt, but this was the only way they could think of to have something that is there but isnt there, the asteroids being so very widely spaced that they couldnt practically represent it otherwise.

Or is it something else?
