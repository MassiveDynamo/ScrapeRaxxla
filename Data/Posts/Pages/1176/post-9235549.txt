the problem with using anything that was written before or even in early elite dangerous times is that fdev has retconned almost all of elite's canon. only the content made for the game is real, and even that is suspect if it contradicts what fdev is currently saying.

the retconning of their own lore even post ED is so bad that we can't really trust anything. they've even hinted that what we know of the guardians and thargoids from ram tah can't be trusted.

it's all rather depressing when you think about it and are involved in these kind of lore mysteries and role playing.
