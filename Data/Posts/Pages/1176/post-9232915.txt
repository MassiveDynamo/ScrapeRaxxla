I'm going back to this almost two year old post because it's still nagging me...and none of you lot responded. So apparently, this is a heptapeton and the matrix that represents it is above. I ran it through an online matrix solver (because I'm pants at math) and the attached is what it came up with. I can't make hide nor hair out of it. Anyone?

We are a pretty useless lot... I mean really - how long have we been at it and we still haven't the faintest clue

I like the idea of getting a set of coordinates from the symbol - but isnt a heptapeton a seven sided polygon? So it should be a hexateron - but I guess I dont know how we derive numbers from the symbol itself based on its geometry.
