Yes, i’ve wondered if it is something real or an artefact. It could be that they wanted to represent the asteroid belt, but this was the only way they could think of to have something that is there but isnt there, the asteroids being so very widely spaced that they couldnt practically represent it otherwise.

Or is it something else?
The meaning is approximately the same. Previously, scanning took place without stopping, and sometimes you could see the symbol of asteroids, now they(asteroids) are highlighted in the target, displayed in the HUD. There is a new poster that shows Sol, but I didn’t have time to read what was written on it. We need an answer from FDev, are we looking for a black cat in a dark room? They didn't fix it because it's lazy/no time or something is as it should be. Then it is already possible to draw a conclusion
