It’s because we havent had the slightest clue that we’re still at it!
But let’s face it, what else is there to do?
The last real gameplay died with Salomé, that storyline lasted months and made the game worth playing. I made first discovery on a whole sector searching out the Reorte-Riedquat clue. I had a reason to fly! Ah, those were the days young padawan!
When there was something to play the game for! Not shallow grinding ranks and credits and engineering mats that The Club seem to think is gameplay.
The Adamastor and Hesperus events were good but a tad short
