Some players may have hearing problems or have limitation.
This is a good point.

What's interesting is that in all cases where there's important audio cues there are also visual cues. For various reasons I frequently play with no or very low game sounds and I've had no problem playing the game fully for years in this way, specifically because everything is visually represented.

To me this is why I consider the Landscape Signal an important unsolved mystery, whereas other mysterious or questionable audio isn't something I personally consider part of the puzzle.

The Landscape Signal has a visual component in the spectrogram. This means the Landscape Signal is accessible to everyone in the exact same way as the (chronologically implemented) later Thargoid map - which to me suggests that it's a mystery to solve on the same level.
