I generally stay in a 3 earth system near Freetio FC-B D14-3. It is a long way from the Sag A. I recently noted two things:

1) When I pointed toward the Sag A from my [pit (Krait Phantom - dead stop / not in SC, 2.6 Million LS from nearest star) I heard the periodic onset of a musical sound stream which would come and go on about a 1 minute period.
Look at the spectrogram of that recording What do you see?

There also are wildlife sounds like the jungle... like ancient strange birds, reptiles, chimpanzies and prehistoric background sound. There are a couple other sounds as well such as a faint AM band distortion frequency.... But there is also two or three distinct types of robotic, almost voice-like sounds, and a consistent thumping of a big gong or base drum. When I the used my camera far away from my ship and pointed toward Sag A I heard the same sounds except the robotic sounds were not there at all. Also, the consistent bang of the drum was completely gone as well.

Conclusion 1: The cockpit is picking up ship sounds that are electronic and metallic in nature as well as heart beat-like banging sounds. None of these sounds likely come from the galaxy but simply are an artifacts of the ship
Conclusion 2: You have to be very careful to use good and bad controls to analyze ED sounds.
Absolutely!

2) When I pointed the camera normal to the galactic plane, and again, I was very far from the the core and any solar system, I heard (and recorded) only the control background sound. It is a basic background hum of the universe and it is on a 45 second period. All other sounds are complete gone.

Conclusion: This background pulse would need to be subtracted from any unique galaxy sounds I want to fully explore.
100% agreed.

Excited to see what you find Keep us posted!
