.Speaking entirely hypothetically and personally - IMO the sound design in Elite is extraordinary and consistently blows me away. There are sounds everywhere and for everything, and most of them are really complex and impressive and mysterious. I wouldn't find it hard to imagine additional mysteries hidden in audio! I also think it's a relatively untapped area of exploration since you need a certain amount of setup to investigate.

Totally agree the sound design in ED is phenomenal and it is an untouched dimension to the game.

In space there is no noise, it’s an intentional element of the game that our ships specifically augment data in space into audio, so as to give us spacial awareness.

The fact that most players might not be aware of this I find frankly criminal, for instance, within the system scanner, the audio for planets etc is ‘based’ upon real space audio.

In early development it’s evident that FD had to navigate significant technical limitations, so ‘sound’ was a key towards enabling much of this.

For instance when flying around the surface of bodies we use incredibly basic navigational systems, this was intended. Sound was used in this instance too to potentially alert us to things… however this is also a significant hindrance.

Some players may have hearing problems or have limitations.

Either way it’s an untapped area of the game I agree.
