Totally agree the sound design in ED is phenomenal and it is an untouched dimension to the game.

In space there is no noise, it’s an intentional element of the game that our ships specifically augment data in space into audio, so as to give us spacial awareness.

The fact that most players might it be aware of this I find frankly criminal, for instance, within the system scanner, the audio for planets etc is ‘based’ upon real space audio.

In early development it’s evident that FD had to navigate significant technical limitations, so ‘sound’ was a key towards enabling much of this.

For instance when flying around the surface of bodies we use incredibly basic navigational systems, this was intended. Sound was used in this instance too to potentially alert us to things… however this is also a significant hindrance,

Some players may have hearing problems or have limitation.

Either way it’s an untapped area of the game I agree.

I love the sound in the game (sorry for a slight derail) and I do wonder what a Thargoid would sound like, in the flesh, so to speak.

What would be really excellent is, if Raxxla is ever found, a whole new soundscape would be encountered.
