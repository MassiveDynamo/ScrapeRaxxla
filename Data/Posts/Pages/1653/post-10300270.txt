Easy for me to test this one.
SPOILER: SPECTROGRAMS OF SUPERCRUISE



I'm seeing no differences between any heading (currently in the Prieluia XD-Q C6-13 system). I've also recorded the sound of supercruise before a while back when I was testing to see if you could hear the Landscape Signal in it, these all match the ones I was doing back then too.

The sound does change a bit, it's linked to your speed and whether you're accelerating or decelerating, but the changes are relatively minor.

For anyone who's interested here's the recorded in freecam at max range, in Deep Space (not in a planetary system).

if you're hearing anything other that a sort of distorted mechanical churning noise and deep bassy thumbing, then you're hearing something new. I'll get my friend in the bubble to record in Asuhail too and update later.

Where these recordings made in camera view far away from your ship to cancel out ship noise? If not can you try this, im hearing it all over this area of space not just this system. move a good bit away from any planets, stars etc, go into camera view and cycle out to the max 3000m then point away with the volume up high

EDIT: Location has shifted from Andromeda after many jumps! I am uploading now to post it here however please raise your volume its very subtle its like a mix of radio frequency changing to robotic type chatter, and yes i chose the Raxxla logo for the video image as to keep with this thread lol
