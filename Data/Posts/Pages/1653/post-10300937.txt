Engine sounds have always been a crucial part of learning how to make fast approaches in supercruise - to the extent that they are more important than the visual display when attempting to hold a spiral approach to a body. There have not been any changes to this since launch - and there are people who have been racing since before launch (the Buckyball Racing Club was formed in July 3301 iirc but CMDR ElectricZ was the one who kicked it all off with the first Buckyball Runs in Beta).
I think FD included the 'Night time' audio mode to help bring out the finer details for those who might not otherwise pick up on them. That shows how important it is.
