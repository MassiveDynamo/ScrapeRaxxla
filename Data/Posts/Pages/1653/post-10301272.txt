Remember how I said tourism stations were important...

I figured this should be shared. Feel free to copy images and discuss. It is possible interpretations may need fine tuning. Anyway, the more eyes the better.

Interesting indeed, thanks for supplying all the images.

Here's my initial thoughts: I feel like this venn diagram sums up what we're seeing:


The images you provided are interesting, and I'd like to know more, but right now I'm struggling to understand how to tell what's of signficance in the Raxxla hunt, and what's just a shape that people like to use in things. Could you elaborate on which bits you see as being important?

Because yes, I fully agree the interiors could show things like the milky way, where Colonia and the bubble are, Magellanic clouds, etc. that would actually be cool for 'Tourist stations' to have baked into the decoration.

Could you supply a little more info on your interpretations to help make sense of these:
I'm struggling to see the "Guardian towers" as opposed to just a tower or monument.
I'm also unsure how to correctly see the "map of guardian region" with capital and nebulas? Could you maybe show some comparison maps to help out?
I'm not quite seeing "three civilisations linked" as opposed to "an entry hall to a main building, paths to a greenspace plaza and a monument plaza, and another side building or hall."
I'm not really seeing "omphalos rift with starship beam" I'm seeing "a path through greenspace to a monument showing male and female human representations around a monument"
I want to believe!
