Just by sheer numbers - and not-unlimited amount of commander's attention
Before the patch the "Other" type of signal has been attributed only to Engineers (let say dozen), Tip Off related crash sites (~150?), listening posts and similar (also may be hundreds, I don't have numbers at my hand)
At the other side "Human" were all planetary settlements (dozens of thousands), space installations (thousands?), combat zones (hard to estimate) and all special and not so special POI's (all those procedural and hand/intentional placed and/or designed). If my assumption is right and some POI's from the last category has migrated to "other" (and probably the most interesting of them) then their observation/discovery can became much more easier (and less speculative).
Yes, I guessed that was the thing you're talking about, just wanted to be sure. I remember the days I had to count every "human" POI in the vicinity of a body to compare with the numbers I got from FSS. That had been exhausting. I hope you're right and they've moved those real interesting signals to "other". That would surely step up our pace.
