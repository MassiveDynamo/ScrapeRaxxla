anyone else getting mis-jumps????

I dont know what im doing, but every once and a while, I will use my transaction list to open a target on the galmap, then open the system map and select my destination station, plot the route...

Then ill back out, and charge the FSD, but it will have selected a different system entirely....

Its happend a few times now where i didnt notice and ended up in a system that was not my target and confused as a cat in a pool....

I always target off my transactions when doing missions, so I have no clue why or how this is happening... Im doing things in the background while playing, so I cant screen record, and I have no idea when it will happen again, but its happened enough times im wondering if its somthing Fdev added??(I thought they removed mis-jumps) or a bug I should report?
