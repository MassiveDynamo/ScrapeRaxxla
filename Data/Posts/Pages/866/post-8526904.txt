Is that really datamining though?

All the info was retrieved in game.
If Microsoft code a TCP vulnerability in Windows is it ok to exploit it, as long as you use Microsoft tools to do it? ;-)

Gaining data through a bug/oversight- is that really any different?

This data leak is a grey area I admit, but even if it is light and even if the theory is correct - it doesnt help! Still cant get there without a permit...that's the real mystery. Get the invite and you'll find which system it's in anyway
