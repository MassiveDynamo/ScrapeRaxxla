The video description says "patched", which I take to mean it was a bug that's been fixed (of course maybe the bug was that only one particular blackhole should do this and/or only in certain circumstances..).

I like the thought though, that maybe it was patched becuase there is only 1 BH or certain BH's that can be entered....

I'd be interested to find another, and try to enter it in diff ways, like with Thargoid items in cargo, or other special items, or try to enter SC while entering the event horizon, or even plan a hyperjump point on the other side while your entering it, and jump into Hyperspace going "thru" the BH...
