Looked to me like he went around the edge of the exclusion zone. Maybe it has a particularly small mass and there-fore a small magic circle.

All looked normal to me.

I seem to remember that when I first went out to the Pleiades (late 2015/early 2016) I entered the BH at Maia (Merope??) and it just continued with no obvious endpoint you just didn't get anywhere. There was no exclusion zone limit like there is now & I seem to remember a few YT vids that implied this was common experience. I think some patch introduced the exclusion zone, which does beg the question why was it introduced-so Raxxla may indeed be a BH that leads somewhere. But if you’re watching YT of BH entry then I’d say check the date it was posted, it’s probably past expiry date by now.
