Yes, I guessed that was the thing you're talking about, just wanted to be sure. I remember the days I had to count every "human" POI in the vicinity of a body to compare with the numbers I got from FSS. That had been exhausting. I hope you're right and they've moved those real interesting signals to "other". That would surely step up our pace.

I still do a check of FSS human detections versus CZ and surface bases. Itâ€™s the only way to find a wrecksite at a distance (and sometimes even close up as some of those POI seem to be bugged)
