Yes, I think moon of a moon still counts as a moon of the GG since it’s still orbiting the GG although performing epicycles instead of normal elliptical orbit. But don’t forget that the Codex entry pours sufficient doubt on Lyta Crane’s “DW knowledge” that “orbiting the eighth moon” could be misinformation in any case!
