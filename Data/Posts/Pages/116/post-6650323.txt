I was quite sure that at least the cure for the mycoid was developed in Alioth ? Correct me if I'm wrong.

Bear in mind the first war was fought between 3125 and 3152. The Thargoids then 'disappeared' for 100 years before Mic and Argent decided to go looking for them. I think you might be mixing up "the first war" with "the last game"?

The Mycoid-vaccine event you're most probably referring to happened 100 years after the war, 50 years ago for us.

The Alliance was very new and young in 3250 when FFE was set.
