nope - not a troll or false lead - i remember the popup well but because i was in SC ( probably heading out to scan an ELW or something ) i didnt give it that much thought other than thinking it was odd because id already honked the system. And tbh im not sure if it was out in the rift, i just know it was somewhere around that time. Im off at the weekend so ill be looking through the logs and hopefully going back to where i got the signal - just hope ill be able to txt search either through EDDiscovery or the actual logs themselves.
