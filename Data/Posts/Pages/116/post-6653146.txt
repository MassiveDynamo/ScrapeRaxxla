A planet is a celestial body. TDW says it's a planet. Silent song of the spheres usually refers to planets in orbit.

I would be a bit surprised if it turns out Raxxla isn't a planet.

I personally don't think anything anyone says about Raxxla is a clue or can be taken as 100% word-for-word accurate, but assuming "celestial body" is an accurate statement of fact, then what does that cover?

Example: https://www.universetoday.com/48671/celestial-body/

"The term celestial body is as expansive as the entire universe, both known and unknown. By definition a celestial body is any natural body outside of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. "

What if Raxxla was a planet, but isn't now?

That would make the search even harder, and explain why it's been so hard for TDW to find (maybe everyone is looking for a planet). I personally love the idea of "Raxxla" being artefacts scattered through an asteroid belt that turns out to be the ruins of a moon or planet, rather than the name of a planet or system. Somewhere amongst that belt are the 'secrets' of Raxxla. That would (IMO) be a really interesting way to hide Raxxla's secret even ater the location was discovered (you could spend years combing even a planetary ring for artefacts, let alone something as diffuse as a true asteroid belt).
