Yes, I refer to what happened 50 years ago.

Btt: what Raxxla concerns, we even do not know exactly what Raxxla is, that it is a planet or system is just one possibility of many.

EDIT: today I just printed out "The Dark Wheel" and I'm looking forward reading it at the weekend .

I'm 99% certain that the Thargoid interactions that occurred around then were entirely unrelated to Raxxla specifically. They were however vaguely related to the subsequent discovery of Soontil by one element of what were Raxxla hunters. So, we know that Raxxla had not been discovered by the main group searching for it 50ish years ago. It's possible that it was discovered since then, but we have no additional data.
