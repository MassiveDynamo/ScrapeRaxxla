Bear in mind the first war was fought between 3125 and 3152. The Thargoids then 'disappeared' for 100 years before Mic and Argent decided to go looking for them. I think you might be mixing up "the first war" with "the last game"?

The Mycoid-vaccine event you're most probably referring to happened 100 years after the war, 50 years ago for us.

The Alliance was very new and young in 3250 when FFE was set.

Yes, I refer to what happened 50 years ago.

Btt: what Raxxla concerns, we even do not know exactly what Raxxla is, that it is a planet or system is just one possibility of many.

EDIT: today I just printed out "The Dark Wheel" and I'm looking forward reading it at the weekend .
