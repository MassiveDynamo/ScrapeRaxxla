So now we have Raxxla out there ... and no clue as to what that means. Will this Raxxla conform to David's vision of the game or pay homage somehow to Holdstock? If the former than I don't think we should rule out a connection to the Thargoids. If the latter then we need more players reading Holdstock.

I've always gone with the assumption that Raxxla in ED is just an ELW out in deep space with city lights on it's dark side. If Frontier is to be believed then it's been in the game since 1.0, so honestly it can't be anything super fancy or "special" unless they've upgraded it along the way, which I find doubtful. That's just my gut feeling.

Now, as to where it is, welp anyone's guess is as good as any!
