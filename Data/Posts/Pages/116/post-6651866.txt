Look, so much has been posted in so many medias by so many people about Raxxla ...
I, for myself, stick to the game and what MB actually said: 'there will be no clues ? mmmh..that's right, but you have to make a tiny part a little bit obvious so people know what they are doing'. If someone here knows what he is doing, please let me know. [yesnod]
But I bet, since MB left/was retired from ED and the disappearance of the Elite missions, this also may have turned out to no longer be valid.
Raxxla is no longer a certain celestial body? Ok. I would not be surprised by another FDevs inconsistency inside their own game ...
EDIT: I suspect someone is erasing the net of some statements and declarations ... As I too can't find a DW declaration about the "alien background secret book" ... I am sure I read it somewhere but impossible to trace it back again.
