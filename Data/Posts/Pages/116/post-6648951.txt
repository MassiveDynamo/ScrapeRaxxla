Hi, thanks for clarifying ! But somehow I have in mind that Alioth had something to do with the first Thargoid war, I am quite sure having read something about a hidden base in Alioth system...... maybe someone be so kind and enlighten me ?

Yesterday I "extended" the trail ( if it continues that heading it defintively could at least strife Alioth) beyond Alioth and the bubble and tried to find a stellar formation or nebula or cloud where the trail could lead to, but I found nothing like that at all with such characteristics.

Alioth was still a site of conflict between the Empire and Federation during the first Thargoid war. I can't find, nor can I recall anything significant relating to Alioth at all during or before the first Thargoid war. It would be a fairly insignificant system if it wasn't the later homeworld of the Alliance. That doesn't mean there wasn't anything there, or won't be revealed to have housed a secret research facility at some point in the future - but just that I can't dig anything like that up currently. Interesting to know if there is a reference somewhere though.

I don't think that the Thargoids have anything to do with Raxxla though, there's never really been any connection there except some vague speculation about Raxxla maybe being a Thargoid device becasue Thargoids are aliens and Raxxla might be an alien device. I also can't believe that from a narrative point of view that every single mystery in the game is connected to the Thargoids (although so far I've been proven wrong on that one.)
