I was quite sure that at least the cure for the mycoid was developed in Alioth ? Correct me if I'm wrong.

The mission to acquire the the vaccine was given on Alioth. The vaccine was stolen from the medical facility on Hotice 1 and delivered to the thargoids in Miackce.

This happened in one possible mission branch in FFE. As it was the most popular choice for players, it's often assumed to be the correct version of events.
That is pure speculation though.
