Been following this thread a while now - last year i spent a good few months out in the rift looking for Raxxla, nothing but ghosts and boredom out there. However i do remember while in supercruise one night having the message 'New astronomical object found' popup. This did suprise me a little as id already honked the system on entry as i always do but didnt pay much attention to it untill yesterday when i read on here that maybe Raxxla doesnt show on honks and you have to be within a certain range. As luck would have it.. my ED install is on a different drive and all my logs right from the start are intact. I remember playing around with ED Discovery and noticed it logs events such as this. So... its off to the logs i go lol.. ill trying and find that single entry and maybe the system i was in.
