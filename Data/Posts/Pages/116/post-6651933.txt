Look, so much has been posted in so many medias by so many people about Raxxla ...
I, for myself, stick to the game and what MB actually said: there will be no clues ? mmmh..that's right, but you have to make a tiny part a little bit obvious so people know what they are doing. If someone here knows what he is doing, please let me know. [yesnod] But I bet, since MB left/was retired from ED, this also can have turned out to be no longer valid.
Raxxla is no longer a certain celestial body? Ok. I would not be surprised by another FDevs inconsistency inside their own game ...
EDIT: I suspect someone is erasing the net from some statements and declarations ... As I too can't find a DW declaration about the "alien background secret book" ... I am sure I read it somewhere but impossible to trace it back again.

A planet is a celestial body. TDW says it's a planet. Silent song of the spheres usually refers to planets in orbit.

I would be a bit surprised if it turns out Raxxla isn't a planet.
