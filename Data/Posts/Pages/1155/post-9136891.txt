I was comparing the FSS signals close to the "Asteroid Belt" ones in Shinrarta Dezhra (SD) and they are somewhat different. In SD, it seems that there are 3 more hidden asteroid clusters in addition to the existing 7 (visible) ones.

New Yembo and Sol seem to have something else which would be close to the Asteroid Belt range but not being one... (comparing only these systems as for now because didn't have time enough to visit the other ones you mentioned).

Which seems even more strange to me...
