Ok... I'll drop this here because this requires more eyes to investigate.

I was flying again in New Yembo and as I mentioned before, there are 3 asteroid belts "missing"
(4 belts are displayed in "system map" but only 3 clusters present on the 1st belt close to the main star).

Currently I'm at body 16F trying to find any clustes by flying in SC to try and drop on its "region".
Anywho... when I opened the FSS I spoted an (!) signal source just by the "Asteroid Cluster" signal.
(Quite strange once this (!) signal has no "label" or indication of what it might be like the others.

So, yeah... feel free to go check it by yourself.



Cheers!
