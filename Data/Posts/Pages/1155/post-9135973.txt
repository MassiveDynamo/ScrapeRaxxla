Now I'm intrigued... 25?! Please, elaborate more on the subject...
After the initial point of discovery in Sol, I eventually thought to make it routine to check every system I visit for these signals. Eventually this did start seeing results, and over about two months I have found 25 systems with similar signals. I haven’t been doing an inordinate amount of travel, nor focusing on tracking these down…. only checking as I go about my business. Based on observations so far, I would estimate that about 1 in 40 systems in the bubble seem to display this anomaly. The systems that I would deem “of note” at this point would be
Sol (8)
New Yembo (11)
Maia (9)
Shinrarta Dezhra (3)
Delphi (11)
Tionisla (10)
And Bestia (17), simply for sheer amount
As of May 1, I have noted another 18 systems with these "invisible signals".
I will continue to track locations. If anyone is keen to participate in this research, let me know and I can set up a GoogleDoc to share.
Beyond this, I’m not sure what I would elaborate on further at this point. Perhaps direct questions would be more useful, if you have any.
