I found something and it may be Raxxla but but it would also explain several things. You see Raxxla has always been descrbed as follows:

"A place that is not a place, a door that is also the key"

The Raxxla codex mentions an omphalos or center between "star lovers" and "stars". There is a gap in the Trapezium cluster at which begins 16 systems that can generate the biggest hyperspace boost imaginable .. it is 8 neutron stars and 8 black holes. You see Robert Holdstock had a pen name: Steven Eisler. Eisler wrote "Alien Worlds: A Complete Illustrated Guide". This is the onty source of the Talmor Lens.

I am still putting the order together that you have to get it to work but this sure looks like it is real.




It wasn't what I was thinking it would be. Hell, it wasn't where I was thinking it would be. However, I am almost certain this is the RAXXLA device ((R)Rapidly Accelerating(AXX) Long(L) Array(A) otherwise simply known as the Talmor Lens) - a ancient naturally occurring lens that be utilized for massively boosting hyperspace jumps.
