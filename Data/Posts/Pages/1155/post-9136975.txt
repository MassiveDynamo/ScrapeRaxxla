Well, I just had a hard lesson in space madness and self-doubt. Jumping less than maximum boost from a neutron star doesn't let you stack the remainder if you daisy chain several neutron stars together. Yes, it really is this complicated so at least I feel better about my framework with complicated mathematics but whatever. Heading back to the Bubble to get some data on some closer to Sol alternatives for Astrophil with Sol as omphalos but in a small region. Then resuming the longer range tests and start officially striking out possibilities from the list.
Reactions:
clavain, simulacrae, Spaceman Spiff and 2 others
