I was comparing the FSS signals close to the "Asteroid Belt" ones in Shinrarta Dezhra (SD) and they are somewhat different. In SD, it seems that there are 3 more hidden asteroid clusters in addition to the existing 7 (visible) ones.

New Yembo and Sol seem to have something else which would be close to the Asteroid Belt range but not being one... (comparing only these systems as for now because didn't have time enough to visit the other ones you mentioned).

Which seems even more strange to me...
Agreed. Which is why the (tinfoil for now) theory of cloaked or hidden objects fits for me.
Maia and a few of the other ones I didn't mention by name are further interesting, in that they have NO asteroids, in either field designation OR as a signal in FSSS. And yet, there are mystery signals.
