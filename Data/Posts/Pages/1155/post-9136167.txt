That’s the spirit. Never intended to disqualify your assumption, it’s as valid as any other of our assumptions here, keep testing until proven otherwise. I only meant, if you have enough evidence, you could try reporting it as a valid “is it a bug” question, FD sometimes will respond in acknowledgement, if they say “as intended” then you’ve obtained confirmation, of something.

Jaded moi, maybe a tout petit. Yes I’ve been here from the beginning, but that doesn’t make me any more an expert, in all honesty, Raxxla is the only thing which keeps me playing, gives me a star to fly by,

Unfortunately FD have in the past shown to be inconsistent, ED is riddled with bugs and errors, they also significantly ret-conned most of their lore to suit back in 2017. It’s very likely much of the evidence out there is no longer relevant, which just makes us old timers a bit prickly, but that’s because we love Elite.

Its true, I am almost certain it’s not actually ‘obtainable’ in game, my own investigations point to it as more likely being part of the 10 year narrative, but I am also equally certain I am also wrong, and that it’s currently obtainable someplace, your valid investigation is equally also likely the key, we won’t know until we see, test it, hold it up to the light and interrogate, I try and keep an open mind.
