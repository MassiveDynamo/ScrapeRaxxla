I did a lot of work on getting permit for locked systems. Just 2 more to go, and before servers went down I parked my Asp Explorer in HIP 22460 and logged off at the POI known as Overlook which well over looks the planet the weapon is on lmao!
I have all "known" obtainables currently bar the cqc one to which I blame Fdev as I can never get into a match to gain the rank
