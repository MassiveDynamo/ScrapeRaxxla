I have all "known" obtainables currently bar the cqc one to which I blame Fdev as I can never get into a match to gain the rank
I gave up CQC, I did a couple of games but it was like hours apart. Honestly if I was FD I would add NPC's to the list of CQC opponents so they eliminate the whole waiting for players to join.

Well, hope youâ€™ve got your camera ready, because when that weapon is switched on I predict a whole heap of trouble is a comin!
Oh I do hope the sight is to behold as the blast shines as bright of a thousand suns.

Edit:

Well this is an eerie patch note.
Nothing further to add on these other than...well, see for yourself. The time is almost upon us!
