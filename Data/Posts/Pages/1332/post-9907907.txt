I did a lot of work on getting permit for locked systems. Just 2 more to go, and before servers went down I parked my Asp Explorer in HIP 22460 and logged off at the POI known as Overlook which well over looks the planet the weapon is on lmao!
Well, hope youâ€™ve got your camera ready, because when that weapon is switched on I predict a whole heap of trouble is a comin!
