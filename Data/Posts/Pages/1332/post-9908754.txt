Just curious, any permits come down with the recent Big Reveal (tm)? Also, are Guardians alive now (or just a different kind of Thargoid after all...)?

If this was to open up the possibility of making contact with a peacefulish Thargoid faction/exploring Thargoid space (or ditto for Guardians) might jump back in again, but if it is just levelling the rock-shooting engineering playground for more pew pew, well, whatevers.
