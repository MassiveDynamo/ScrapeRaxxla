Any Info what System it was?
Heâ€™s now disclosed the system on IRH. It was Epsilon Indi & the planet was New Africa.
At his request I checked there this morning for comets, but there were none & only the system bodies and stations as shown in the system map. I could not detect any such fast moving object. Even reducing my screen brightness to minumum I could not reproduce the picture as the star was still too bright, so I suspect the video shows an artefact of Mitterand Hollow or perhaps a ship moving along the orbit line.

But the discussion to that video was interesting...
