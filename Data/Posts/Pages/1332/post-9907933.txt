I gave up CQC, I did a couple of games but it was like hours apart. Honestly if I was FD I would add NPC's to the list of CQC opponents so they eliminate the whole waiting for players to join.


Oh I do hope the sight is to behold as the blast shines as bright of a thousand suns.

Well this is an eerie patch note.

Players have been asking for npc bots in CQC since just after release...unfortunately it has fallen on deaf ears, They claim it is for player versus player only but yet ignore fixing the matchmaking which is also why hardly anyone play it anymore
