Have you noticed that the "IPv4 Address" on the top of you DBX cockpit frame does not fit a regular IPv4 address: View attachment 161758
I havent noticed that before. And, apologies, idk what it means. I used to have a vape mod that was an ipv4 and that is an amazing coincidence, which i tend not to believe in. What does that mean about the ipv4 address?
