I'll keep on working with scoring brownie points with the factions in Sol.

My reputation must have preceded me. That's why you're contacting me out in deep-space in Sol, 480,000 LS from the Sun, correct?
I'm the right Cmdr for the job.
Cummings, afterwards, perhaps you could share with me some more insider information or secrets surrounding Raxxla?
