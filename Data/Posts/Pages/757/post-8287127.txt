The point is that as we cannot target it, we're most likely dropping on the Asteroid Belt "Region", not at the center of it... and as I wrote before, the area is a disc about 600ls in diameter... so, quite a big area to cover... x3 because I found at least 3 of these Asteroid Belt locations.

Ah yes, I agree, a huge area to search even if we stood a chance of finding it (which I currently doubt until we've reached some unknown threshold);
however I misunderstood what your previous post - I thought you had found a rock there!
