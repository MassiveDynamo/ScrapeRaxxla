But when you drop down out of SC there are no asteroids visible or on the scanner?
The point is that as we cannot target it, we're most likely dropping on the Asteroid Belt "Region", not at the center of it... and as I wrote before, the area is a disc about 600ls in diameter... so, quite a big area to cover... x3 because I found at least 3 of these Asteroid Belt locations.
