Yeah, many of the tip-offs back then was to provide a story pre Thargoids & barnacle hunting I guess. So nice to have the hindsight a few years later.
It doesn't mean they are irrelevant today, perhaps we just need to discover the right one's.
It could very well be that more clues are delivered this way but it's hard to sift through it with all the previous stories.
