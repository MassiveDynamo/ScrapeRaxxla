But Iâ€™ve been allied with Mother Gaia for a while & not been offered it. There must be something in addition, perhaps Fed ranking?

Been allied for ages (1-2 years), nothing out of the ordinary. Had a good nice personal mission yesterday, seek out a strange signal over at 90482 Orcus.

Scanned a beacon at an outpost and received a followup mission (by the Federal Congress) to kill a particular elite pirate in another system, ~7mill credit.
Nice short story, I did like the format of it however these mission comes at a regular pace it seems.
