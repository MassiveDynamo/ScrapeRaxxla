Here, give it a go.

Strange thing, as I dropped into the 'hidden' belt a Search and Rescue anaconda appeared. And kept insisting on keeping me safe, circling me at ~2km. I moved and it moved with me.
It stayed for about 7-8 minutes or so.
I did not notice anything else peculiar with it though. No communication in local.

EDIT: Ehm, while writing this post; 7-10 minutes after the Conda jumped out another Search & Rescue appeared. This time an ASP. Is this normal?
I've been idling in space in quite many times & locations, but never been randomly visited by Search & Rescue like this.
Perhaps it's new due to the system status in Sol. Hm alright.

I had the same S&R ship behaviour when I was looking for Cupid & Bellinda in the roid belts at Uranus. Sol is definitely looking a little peculiar.
