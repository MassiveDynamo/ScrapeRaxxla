Nicely spotted!
So if Triton is the first part of the puzzle, how do we get the permit??
I have long suspected that FD are using permits to 1) slow us down and 2) highlight systems.
I read somewhere once that mother gaia has put the permit lock there. ( Clearly not fdev as everyone thinks lol jk). Maybe somehow from then you could get it? Im going to look for the source for this.


Edit: first result...
Triton was first discovered by the British astronomer William Lassell on 10 October 1846, just 17 days after Neptune was discovered by the German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle and Heinrich Louis d'Arrest. Triton is permit-locked by the minor faction Mother Gaia.
