In my humble opinion the potato hunt, although highly commendable and a great example of data collection, is not thorough enough, although a group effort, some may be more thorough than others… much of the data may not have been cross examined etc leaving room for doubt.

It’s primarily focused on one principle, that Raxxla is within this bubble and can be found by normal means.

A sound hypothesis, however it’s possible FD altered Raxxla, it’s possible FD moved it, it’s possible it’s not going to reveal itself to just anyone (either through naming or mechanics) or even that the path to Raxxla although it may start at X might lead somewhere else…so it just might not be ‘obvious’

At most once the potato hunts complete, to be truly useful the data should be cross checked by other Cmdrs. But in conclusion it’s a flawed hypothesis as they will say it rules out Raxxla as being a body or object in this area, it might not, they could just miss it, or it might not be so obvious?
