Just a quick on the ‘little bit obvious’ quote.

It wasn’t a scripted response, it was Michael Brookes thinking on the spot.

From the context it’s not at all clear whether he is talking about how it would have to be approached in the future, or how it had already been approached.

It appeared to me to be the former rather than the latter, but that’s just the impression I got and it could be wrong.
