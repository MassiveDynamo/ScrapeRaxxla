Did someone take a look at the Trinkets of Hidden Fortune by jettisoning one and looking very closely at every angle?
Just a thought.
I spoke to FD Support via Devs some time ago (in this thread someplace), where FD essentially stated the trinkets were linked to the now removed DW missions and that ‘story’ and they were at most nothing more than a curiosity…

I took it to read they left them in because they were some form of narrative foreshadowing, which together with the missions would take us elsewhere… but this falls into high speculation, and at best I presume it was in part narrative, and a broken one at that… but then came the Codex… so I suspect FD just threw all that hard work aside and dumped Raxxla and the DW out there in the void, and rebuilt the mystery or just left the bones… to be uncovered…
