Here's the the thing: Brewer Corporation codex tells us what exactly to look for because a station was damaged in Tau Ceti. This being the station in Tau Ceti - Ortiz Moreno City. You cannot find these just by scanning a system. That is utterly useles. If you target a station in supercruise the holographic image is white. This image does not reflect reality. It is a template based on the object type. Dropping out of supercruise at the station will have the holographic update to the true structural shape of the station once you submit docking request. This still isn't good enough. You have to dock. None of these look like their purported economy type and to see that you have to go there yourself. This is why Great Potato Hunt of Raxxla will fail. They failed to understand everything targeted whilst in supercruise never will reflect reality. Supercruise isn't reality. It is still Witchspace but just not the Witchspace tunnel between systems. Even Smith City in Rauras (recently found station says it is agriculture) but it sure as hell doesn't look it. Also, per Wanted Black Mausoleum is an abandoned station (also station) and they missed that and a great many others (and we are still finding more of them).
Why the focus on and not on statues instead?
Never went close up to those statues (are they mainly in Imperial systems? IIRC. There could be something there. Inscribed on it, or maybe it is with their postures?
