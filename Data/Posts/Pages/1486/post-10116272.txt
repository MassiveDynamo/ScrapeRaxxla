Saw The Big Potato Hunt thread yesterday, 70%+ of all stars in a 200ly from Sol covered in search of Raxxla (they would of course also notice a disused station silently run), no sign of Raxxla or TDW.
What if they find nothing. Would it be possible that Drew Wagar exaggerated Braden words, or misinterpreted?
FDev has only said it's in the game, not that we can go there.
