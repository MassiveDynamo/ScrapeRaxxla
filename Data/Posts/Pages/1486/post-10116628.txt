Just a quick on the ‘little bit obvious’ quote.

It wasn’t a scripted response, it was Michael Brookes thinking on the spot.

From the context it’s not at all clear whether he is talking about how it would have to be approached in the future, or how it had already been approached.

It appeared to me to be the former rather than the latter, but that’s just the impression I got and it could be wrong.
Yes valid point, this is my opinion as well… ultimately much of the historical’ clues, might not have any relevance since Brookes departure, the lore purge and the introduction of the Codex, at most it’s very insightful, but should be taken with pinch of salt in my opinion.
