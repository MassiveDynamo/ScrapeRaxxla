The first reference is a direct quote from M Brookes, a previous lead on ED, when he was asked in a live stream about Raxxla - see page 1 of this thread for links.

The second reference is attributed again to M Brookes, who was responding to questions online, a long time ago just after launch, however that original source is lost to a possible data purge, there is a screen grab of it, see Jorki’s signature for a link to that.

Basically Brookes just says (prior to Codex) and during the existence of the PF/DW missions, that it was in game but no clues would be given, but sometimes you have to make things obvious - likely meaning there was something in game at that time to direct you towards it.

My assumption is it was those PF/DW missions - now confirmed removed by FD. Again see page 1.

The second reference cannot be corroborated in my opinion as the original thread is lost, but if true (very likely) it resolves towards the mechanism towards finding Raxxla is effectively simple and possible, by anyone, anytime…

That reference might hold water if another unconfirmed reference, about someone visiting the system was true…(again see page 1) that essentially at some point in time Raxxla was at a certain location and could be found, but we just walked right past it….

Please note there is another screenshot from Brookes on that subject findable online (not posted here), where he denied saying that…
