I don't think so, no. I've seen it alleged that Michael Brooks said someone had honked the system and not scanned the planet...and various other iterations, but, no, I've not seen anything official where anyone attached to Frontier has "said" anything on the matter.

OK, thanks for confirming. I think we've read the same allegations. Pretty sure if he'd actually said that we'd have a reference/source.

The search continues!
