A small suggestion if you don't mind, whenever you feel like doing something 'because we can't let it pass just in case' you might want to add this as a subgoal of any other task you had in mind or you may get burned out pretty quickly (I'm looking to all the barnacle hunters out there).

Thanks. My Primary Goal was Beagle Point, but I cannot get there straight. That subgoal was very much needed. Will try to find WR and Carbon Stars on the way as well.

Three more barren wastelands for your entertainment:

Ooscs Bra XX-L a36-0, Ooscs Bra XX-L a62-0 (doesn't even have planets...) and Ooscs Bra XX-L a63-0.
