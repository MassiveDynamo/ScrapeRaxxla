I’m rambling. Put it down to the shock of being rudely awoken by noisy birds at 05:30 & the reaction to a second mug of breakfast coffee at an uncivilised hour.

I find the extent of evolution of this game highly amusing. This time two years ago the forum activity was all focused on the Canonn thread, solving abstruse cryptograms and searching Merope 5C to find whatever the UAs and UPs were pointing at; now all the activity seems to be focused on a thread dealing with something for which we have no clues & no real in-game confirmation of existence.

Come back Michael, all is forgiven!!
(Except for that very machiavellian clue about making it just a little obvious)

edit: how could I forget about the Formidine Rift thread? Searching the black based on some other very abstruse clues from a couple of paragraphs in a novel. Mmmm, maybe things haven’t evolved at all.......
