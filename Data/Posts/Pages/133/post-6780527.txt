That would have been nice.
Maybe all is not lost. The Zurara/Dynasty mystery does not explain why the rift had the "here be ghosts" tag beforehand. Maybe Raxxla is what gave the rift it's reputation and maybe that's why "the club" sent the Zurara that way out.

Exactly. Although the "here be ghosts/dragons" is fan-made, a little bit of fantasy in this aseptic MW could sweeten somewhat so shallow plot. But I doubt FD is currently up for this kind of work.
