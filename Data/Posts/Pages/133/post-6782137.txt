Folks,

have FD stated that at least one player has visited the system where Raxxla is (but not necessarily found the gateway)? I thought I read it somewhere but think it might have been someone up to mischief. Couldn't find anything on the front page.

I don't think so, no. I've seen it alleged that Michael Brooks said someone had honked the system and not scanned the planet...and various other iterations, but, no, I've not seen anything official where anyone attached to Frontier has "said" anything on the matter.
