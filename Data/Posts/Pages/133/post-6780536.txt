A small suggestion if you don't mind, whenever you feel like doing something 'because we can't let it pass just in case' you might want to add this as a subgoal of any other task you had in mind or you may get burned out pretty quickly (I'm looking to all the barnacle hunters out there).

Easy peasy. Primary goal. Get lots of hand in exploration for money and rep with faction related to raxxla potentially and to get elited in all areas and more raxxla hunting. If you go all out raxxla hutning at this point it's just being a completionist. So, get er done as efficiently as possible. Do everything and figure out the scope of the game. IE your personal journey.
