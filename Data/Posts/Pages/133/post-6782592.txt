Yeah ... because when the POI was put in place that was what we knew about it ... 'partially decoded'. I'm not sure if it ever got 'fully decoded' or not but now that Premonition has been released and Drew has moved on ... I think it is safe to assume that whatever info we have from that is all we'll ever be getting.

Will need to chuckle a bug report for this then.. tsk!
