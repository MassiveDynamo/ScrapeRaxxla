You should find "Raxxla" written in fine print on the planet's surface. Probably just over the next hill ...

I think you mean:
”on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘Beware of the Leopard.” In another galaxy.

It is not only having a label on top of it, it has to smell like Raxxla and it has to bark like Raxxla to be the real Raxxla. Other than that is just a copy.

No, that’s my dog.
Nicknamed him Raxxla cos I never know where he is, amd wherever he is he’s up to mischief!
