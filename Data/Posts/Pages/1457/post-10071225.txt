I think it was more or less confirmed that the old E/F missions were removed after the discovery of Guardian ruins, because they were obsolete.

We also know that the discovery of ruins was supposed to be linked to Halseys vissions. This makes it quite likely that the Caretakers are beings that evolved from Guardian AI and / or implanted, exiled Guardians.
I think I disagree with you slightly on the dates for this. As far as I can discern the E/F missions apparently disappeared when rank-locking was removed from missions in the December 2015 v1.5/2.0 update. We did have some comments from FD reps in response to complaints that they should still be in the game but then it all went quiet, so I think they weren’t aware of the plot change. Which doesnt surprise me-I think the upper echelons of game designer/exec producer/DB would have kept that level of planning to themselves.

Guardians appeared ( together with FSD supercharging/boost) with ‘Horizons: The Guardians’ (2.2) in October 2016. So well before the “alleged toast” was released. So 10 months separation between E/F missions disappearing and Guardians release, but I do agree that the apparent change in storyline could well have been decided for the game release plan well in advance & it ties in with my thought that the E/F missions were deleted to delay the Guardians storyline by around 6 months or more.

Starship One was blown up May 26, 3301 (2015) and Halsey’s capsule was subsequently recovered/identified Feb 3302, and she revealed her “visions of the caretakers of the Galaxy” in April 3302 (2016). The gap May 2015 to April 2016 is quite large. So I suspect the original Starship One sabotage was planned as a minor incident in the game timeline, but that subplot was redirected around November/December 2015 to provide the basis for Halsey’s visions in April 2016 which were a change to and extension of the preparation for the Guardians story . Guardians were then inserted in October 2016, but the visions storyline route to them was bypassed when CMDR XDeath found the first Guardian site on October 27, 3302/2016 by interpolation from the skymap shown in the FD trailer. Otherwise I suspect FD would have expected that first find to take around a further 6 months.

I think the “caretakers” are the human mind’s interpretation of signal leakage from the Guardian comms network linking the sites, and which are populated by the Guardian AI. So one storyline development might be for Utopian mind links to be taken over by those Guardian AI, for another future threat..around v22.4 update circa 2035!
