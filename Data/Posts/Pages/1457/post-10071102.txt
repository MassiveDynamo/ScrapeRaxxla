Ah yes, good spot. I’d forgotten the old E/F missions and their crystal shards. That could well have been the Raxxla storyline. Maybe pulled because they wanted to extend the game timescale (profitsss?) and delay the Guardian stroryline start.
Of course we do have Guardian “keys” from the beacons...perhaps their use to get guardian blueprints is another obfuscation/red herring and they have a more pertinent use?

The beacons seem to me to be very ornate and ought to have more to their existence than merely to give us ancient keys to open the ground site repository.

“Place that is not a Place, door that is also the key”???

I think it was more or less confirmed that the old E/F missions were removed after the discovery of Guardian ruins, because they were obsolete.

We also know that the discovery of ruins was supposed to be linked to Halseys vissions. This makes it quite likely that the Caretakers are beings that evolved from Guardian AI and / or implanted, exiled Guardians.
