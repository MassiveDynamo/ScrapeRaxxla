Trying to find the surface settlement that mentioned a pyramid like structure monument (at Site 94 in HIP 19284) that was discovered right before an alien attack. I believe it was near Pleiades region. Also, Mic Turner vanished in Pleione system.

Should be noted that "...monument vaguely like a Temple" does not really align well with the firmly established bits on Thargoids. Also, HIP 19284 A 2 d where Site 94 is located is quite warm at 447 K/173.85°C/344.93°F. I really am beginning to suspect the only species that is dead and buried are Thargoids. This would fit better with Guardians. I honestly think we thought that Guardians were Thargoids (the name Thargoids only came about due to holo-vid from Lave) which happened during First Thargoid Contact in 3125. The beacon makes specific reference to symbols appearing to spell "THARG".
