Within Philip Sidney’s Arcadia, a ‘trifle’ for his younger sister Mary (child’s story), also describes a tale of a pirates stash, hidden below a great oak tree by Aristomenes.

With the inclusion of another shot of brandy, this ‘hoard’ story was also later re-appropriated by 20th century mythology shenanigans into the Oak Island mystery!

A certain scene within Phillip Sidney’s 'Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia' holds, a "striking resemblance" to that of an arcane mystery called the 'Oak Island mystery'. Where in both there’s a pirates hoard found under an 'oak tree' with a very specific burial method. = "Striking resemblance", "Pirates stash" and "myth".

Link: The story of Oak Island and Arcadia

This Oak Island is located in Nova Scotia, an alternate name for Nova Scotia is Acadia which is a shortening of Arcadia (A typical name at that time used by explorers of the age for new lands).

Frontier Development had an office in Nova Scotia. It closed in 2015. It developed the game 'Planet Coaster'.

There is a level within Planet Coaster based in 'Oak Island'. Not actually that surprising given its office was in Nova Scotia and Oak Island would be a prominent fixture in the local history.

Another phrase to describe 'Arcadia' is: "Arcadia, a paradise lost".
