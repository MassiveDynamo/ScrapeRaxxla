Hah, I finally found my chat history on these new-fangled forums, and in addition to all the hexediting messages from mods and strange notes from penguins (weirdly also about a Rift), found the video that had the view of the Pleiades in it which looks similar to the Thargoid logo. Check out the 3:54 mark here:

Notice anything interesting about it? My photoshop skills aren't up to this, but if you overlay the barnacles logo on it, it sure looks to me like the black areas on the first of the Thargoid logos match the dark areas of the nebula where there is no dust almost exactly. I am sure you could find a better image of the nebula where it would be even clearer.

Some may remember this video from the threadnought, I think it ended up posted there as well after I shared it with some of those orangy sciency folks..
