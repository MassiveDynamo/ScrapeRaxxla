Hey SergMx , would you be able to post the russian version of the toast , i would like to have a look at the potential translations. Might give a different perspective
Okay, I'll write it tomorrow, since I'm away from the computer now.

In the meantime, my next question: was there a possibility that Raxxla was the name of an unknown Thargoid device ? At least we don't know what it is.
