Hmm, not Raxxla related, but in California Sector now and no Thargoid ship presence that I can see, not even in the systems with barnacles. Why have the Thargoids not contested the Alliance expansion there like they have in Witch Head and Coalsack? Pirates have, but not the Thargoids themselves? Anyone find that a little strange? Also facilities named after Mic Turner, and his faction Turner Research Group seem to be largely running the place. He (supposedly) disappeared trying to make peaceful first contact with the Thargoids. I believe it is different Alliance factions in the other nebulae. Curiouser and curiouser. That said California Nebula is one of those odd ones where the systems don't actually seem to be in the nebula itself as depicted on the Galaxy Map, so perhaps that explains the absence of Thargoid signal sources. Just out of curiousity, does anyone know if a Thargoid signal source has ever been seen outside of a nebula or dark region?
