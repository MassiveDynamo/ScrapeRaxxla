Regarding passing through Thargoid "portal"... I've tried it with all Thargoid/Guardian materials onboard and it's like hitting a rubber wall. Scanning the wake with these materials onboard also did not yield anything. (for me)

But I wonder why ploting a course close to the locked sectors takes significant more time even if you plot a jump to the next nearby system.
