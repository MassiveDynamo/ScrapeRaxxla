I'm considering what cargo items might make a difference when scanning a Thargoid wake and whether that could lead elsewhere or to Raxxla. It's an area I've thought about a couple of times before but with the addition of fleet carriers (item storage) it should now be easier to collect items and then see if any make a difference. Flight Assist off boost from a hyperdiction should work, I think, or staying near an attacked megaship which draws Thargoids in. Will see first if I can find any previous investigations into this.
