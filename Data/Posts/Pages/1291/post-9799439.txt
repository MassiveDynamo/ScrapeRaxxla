1) The hexagon pattern is prominent in the game, e.g. with the Raxxla symbol (as opposed to octogonal thargoids).

2) Police ships fly a hexagon pattern around stations. If you wait a while for more police ships to spawn, you can even see the hexagon pattern in their drive trails.

3) Some properties of stations could be a lead.

4) I tried measuring the stations' orbit by aligning the stations with distant stars behind them at different times. The idea was that a station's alignment would sweep through space, e.g. in a plane or cone. Measuring the paths of different stations and computing the intersecting objects between those different surfaces would yield e.g. a curve, and ultimately, a point, defined by 3 stations.
So far, no results. When assuming that a station's orbit would form a plane (meaning the station's axis is parallel to the radius of the orbit), I found that many stations form nearly parallel planes. And when I found stations that would deviate and used their orbits to obtain locations, the locations would be all different.

5) Lights around a station's mail slot could be some kind of code. Sometimes some lights are dark, some are coloured, some show a flickering like damaged flourescent tubes, maybe flickering in morse code.

Some good thoughts there! But not all stations point towards the planet they’re orbiting so the station axis isn’t necessarily aligned along the orbital radius. I think some are & that was a hangover from the original elite game when that arrangement was chosen to reduce the graphics loading.
Happy hypothesis testing!
