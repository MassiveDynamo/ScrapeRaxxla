Going over the un-corroborated DB statement about a group of Cmdrs needed to scan something for it to become accessible, I wonder if this attribution from an earlier DB statement around dark systems which proposed a similar mechanism?

I don’t expect dark systems ever got implemented, but maybe this method of exploration needs clarification from FD next time there is a Q/A… eg in June 2014 DB made this statement, was it ever implemented.

I always thought, if I wanted to hide something this would be the coolest way to do it… again I don’t actually believe FD implemented it…but what if they did?

I wasn't playing that early, else I would have queried his statement. How can the “dark system” be scanned before you arrive in it? As far as we know the discovery scanner is “infinite” within a system, but not outside it.
