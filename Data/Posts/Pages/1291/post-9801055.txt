Gordon Class Bulk Cargo Ship HDI-385 in Nauni...

Goids will appear if you wait....

Now what did they pick up from what wreck? why don't the Goids like it and what was in the direction were they headed in as it was a straight line... and jumping back in the opposite direction for countless jumps would find the wreck?

How far can these ships jump? not seen any info so far....
