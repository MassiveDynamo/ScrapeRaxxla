1) The hexagon pattern is prominent in the game, e.g. with the Raxxla symbol (as opposed to octogonal thargoids).

2) Police ships fly a hexagon pattern around stations. If you wait a while for more police ships to spawn, you can even see the hexagon pattern in their drive trails.

3) Some properties of stations could be a lead.

4) I tried measuring the stations' orbit by aligning the stations with distant stars behind them at different times. The idea was that a station's alignment would sweep through space, e.g. in a plane or cone. Measuring the paths of different stations and computing the intersecting objects between those different surfaces would yield e.g. a curve, and ultimately, a point, defined by 3 stations.
So far, no results. When assuming that a station's orbit would form a plane (meaning the station's axis is parallel to the radius of the orbit), I found that many stations form nearly parallel planes. And when I found stations that would deviate and used their orbits to obtain locations, the locations would be all different.

5) Lights around a station's mail slot could be some kind of code. Sometimes some lights are dark, some are coloured, some show a flickering like damaged flourescent tubes, maybe flickering in morse code.
