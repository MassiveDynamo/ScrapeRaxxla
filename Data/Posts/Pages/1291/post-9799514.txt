Tripling CMDR Ishap Black, currently Deadly, to try to see if anything interesting happens when the triple happens.

It is slow going, but at least no more CMDR's will be tripled. I do miss my crew member, tho.

Using the build to rank. My favorite place to rank is in a CNB. Currently CMDR Ishap Black is in Tasaki Freeport taking massacre missions against Brotherhood Of LP 98-132 pirates. If you're going to massacre, then why not make sure you're getting the most of it. Found this location via https://edtools.cc/pve?s=lhs+2819&md=&lo=on&sc=
