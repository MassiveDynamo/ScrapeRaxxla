Going over the un-corroborated DB statement about a group of Cmdrs needed to scan something for it to become accessible, I wonder if this attribution is actually a false recollection of an earlier DB statement which was around dark systems, which proposed a similar mechanism.

I don’t recall FD ever communicating that they had dropped dark systems as a concept, nor if it ever got implemented, but maybe this method of exploration needs clarification from FD next time there is a Q/A… eg in June 2014 DB made this statement, was it ever implemented.

I always thought, if I wanted to hide something this would be the coolest way to do it… again I don’t actually believe FD implemented it…but what if they did?
