1. Are there any systems with bodies so heavy you don't jump in at the star?
2. Is it possible the Amish vs Tech thargoids are the club/dark wheel. Particularly if the guarians vs thargoids are the nature/tech guardians.

If they are the same entities I wonder if the are pulling the strings in the background. Can't some of them psycically control people?

This would simplify the entire thing down to guardians and fit the existing oddly thinned out content.

IE. The guardians tech vs nature = Guardians vs thargoids = club vs dark wheel. And we've had secret alien overlords controlling us the entire time via mind control! 8)
