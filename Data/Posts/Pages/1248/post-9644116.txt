It's very simple - the United States was convinced that they had won the war of 2055, but in fact, the cunning Russians, with the help of hackers, leaked into the government and reformed the United States from the inside, turning it into an appendage of the Federation. They put Hudson-Biden on the post of president so that everyone could see - that's a real American! The Empire is just Russian oligarchs and runaway officials who stole from the Federation, having founded the monarchical system

Imo, federation is USA and empire is URSS (not russia).
Hudson looks like uncle sam. And for empire, though i'm not a pro in history, there were some dynasty/royalty with romanov's family (duval's family in-game).
It's like in movies, this cold war (that i don't care btw, as i wasn't born) seem to be an obscession, even 3307.

But as i just wake up, maybe i'm still high with weed
