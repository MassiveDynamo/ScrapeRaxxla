Elite dangerous proved that all the Russian Federation has left in 3307 is Yuri Grom...and we all know that's not very good
Imo, federation is USA and empire is URSS (not russia).
Hudson looks like uncle sam. And for empire, though i'm not a pro in history, there were some dynasty/royalty with romanov's family (duval's family in-game).
It's like in movies, this cold war (that i don't care btw, as i wasn't born) seem to be an obscession, even 3307.

But as i just wake up, maybe i'm still high with weed
