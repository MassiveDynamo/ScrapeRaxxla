Achernar, of alpha Eridani, doesn't seem to be in-game.
Achenar is in game. slightly different spelling - not sure if thats the same place. Search for the HIP or HD names and the map will find it for you.

Interstingly Achenar is a ref to an adventure game:
Characters of Myst - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org

So perhaps its deliberately spelt like that , who knows.
