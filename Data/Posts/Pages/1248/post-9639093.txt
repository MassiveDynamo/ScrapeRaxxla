Good to hear!
But I cant remember why I was looking for you!
Ah, old age the neurons are fading rapidly...
But thanks to Lavian Brandy they're going happily!

If sufficient go then I’ll be a figment of my own imagination!


Edit: ah yes! Forum search is a wonderful thing , when it works...
Han_Zen wrote that “The pre game writers guides told that TDW hadn’t found Raxxla” & said you might be the source of that cos I couldn't see it in Allen Stroud‘s PhD thesis.

Edit2: and he then found your source statement! https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...eel-may-contain-spoilers.402645/#post-6366667

You’d said in that post:
“The second scene on the Behemoth confirms the FFE main storyline and that the Dark Wheel didn't find Raxxla.

WHILE AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS WAS TRUE AS PER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY FD, THE FIRST ENCOUNTERS STORYLINE WAS LATER REDACTED.”

Which sort of sounds like TDW may have found Raxxla??
