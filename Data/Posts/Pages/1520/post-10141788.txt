.."mythical plant Raxxla"?!?

I just checked multiple versions of TDW novella including the one that was included with Elite (1984) (both text and PDFs). This appears to not be a typo. At least across multiple editions, we get the same "mythical plant Raxxla". Well, that might just explain exobiology paying so well.
