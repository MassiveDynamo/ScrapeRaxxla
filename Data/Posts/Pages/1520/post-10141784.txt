I seem to remember hearing Ian Bell had said at some point something to the effect that he didnt think Braben could do Raxxla like Holdstock had envisioned. If i am remembering this right - (yes need to find source) than to me it indicates that Holdstock had a definite idea of what Raxxla should be - and Braben atleast knew what it was. Im not saying looking at Holdstocks past works is going to give us “The Answer” - but I do think it could give us clues as to where in ED to look for answers. But ya to each their own methods. Its not like we have found anything yet this way…
Yes, I remember reading that quote by Ian Bell. Apparently there was some falling out between IB & DB after the first Elite game, so anything said should be viewed with some caution. I don’t think IB knows anything about Raxxla in ED. We also have a suggestion that DB didnt buy into the Holdstock mythos (“
Your father was chasing the mythical planet Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life . . .” Elite: The Dark Wheel,

So I think it’s quite likely that DB has changed the implementation to suit ED. I suspect DB’s will be a bit different from Holdstock’s.
