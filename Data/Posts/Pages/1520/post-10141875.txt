.."mythical plant Raxxla"?!?

I just checked multiple versions of TDW novella including the one that was included with Elite (1984) (both text and PDFs). This appears to not be a typo. At least across multiple editions, we get the same "mythical plant Raxxla". Well, that might just explain exobiology paying so well.
The version on Ian bells site is OCR'd and is thus has many of that particular type of error.

No doubt someone here has the original feelie from the 1st game. My C64 version didn't come with the novella, unfortunately..
