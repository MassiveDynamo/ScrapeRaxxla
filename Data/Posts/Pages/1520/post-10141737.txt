I seem to remember hearing Ian Bell had said at some point something to the effect that he didnt think Braben could do Raxxla like Holdstock had envisioned. If i am remembering this right - (yes need to find source) than to me it indicates that Holdstock had a definite idea of what Raxxla should be - and Braben atleast knew what it was. Im not saying looking at Holdstocks past works is going to give us “The Answer” - but I do think it could give us clues as to where in ED to look for answers. But ya to each their own methods. Its not like we have found anything yet this way…
