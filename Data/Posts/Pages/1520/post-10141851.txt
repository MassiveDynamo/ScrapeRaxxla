Yes, I remember reading that quote by Ian Bell. Apparently there was some falling out between IB & DB after the first Elite game, so anything said should be viewed with some caution. I don’t think IB knows anything about Raxxla in ED. We also have a suggestion that DB didnt buy into the Holdstock mythos (“
Your father was chasing the mythical planet Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life . . .” Elite: The Dark Wheel,

So I think it’s quite likely that DB has changed the implementation to suit ED. I suspect DB’s will be a bit different from Holdstock’s.

Ya i am sure Braben made his own version of Raxxla to fit the constraints of ED - but at the same time I dont think he is the type to throw out the baby with the bathwater. I imagine it still will be tied atleast in some way to the ideas of Holdstock - atleast that is the assumption ive been going with ….
