It definitely says "mythical plant Raxxla".

However, end of Chapter Two has this paragraph:

Rafe smiled, shaking his head. Suddenly there was a brilliant sparkle in his eyes: 'Raxxla's no alien, Alex. It's a ghost world. A planet. A legendâ€¦' He hesitated, staring quizzically at the younger man through the distant link between them, 'Jason really said that to you?'

I am guessing a long uncaught typo.
