Hypothetically speaking, were it a plant on a planet/moon - would it not make sense to check Panes in Kappa Fornacis (home to Onionhead) or HIP 55118? Panes is landable and orbits Panem. The system also has a Y-class brown dwarf like the Soontill description in "..And Here The Wheel". This is also one of the earliest events in Elite Dangerous.

Onionhead description:
The Onionhead flower is native to HIP 55118, and its seeds contain the well-known psychedelic narcotic.

Illegal in most jurisdictions. This rare good is legal in all Imperial, Anarchy systems, Independent and Alliance Democracy, Dictatorship and Confederacy systems. Illegal in all other systems.

Please note that if a system's controlling faction changes, some formerly legal rare goods may become illegal in that system. If this happens, the rare goods in question will no longer be available for sale or purchase.
