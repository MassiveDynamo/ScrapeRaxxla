A reminder there is no shortage of propaganda in the lore. As such you should not blindly believe anything unless it can be independently verified. It started in Lave and didn't get any better. I will be happy to cover this, if anyone is interested in a primer. Also, I would strongly advise that pre-conceived notions can be trouble.
