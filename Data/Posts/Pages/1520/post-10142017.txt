Mmm, not sure “constraints” is the right word there, I’d substitute “mythos”. It was a planet with an alien gateway, in ED we have Thargoid and Guardian aliens. We have some missing Guardian ark ships (according to Ram Tah’s decodes). Guardians left behind a comms network and AI, that is somewhere...Now Raxxla has been in-game since the beta/gamma, well before Horizons brought in surface landing. So I’m still speculating ED’s Raxxla is Guardian tech, hidden in orbit, and from the logo I suspect a hidden asteroid base/ship. It should have an alien news feed/logs to provide some startling new information...I’m hoping for the winning Euromillions numbers!

Where’s the best place to hide an “asteroid”? In amongst millions of others.
My epileptic copawlot has disturbed my sleep to the point where I havent played this week. Still intending to go back to Saturn and start searching the rings. Likely to be a frustratingly boring, long & lonely search.

When talking about a myth, Planet is a loose term. It could well be a moon, asteroid or something artificial.
I have my doubts when it comes to the Ark ships. They were early guardian tech, without propulsion. It would surprise me if they were much more advanced than our generation ships.

It seems that Stellar forge has a minimum radius of 135 km, for planets / moons. Anything smaller than that would be in the Small body or Asteroid category. Neither of those will show up on scanners. At least individually. Small bodies are in the cases we have found, just gravitational singularities.

Rings, clusters and even deep space are good places to hide any of these.
