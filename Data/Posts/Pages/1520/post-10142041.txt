When talking about a myth, Planet is a loose term. It could well be a moon, asteroid or something artificial.
I have my doubts when it comes to the Ark ships. They were early guardian tech, without propulsion. It would surprise me if they were much more advanced than our generation ships.

It seems that Stellar forge has a minimum radius of 135 km, for planets / moons. Anything smaller than that would be in the Small body or Asteroid category. Neither of those will show up on scanners. At least individually. Small bodies are in the cases we have found, just gravitational singularities.

Rings, clusters and even deep space are good places to hide any of these.
I suspect Planetary rings over Asteroid clusters. There’s a lot more to hide in! With no scanner detection it’s going to be a hit or miss search.
