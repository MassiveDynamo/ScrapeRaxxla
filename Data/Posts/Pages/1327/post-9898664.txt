Raxxla is what's been retconned along the way?
No, I don’t think so. The retconning related to the Thargoids & Col70 etc, IIRC (I suspect goids were originally intended for Bovomit, but the FRift received too much attention so they changed their location. Nothing has ever been said about Raxxla, other than in the livestreams etc that I reported in my FD quotes thread.

Of course it’s always possible that Raxxla has been retconned, but since nothing has been said to link it to any lore then there would have been no reason to do so. The only reference in this respect is that Drew Wagar (I think, though it might have been Allen Stroud) said it appeared in FD’s internal alien lore manual which is secret and covered under NDA. Edit: just checking my notes, it was Drew.
