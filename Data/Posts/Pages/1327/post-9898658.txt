Was that not @GURU-951 if so you can just ask him here?
They’re not saying who this time, so I dont think it’s Guru again. There was some mention of visual evidence involving Guardian stuff, which alone makes me suspicious, since I think its likely not that far out-TDW has been “in existence since the earliest days of space travel” (a hint it started in the old worlds, possibly Sol) and an early space station wouldnt have travelled far. So I agree it’s likely to be hogwash. Was just reporting this to @Rochester, who had some TDW-related dialogue with FD.
