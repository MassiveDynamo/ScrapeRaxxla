Strange that system "PMD2009 48" appears here and now.
The system just popped up in some, eh, let's say, "general data mining activity".
The system is not very special as this algorithm yields approx. 1000 systems.
The results of this algorithm didn't look particularly helpful.
So I suspected another dead end.
But maybe I should give these results another look at some time...
