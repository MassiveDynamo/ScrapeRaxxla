And I think Raxxla and it's secret can't be too much further, because our knowledge of the stars wouldn't be too far from Sol, so "out in the black" then would be what, at most a couple thousand LY?

This may not be a safe assumption. Firstly older hyperdrives could route plot without jumping to stars. Also they had only a factor of 5 or 6 times less jump range - so they could cross the galaxy in a few months instead of a week.

Finally the codex date of 2296 may be misleading. Its possible Raxxla was known to exist (as a myth or otherwise) without anyone actually having set eyes on it. It could have been known from a third party source such as from found artefacts or communicated directly by aliens etc.
