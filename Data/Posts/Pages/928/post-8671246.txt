Jewel in brow could be some BH/NS radiating ... and those are "best made" by gravity = jewel.
I like Idea of spiraling BHs as somebody said. However ... need re-read by native english people. It can be double meaning there, like "stars which spiral each other" and "stars which look like spirals" (researching from 2000 shows that WR star with companion star can produce spiraling visible gas).
"stars which spiral each other" -> that can be whole galaxy, after all they're spiraling
