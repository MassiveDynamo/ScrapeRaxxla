I would also like to contribute to your gravity idea but based on gravitational-waves idea and just ran into this just now and I would like to know if anyone got knowledge of this.

It's basically called Gravitational-waves Standard Siren measurement. I don't fully understand and hopefully someone here can make any sense of this.
"Standard Siren" is wide term, basically everything shiny in Universe they call so. I saw works about 1A super novas, named "standard siren" as well.
