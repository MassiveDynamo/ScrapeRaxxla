I’m fairly sure that supposed reference was actually DW talking about the FRift mystery. Can’t remember DB ever saying anything like that. The two seem to to have been confused multiple times.
Why DW thought that a ship 10kylies out, with no breadcrumb trail, would be easy to find still escapes me (the giraffe etc only provide a general direction), which is my concern over Raxxla and TDW. I suspect that Raxxla is pretty obvious and a standard astronomical body (such as a BH or pair thereof) with a secondary purpose that just hasn’t been tested yet. And I think it’s close!

Mmmmm- Has anyone tried jumping at/into the WD in Lawd26??? Might try it sometime with a low rebuy ship. There’s also the WD in the permitted system (Van Maanen?).
Nah, I’m sure the quote was DB, not DW. There was a lot of debate on what it pertained to at the time. If it was DW we would have pretty much known it pertained to the FR mystery, and it would have been a FR mystery thread thing, but as I recall it, the discussion was on one of the Canonn megathreads. I’m also fairly sure it was reasonably close to the trailer that featured what we now think was a Thargoid Structure.

That would fit as it could actually have been the Thargoid Stuctures that we’re being referred to as they were apparently in game prior to the update where the listening points and installations which lead to their discovery got added to the Pleiades.

(If the forum search didn’t miss out large periods of time, I’d track it back that way! )
