Jewel in brow could be some BH/NS radiating ... and those are "best made" by gravity = jewel.
I like Idea of spiraling BHs as somebody said. However ... need re-read by native english people. It can be double meaning there, like "stars which spiral each other" and "stars which look like spirals" (researching from 2000 shows that WR star with companion star can produce spiraling visible gas).
"stars which spiral each other" -> that can be whole galaxy, after all they're spiraling


I've been stuck on the jewel bit too. Also there's something that Drew claims FDev said, that it's a journey each Commander must make on their own... Or something if that matter.

If this be the case, than surely it has to have some sort of connection to allegory, right? But diving too deep into myths and legends might just be too deep, it has to be simpler... But those two things, the Dark Wheel alleged toast, plus what FDev may have said, just keeps playing over and over in my mind.

I might need to do some digging at this... Ancient civilizations have referred to specific stars as jewels, I'm certain... Just gotta remember who and when, and what...

Anyway, it's long past my bed time and I'm practically fading into sleep as is, time for bed.
