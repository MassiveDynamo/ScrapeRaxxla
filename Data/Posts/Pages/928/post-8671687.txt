Nice!

A quick appeal to anyone else searching through old vids - please keep an eye out for DB saying something about being surprised that players hadn’t yet found one of the biggest things in game.

(It’s somewhere, but I’ve not been able to find it in in the official FD vids from around the time I think it was said!)

I’m fairly sure that supposed reference was actually DW talking about the FRift mystery. Can’t remember DB ever saying anything like that. The two seem to to have been confused multiple times.
Why DW thought that a ship 10kylies out, with no breadcrumb trail, would be easy to find still escapes me (the giraffe etc only provide a general direction), which is my concern over Raxxla and TDW. I suspect that Raxxla is pretty obvious and a standard astronomical body (such as a BH or pair thereof) with a secondary purpose that just hasn’t been tested yet. And I think it’s close!

Mmmmm- Has anyone tried jumping at/into the WD in Lawd26??? Might try it sometime with a low rebuy ship. There’s also the WD in the permitted system (Van Maanen?).
