let's not forget this is supposed to be 'a tiny bit obvious' i feel like that should apply to the average ED player and not specifically to the mensa crowd. To me it just feels like needing the equivalence of several PHDs in things like physics, theology, mathematics and philosophy kind of goes against that claim
Very possibly the ‘tiny bit obvious’ thing has been misinterpreted. It could simply have been MB speculating out on how they’ll have to approach it, not him saying how they have approached it.

Also, I think what needs to be borne in mind around the obviousness is that if it’s designed around the average, that means it will be difficult for some and easy for others.

Given how things operate in terms of people publishing solutions, then generally speaking, if it’s easy for anyone then it’s solved for everyone.

This is a real ‘be careful what you wish for’ situation, because getting what’s being wished for would almost certainly have meant that the whole things was solved years ago, and we would never have had this long running quest, and this thread in which for people to express such wishes.

Think I’m wrong? Consider, when thinking about what might constitute a ‘tiny bit obvious’, how many times it has to be pointed out to people that ‘bounty’ and ‘fine’ are not in fact the same word. Or one of the other current recurrent topics - people not realising that they might get carried somewhere if they park up in a carrier. (I’m not being derogatory towards anyone here, it’s just illustrative of the range that needs to be taken into account when considering what is and isn’t obvious.)
