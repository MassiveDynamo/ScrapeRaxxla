This may not be a safe assumption. Firstly older hyperdrives could route plot without jumping to stars. Also they had only a factor of 5 or 6 times less jump range - so they could cross the galaxy in a few months instead of a week.

Finally the codex date of 2296 may be misleading. Its possible Raxxla was known to exist (as a myth or otherwise) without anyone actually having set eyes on it. It could have been known from a third party source such as from found artefacts or communicated directly by aliens etc.
It may also be that the station or the previous station owners used some of that "fundamentally different" hyperdrive tech the Guardians used. Or it could even be the Thargoid tech, or something completely different.

It would make sense if it's related to the way that Thargoids are hinted to have arrived in the Milky Way from wherever their extragalactic (extradimensional/extra-brane-al? ) home is. Maybe it's what lets them get an FSD lock from Andromeda or wherever.
