Just on the MB quote; I would always say the video should be watched.

It’s clear when watching the video that there’s interpretations that aren’t obvious when just reading the quote.

Also worth bearing in mind that the first part of the quote was a pre-submitted question and pre-written answer, whereas the second part happens on the spot.

Indeed, I am still suspicious why he wore the Ygdrasil tee-shirt, and that tattoo!!!! Why is the intended book still not published???
Always worth checking through vids and other references oneself, we might have missed something, or misheard, or there may be other interpretations that we missed. Mmmmm, I ought to post my list of found sources.....
