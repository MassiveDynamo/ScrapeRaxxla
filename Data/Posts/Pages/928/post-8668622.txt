Found a couple of luxury cabin passenger missions. No apparent indicator other than the mission description. Strangely the first I did wanted a diversion to a conflict zone in Nuenets so I visited the first CZ in-system, no indication from him, so carried on to his destination & he wasnt happy because Iâ€™d missed a tourist beacon! No tourist beacon at a conflict zone!!
You have to be in CZ for some time, he will thank you then.
