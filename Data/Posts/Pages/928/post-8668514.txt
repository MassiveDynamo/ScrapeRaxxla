Oh yeah! >_< Forgot about that bit.

So... Raxxla could be anywhere, perhaps even between the stars, as I've heard before. Lovely.

I still think the station might be close to home however, if the station even exists in the first place. And if it does, wouldn't we find some clues there?

Too much information making my head spin @_@

I just need to read the books and watch some lore videos from reputable sources.
