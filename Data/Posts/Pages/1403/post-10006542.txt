Yes that’s correct, however with that same stock Stroud is confirming he and Brookes ‘were’ reverential?

I’m assuming if Raxxla was developed by Brookes and not Braben, which sings true being the producer, lead on lore and a writer, then it will have markers applicable to Holdstock, Lovecraft and maybe Milton?

If Braben discarded that content, which is doubtful, then Holdstock is correctly irrelevant if Raxxla is content applied and directed by Braben.

That might in my opinion explain Braben general disinterest in the Raxxla question. It being more of a tribute Brookes and Stroud developed. It being their project and not his?

It would explain why when the DW missions were removed, no one told us. Maybe because Braben was not directly concerned, it being a trifle?

I hope that’s still the case and FD haven’t gone down a divergent path and just re-appropriated Brookes / Strouds work since 2016; that’s a terrible thought.

I do feel the Lovecraft / Holdstock avenue hasn’t been trodden as much as maybe it ought.

My own analysis points to Milton being used in game, in regards to Pandemonium’s very specific placement, and the use of some very Milton type phrasing in the DW missions…not less the reference to the celestial spheres.

As to if that’s at all relevant or even still relevant is anyone’s guess.
