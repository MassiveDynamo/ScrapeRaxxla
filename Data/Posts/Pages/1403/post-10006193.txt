True but I don’t actually deal in mythology, the true context is too wide, about 50,000 years too wide, I deal in linguistics and behavioural links. I am actually an ‘analyst’ and behaviour can be mapped, and understood, patterns exit, people are complacent. If it’s an ‘intentional’ puzzle there is an intentional ‘key’. Or there at least are ‘triggers’, or ‘relationships’; if there aren’t then there will be intelligence gaps, and the absence of information is information waiting only to be understood.

Unless there isn’t. Part of the fun is figuring that out collectively and proving it true or false. Unlocking that puzzle is a totally different kettle of fish and likely someone else’s prize.
