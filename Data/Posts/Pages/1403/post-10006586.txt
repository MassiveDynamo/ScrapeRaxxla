Annnd speaking of things that may relate to the Raxxla logo, and since I've been exploring Sol a lot lately, I of course went to see the Voyagers and New Horison, and recorded the audio the put out and checked it for anything like hidden signals - couldn't see anything. Though I hadn't previously realised that the Voyager message you pick up from them in-game isn't any part of the Voyager message that's actually on the discs. Presumably it's audio from Fdev directly made to emulate the feel of the disc message. The audio I recorded matches the audio on the Canonn site if you want to hear it, and if you want to hear the greetings from the real Voyager, you can find them here on NASA's site.

However! While investigating the possibility of Voyager containing some secret message I watched a documentary on the real Voyager, and noticed this:


Circle dot and something similar to a dashed line. Pretty sure it's not related, but thought it was interesting! We know Fdev have used the Voyager golden plate style imagery before in the Thargoid message:

You can see the --| -|- -|| are basically identical to the same marks on the golden record.

I doubt Fdev would use the same references for clues twice. Again, just noting this to eliminate any possibility of Voyager probes being the "sirens of the deepest void" (I thought they might have been).
