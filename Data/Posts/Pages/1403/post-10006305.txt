The main issue ofc being that no one has a single clue if the years of effort they put in is in the right direction.
As indeed you say understanding the meaning of the task is the only clue to unlocking anything.

I keep coming back to the comment of "it has to be somewhat obvious" and think are we all just massively overthinking this lol.
The Toast is the only thing we have, it could have been called anything, a poem, story, quote or statement. but it wasn't it was a "TOAST".

This implies that there were a NUMBER of factors for Raxxla, that is interpreted as 6 due to the logo and the punctuation of the toast but this is also technically a guess.
IMO - a toast is going round the table to toast things or people, "combined with a journey that everyone has to take" leads me back to the waypoint idea, but oh.. where to start.
Has anyone just travelled the winter hexagon to see what happens?

I also wonder what the binary message was for, and why the new load screen of the same station type, was this the Thargoid update or was it a message to someone that at that point were somewhere near something. The whole thing after 9 years is still, what if.

There is also all the little things that people don't share in a hope they are the first to find it from their theory lol. these could all add up to the answer
