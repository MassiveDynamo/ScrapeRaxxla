Last week I purchased a copy of "Alien World" by Steven Eisler. I wanted to go through it myself (rather than relying on the word of others) to see if there's anything that may be a clue (in terms of Fdev writers using something from it as a clue since they already knew people were already making connections from games like Oolite, etc).

My main purpose was to eliminate that book as the "Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars" reference - or hope to find a clue - honestly not even sure I did that

I can honestly say, other than the word "Raxxla" appearing in that book, there's nothing that I can point to and say "here, this seems familiar from Elite Dangeorus". I know there's been a lot of talk of the Talmor Lens, and while it's certainly very interesting since it directly relates to ancient aliens ideas that have (shamefully) become increasingly popular these days, I can't see any way to relate anything mention in Alien World to Elite Dangerous other than by some very, very circuitous reasoning (like, Earth exists in Elite, it's mentioned in Alien World, and therefore Talmor Lens must also exist in Elite.).

For those that don't know:
SPOILER: SUMMARY OF TALMOR LENS' AND OISIR-RAXXLA FROM ALIEN WORLD



The entire Oisir-Raxxla part of the book is 5 of the 96 pages (and most of them are less than half pages because it's primarily an art book). If anyone wants to see the text for themselves I'm happy to share photos of those 5 pages. DM me.
