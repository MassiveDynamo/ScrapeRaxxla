More accurate than you may think, wouldn't be surprised if some of those "AncientAliens" book authors were contacted by Fdev as consultants for some aspects of the lore to be fair, as the Talmor lense thing is a variant of one of their theories from the 70s though I forget offhand which one. Perhaps the whole "Little bit obvious" part is lost on people as the "Dont look for Raxxla go the other way" clue was... Play the game, solve the aliens puzzles and get to it naturally.
Do you have Alien World and have you read it? If so, please do feel free to point out the exact bits of the text that you think relate to Elite Dangerous, I'd love to see them, I sure as hell couldn't find any
