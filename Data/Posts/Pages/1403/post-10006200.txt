True but I don’t actually deal in mythology, the true context is too wide, about 50,000 years too wide, I deal in linguistics. I am actually a ‘analyst’ and behaviour can be mapped, and understood, patterns exit, people are complacent. If it’s an ‘intentional’ puzzle there is an intentional ‘key’.

Unless there isn’t.
As someone who studied pre-Akkadian era cultures and can agree its all far to wide and far to open for interpretation, I believe the format that has been laid is such that you can not recognise the meaning within something truly until you have context for it. Like the room of acquirement in HarryPotter you must know something before being able to see it, they really were quite on the nose with it and tried circling people back to it numerous times but the well of reasoned science and critical debate had been quashed in favour of appeasing the chorus of well intentioned but ill informed.
