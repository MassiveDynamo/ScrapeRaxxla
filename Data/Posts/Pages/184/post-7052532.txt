Sorry to go back to comments a number of pages back, but I don't forum every day.

But if it is not a jumpable destination in its own right it could be a part of an extant system and might therefore be named/numbered in accordance with that systemâ€™s makeup (or it could be named entirely differently). The only distinguishing thing would then be that its orbit might well be highly inclined to the ecliptic since it would not have formed from the spinning dust disc that formed everything else there.
Your thoughts on rogues matched mine. As there doesn't seem to be a way to jump to "dark systems", I spent time looking at likely inclined planets: like Shinrarta Dezhra B3 (off star LTT 4550) which is perpendicular to the plane.

(it's centered-ish as I was recording the logs)

As a gas giant, surely this could not be formed naturally, and has to be captured / ex-rogue?

I've basically stopped playing at the mo, but hopefully the Q4 update sparks my interest again, in which case i'll definitely be doing some more Rax hunting
