For the record, here's what I think about Raxxla's actual state in the game today. It's quite dull and does not sit well with tinfoiling around the galaxy chasing rumours (which I love to do and shall continue) so I'll spoiler it so, once I've got it off my chest, we can all pretend it's not there.

I told you it was dull. Now close the spoiler and let's never speak of this again.
