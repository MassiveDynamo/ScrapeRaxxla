Now for those interested in digging into lore:

Years 2545 and 2589 might be interesting. Possibly inspired the 'Oolite Raxxla'.

Well 2545 is a reference to the original 8 bit game's Galactic Hyperdrive and the 2589 reference is retconning the 8 galaxies you could go to in the OG game to different locations in ED's Milky Way.
