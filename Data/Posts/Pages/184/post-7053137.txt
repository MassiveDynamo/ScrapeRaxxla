Imho, Raxxla is in ED (What a silly question! Of course!) but the journey everyone must take for himself (AKA E/F missions, the part a tiny bit obvious) no more.
I bet MB was the one who was personally in charge of this Quest, and as long as he isn't back, the Quest is on standby. He was the story teller.
What could be the story ? Well...would be interesting to read the tinfoilings of our excellent fellow-threaders
