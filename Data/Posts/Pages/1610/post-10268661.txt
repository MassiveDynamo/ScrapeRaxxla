A place that is not a place, a door that is also the key
Been thinking back to this again and im still of the opinion that its Witch-space, its not really there and is a connection.
If Raxxla is hidden in game then something must trigger 'the door' at a certain place and maybe carrying a certain item.
Maybe you have to do something like Jumping from SOL, carrying Trinkets in a Cobra Mk3 with a triple Elite logo on the front whilst playing Europe's 'Final Countdown'?
Yeah that didn't work btw.
