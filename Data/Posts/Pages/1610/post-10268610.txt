If this is accurate, then it means Raxxla (and whatever it contains) is very unlikely to be anything complex in terms of assets or function.
The (implicit) requirement to be implemented with 1.0 capabilities narrows that down as well.

Complexity might well come in through breaking it up into multiple "components" such that you can't just do a search on Frontier's internal database for anything labelled Raxxla - it won't appear in those terms.
