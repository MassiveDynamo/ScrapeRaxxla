Been thinking back to this again and im still of the opinion that its Witch-space, its not really there and is a connection.
The second part of the Toast also points towitch-space:
"To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!"

I still don't feel like I've heard of a convincing idea for what this might mean - other than there are whispers in witch-space - why mention them??

I suppose someone has already attempted to listen for whispers and see if there's any differences in the audio across different parts of space? I hope someone has!
