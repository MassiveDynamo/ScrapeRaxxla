Couple of quick things (unrelated to each other):

1) In his tribute stream to Brookes, Drew Wagar said that - as far as he knows - Only Brookes and Braben know/knew where/what Raxxla is, apparently it's a very closely guarded secret at Fdev.

If this is accurate, then it means Raxxla (and whatever it contains) is very unlikely to be anything complex in terms of assets or function. The more complex it is, the more people will need to be involved or at least know about it. Presumably the secret has been passed down to whoever took over from Brookes, etc. This also explains why there's been no leaks all these years.

2) Going through Galnet looking for references to anything from the Raxxla Codex:

Sol is the jewel in the brow of the mother of galaxies, maybe.
