I still worry if Raxxla is broken.

What if the Trinkets are the key, are they redundant, are they now nothing more than a curiosity, worse still are they the reason no one’s found Raxxla, are they broken?

To advertise an element (Raxxla) but not to advocate any method towards finding it, would only logically indicate there is no mechanism; that instead it only needs to be found, or it’s narrative?

I think by now we’ve established enough evidence (namely the extensive architecture, the multiple references, and FD honourable memorial) to substantiate that it (Raxxla) is certainly in game currently.

But what else could the suspected ‘Children’s Story’ be except the obvious ‘Elite Legacy’ and what else could that book allude to, if not simply ‘go to Artemis’ and / or the Trinkets? We then have the Brookes Galactic Tours, which likewise re-references that system and those trinkets!

What else is there about the system Artemis, could Legacy teach us - if Trinkets were now redundant?
