Rochester, your mention of altars makes me think of the Dais system, which lies below the Lost Realms and below the mountain-related locations of Elysia, Wakea and Ys (moons and planets in those systems named after mountains).
I have been to that system but maybe not at the right time, or carrying the right things, perhaps.

Also, from selbie's above quote about Hecate, Terra Mater Blood Bores are starting to look awfully juicy (and they are only available in the permit-locked Terra Mater).
