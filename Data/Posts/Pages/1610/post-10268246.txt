Can’t recall if I posted this before, but again I was trying to reconcile why the system Artemis was utilised in Brookes Elite Legacy, if it were an intentional reference to Raxxla, of course it might not.

Eve as Artemis

Brookes alluded to his tattoo as being heavily inspired by Paradise lost; so the figures around the tree ought to be Adam and Eve, but they obviously aren’t…they have weapons, and seem to be dressed in Greek classical attire?

The following passage analysis of Paradise Lost identifies Eve probably represents Artemis…

Milton repeatedly alludes to classic, pre-biblical mythology - to the biblical characters themselves, to make cohesive connections in simile, storytelling, syntax, and wordplay.

‘Thus saying, from her husband’s hand her hand. Soft she withdrew, and like a wood nymph light. Oread or Dryad, or of Delia’s train. Betook her to the groves, but Delia’s self. In gait surpassed and goddess-like deport. Though not as she with bow and quiver armed’.

Still unsure why, but one hypothesis might be this goes back to my assumption that Brookes wrote his ‘unpublished’ book, but wide upon the galaxy.

And that his tattoo image, originally intended for the book, is likewise a map to Raxxla. If so does the system Artemis represent Eve by the tree of knowledge, in game this might equate to Artemis being next to the Yggdrasil system tree? If so which other figure may represent Adam?

Although I still wonder why, and perhaps this reference is far too wide to make sense, but still I wonder…
