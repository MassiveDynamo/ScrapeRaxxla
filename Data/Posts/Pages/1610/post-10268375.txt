The trouble is that we have no hint as to the mechanism to access Raxxla. Do we just fly through the Omphalos Rift? How do we know we've found the Rift-is it visible? Do we have to have an Omphalos ful of salt and a stick of celery??

Is the Omphalos one (any??) of the Guardian beacons? - - - has anyone tried a visible match of the beacons against the logo? Has anyone tried to fly into one? Tried to put an Ancient Key back into one?

Itâ€™s not that dificult. You find Raxxla. You shot the omphalos with a laser. It activates the rift. You go in.
