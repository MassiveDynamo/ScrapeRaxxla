So unless I've missed someone else's analysis in my searches of the Landscape Signal - one small, tiny little detail seems to have been overlooked...

The Landscape Signal could be from a Living, Breathing Entity!!

Landscape Breath Audio (you will have to unmute the video player)
In this recording the original signal audio duration has been compressed by 3x, and notch filtering has been applied to remove the musical humming ( ie. the strong horizontal lines seen in the original spectrographic image below). This leaves the vertical bars - the last two of which are much stronger, and align with the 'landscape' shapes.



This means the search could involve finding a stasis pod / life raft / derelict vessel floating somewhere in the void.
It also raises many questions like what lifeform is it coming from? An escaped Guardian from the ancient civil war? A human explorer from the Quirium Drive era? A sound designer with a cheeky sense of humour? Are the 'mountain' lines perhaps related to the atomic composition of the entity's breathing?

For the technical aspects of this audio and the image:
Audio below 200Hz was cropped out to remove the deep humming sound - using the Spectral Delete tool.
The frequencies removed with the notch filtering were - 875Hz, 1167Hz, 1401Hz, 1765Hz, 2350Hz, 2788Hz, 3282Hz, 3546Hz, 4676Hz
The spectrographic image above was generated using Audacity - with the following spectrogram view settings:
SPOILER: SETTINGS WINDOW
SPOILER: VIEW WITHIN AUDACITY
The left and right channel images were then overlaid with each other and the top image had a Lighten layer blending filter applied to help 'merge' the images.
