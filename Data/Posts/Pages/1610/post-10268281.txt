The lateral movement behind cold orbiting shows that even pilots are subject to carcinisation.

I spent a long time looking in both Hecate and Terra Mater, with & without Trinkets in the ship's hold. But I didn't try with Guardian Ancient Keys...what you say makes sense so might be worth someone trying! I'm still enjoying Starfield...

still got to find a power, kill the terrormorphs, destroy the Va'ruun battleship, investigate the distress call in Charybdis, locate the missing galbank treasure ship, provide evidence against the Crimson Fleet pirates, and find the last couple of artefacts.
The Mission in Charybdis is a very amusing part of the game, and the final stretch of the Crimson Fleet questline (exploring the Legacy and later picking a side on the final conflict) is simply glorious.

Also: the UC Vanguard plot's climax happens in Londinion in Toliman, AKA Alpha Centauri B... which makes me sad upon realizing that Proxima Centauri is not represented in Starfield at all.

He put Eden at the end of a long journey in Alpha Centauri...but perhaps something needs to be done to open the portal?
Calling it: the Omphalos Rift is a Hutton mug. Or maybe the Anaconda we earn by getting there.
