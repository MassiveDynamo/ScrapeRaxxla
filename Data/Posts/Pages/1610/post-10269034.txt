Are any hunters near the center of the galaxy right now? If yes, please check the lowest point of the galaxy. Judging by the map, there is a cluster of neutron stars, but there is an obstacle due to the distance. If it is possible to use a neutron star to enhance the jump and then return back in the same way. Very suspicious place, needs to be explored
Got a system name?
