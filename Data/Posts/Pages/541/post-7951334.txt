Tin foil hat time...
Welcome to the thread, Cmdr. ( Don't worry about your English, I already got our excellent fellow-threaders used to make an effort to understand my own pidgin English. )
Imho, each of the verses of the toast directly describes Raxxla through images.
We hear the song/whisper of Raxxla everytime we use witch space. (I suspect that somewhere in the MW, its song must be more intelligible/ decode-able, sonogram.)
Raxxla sits inside witch space, which, by the way, is the deepest possible void.
The icon represents the six bridges, jump paths, that lead to Raxxla, along its singing (curved lines) and the dashes which are its natural obfuscation because of sitting in witch space.
Or, Raxxla sits in normal space but "sings" through witch space and is reachable through six specific jumps, where its song is louder/understandable.
Imho.

Or, Raxxla may be in the Formidine Rift (my current hypohosis) or it might be in the bubble, or it might not be.
It might be a moon, a planet, an astroid or a generation ship.
We might be able to discover it straight away, or we may need to be Elite, or we might need the Dark Wheel to help us, which would involve them inviting us to join them, or finding their dark station.
We might need to decode a cipher, or not. We have some clues in the codex but they might not really be clues
We might need to brush up on our Greek mythology to understand the clues (if they are clues) or the clues might point us to the club.
We might need to follow a path around the old worlds, or we might find it obfuscated in the outer rim.
What we know for sure is that it is a definite place, in the Milky Way.
Welcome to the thread and happy hunting!
