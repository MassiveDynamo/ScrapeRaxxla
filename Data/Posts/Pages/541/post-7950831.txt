A couple of tidbits from David.

The docking bay entrance (in the original game) was deliberately put on the planet facing side to avoid having to render the docking bay and the planet at the same time - framerate issues.

And Raxxla...?

Well - "It exists, we know where it is and we know why people haven't been able to find it..."

Cheers,

Drew.

The day I met David Braben.
Wasn't quite sure where to put this, it's not really about the fiction and I thought all fans might enjoy it. Yesterday I ticked a significant item off of my 'bucket list' and, well, here it is. http://www.drewwagar.com/progress-report/the-day-i-met-david-braben/ Cheers, Drew.

so that's where that comes from.

Yes its the same conversation, make of that what you will. Either way the consistent message is its in the game.
