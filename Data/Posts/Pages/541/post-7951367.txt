The AI Pilgrim ? Could that " lost AI " actually be The Caretakers ?



Mmmh.. Raxxla features, as well as anything else ingame, could very well be evolving as the game mechanics evolve. I hope so !
I've always said there is a fair chance that the Caretakers / Architects are descendants of the lost Constructs(Guardian AI).
They could of course also be the builders of Raxxla. They already have a fully operational 'alternative universe' going, in the monolith network.
