Random thought for the day...

DB once said (paraphrasing): Nebulae are good places to find [things?].

So, looking at the Witch Head Nebula, cos I been doing short run repairs to stations which are outside the nebula and getting hyperdicted while jumping near or through it. We can't jump into it due to a lack of stars within it, so is the Thargoid FSD technology able to plot a jump into empty space without a target?

Why is this important? Well, more paraphrasing, didn't someone suspect The Club somehow controls where we can go due to permit locks? Is that controlled in layers, ie by The Pilot's Federation, their clandestine arm, The Dark Wheel, and above them pulling the strings are The Club board of directors?

How does Raxxla fit? Well, if it's a 'gateway', could it not be a means to circumvent the permit lock system entirely, thereby removing a powerful asset, and layer of defensive shielding from control of The Club if they have the system they, and Raxxla inhabit behind a covert 'invitation only' permit lock paywall?

If The Club really do have a galaxy wide influence is it possible they funded an AEGIS / INRA project that either found and exploited Raxxla or reverse engineered Thargoid drive tech secrets some time ago? Could the discovery of one lead to the other and is this what makes it possible to find rogue planets?

We can only jump via primary stars and there's no way to 'mis-jump'. Why?

[Edit: Hidden in plain sight: ALL empty space between the stars is 'off-limits'.]
[Edit, edit: By that reasoning the loading screen between systems is Raxxla.]
[Edit, edit, edit: Witch[space]'s Reach is only 33.25 Ly from Sol, and locked?]
