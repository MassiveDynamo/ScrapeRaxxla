Hello, CMDRs. Got to active RAXXIA 2 days ago since my english is not native ...
So google random showed me some reddit about "Cassiopea & Andromeda" and...I got a mindflash...started "stellarium" ...
And look on it "To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!":



I swapped back to elite, yeh! It has special name which stellarium do not know "Ao Cassiopeiae".
From here I started urgent 30000ly jump back to bubble ...and had time to think.

Let's read more: "To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!"
Initially I thought it is Rigel ...but, read some more wiki, and we have the winner "69 Lambda Eridani". In the name of this star there is a whole class of variadic stars with less then 24hrs period. I guess it must be wisper if you use radio-telescope.

And last one "The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts." - it seems like definition of word "traveler" for me. And the star of them is ..."Polaris" (actually can be another too in sourthern part of Earth).

Now I (we) have 3 stars and 1 is locked, which gives 2 hints:
1. Somebody do not want we know exact coordinates of Polaris since edsm shows it has errors there ...
2. It is tip we don't have to visit those stars.

And now, last 36 hrs I'm trying to figure what I can calculate from those 3 stars ...something like "the center of outer circle around triangle", "of inner circle" etc. etc. But it goes slow since I completely forgot school math.

P.S. Sorry if you already discussed that all on 500 pages before
P.P.S. "NGC 752 Sector HR-V d2-3" is ALMOST in center, i.e. has distances 1270.25; 1273.93; 1284.56 -- best i could figure yet.
