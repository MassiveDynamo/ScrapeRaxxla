I'm sorry to see this thread dissolving into bitterness. There's a strong feeling of frustration, which is understandable, but complaining about what FD May or may not have done is no answer.

We need to rediscover our sense of Fernweh and go back to scratch and examine where this puzzle has taken us.

There are still unexplored things in this game. 10% of tourist beacons remain undiscovered , several in the lore number spans, for instance, showing there is stuff yet to be discovered.

We've covered many possibilities, but even in the last 20 pages there have been interesting new avenues.

Let's get back to work!

I'm not bitter (well, no more bitter than I was yesterday) since I'd given up on GalNet a long time ago.

I'm also inferring from the fact that FDev has confirmed that GalNet fluff is just fluff, but said nothing about other mysteries, that those other mysteries are still in play. Finally, it's confirmation that FDev do at least pay some attention to non-pew-pew players, since they did (eventually) realize that they were sending some of us off running around on wild goose chases.

All-in-all, I'd call it a day to be optimistic.
