A new experience and not a mis-jump per se.

As I was hyper jumping to escape a Thargoid Interceptor in the Witch Head area, I was hit by the it's disruption field but still made the jump. As I arrived in the new system, my ship went offline seemingly permanent. I re-logged to get the ship online again. Never tried that before.
So do you have a theory?
