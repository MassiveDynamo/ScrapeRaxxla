Hello, CMDRs. Got to active RAXXIA 2 days ago since my english is not native ...
...snip..
Tin foil hat time...
Welcome to the thread, Cmdr. ( Don't worry about your English, I already got our excellent fellow-threaders used to make an effort to understand my own pidgin English. )
Imho, each of the verses of the toast directly describes Raxxla through images.
We hear the song/whisper of Raxxla everytime we use witch space. (I suspect that somewhere in the MW, its song must be more intelligible/ decode-able, sonogram.)
Raxxla sits inside witch space, which, by the way, is the deepest possible void.
The icon represents the six bridges, jump paths, that lead to Raxxla, along its singing (curved lines) and the dashes which are its natural obfuscation because of sitting in witch space.
Or, Raxxla sits in normal space but "sings" through witch space and is reachable through six (three ?) specific jumps, where its song is louder/understandable.
Imho.
