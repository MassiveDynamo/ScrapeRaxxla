Anybody checked out “scifi” sector? sorry SIFI sector! https://cim.sotl.org.uk/elite-dangerous/

Might be a good place to locate novel items!
I'm out there all the time. It's a big sector in the middle of Cygnus.
Both Sadr and Star of India are inside the sector. Deneb is just outside.

Sifi is where the bridge is.
