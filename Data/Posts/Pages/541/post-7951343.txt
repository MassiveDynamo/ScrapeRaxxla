Or, Raxxla may be in the Formidine Rift (my current hypohosis) or it might be in the bubble, or it might not be.
It might be a moon, a planet, an astroid or a generation ship.
We might be able to discover it straight away, or we may need to be Elite, or we might need the Dark Wheel to help us, which would involve them inviting us to join them, or finding their dark station.
We might need to decode a cipher, or not. We have some clues in the codex but they might not really be clues
We might need to brush up on our Greek mythology to understand the clues (if they are clues) or the clues might point us to the club.
We might need to follow a path around the old worlds, or we might find it obfuscated in the outer rim.
What we know for sure is that it is a definite place, in the Milky Way.
Welcome to the thread and happy hunting!
