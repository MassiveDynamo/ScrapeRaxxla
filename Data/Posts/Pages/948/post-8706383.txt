Sorry, but it was never between Reorte and Riedquat. It's from Drew Wagars novel and there its described that you draw a straight line from Reorte through Riedquat and then keep going to "the edge of the galactic arm". On his lore toure Drew said that he considered the gap between the Heart and the Soul Nebual to be the "door" to the Formidine Rift.
Of cource

The Rift between Reorte and Riedquat was just a small anecdote in one of the other authors book.
It was probably due to missunderstanding Drewâ€™s info.
