That JH quote sounds a lot like the Rebecca speech which I thought was an homage to Blade Runner and Hauer's character when he saves Ford. Sounds like the idea was around for a bit before, possibly on the writers forum, or 2 people had the same idea independently. But JH is the only one that maybe links it to the Rift, if its not a completely separate statement divided by a comma. Interesting.

There was a comment on the Lore Tour about the PS being a young nebula and therefore had more 'energy' iirc and unspecified what that energy was (radiation of some type presumably but could be others?) and this is why the Thargs maybe came from there or had used it as forward base, because of the availability of that energy. I can speculate what that may mean and would fit in with moving Thargs from FR if that was ever the idea.

Re Confusion between authors - it does seem like the game was written over the books and where things arent the same or just arent there its that the game didnt behave as intended after the authors were given info to include or asked for something to be included. And some are just plain bugs. But the game is the finished version of whats 'there' and what isnt and doesnt look like any of it is getting updated to be 'correct' so the books will always seem wrong.
