Sorry, but it was never between Reorte and Riedquat. It's from Drew Wagars novel and there its described that you draw a straight line from Reorte through Riedquat and then keep going to "the edge of the galactic arm". On his lore toure Drew said that he considered the gap between the Heart and the Soul Nebual to be the "door" to the Formidine Rift.

Oh yes it was! Han_Zen knows his lore, even though most of it has been retconned.
Formidine Rift was mentioned by at least three of the Elite authors, Drew Wagar, Allen Stroud and John Harper. Which indicates it was a thing defined by FD and was in the “authors’ pack” which they all received, but clearly FD hadn’t explicitly defined at that time where it was.

Allen Stroud “Elite: Lave Revolution” ch 17
“Traffic from Reorte is constant,’ Cassom said, manipulating the view to focus on Lave. ‘This appears to be the main trade route. Import/export from Orrere tends to be sporadic and mostly illegal. Reorte to Riedquat is another used trade lane, but local pilots talk about problems in the Formidine Rift; something to do with an unchartable area of space and ships going missing.”
