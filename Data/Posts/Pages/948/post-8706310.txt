I think there was a misunderstanding between some authors on the Formidine Rift. If I remember correctly, on book character places the Formidine Rift between Reorte and Riedquat.

Sorry, but it was never between Reorte and Riedquat. It's from Drew Wagars novel and there its described that you draw a straight line from Reorte through Riedquat and then keep going to "the edge of the galactic arm". On his lore toure Drew said that he considered the gap between the Heart and the Soul Nebual to be the "door" to the Formidine Rift.
