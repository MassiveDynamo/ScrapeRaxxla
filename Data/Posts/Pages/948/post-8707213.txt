So I've been out of the loop for awhile....but I was just thinking, with the new Odyssey update they said that they're not focusing on ship interior but on station interiors. Maybe they are focused on stations because the interior of The Dark Wheel station will be one of the bigger discoveries, not sure if I am making sense because its 4am for me....but was just a thought
