I think there is at least a generation or three between Liz and Jason.

From "And Here The Wheel" we have Oberon and Neptune Ryder ,
SPOILER: BUT ALSO..

Liz's heritage is in doubt too.

AHTW time line is just before 3300, but Soontil Relics were known to CIEP well before that by implication.

No Zetters in the game whatsoever that I can find..

btw, the only Charybdis in game I could find is a Capital Ship LLV Charybdis - flagship of the Imperial fleet.. I expect its quite busy atm
