The thread (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/fdev-ed-relevant-quotes-videos.553526/#post-8671776) I started is for any vid (or other official source or original rumour reference) related to E D mysteries. Please post Twitch or YT vid links or anything else there, but strip off the preceding “https:\\” so the link is embedded without all the graphical stuff that this forum software imposes and which makes page refresh problematic. The link can still be clicked and it will open up the reference.

@Macros- perhaps a link to that thread in the op of this?

I suspect Jameson’s wreck was placed early when (I suspect) the Thargoids threat was due to “come across the Formidine Rift” ( early, now retconned so no longer canon, book reference) & presumably from Bovomit. It’s location could make sense in that context.

I think there was a misunderstanding between some authors on the Formidine Rift. If I remember correctly, on book character places the Formidine Rift between Reorte and Riedquat.

When it comes to the direction Thargoids came from, ED is at least relatively consistent with FFE. The Pleiades is still a forward Thargiod position and COL 70 sector fy-n c21-3 fits relatively well with Miackce (go to Pleiades, turn a bit left and go to 1000 ly from earth).

It's always difficult to compare positions to FFE / FE2. The Galaxy in those games were extremely flattened and the import of real stars were done wrong. All real stars have galactic east and west swapped. This is probably the reason for the Old Worlds jumping to the other side the bubble, as well.
