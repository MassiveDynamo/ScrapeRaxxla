He mentions rewards for CG’s and says there will be rewards other than monetary rewards but can’t say what they are. But that CG’s are connected to the wider narrative over the next 2 years and that some rewards include “invitations to certain things and permits” but can’t say where to or what for.

iirc they said that in response to a Q and the permits bit was part of the question and they mixed permits in with the answer. My IRL response at the time was 'They need to have a standard answer for these things to avoid confusion, something like Thats a good question, but Im not going to answer it / wont answer / cant answer' As long as its the same answer it would avoid misinterpretation or placing emphasis on certain words or things a la Gan Romero style or the SB incident
