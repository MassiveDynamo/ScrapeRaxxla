Watching the last FDEV stream waiting for the CG to start. He mentions rewards for CG’s and says there will be rewards other than monetary rewards but can’t say what they are. But that CG’s are connected to the wider narrative over the next 2 years and that some rewards include “invitations to certain things and permits” but can’t say where to or what for.
