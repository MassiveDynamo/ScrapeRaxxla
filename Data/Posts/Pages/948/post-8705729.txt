Yes, though having Thargoids coming across the FRift from Bovomit would also explain that graveyard area of damaged ships and their beacon messages. I think it highlighted a certain problem with FDevs
/designers/authors not talking to each other & unawares of the extant lore. It was around that time all the lore seemed to be retconned. Not surprising since FD would likely have tried to maintain Chinese Walls on significant gameplay design details amongst themselves as well as the authors.
