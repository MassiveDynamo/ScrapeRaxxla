Thinking more about Ram Tah past couple days. I’m not sure his missions are related to raxxla. TDW is the better bet for info imo. If Raxxla is meant to be a mystery for all players that means that includes those without Horizons. Which means they don’t have access to engineers or the ability to search guardian sites since they don’t have planetary landing either. They can land stations tho, like TDW station.
