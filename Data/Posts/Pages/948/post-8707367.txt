New (?) left field idea. (inspired by last night's Frontier live stream)

Arthur stated (and it's never been hidden, but I don't think so openly acknowledged either) that "having a dev account I can move the ship where I need to be" (

time 29:45).

Is Raxxla this ability? To be able to go to wherever in the Galaxy you need / want to be? I think this might be the best 'superpower' in the game we could wish for.

Still doesn't help answer how we get it / where we find it, but intriguing to think about.

No, I don't think so. What you say implies to me at least that if a player (not a dev or CM) would gain access to FDev testing area's and have access to as yet unreleased content being tested. Why would FDev hint at such an ability being in game and accessible and then never ever letting the player get it. Good theory, but I don't think so.
