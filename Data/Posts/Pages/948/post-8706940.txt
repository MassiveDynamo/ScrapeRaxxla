I've been doing the paper-trail stuff, to try and hem in the search radius.
So there are 3 mysteries Raxxla, Soontill and the Dark Wheel station. Apparently we will know it's the real Dark-Wheel station because they have ancient artefacts we can walk around and investigate.......sounds like DarkWheel station will have to wait until space-legs........wait, are space-stations like the Dark-Wheel also walkable in odyssey?

Elite ( the first game) sort of takes place in the Elite Dangerous world in 32nd century 3100 sees the Pilots federation give Jameson the first title of Elite.

Soontill is a planet full of thargoid stuff -> thargoids don't come into the picture until 2849

Offical contact is made with the thargoids in 3125 with the for-runner of the Alliance, the Galactic Cooperative (galcorp) who basically goes to war with the thargoids, spearheads inra.
They reverse engineer their tech, and build a Quirium based hyperdrive, allowing humans to jump to other galaxies.

2696 - Galcorp was based on the old words, the first set of truly independent colonies (who could cut ties away from Federal and Imperial and create their own super-power)
these worlds were Lave, Leesti, Diso, Zoance, Reorte, Quator, Reidquat, Tionisla, Uszaa.
Those colonies were founded between 2412 -> 2422

Whereas the soontill relics sold in Ngurri are crystal-based and don't appear to be of Thargoid tech (possibly a teaser for the guardians).
Ngurri does NOT fall into the location of Soontil, which is a planet hidden in a debris field of a Brown Dwarf 2AU 998ls, according to "And here the wheel" by John Harper.
where the circle(?) would launch its attacks on Delta Pheonicis from Grandmort via Broman and then Lanaest and THE PLANETOID Soontill was on that flight-path.


So where does this leave raxxla? A couple of centuries earlier. The earliest mention is 2296 in a journal from Tau Ceti.
By the start of 2100 after the creation of "The federation" in the nuclear ashes of WW3, the colonisation of the moon and mars was well underway, as well as the launch of the generation ships.
Mankind does nothing until Qin Jao invents the hyperdrive (no real date is given) but the first probes based on this tech 2151 come back from Tau Ceti.
2151 Tau Ceti discovered and starts being colonized.
2190 Colonies in Delta Pavonis (20ly), Altair(16ly) are established.
2230 Colony in Beta Hydri (24 lys)
2280 Martian Relic found on Mars, the feds hush it up and whisk it away. (if it was 2080 it would have been cooler as it would have hinted that the hyperdrive could have been based off this thing)
2288 Eotienses begins to be Colonized. ( 115 ly from Sol) This is also Denton Patreus home-system, which establishes a colony in 2312 with a terraformed planet (planetfall) and they sign up to the empire in 2314 )
2292 the republic of Achenar is declared (140 ly from Sol)
2296 the pacifist Marlin Duval who wanted to protect the native INTELLIGENT SPECIES of Achenar 6d gets killed by her brother who forms the Empire as we know today, and he wipes out that species as well.
oh, and also in the same year, some space journal mentions someplace called Raxxla

Now I remember BrabeN saying that the imperials tried to get as far away from the Feds as possible and as quickly as they could, and built inwards back towards Federation space.
The core-systems are (according to the wiki) a sphere of a radius150lys of Sol, this tallies that Achenar was on the fringe of humanities knowledge of the bubble by Raxxla's mention.
That being said it's not an even 150ly radius from Sol, because the "old-worlds" of Lave, Leesti and Diso, but they didn't get discovered until 2412-2422 More than a century later, and they were 115ly away, mankind was not exactly colonizing with the same speed and in all directions.
Sooo.
ignoring the long dash of the imperials and we stick to the Tau Ceti and the federation.
2412 (founding of Lave) - 2151 (founding of Tau Ceti) give us 261 years to play with.
and with 115ly the feds were colonising half a light-year per year(?)
2296 (first mention of Raxxla) - 2151 (founding of Tau Ceti ) gives us 145 years to play with, and going off the half a light year colonizing speed.
The feds had stretched out roughly 75ly from Sol.

So going back to listening for mysterious whispers in witchspace, or looking out for a squiggly green star ( which I spotted near Helios once) on that "odyssey"
I dusted off my old bookmarks from previously in the year...or was it last year? They appear to be incomplete going off my numbering scheme.

OD01 - The planet Trojan in Eta Cassiopeiae (20 ly to Sol) : Curiously enough we also have a planet called ROCK and another called BETWEEN. The stone at delphi was at the center, the middle - one might say in-between something.

and my next entry is
OD04 - Scythia, the cyclops. (169 ly from Sol outside the core-words and well outside the 75ly prediction of the feds colonization)
Goodbye EDDB
Goodbye EDDB

OD05 Aoelus (65ly from Sol)
Goodbye EDDB

(another gap?)
OD07 Circe - The nymfs (47ly from Sol)

Ah and here I have that issue of Most names in ancient myths and stories have a star named after them
So at joint OD08
OD08 Hecate The underworld - 75ly from sol
Goodbye EDDB
Goodbye EDDB

OD08 Perspherone - underworld (110 ly from Sol)
Goodbye EDDB

oh and try to forget that cutey 3 head dog Cerebus guarding the underworld, that's Hercules and not Odysseus...which like the River Styxx (45 ly from Sol)
https://eddb.io/system/17170 is also another greek myth but is outside of Homers Odyssey (I'm not 100% sure of that though not having READ the damned thing)
I Think this is when I stopped charting this thing, and started listening to Stephen fry's heroes....omg...it really was 2 years ago I made this list.

OD08 Thanatos (deaths door) (also 110ly from sol)
Goodbye EDDB

OD09 Siren (82ly from Sol)

OD10 Scylla (82ly from sol) big monster on land, and the whirlpool in the sea (having to navigate through the middle)

Finally coming home to
OD14 Ithaca ( 46 ly from sol )

So it's incomplete and my understanding of Homers work is rusty at best. I must have made notes in a google doc somewhere that explained my logic to myself somewhere,

Oh and just to really mess with everyone.
the brothers Neptune Ryder and Oberon Ryder, can be found referenced in Sol System, The planet Neptune and Uranus's moon Oberon.
The half-way point between those two bodies(?) well can't be neptuns moon triton can it? although hiding behind that permit lock would explain raxxla still being undiscovered.
Oh and Perspherone is the name of a small planetoid orbiting the Sun and of course there has to be installation called Delphi Control Chapter.
