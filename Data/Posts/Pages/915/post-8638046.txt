Or we just say, "thanks!" Usher him over to a door that leads to an ordinary parking lot, in a thriving outside world and send him on his way with a lollipop. Huge "what the- ?" Moment...except we're in pandamic times, so maybe the world isn't exactly thriving, but within spec of the "new norm."

...oh and if we find out the bit about it being an inner journey and that RAXXLA was always there(with us)? No lollipop.
No! He could still have the lollipop....[error decrypting message]....sideways! ;-)
