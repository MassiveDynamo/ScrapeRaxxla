I was also thinking about the phrase about the door thatâ€™s also the key. What if it means that the door is the key to finding what we seek, we just have to figure out how to open it.
after we find out what the door is of coarse

Yeah I actually dwell on that one too. It lead me to a lot of experimenting, like following Thargoids into their own wormhole with a Thargoid heart and sensor, probe, and link. Thereby making Thargoids both the door and key, by making their systems think I'm part of their ship...no dice on that experiment. I also did some experimenting with literal Ancient Keys lol.

I feel, right now, that key is our own FSD. We need Metadrive modifications and there are undiscovered engineers yet in the game. The key to them, I feel, is getting the Dark Wheel into specific permit systems and having exclusive access to these off-grid engineers.
