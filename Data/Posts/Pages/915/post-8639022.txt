Makes me think about something i've noticed while decorating my ships recently, which probably means nothing at all: while FDev have named the Trader Elite decal "Elite Trader", the Explorer Elite decal is simply named "Elite", as if it was the one that mattered when talking about Elite cmdrs. I'm only Expert in combat so can't see what the Combat Elite one is named.

I'll take a look. I've been Deadly in combat for about 2 years lol. Combat has never been a real money maker and I think there is stock in the reasoning for that. Maybe it is as you suggest. It is a trade sim after all. In the early days it was easier to climb elite ranks... then it took a severe nerf, at some point. People were hitting triple elite way too fast. Trade was my first Elite, as back in late 2014 cargo missions were the only real money makers. My next was exploration. One trip to the core and another to Colonia was enough for Elite...but I was even late for that. Many were getting elites just after one trip to the core, or Colonia. The combat is largely my fault. I spawned in my fist Sidewinder and couldn't hit sh**. Didn't realize there were gimbals so never bothered to do combat after my first few deaths. Just stuck to what I knew. Didn't really start to engage in combat till about a year later.
