Get your tin foil out....Carter's got a theory....

I have always though of the toast as a pirate treasure map to Raxxla, but what if it is a shopping list for how to impress TDW and get an invite?

Jewel that burns brightest - Ngadandari fire opal
Parents greif/lovers woe - black box? Personal effects?
Whispers/sirens - thargoid heart
Vagabond heart - anyone got any ideas on this one?
To Raxxla - we have to find Raxxla? Or bring them all that and they will help us find Raxxla?

Vagabond heart - hopefully something you steal, to complete the theory.

Ideas/elaboration welcome
