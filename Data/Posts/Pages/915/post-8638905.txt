Get your tin foil out....Carter's got a theory....

I have always though of the toast as a pirate treasure map to Raxxla, but what if it is a shopping list for how to impress TDW and get an invite?

Jewel that burns brightest - Ngadandari fire opal
Parents greif/lovers woe - black box? Personal effects?
Whispers/sirens - thargoid heart
Vagabond heart - anyone got any ideas on this one?
To Raxxla - we have to find Raxxla? Or bring them all that and they will help us find Raxxla?

Vagabond heart - hopefully something you steal, to complete the theory.

Ideas/elaboration welcome

I always related Vagabond as something tying in to Norse, since the mentioning of Sirens too. But this is also because of a popular Raxxla quote. The day Michael Brookes said that bit about the journey he was wearing an Yggdrasil tree shirt.

Odin was a Vagabond. There is a system called Odin's Wisdom and a region called Odin's Hold. Could be either a very specific or general heading. I doubt it would be as easy as the system.

Do you suppose any if the old Trinkets or Sap 8 cores play in anywhere? It's kind of weird those just suddenly became irrelevant. Trinkets are super rare too.
