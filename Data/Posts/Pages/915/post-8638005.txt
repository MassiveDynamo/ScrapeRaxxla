Anyone here used to watch the Mission: Impossible series? More than in the movies, they often had those episodes where they'd craft a whole prank just to trick the target into giving up information.

So here's the plan: we capture David Braben in his sleep, he wakes up in what looks like some post-apocalyptic underground bunker and is fed some phony story by a fellow cave dweller about how that's it, space aliens have attacked and Humanity has gone into hiding. As expected, he starts saying something to the tune of "Hey that's funny, i used to create stories with space aliens in them!". Slowly but surely, the team steers him into talking about that old story that will never see its conclusion, and in a cathartic moment he reveals what Raxxla was, where it was and how to reach it. As he turns to his interlocutor, he realizes he's now alone in the room. After a long hesitation he finally ventures past the "warning: radiation hazard beyond this point" door, and finally understands he was in some abandoned warehouse in the countryside. End credits.

I volunteer for being the guy with the cool mask-making briefcase.

Or we just say, "thanks!" Usher him over to a door that leads to an ordinary parking lot, in a thriving outside world and send him on his way with a lollipop. Huge "what the- ?" Moment...except we're in pandamic times, so maybe the world isn't exactly thriving, but within spec of the "new norm."

...oh and if we find out the bit about it being an inner journey and that RAXXLA was always there(with us)? No lollipop.
