Vagabond heart could be elite explorer of course?

Makes me think about something i've noticed while decorating my ships recently, which probably means nothing at all: while FDev have named the Trader Elite decal "Elite Trader", the Explorer Elite decal is simply named "Elite", as if it was the one that mattered when talking about Elite cmdrs. I'm only Expert in combat so can't see what the Combat Elite one is named.
