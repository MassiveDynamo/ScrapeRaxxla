Well yes, I see your point, but whispers/sirens would almost certainly be tharg, and I would suspect all the objects to be fairly unrelated, so you need to do different game aspects to get them
Vagabond heart could be elite explorer of course?
Hmm ....is any exact distance to get Elite? Maybe that should be read "go to the mention of whisper" (see Dynasty logs, 1 mention) by distance to get Elite?
