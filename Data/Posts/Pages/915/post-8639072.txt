Form Rift, alpha mission, text 5/6 - "lights calling me, siren song"
Anybody knows, was that event prior raxxla codex, after or same time? DIdn't play that time.
I think the alpha site was found mid 2017 and codex wasnt until beyond chapter4 update december 2018

But ya the wording is not just a coincidence.
