Just wanted to share an interesting finding (though i didn't find the system myself).
It's in Musca Dark Region PJ-P B6-1 planet 3, i went to Geological Survey 23B.
Then, i just wanted to get a close human system data - just because - and found this (look for asteroid base station, at line 3):

SPOILER: SYSTEM MAP


SPOILER: LEFT PANEL

SPOILER: ASTEROID BASE

So it seems that stations inside belt clusters are shown in system map (whatever the distance).
If TDW station is operating at low power, it could be hidden from the left panel but still present in any belt cluster, which is the perfect place to hide!
