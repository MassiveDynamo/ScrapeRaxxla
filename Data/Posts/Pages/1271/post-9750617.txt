Gotcha my apologies.
My apologies to you, too @Godreyfarris - I did not mean to set you up so!

I've been away from ED for a long time, and I'm just getting back into the 'tinfoil' side of things (Thargoids, Guardians, the Search for Raxxla, other mysteries!), and your post both piqued my interest and also sounded a faint alarm in the dark forgotten corners of my brain.

Seeing that twitter feed reminded me that there was once a poster who would spam threads such as this with exactly that stuff on twitter, bereft of any context, explanation or even hints.

It was maddening.

I see you only joined the forums recently - new to ED/the 'tinfoil mysteries' or an old hand de-lurking?

If you'll pardon my intrusion

And apologies again for making one of your first ED Forum interactions less than welcoming

Edit: More line breaks for clarity.
