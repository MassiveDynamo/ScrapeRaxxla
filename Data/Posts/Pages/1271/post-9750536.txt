You weird and sound paranoid I just want to say that.
They thought you were the Twitter account owner, and that person is well established to be unreliable (to be nice and keep it short)

It was mistaken identity and pure annoyance as the Twitter account owner has been sending imgs like that without proof or explanation for well over a year on FB and Twitter. It's quite annoying when you have no context, explanation, conversation, debate, with the person, and they just show up and post random imgs and say " hey look what I found", nothing more.... again, that's where you were mistaken for being them

Hope that clears this up, no one meant any disrespect to you intentionally
