Are we sure this Tharg rank thing is genuine. its not official is it?

but either way I dont see how returning stolen items, usually involving destruction or vandalism to Tharg or Tharg sites, is gonna rank up with them, that makes no sense. Scanning and not vandalising or killing should be what does it...and hope they dont count Scavengers coz we need them for Mats

According to a Cmdr (8th March) in IRH Discord (#general channel) he had a conversation with an FD contact on this topic and showed a pic of part of the conversation which does imply there is a hidden Thargoid rep meter which FD can monitor. The response was that FD narrative team could insert appropriate content to if there was significant response from the playerbase. So the mechanism is not hard-coded in-game. But it does confirm FD can monitor all sorts of things (e.g. the hidden PilotsFederaion rep counter for rescue missions & killing Thargoids, though that does seem to have some associated hard-coded behaviour).
