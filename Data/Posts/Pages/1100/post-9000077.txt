I'm sorry, the code has different objects and figures about confirming them. Are there people who have all these objects confirmed?
I've written above, and I want to still understand. For the Elite game is characterized by the fact that one minor faction can be in different parts of the living area ?
If there are no such factions in the game, except Sirius, then I have a hypothesis that their second name is the Dark Wheel.
