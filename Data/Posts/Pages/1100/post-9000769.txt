Sirius has many faction names all slightly different.
I'm not talking about the minor Siriuses, I'm talking about the Sirius Corporation.
Minor Faction Sirius Corporation - EDDB
Minor Faction Sirius Corporation in Elite: Dangerous
eddb.io
The corporation itself is 8 years from the Sun, and the farthest point is 516 years. Are there any other factions like this in the game?
Look at this organization, they are scattered around to control everything ?
And why did they disrupt the Sirius summit where the main goal was to increase opposition to the Thargoids.

After all, I think I read that Sirius was called the Dark Star in ancient times on earth. A star is certainly not a wheel...

P.S. I wonder if there is any data that the main station of Sirius was redesigned ...
