Aaaah, back in the Bubble again. Gave up on Beagle Point when I remembered it was 45K LY there and 45K LY back again from Sag A*, so just hit the Top of the World and then took the scenic route back. At Ngurii now about to check out Soontill for the first time in a couple of years, and I noticed that the availability of Soontill Relics on the commodity market there is huge - 400 !! Are all the rares that available now? There used to be less than a dozen I think a few years back. Significant? Who knows. Going to pick up 32 and take them around to a few places after visiting the namesake system, then might head to Sol or check out the Hesperus thing, or perhaps check out the alternative Soontill planet locations between Grandmort and Delta Phonecious per the book. Or do something.
