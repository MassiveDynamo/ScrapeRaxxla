Yep, by “Cmdr Harry Potter” but renamed in the book to avoid copyright issues. you can google it, there are some youtube vids.

The spiky haired woman was Elyssia and the theory is that she, Rebecca, Salomé, the pirate woman, and possibly Emperor Arissa are all clones. You’ll have to read Drew’s two Elite books and make your own mind up on that.
I did read the darkwheel, but it was about 11 pages on the internet so not sure if i read the whole lot, do you think it was a bad decision to kill her? Maybe she was one of the significant links to the darkwheel and raxxla?
