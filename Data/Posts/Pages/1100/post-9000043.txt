I don't mind people inspiring others to go on the search or others posting theories of which path to take and what possible routes there may be. It is fine to post all theories no matter how much tin-foil is needed for them. I think all paths should be considered.

However, I do have a problem with people claiming they have found anything from the Dark Wheel and/or Raxxla without posting actual in-game concrete evidence for something of this magnitude.

Raxxla is perhaps the biggest mystery in the entire game to date and should be taken seriously.
Completely agree! You need photographs of it, or your full of it, or saying your close to finding it, not mentioning any gurus...
