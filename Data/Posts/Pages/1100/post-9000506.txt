For the Elite game is characterized by the fact that one minor faction can be in different parts of the living area ?

Yes. Factions can be in many systems if thats what you're asking? Any faction reaching 75% influence in a system can 'expand' into a system up to 20LY away. Usually they are player managed factions (PMFs) as its easier with dedicated support but AI does it too. Look up BGS for more info.

Its possible to chain expand into systems and then retreat from the middle ones in the chain so 2 separate groupings happen.

Sirius has many faction names all slightly different. The Dark Wheel faction existed in game and was installed in Shin Des. It was probably supposed to stay there but an accident or design allowed it to expand to LFT 926. There its stayed for a long time until last year when a concerted effort was made to move it closer to Sol and other systems and expand it into 50. Look up Turning The Wheel for more info.

The Dark Wheel is also a player set-up Squadron. They only had small numbers and last time I checked had had no contact from anybody in or out of game for using the name. Frontier allowed the name in the first place and havent told them they need to change the name and the real Dark Wheel havent shut them down either like Felicity says.

Nah, they primarily want their own stuff.

Are we sure this Tharg rank thing is genuine. its not official is it?

but either way I dont see how returning stolen items, usually involving destruction or vandalism to Tharg or Tharg sites, is gonna rank up with them, that makes no sense. Scanning and not vandalising or killing should be what does it...and hope they dont count Scavengers coz we need them for Mats
