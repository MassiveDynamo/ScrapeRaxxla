about clouds ...there is a setting in xml file - "density of local dust". It has some value like 0.13 for minimal settings and 0.0 for high. Point is, if you set it like 0.001 on high u will see dust here and there. I made it because I assume dust cannot be complete invisible (0.0). And I see nice clouds everywhere now.
