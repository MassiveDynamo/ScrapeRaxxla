I always remember Brookes admission: “Not all stars have planets, but then again not all planets have suns either”

If that were the case, surely such a system would not appear in the Galmap, however, I suspect FD take liberties with textual description, a non star based system could simply mean a system with a brown dwarf / failed star equals a low temperature gas giant?

I recall how pre launch DB confirmed (as he was prone to do) that exploration involved ‘dark systems’, a rather wonderful set-up that actually enticed me towards backing the game.

Such dark systems it later transpired were brown dwarfs mainly, and Brookes actually names one in Elite Legacy which is in game.

I long suspect that was also the source of the hypothetical DB quote about having to scan it a few times, as that was the primary method for finding dark systems originally, scan all the systems around it and it appeared, then apparently they had ‘mysteries’ in some.

I suspect the evident errors in game eg duplication, catalog etc or maintaining a stable launch may have put an end to this.

Nether the less it’s a perfect way to hide a system?

What if we have to read this very precisely? As far as I know there are only 8 (known) plantes having a Sun!
