Did you visit Dahan to test the theory ?
It appears to be a quite heavily scouted system...
ALL systems within the bubble are probably heavily scouted by now. But since Raxxla/Omphalos Rift gateway to it is IMO in all likelihood really well hidden so that does not matter. Raxxla is NOT obvious. MB said it is very hard to find, and I think that means even within the system it's located in. The perfect hiding place might be in a planetary ring-they're so large it would take several people a long time to fully search. There is also a suggestion that a Random Number Function may be associated with its detection....
