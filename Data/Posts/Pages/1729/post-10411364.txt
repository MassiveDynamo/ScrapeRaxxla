What if it is a (artificial?) geological formation visible from orbit?
That could have been there from day one, pre-planet landings.
Quite possibly. IIRC years ago there was some discussion of a mile high monolith somewhere...never visited it myself....may have been a rendering bug/maybe not.

But if something were on the ground before Horizons could it have been used to access Raxxla?

I'm only questioning the likelihood of MB implementing Raxxla in this way, we have no way of knowing what we're looking for. As @Rochester pointed out it could be, from MB's favourite book Paradise Lost, that we are looking for a hollow "planet" (I've long postulated Raxxla as a Guardian ark ship!). In which case a crater would be an obvious access point, and could fit the "rock with conical hole" description of an Omphalos.

Edit2:
If this were the case, then I still think the moon "Wanderer" in Dahan is the prime contender. It's very small, low self gravity, on an inclined orbit to the rest of the moons of that planet so unlikely to be a natural product of the evolution of that system. And it fits the "vagabond" of the alleged TDW toast, which could apply the to Dahan system as a whole, as I've previously shown:
Mother of galaxies-Hathor planet 2
Whisperer in witchspace-Coltan moon 2a
Parent's grief, lover's woe, yearning of vagabond hearts- Wanderer moon 2e
