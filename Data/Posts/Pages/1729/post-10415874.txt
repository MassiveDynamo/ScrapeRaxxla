I just can't get over the Raxxla codex symbol matching up with certain stations and the random code they make. Once you see it, you can't unsee it. And so often, like almost Everytime you stop at a station. In my opinion, this has to be the start that is "a little bit obvious." It's my understanding that the letters are just random nonsense though.
