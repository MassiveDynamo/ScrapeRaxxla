I always remember Brookes admission: “Not all stars have planets, but then again not all planets have suns either”

If that were the case, surely such a system would not appear in the Galmap, however, I suspect FD take liberties with textual description, a non star based system could simply mean a system with a brown dwarf / failed star equals a low temperature gas giant?

I recall how pre launch DB confirmed (as he was prone to do) that exploration involved ‘dark systems’, a rather wonderful set-up that actually enticed me towards backing the game.

Such dark systems it later transpired were brown dwarfs mainly, and Brookes actually names one in Elite Legacy which is in game.

I long suspect that was also the source of the hypothetical DB quote about having to scan it a few times, as that was the primary method for finding dark systems originally, scan all the systems around it and it appeared, then apparently they had ‘mysteries’ in some.

I suspect the evident errors in game eg duplication, catalog etc or maintaining a stable launch may have put an end to this.

Nether the less it’s a perfect way to hide a system?

We've discussed this before:

p92 "star descriptions" in v3.2 of the player journal (http://hosting.zaonce.net/community/journal/v32/Journal_Manual-v32.pdf)
"
(Main sequence- O B A F G K M L T Y

(Wolf-Rayet- W WN WNC WC WO
(Carbon stars- CS C CN CJ CH CHd
MS S
(white dwarfs- D DA DAB DAO DAZ DAV DB DBZ DBV DO DOV DQ DC DCV DX
N (=Neutron)
H (=Black Hole)
X (=exotic)
SupermassiveBlackHole
A_BlueWhiteSuperGiant
F_WhiteSuperGiant
M_RedSuperGiant

"

so a Rogue Planet could act as a star in its own ED system so we could fsd jump to it. It would be very small mass compared to a star so IIRC the system name (if discovered) would end in "a".

Doesnt mean there are Rogue planet systems in ED, but that comment by MB suggests there could be. Could be a hiding place for Raxxla....but how would we find it?

edit:
however that MB comment was in 2014- so a comment about an in-game implementation? or general astronomical comment? or a developer aspiration??
