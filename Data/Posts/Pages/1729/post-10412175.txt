What if we have to read this very precisely? As far as I know there are only 8 (known) plantes having a Sun!
Ok that's...very literal. And also AFAIK only our star is named "Sun"; i've zero idea if other stars in elite(lore) are named sun.
-alternatively, it could be another word for sun (not star), even in another language used around the time of Jameson.
