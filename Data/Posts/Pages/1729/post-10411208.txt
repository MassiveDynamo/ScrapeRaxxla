Ah yes. I'd forgotten...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baetyl

The problem though is that meteorites are found on the ground but on game release planetary landings weren't possible. That only came in Horizons release, which IIRC was when I started playing. But would Michael Brookes have set up the Raxxla puzzle in game so it could not be solved until then?

Edit
That baetyl reference does mention "meta", the turning point in a chariot race. Now Omphalos can also mean "hub", i.e. a centre of rotation......
What if it is a (artificial?) geological formation visible from orbit?
That could have been there from day one, pre-planet landings.
