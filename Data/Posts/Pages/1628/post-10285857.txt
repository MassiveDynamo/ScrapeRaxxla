this is all interesting and the fact that Han_Zen posted a photo originally of them visible in VR aswell...
it brings to mind that Fdev/MB/DB quote, "we don't play the game the way they thought we would" or something to that effect.

maybe... they expected more cmdrs to play in VR, and spend more time in the system maps, and notice these things?

another theory, maybe these are some visual bug/remnant from the "Rogue" planets/stars that were removed/disabled?
