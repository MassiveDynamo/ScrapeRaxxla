Got one in Shinrarta Dezhra too, just above my pointer, took a long time to appear though, many minutes.:


Much like the others, seem to be 3D objects that rotate around.

WELL... they seem to be in many locations... they're not Raxxla then (probably). but.. does this mean that there are objects in systems we can't see that are appearing on the map, or is this some very weird and specific map bug that places asteroids on the map for some reason that's been there since at least 2018??

Edit: Got some better pics of the one in Star of India:
