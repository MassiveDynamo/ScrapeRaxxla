The Quest To Find Raxxla

No, it looks from his image liks it's on the upper left of the star itself. I CAN SEE ONE - it just appeared as I typed:



Interestingly the reflection is the colour of the starlight.

I know on these images it looks like a blobby gas-cloud, but it's a 3D rotating object when you see it "live". Seems to rotate a lot faster than the ones in Alpha Cygni - however, notice much like Alpha Cygni the light-source direction doesn't match the star as shown on the system map (lighting here looks to come from above-left maybe).

In the space of typing this it rotated quite fast and has gone now, well, rather it's rotated to black and I can only just see it by moving the camera back and forth to see tiny bit of rim-lighting.

Edit: Looking on Han_Zen's image, it loooks like there's two of them. One above-left of the star, and one where I've just posted one.
