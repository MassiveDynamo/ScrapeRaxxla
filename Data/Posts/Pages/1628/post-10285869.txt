Well that's a bit strange in V380 Orionis..... that's not the star and has disappeared now...

And it's not a solar flare.... here's it missing and a flare...



and another one appeared/disappeared above the flare too about 1/3 towards the center of the star....

EDIT: Seems to be on most stars so guessing it's intentional... seems too have some flames but then soft gas like and so sticks out.... Doesn't feel like it's part of the star but guess it's layered on top.....and hangs around for quite some time, some appear to rotate too.... Do stars have atmospheres with clouds...LOL
