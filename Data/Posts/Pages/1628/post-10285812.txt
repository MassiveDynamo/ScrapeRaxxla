weird clouds..... or solar flare looking....
They're definitely 3D objects, and they rotate. They don't look like flares to me. You can get them fairly large on screen and sit and watch them slowly turn, by moving the camera back and forth you can see them as 3D, which is very hard to see on flat images

They do look a lot like normal asteroids, but... why are they there?

I'm heading to the "Star of India" since Han_Zen also confirmed there was one there too. I assume it's still there, but checking soon.

I'm assuming it's some sort of bug or something in the system map, but I'm not sure why or how that's even possible really. Especially since they appear after a little while and it's very predictable.
