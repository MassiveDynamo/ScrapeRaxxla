are these things visible in Orrery Mode zoomed out? just curious..

maybe it's time to start flying out in a random direction a great distance, and seeing where/if the objects position changes in the map?

just throwing spaghetti at this point
I tried Orrery mode, but couldn't see them, however... I'm not sure where to look in 3D space.

I'm having a lot of trouble seeing the ones in the Star of India system map, they don't seem to stick around like the ones in Alpha Cygni?
