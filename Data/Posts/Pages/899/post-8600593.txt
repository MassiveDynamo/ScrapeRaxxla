In the old lore it was said that Thargoids once knew where Raxxla was but lost it & are looking for it, though were also more interested in Soontill which had been their planet.. That might have been retconned though, since TDW are said to have lost Raxxla, and CEIP were interested in Soontil (from one of the books). So, if itâ€™s lore-based, I no longer have any idea of what is supposed to be current!
