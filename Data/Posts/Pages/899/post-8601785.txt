Has anyone asked...why are Guardians called Guardians? What are they Guarding?
In game itâ€™s just a name that Ram Tah thought would be appropriate, based on a societal expectation of mutual protection (from their earlier days, not their latter days).

Always possible that FD might also have been hinting at something with the name I suppose. Who knows.
