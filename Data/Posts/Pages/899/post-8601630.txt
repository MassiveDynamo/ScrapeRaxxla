I'm pretty sure RAXXLA, Thargoids and the Guardians are all together connected somehow. Even if RAXXLA is a portal to another dimension/galaxy/whatever then who built it? The answer is only the ones that could have built it are either Humans, Guardians or the Thargoids since there is currently nobody else in the game that could have done it. Only exception if it is a natural phenomenon but that would be somehow unlikely since they try to be as realistic as possible from a scientific point of view. Also such a construction would have to be fed with huge amounts of energy. Target systems for such an place should be the ones that can deliver that kind of power. Maybe black holes or even dyson spheres altough there is probably no method in the game to find them.
