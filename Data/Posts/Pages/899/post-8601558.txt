In the old lore it was said that Thargoids once knew where Raxxla was but lost it & are looking for it, though were also more interested in Soontill which had been their planet.. That might have been retconned though, since TDW are said to have lost Raxxla, and CEIP were interested in Soontil (from one of the books). So, if it’s lore-based, I no longer have any idea of what is supposed to be current!

Ya im not basing the idea that I think the Thargoids know about Raxxla on anything in lore really - more from the fact that they have been around for thousands, err millions? of years...
Well there is this one quote from Galnet that I like “Alternatively, they may be using hyperspace as a conduit from a dimensional plane entirely separate from real space. The Thargoids may not just be extragalactic in origin, but extra-universal.” Which hints at a possible Raxxla connection as that is one potential idea for what Raxxla is ... A gateway to another place.
And ya I think that the Thargoid Device is indicative of that in it shows a Galaxy like projection that does not match with our own.

A side note - Im working on a theory that the Guardian beacons (which are quite similar to the Thargoid devices) are not part of a "communication network" as such - they are too clustered to be an effective network across guardian space. I am assuming they are clustered for a reason - they are warning about a location possibly? This could be the area where the Guardian/Thargoid war took place. And a specific reason why t he Thargoids wanted it?

Currently assuming that the Thargoids are working on a vast project that has spanned millions of years possibly related to Raxxla and the Guardians thwarted them in the past and we might be doing the same again... but ya total spitballing.
