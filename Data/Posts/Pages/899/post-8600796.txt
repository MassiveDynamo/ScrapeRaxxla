Well that was an interesting 50 page catch up...

In the old lore it was said that Thargoids once knew where Raxxla was but lost it & are looking for it, though were also more interested in Soontill which had been their planet.. That might have been retconned though, since TDW are said to have lost Raxxla, and CEIP were interested in Soontil (from one of the books). So, if itâ€™s lore-based, I no longer have any idea of what is supposed to be current!

Are you sure that was lore and not fan fiction? Not that it really matters as I think we have to take any new lore and disregard the old until its confirmed, a new player with zero knowledge of the old lore should have the same chance surely....the same chance of never finding it either that is...so anything 'findable' must exist in the current ED Universe (which may include the game, forums, vids, twitter, FB but hopefully not unrecorded conversations of any variety that isn't then confirmable to everyone)
