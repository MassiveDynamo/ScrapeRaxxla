I'm beginning to come to the realization that our understanding (expectations?) of what Raxxla is may be inherently flawed.

"A place that isn't a place, a door but also the key', references to Delphi (and by proxy it's famed oracles), ideas of portals to other worlds and the knowledge contained within... So, a massive repository of knowledge? A digital library? Perhaps containing knowledge that would warp the perspective of anyone who reads it, changing everything we've ever thought of as our understanding of the universe shifts into an unintelligible amalgam of what was and what truely is?

That would explain quite a bit. Even its name, Raxxla. It has no meaning, yet it transcends languages as being known as itself. Utterly unknowable. Knowledge like that would be an exceedingly dangerous cognito-hazard and very valuable. Definitely worth protecting. Preventing the knowledge from escaping would be paramount to those in charge as stuff like that would completely reshape humanity as we know it. Total chaos.

So, my newish theory?

The codex points us to Tau Ceti. Tau Ceti points us to the dawn of hyperspace. The codex defines a time in which the Raxxla myth is widely circulated. Tau Ceti points to a start date of human exploration's golden age. This brings us back to Earth and the clues place an emphasis on our early history post hyperspace.

The discovery of the Mars relic fits the timeline especially well. That's where the trail ends. Does the relic contain Raxxla or just point towards its existence? Who knows.

The Mars relic containing information on Raxxla (or Raxxla itself) would explain the near total secrecy surrounding the childs palm sized object.
