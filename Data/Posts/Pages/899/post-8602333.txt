I do like that ... raxxla as a construct ... perhaps its guardian AI combined with thargoid gate technology used as a means of ghost writing childrens books about princesses and spiraling stars.
If we believe Rafe Zetter, Raxxla is a planet and it has an alien construct. In ED the word 'construct' is used as a name for the Guardian AI.
I'm not a native English speaker, but to me it feels a bit odd to use that word for a virtual entity. It doesn't feel like a coincidence.
