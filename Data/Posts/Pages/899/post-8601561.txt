Well that was an interesting 50 page catch up...



Are you sure that was lore and not fan fiction? Not that it really matters as I think we have to take any new lore and disregard the old until its confirmed, a new player with zero knowledge of the old lore should have the same chance surely....the same chance of never finding it either that is...so anything 'findable' must exist in the current ED Universe (which may include the game, forums, vids, twitter, FB but hopefully not unrecorded conversations of any variety that isn't then confirmable to everyone)

No, I’m not sure of anything about lore any more, I’m totally confused! Yes, I agree, we should read the Codex and Tourist beacons (& maybe the Galnet archives ) and take that as the current lore. But my memory is failing a bit in old age so I tend to remember older stuff better!
