UA spectrogram map points (supposedly) to first barnacles on Merope5c, though they were found manually before that was found & decoded
UP spectrogram map shows how to find Thargoid Surface Sites (Motherships) using UP+UA+UL.

It’s all explained on the Canonn pages.

But since neither thargoids nor humanity (apart from DB and MB) know where Raxxla is located, then it’s not relevant here
I think the thargoids know
