So is Raxxla a system or a planet? And will the meta-alloys help us find it?

Right now I doubt it's anything but a future DLC, meaning, the mechanism by which it would effect the game doesnt yet physically exist until certain 'events' are announced and stages towards finding Raxxla are unlocked by the players themselves.

"As the legend goes, on Raxxla there are alien structures which serve as gateways to other universes."

If finding Raxxla does indeed turn out to be a gateway/portal to another universe(s)/'witch space'/'dragons be here' this will of course open up a whole new avenue for the game to progress even further.

In the meantime I'm keeping a watchful eye here (http://childrenofraxxla.com/) and especially here (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=220273).
