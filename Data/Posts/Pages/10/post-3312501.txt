I started looking around for hidden places within Elite Dangerous shortly after I started playing a few months ago. My search renewed four days ago after seeing this in the video on the Horizons page in the Frontier Store (It's a 4 second clip about 60% through the video):

Looks mysterious enough, think this could be a reference to Raxxla being a landfall body? Or maybe something new entirely?

Looks alien indeed, would be nice to have a closer look.
