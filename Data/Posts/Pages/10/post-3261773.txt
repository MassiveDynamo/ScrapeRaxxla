The "Espada de venganza" has docked in the Maia system.
En route there a signal anomaly was detected and checked out, an UA revealed itself and was picked up.
Several jumps later a shipwreck of imperial craftsmanship was discovered, saving 5 escape pods and returning them to the Ant-Hill.

The ship is ready for any further engagements,
Ground assault weaponry features high payload missiles and
rapid fire lasers.

Standing by...

"To RAXXLA and beyond!"
