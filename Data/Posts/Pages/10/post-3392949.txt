So is Raxxla a system or a planet? And will the meta-alloys help us find it?

"A certain celestial body" sounds like a planet to me. I've not seen any links between meta-alloys and Raxxla, or UA's for that matter. Horizons gave us the ability to make landfall, although no one is saying Raxxla is placed on a planet we currently can land on. The hunt for meta-alloys, even with very local area-specific clues to the seven sisters, shows us what a gigantic, ginormous, galactic sized task the search will be.
