I don’t know how to translate this so that it’s clear ... the mission chain, after the current one is completed, another one will be given, possibly of a different type and with different goals. I need to know if there are such missions at stations near Earth and Mars
Well, I didnt do missions there ... but station near IO looked regular - I clicked all menus ...all the same. Vega too.
At firts look.

....I have another idea, that's why did Vega just in case ... so we have 2 people in galaxy news, who saw white lights and then disappered.
1st was president, last seen in Alioth. 2nd one was technical guy from Vega.
Both stars are A class, both are permit locked...
Could it be (1) and (2) parts of toast? If it could, then where it points as 3rd ?>: Something in imperial space (just to have 3 stars = 3 powers) ?
