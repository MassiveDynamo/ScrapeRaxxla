.. I just got Sol permit couple days ago ... there are 2 interesting beacons there. 1 about nonhuman find ("baby hand"), however I read on reddit it sends us to Mass Effect.
And 2nd one "Halsey shares her vision" (that woman-president 4 years ago, and she disappeared). Next similar something was stolen ship from Vega on last April-May or so on Galanet.
Could those be connected any how?

P.S. Right, this is all mentioned directly in galanews. Guess devs tired to wait us

Can you also see if there are chain missions at the stations in the sol?
