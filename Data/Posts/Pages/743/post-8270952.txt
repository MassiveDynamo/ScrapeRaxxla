Huh ... I had similar (wrong) idea ..
1. jewel = Virgin 3 - giant star, single one in system
2. sirens ....1 of 3 sirens in myths had Lyra. So looking at "Lyra's " direction from (1)
3. parents, lowers .... ring ? wedding ring? Looking for "ring in Lyra" (M-57), well, star is there, but no ring any more. Star is Wolf-Rien btw. Visitied it too - it's just double star system and nothing more.
