.. I just got Sol permit couple days ago ... there are 2 interesting beacons there. 1 about nonhuman find ("baby hand"), however I read on reddit it sends us to Mass Effect.
And 2nd one "Halsey shares her vision" (that woman-president 4 years ago, and she disappeared). Next similar something was stolen ship from Vega on last April-May or so on Galanet.
Could those be connected any how?

P.S. Right, this is all mentioned directly in galanews. Guess devs tired to wait us
