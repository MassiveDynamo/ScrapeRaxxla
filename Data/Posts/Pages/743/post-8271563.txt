I’ll talk a little about my theory, the developers said that they want the player to travel, and not fly along the same route, so I need chains of missions, maybe they can start the mechanism to search for raxxla. Also, all the points from the toast are eaten in sol, but I can’t be 100% sure that they are them. Given all the information, the probability is 5%.
Ah, i see what you mean. A few of us are somewhat suspicious of the 'mysterious tip-off' missions you may sometimes receive for that same reason. Unfortunately a lot of the points in the toast also seem to comparatively point to other locations also, as shown by a few seemingly reputable commanders in here, so it's all very confusing to us. There tends to be a lot of conjecture. I agree its worth testing at any rate. Even if it doesn't pan out it will provide useful data.
