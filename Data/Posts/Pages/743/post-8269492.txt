Maybe look at some older Fdev games to see if any of them had a cheat code. Besides previous Elite games the only one that comes to mind to me that I've ever heard of was a dog's life on PlayStation 2. I bought that for my daughter when she was like four or five and she loved it but I don't know if there were any cheat codes for it. Also did you try typing it into comms chat? I'm pretty sure you can use that during jumps.

Keep in mind I'm pretty sure any input code that might trigger a raxxla jump would have to probably be possible on console also, which doesn't do keyboard and mouse for elite for some reason
