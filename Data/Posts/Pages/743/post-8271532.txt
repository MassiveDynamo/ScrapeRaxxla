Well, I didnt do missions there ... but station near IO looked regular - I clicked all menus ...all the same. Vega too.
At firts look.

....I have another idea, that's why did Vega just in case ... so we have 2 people in galaxy news, who saw white lights and then disappered.
1st was president, last seen in Alioth. 2nd one was technical guy from Vega.
Both stars are A class, both are permit locked...
Could it be (1) and (2) parts of toast? If it could, then where it points as 3rd ?>: Something in imperial space (just to have 3 stars = 3 powers) ?
I think I'm close, but I do not have access to sol to confirm my theory)))
Do you have links to this?
just in galnet, Hudson said that Mars or Earth (I canâ€™t remember) is a pearl.
