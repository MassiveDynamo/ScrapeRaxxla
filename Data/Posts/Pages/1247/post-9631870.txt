I am being honest i have never seen this before...now I think personally it is a graphical glitch where the game crashed and done so before the colour pallet loaded for the background environment of the jump as iv had jumps do this however only maybe 1 colour, however due to the colours being missing I have noticed that there is a group formation of stars I have never seen in the jump that may usually be obscured.....I wonder what group formation of stars this is and are they in every jump? if so whats so special about them to pass you 3-4 times while jumping...

3rd time

and more after and on the other side when jump turns

The hyperspace transition seems to be on an endless loop, ending only when the next system poi are downloaded(?), so it’s not surpising you’d see them repeating.

Whether they have any special meaning in-game is a separate question!
