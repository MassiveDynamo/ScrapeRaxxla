I am loving this great map by Mita Kondria.

Granted the ‘scope’ is primarily focused upon Thargoid/Guardian etc locations, in that regard it’s a straightforward point based map showing their relative locations and borders.

I’d love to see this as a heat map, but with additional data and ‘all’ points filtered, to show concentrations of ‘developer activity’ and a tonne of other data, pretty sure that would highlight some interesting voids in our understanding - ‘intelligence gaps’.

All in all a tall order to accomplish needless to say, and hats off, I wish I had the time to put something like this together.

Suggest it to Canonn, they’ve probably already done it!

Edit: and it is an interesting map. It clearly shows that the Guardian space encroaches between the Thargoid Coalsack and other (Pleiades, Witchhead & California) regions. I suspect this is an indication that the Coalsack is a different thargoid faction, that they are the Klaxians, whereas the other areas are the Oresrians. It will be interesting to see if the Klaxians do turn out to be more aggressive than the Oresrians, as indicated by a couple of the ED books and the Dynasty plot.
