I am loving this great map by Mita Kondria.

Granted the ‘scope’ is primarily focused upon Thargoid/Guardian etc locations, in that regard it’s a straightforward point based map showing their relative locations and borders.

I’d love to see this as a heat map, but with additional data and ‘all’ points filtered, to show concentrations of ‘developer activity’ and a tonne of other data, pretty sure that would highlight some interesting voids in our understanding - ‘intelligence gaps’.

All in all a tall order to accomplish needless to say, and hats off, I wish I had the time to put something like this together.
