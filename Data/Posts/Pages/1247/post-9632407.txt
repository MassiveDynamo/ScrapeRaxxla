The hyperspace transition seems to be on an endless loop, ending only when the next system poi are downloaded(?), so it’s not surpising you’d see them repeating.

Whether they have any special meaning in-game is a separate question!
Yes however if you time the loop towards a normal jump there is adleast 2 times they pass, however either way yes why that formation of stars stands out and now i can make them out in the normal jump, although the backdrop and other stars are usually mixed these are constant and static
