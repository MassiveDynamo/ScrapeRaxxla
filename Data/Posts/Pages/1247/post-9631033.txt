Comets don't develop their tails until they come close to a star though. When they're in far off stages of their orbits they would look just like an nice asteroid from a ring (possibly dirtier).
That's what makes the tail modeling complex. It's not a static object. I guess it hasn't been the highest priority either. It's mostly eye candy.
