Six stations orbiting a comet? Are you sure? That doesn't sound physically possible. Could they be orbiting something larger?

Not impossible, The comet has the same gravitational pull no mater how many items you put in orbit around it, just like earth, look howmuch we have in orbit around it now with no actual affect on its gravity and orbit
