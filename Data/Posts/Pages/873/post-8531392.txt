So i just went down to a thargoid maw, plugged in a probe, scanner, and link, and while the stars showed up, the audio files did not have any noise. Want me to make a video to show what i mean?

Also, i have no real cash on me at the moment, and i need to put this into a video. What video editor should i use? I wanna make captions and stuff.

The links and the signals still work. The audio does not play but the link still reacts to the signal with the tight beam octal ranges. I has been this way for a while...
