Friends, I have maybe important message regarding LFT 509.
Today, 5 minutes prior of this message I logged back in to elite to check the invisible system near LFT 509 and confirm it on issue tracker Invisible system. Searching
Hip 34104 truly points to empty space near LFT 509.

But then I suddenly realized, looking at galmap, that I have old bookmark on LFT 509 with ARROW POINTING DOWN with means I bookmarked an object in this system. Hastily checking the list of all bookmarks in galmap I found LFT bookmark WITH CITY icon!
SPOILER: CITY BOOKMARK IN LFT 509
edit. Please report to me if you can't see attached image

The surface installation icon is a "bug". This is the same "bug" as the Polaris surface installation icon which made everyone think that there is a population on Polaris. IIRC you can simply replicate this by using your left panel to bookmark it when you are next to the system in question.
