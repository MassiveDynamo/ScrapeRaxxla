I cant say, i'm just proposing a hypothesis.

Everywhere i looked people seem to be satisfied with "DS/FSS has unlimited range after 3.3" but where is the confirmation for this? If it had unlimited range i could scan nearby systems as well (i know they are not loaded in the game engine thus couldnt be scanned, but the argument persists). If it has a limited wide range, what's beyond that? Can anyone prove it's nothing?

I think it's an important point to bring because it's an obvious limitation, since we cant detect Raxxla without these tools
Important point first - we don't know we can detect Raxxla even with those tools.

Second point - the infinte range has always been 'infinite within the scope of what's generated within the instance of the present system' (phrasing is mine there), it's never been literally infinite. (Can you imagine how long a hyperspace jump would take if the entire universe had to be procgen'd prior to system entry? )

Anyway, the ADS had infinite range since the point of it's introduction. It's generally accepted that that's what transmorphed into the DS in 3.3. It certainly wasn't the BDS or IDS as using the range limits in them would have a. caused an outcry, and b. been spotted straight away.

The ADS specified its range as being infinite, and Michael Brookes is on record expressing some regrets about it being infinite.

Could they have made it very high but non-infinite in 3.3? It's certainly not impossible. Would be very very hard to find out in-game though. Probably worth a check through patch notes etc. first to see if there's any 100% direct confirmation the infinite range was continued into 3.3.
