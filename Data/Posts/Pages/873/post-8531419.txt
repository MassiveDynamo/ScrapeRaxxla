It would be nice if fdev had some employees that were actually able to answer questions. From what ive seen so far the general response is 'i dont really know'. You could get the same amount of info from a random person in your neighborhood realistically

Mmm, now the covid restrictions are beginning to ease then there may be a way.
You’ve heard the story about giving sufficient monkeys a load of paper and pencils and eventually you’ll end up with a Mozart symphony?
Well, pop round to the nearest zoo/wildlife park, drop off a load of paper & pencils & shout “where is Raxxla? what is it? and how do we get TDW membership.”

Of course be sure to choose only friendly monkeys, and don't do it in the big cat enclosure!
