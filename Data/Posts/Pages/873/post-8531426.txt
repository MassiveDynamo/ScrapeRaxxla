Hello guys,

Has anyone worked in the theory that discovery scanner and FSS has limited range (e.g. 1ly) and nothing beyond that has been discovered yet (rogue planets, Raxxla etc)?

Going long distance in SC has been tried in a few systems. I’ve done it 1.5ly in Sol and around 0.8 in Alpha Centauri and Merope, nothing found. Some people have tried to SC to the next system (it doesn’t work, the hyperspace jump is when the next system is instanced). But of course that’s only travelling in one direction in a system. Of course this may be a valid approach for a particular system, if you choose the right direction and travel sufficiently slowly that you don't miss the object you're looking for. But it would make extremely tedious gameplay!
