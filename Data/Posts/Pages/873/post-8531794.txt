There's no way to get the permit for LFT 509 that anyone knows of as yet. Frontier support said they don't think it's currently available, but went on to say search the forums and threads as they are the best way of finding out.

So my point was that if you can't get there why did they specifically put Convoy missions in the system back in 2015? ("Adding valuable salvage convoys to three permitted systems: LFT 509, Isinor, Witch's Reach"). Why would you waste time and money developing and deploying it and then announce it to the community if you can't get in the system...
When you think about it, it actually makes for quite a neat little way of providing a bit of a hint and nudging people towards something without actually just handing it to them on a plate (see @Han_Zen 's post for details).

Whether that was the intent or just an unintended side effect is another matter of course!
