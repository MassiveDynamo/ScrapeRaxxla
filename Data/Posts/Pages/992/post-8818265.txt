So far I checked all systems on Nav Panel in Furuhjelm, Su, and HIP 53688. Nothing yet, all those systems also appear on Galmap. I need to get sleep but will resume tomorrow. I’m curious though, which direction is the proposed search area in relation to Azaleach from her tour path? Meaning does it appear the ship over shot Azaleach from one of the tour systems or is it in a seemingly random location. I’d assume it would be a somewhat straight line away from one of the systems. I didn’t get to check. I’m planning to check both where it went missing and where the wreckage was found.
