Agreed, which is a potential reason no one has ever found it, because we dont know what rogues are or how to look for / there are so many conflicting avenues of enquiry.

Propose the question is raised at the next AMA. But its delivered in a way to enable FD to provide a sensible answer.

Q: How do we detect rogue planets.

Simple but it allows FD to provide an answer (if they arent being pedantic) potentially such as:

A: Nope they dont exist / or they were to be implemented but..: Good because it rules them out of our quest, even 'were' would be good as it says its not in game at present.

A: They can be found, example given: Obvious.

A: You cant, or its a bit tricky or not telling: Good because it confirms their existance. Any flim flamery can be taken as confirmation that its something of note (maybe not Raxxla but something of import).

A: Spoiler / redacted: confirmation they're in game and somethong of import.

I'll endeavour to engage with the AMA, but cant guarantee I'll remember.
