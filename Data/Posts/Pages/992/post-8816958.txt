. A rogue might enter a system, be affected by the gravity (so would show up on the line against an X, or a star), but then its momentum would sling it out of the system again.

Dont we have at least one in Sol thats on a multi year orbit with our Sun and another system entirely somewhere?

If so, when is it due back?

Incidentally, you said a while ago (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8704196) that DB had said of Raxxla “‘Its like nothing else in game and you will know it if you find it' or words to that effect”. Can you please give me the reference for that to add to the official quotes thread because I’ve never seen or heard of that comment or anything like it.

I been looking. and beginning to wonder if it was from 2nd source in the first place, ie read someone saying that DB had said. I recall the 'Its like nothing else in game' bit specifically as that to me didnt help at all and seemed deliberately obscure and non-helpful in the cheeky way they do (eg Its in The Milky Way), but cannot recall if it was written or said or what or where. Put it down to 'unsourced / unreliable' memory or 3rd party at best for now. Im hoping for a Dyson Sphere type thing, something obvious the moment you see it and cant miss. Was it perhaps part of the Exodus storyline and Ive got them mixed up, there were a lot of hints from DW all over the place at different times (and after updates) and many get attributed to Raxxla? Have I done the same? it would fit the Zuara at the time and is an answer to the question 'Will we know when we find it / whatever the secret is?'
