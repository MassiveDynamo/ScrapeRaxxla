Agreed, which is a potential reason no one has ever found it, because we dont know what rouges are or how to look for / there are so many conflicting avenues of enquiry.

Propose the question is raised at the next AMA. But its delivered in a way to enable FD to provide a sensible answer.

Q: How do we detect rouge planets.

Simple but it allows FD to provide an answer (if they arent being pedantic) potentially such as:

A: Nope rouge planets dont exist / or they were to be implemented but..: Good because it rules them out of our quest, even 'were' would be good as it says its not in game at present.

A: They can be found, example given: Obvious.

A: You cant, or its a bit tricky or not telling: Good because it confirms their existance. Any flim flamery can be taken as confirmation that its something of note (maybe not Raxxla but something of import).

A: Spoiler / redacted: confirmation they're in game and somethong of import.

I'll endeavour to engage with the AMA, but cant guarantee I'll remember.

What we do know is that Stellar Forge has the ability to create rogue planets. We also know that Rogue Planet is listed as a star class. This means that they can be either their own system or a secondary in a system with regular star.

What we don't know is if any rogues are generated. Perhaps there is only one, in the game.
