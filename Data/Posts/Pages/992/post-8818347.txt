This one I can debunk, as there was no hyperspace in the Alpha. There was only one system.

I can confirm that the devs can jump to directly to planets and stations, on their test accounts. They do it all the time, in streams. They usually cut the picture, while they do it though. It's called 'Dev magic'.

I want one of those! Santa, Iâ€™m putting it on my Xmas list!
