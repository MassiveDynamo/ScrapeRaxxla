"Doctor Professor" you keep saying to Han Zen.

Herr Professor Doktor Han_Zen, alias Hansen. Calling him this because of his high scholarship, his Germanic name and because he is an infiltrated (gentle) Canonn mole and founder. (Btw, he was so kind to bring me here from the Rift thread when it was closed and I was feeling sooo sad and lonely ! Thx again!)

The One Who Loves TÃ¤nzerinnen..
SPOILER

Interessing plot, anyway. Please keep us informed, mein Freund!

Ah, that misdirection. Because
This.
In an alternate hypothesis, giving the medallion to someone might be the way TDW uses to summon him/her for a meeting. Still waiting mine...
Btw, anyone here thinks Luko was a TDW agent/asset ?
