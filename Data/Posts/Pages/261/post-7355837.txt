Ah, that misdirection. Because
1) there has been no in-game or galnet confirmation that medallion is from the Dark Wheel, though it may be a fair hypothesis that its TDW, however the act of leaving it behind is symbolic that she had left whatever organisation it represented
2) galnet clearly published that it had been left behind in her ship on Achenar, yet the medallion was used later as evidence against her at the trial which condemned her. It was was clearly planted evidence intended to falsely incriminate her- see chapter 5 of Premonition! (Aisling & Gerrun!)

The medallion was fan art (by one of the original CoR), its use in Galnet was part of the DW story writing Salome out of the game, when it looked like Frontier was abandoning the FR storyline and DW was leaving. That of course later changed, but nothing to see here related to Raxxla, move along, move along.
