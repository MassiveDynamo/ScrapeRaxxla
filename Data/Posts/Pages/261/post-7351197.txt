Not a bad theory there, though the Empire also uses familial descent, as did Walden (you could say his clones were his descendants) so Iâ€™m not fully convinced by your last paragraph.
It's less to do with the leader selection and more to do with how new members are selected.

But yeah, I agree. I'm just trying to find a way to test and rule out possible theories on the method used to find Raxxla (or something leading to it) the first time. I edited the post to seperate the tinfoil from the observations.

We have a when. We have a possible where. We just lack the 'how' of it.

Generation ships were launched pre-FTL. So we have a timeframe of 2020 to 2100 for initial launches, leaving us with anywhere from 80 to 376 years of travel assuming we use 2296 as an end point.

So, assuming that the gen ships were traveling at sub FTL (due to it not being invented yet) we have a hollow sphere around Sol with an outside radius of ~376Ly as our max search area. I'm still working on the inside radius.
(For now just use 40 as an educated guess)

We'd be looking for either Raxxla itself or something that points us to the next step. That is of course if a generation ship is our 'how'.

Post 2100 we're looking at FTL and things get rather tricky as exact numbers and specifications of the OG drives are muddy at best.
