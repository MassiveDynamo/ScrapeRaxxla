Ah, that misdirection. Because
1) there has been no in-game or galnet confirmation that medallion is from the Dark Wheel, though it may be a fair hypothesis that its TDW, however the act of leaving it behind is symbolic that she had left whatever organisation it represented
2) galnet clearly published that it had been left behind in her ship on Achenar, yet the medallion was used later as evidence against her at the trial which condemned her. It was was clearly planted evidence intended to falsely incriminate her- see chapter 5 of Premonition! (Aisling & Gerrun!)
