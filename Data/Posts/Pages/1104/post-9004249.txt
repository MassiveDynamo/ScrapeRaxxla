Booo, another hunter of Thargs. I hope they do hold the keys to Raxxla and you dont get a ticket coz you shot their Tharg cops the other day

Unless you meant hitting as 'finding' in which case, yeah they are all over certain nebulae and regions. Not sure if anyone has done a 'range' for them to appear within.
I'm not hunting them, just seeing them everywhere. My Asp actually has no weapons on it. You guys always send me to the best spots.
