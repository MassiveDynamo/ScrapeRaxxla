Sorry.
Has it already been considered that Raxxla is an abreviutra of the first letters of the name of something?
R....A....X....X....L....A....
(Really, I can't understand why there are only six letters instead of eight.)
I have been long suspected the six letter thing to mean something. I tried different combinations, but i deleted all that posts to prevent confusion in new comers unbended minds. I got another shot going on right now, if i cant find something with that, i will abandon this idea. And attention to R A X X L A --- P A R A L L A X
