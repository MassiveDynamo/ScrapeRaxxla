I think this referred to engineers, in hindsight

Kind of agree that Engineers are one 'version' of how this played out but yes the original does refer to 'shooting that cop' so there was something else in mind as well. Problem is we never know if it got changed or morphed into something else or got dropped as unworkable. Its hard not to think Dark Wheel when he said it but DB does like his cabals of men in dark rooms running the galaxy so it could be something else.

Hes basically describing 'reputation' with someone, so it is in game but maybe not as intended, or maybe not fleshed out enough yet, or maybe they wanted to get the game to a certain stage before introducing it....like legs first then this storyline. A lot of the early stuff was how it was imagined in DB head, which may have morphed into something else actually in game. Sometimes wish we could ask DB some detailed Qs about what was and what is and what morphed into what and what got dropped and how he sees the game now, how complete is it? How close is it to the original vision etc?
