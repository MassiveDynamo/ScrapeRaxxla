Adding this as it relates to @Rochester's Miltonian connections to Raxxla. It would appear that GalMap regions would suggest we may need to be applying these ideas beyond the Inner Orion Spur. The galaxy is after all a huge place.
From a message on Independent Raxxla Hunters discord where I was responding to @El Saico
Hard to show it from EDSM via screenshots but the regions Empyrean Straits and Arcadian Stream are right next to each other just to the right of the core. Empyrean Straits is approximately the right-hand side of the core. Arcadian Stream is the next farthest out. Meanwhile, Ryker's Hope is the opposite side of the innermost core region.

I believe Empyrean Stream has rumored Guardian sites per the in-game Codex Map.

Image provided visualization purposes. The brightness of the core plus how EDSM highlights makes image capture hightlighting zones difficult at best.
