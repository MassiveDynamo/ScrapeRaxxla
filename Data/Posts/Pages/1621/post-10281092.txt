Flying into the Sirius system once again I thought ...
1. Why is a planet (on which you can land) called Lucifer? As far as I know it's one of the names of Venus,
2. Sirius is still considered the brightest star visible from Earth,
3. It's only about 8 light years from Earth,
4. There is a white dwarf and so we can jump farther away from it than usual, do we have habitable systems with a white dwarf ?
5. And still why did they make engineers from the horizons in the Odyssey ? Von on the screen you can not go to half of the room next to the engineer and climb the stairs on the right to the top, there is not visible wall.
