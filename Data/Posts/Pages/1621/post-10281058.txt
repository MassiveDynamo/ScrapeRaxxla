Adding this as it relates to @Rochester's Miltonian connections to Raxxla. It would appear that GalMap regions would suggest we may need to be applying these ideas beyond the Inner Orion Spur. The galaxy is after all a huge place.

Just a note that the galactic regions were added around the time the Codex was launched. Before that, many of the regions were unofficially named by fan projects, which I believe Fdev adopted many of - been a long time, anyone know the facts on this?

Edit: Source for the timing of the Galactic Regions. Fdev post from Oct 2018

Therefore; if Raxxla was placed in the game at the start and there are celestial clues indicating that, it's extremely unlikely that any of the current Galactic region names relate to any pre-Codex elements. It's possible they do relate to the Raxxla Codex since they seem to have been implemented concurrently.
