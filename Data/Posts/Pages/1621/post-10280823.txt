Uh, excuse me.


Can anyone here give me a clue to Raxxla ?

We would if we had any to give

Anything cooked so far after all these years is either incomplete or already disproven. The Brookes tour brought more people (I'm one of them), but things remain all over the place until someone gets an actual lead.
The tour's chosen destinations, as far as we can see, are all related to his role in developing the game's world:
Artemis - its asteroid base Freeholm is a key location in his novel Elite: Legacy
Beta Sculptoris - anything on launch that was not generated by Stellar Forge had his hand in it, so my theory is that it was chosen as a rich example of handcrafted system (seven different classes of stars, including a neutron one!)
Synuefe whatshisface - part of the Guardians' "arrowhead of influence" that stretches from the Regor sector
Taygeta - one of the Pleiades, and thus instrumental to the Thargoid War
PMD2009 48 - now here's where our tinfoil hats start heating up: why the Orion nebula, for the part when Raxxla is explicitly mentioned? (and yet, nothing comes out of it...)
