Just a note that the galactic regions were added around the time the Codex was launched. Before that, many of the regions were unofficially named by fan projects, which I believe Fdev adopted many of - been a long time, anyone know the facts on this?

Edit: Source for the timing of the Galactic Regions. Fdev post from Oct 2018

Therefore; if Raxxla was placed in the game at the start and there are celestial clues indicating that, it's extremely unlikely that any of the current Galactic region names relate to any pre-Codex elements. It's possible they do relate to the Raxxla Codex since they seem to have been implemented concurrently.
Personally seeing as Raxxla was in discussions long before this was implemented I never gave it a second thought, primarily because those sectors originally were simply numbered, as far as I recall the names were part inspired by players.

The concept is sound, but I canâ€™t see how the Codex applies to it presently, also if we are established upon a galaxy wide Easter egg hunt, which technically is in a haystack of needles the size of the literal galaxy, then I think FD would have made significantly more of this.

Back then exploration outside the bubble was only via player incentive, My impression of FD was that doing so back then was seen by them as far too laborious, also many if not all of the mysteries were kept inside the bubble.
