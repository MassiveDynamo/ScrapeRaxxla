Yeah great point and good info!

Drew did say in the video (memorial stream) that T James was the one to do a lot of work on the Thargoids lore (cos he used them extensively in his novel too). Then Drew went on to say that Brookes had plans for the Thargoids to be truly a terrifying horror and he wanted them to invade and destroy the bubble.

I'm paraphrasing Drew who was reminiscing on things almost a decade in the past but Drew said what Allen also said a while back, that Brookes was very into his Lovecraftian themes.
Something I heard Drew say is that Brookes was the biggest enthusiast of burning the bubble.
