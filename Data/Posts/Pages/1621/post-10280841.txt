I am actually about half way between Colonia and Beagle Point right now...
if you can supply a system name, or a group of systems, that is at those coordinates, I would be more than happy to go there after Beagle point, and FSS any systems of interest and report back... (I've played my last 100hrs on Steam Deck, so galmap coordinates are hard to see and find, but systems I can search for)

I'm planning to get to Beagle Point by the end of this weekend (if not today/tomorrow), so I could head to this area next week easily...

Edit: I'm exactly 300 jumps away from Beagle Point now. And I forgot I'm kinda busy this weekend, but I'll definitely be there by mid week, and then can start headed out anywhere anyone suggests

Well I'm pretty sure this is not going to pay off, so only go there if you're sanguine about that But it would be awesome to have someone actually check it out, just in case there's a stellar object there that's not visible on the map.

The exact location is where the circle is here in the "Newton's Vault" region:

The two nearest systems are: BYOI AUSCS BA-P D6-7 and BYOI AUSCS JR-A C15-0
If you were to go to one, and look towards the other, I think the sight-line would pass relatively close to the coordinates 23114, 584, 46931.

I've no idea how hard it is to get there, stars look pretty sparse out there.
