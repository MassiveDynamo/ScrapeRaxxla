There's one thing, I don't know where it came from, but the Thargoid motherships have been flying through systems in our galaxy long enough that we've been tracking them through the FSS.
You mean the arrival of the Maelstroms last year? Canonn charted their paths on this 3D map, if you're interested in where they originated. The exact origin is unknown of course, but you can see the areas they were first detected in, and they kept a straight course.

The only other one I know if mentioned in lore is the one Jameson infected with the Mycoid, which may have been the one that earlier attacked Carmichael Point. We know that originated in the Pleaides.
