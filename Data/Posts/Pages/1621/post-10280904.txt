"Browsing around today I noticed a lot of inaccurate attribution on a few websites. I thought it might be helpful to clarify a few things:

Initial background guidebook discussion group:

David Braben (Frontier)
Michael Brookes (Frontier)
Andrew Gillett (Frontier)
Allen Stroud
T James

Dave Hughes was invited into the group at my suggestion.

Allocation of drafting work:

Empire, Alliance, Federation - Allen Stroud
Collation of existing fiction - Michael Brookes
Initial Old Worlds region timeline work - Dave Hughes
Thargoids - T James

Later addtions:

Covert Ops - Allen Stroud (Most of this was never used).
Interstellar Police and Law Enforcement - Allen Stroud (Most of this was never used).
Corporate Guide Book - Allen Stroud
Stardreamer technology and Invention of Mark 3 Hyperdrives (last document I wrote. Not sure if it was used).
Some stuff on Artificial Intelligence, a few additional star system notes - Allen Stroud

Note, this was drafting work. Most of the documents were produced and then edited and changed by Frontier in the discussion and outside of the discussion with their own teams.

There was substantive discussion over the Elite game context (Old Worlds) and how it would be incorporated into the game. In the end, as there didn't seem to be much agreement, and we were all on a deadline, I wrote the guidebook for that as well.

These were the only people involved in the discussions in that period. I can't speak for anything later.

There are one or two wikis which seem to suggest other people were involved.

A lot of the guidebook material that was produced ended up as the the text for many of the tourist beacons, a fact that continually makes me smile."

Yeah great point and good info!

Drew did say in the video (memorial stream) that T James was the one to do a lot of work on the Thargoids lore (cos he used them extensively in his novel too). Then Drew went on to say that Brookes had plans for the Thargoids to be truly a terrifying horror and he wanted them to invade and destroy the bubble.

I'm paraphrasing Drew who was reminiscing on things almost a decade in the past but Drew said what Allen also said a while back, that Brookes was very into his Lovecraftian themes.
