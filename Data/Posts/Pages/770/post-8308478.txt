A fair point, but crazier theories have been concocted. The most popular and widely accepted hypothesis to date is that we have to travel into certain places in a certain order to "unlock" the door, which is much more elaborate than a simple "disconnect" design.

But we could spend all day talking about intentions and developers. The point of these conversations are to spark ideas, as a community we have no clue about how elaborate Raxxla is. It could be a simple undiscovered location or a massive puzzle requiring us to use knowledge of mathmatics and ancient Greek mythology. Until then, it's worth guessing.

being hostile with all spowers while 3Elite is a very, very simple mechanics That is its best merit. It might not even require the Elite part to be invited to DW. The path between DW and Raxxla is a whole other animal. Wagar couldn't touch Raxxla, but he did touch the DW. Would we be a step closer to Raxxla, is anyone's guess. For me, the only thing I have left in-game is to visit all the regions. I'm getting on that and then go to war. If nothing else, it will be great fun.
