being hostile with all spowers while 3Elite is a very, very simple mechanics That is its best merit. It might not even require the Elite part to be invited to DW. The path between DW and Raxxla is a whole other animal. Wagar couldn't touch Raxxla, but he did touch the DW. Would we be a step closer to Raxxla, is anyone's guess. For me, the only thing I have left in-game is to visit all the regions. I'm getting on that and then go to war. If nothing else, it will be great fun.

I agree that Elite may not be necessary to get the DW invitation, that came from the original Holdstock novella where Rafe said “One thing's for sure,' Rafe went on drily. 'Unless you get there, unless you become élite, you'll never get to Raxxla”.

But I remember something about them keeping their eye on/also recruiting Dangerous and Deadly. That ties in with Lori Jameson’s friendship requirement....
and she’s in Shinrarta alongside TDW!

Hypothesis-Lori Jameson is part of TDW!
