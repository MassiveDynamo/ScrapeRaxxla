But we could spend all day talking about intentions and developers. The point of these conversations are to spark ideas, as a community we have no clue about how elaborate Raxxla is. It could be a simple undiscovered location or a massive puzzle requiring us to use knowledge of mathmatics and ancient Greek mythology. Until then, it's worth guessing.

1. Guardians content is based on EulerÂ´s formula where decimal numbers are converted to a binary code.


Hyperjump animation is a helix pattern. One could try rolling (clockwise helix pattern) before the jump.
