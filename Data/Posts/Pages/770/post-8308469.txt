This is a game. Nobody will spend expensive programer's time just to make one time use "disconnect" mechanics. Raxxla should be in common wide game mechanics.
Also If I sit offline or fly deep space for months am I disconnected?

A fair point, but crazier theories have been concocted. The most popular and widely accepted hypothesis to date is that we have to travel into certain places in a certain order to "unlock" the door, which is much more elaborate than a simple "disconnect" design.

But we could spend all day talking about intentions and developers. The point of these conversations are to spark ideas, as a community we have no clue about how elaborate Raxxla is. It could be a simple undiscovered location or a massive puzzle requiring us to use knowledge of mathmatics and ancient Greek mythology. Until then, it's worth guessing.
