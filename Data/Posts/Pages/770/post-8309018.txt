I think all the info about the Coriolis station, is from fan fiction(Oolite). There are no official descriptions of Raxxla except for Rafe Zetters words, in The Dark Wheel.

Rafe's words: "Your father was chasing the mythical planet Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life…"

and : "Cirag is Cirag, and Raxxla—if it exists—is in another Galaxy".

In the context of TDW, another Galaxy means not in Galaxy 1, in the Galcop network.

but you're right, indeed, how simple it can be. an alien construction that serves as a teleport to another universe ... a targoid structure showing another galaxy, here it is a teleport.
