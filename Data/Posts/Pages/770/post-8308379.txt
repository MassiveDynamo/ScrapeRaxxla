Destroy pp ships, support independent factions, undermine pp controlled systems. A total war against the established ED order. That would be dangerous. I think that is how we would get the invite. We also happen to have an independent base fully stocked that doesn't make any sense to exist other than to support that kind of end game.

A lot of players including me do undermine PP control systems, currently giving the Feds a hard time near Sol Only problem is you have to signed up to one PP before you can really undermine another....I think. Not sure if with a concerted effort we could make one existing PP system uncontrolled and work out from there.

Anybody on XB want to wing up for PP let me know, I have a little routine of PP, assassination, courier, nav beacon & trade so do PP, faction rank, combat rank & trade rank all at the same time. Found some nice routes around enemy PP control systems.

Has anyone tried to pirate them with either hatch breaker limpets or something? What if that triggers a chain of events in some manner? I dont know what i would expect to happen but im not much of a pirate. Never managed liberate hostages or anything yet either...

Strangely enough no, I don't think I have tried to hatch break a funeral barge but I'm pretty sure I have manifest scanned them but cant remember if it says 'Escape Pod' or what now or if its empty. Private Courier Service more often than not carry passengers which always seem odd as usually theres 2 Belugas nearby and the Red Planet Taxi Service so thought the Courier would run packages / cargo not passengers but probably just a name and not a massive cover up front organisation moving people around in secret as I first thought I had uncovered...this game hey
