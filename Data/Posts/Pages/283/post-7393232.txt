Any old FRifters remember hostile npcs at the abandoned bases? What faction? Where did they jump to? Was there a cause of their hostility?
The DW2 fleet is being attacked at Conflux Delta base & this rings a bell, but advanced age & memory is poor...and babysitting grandson so searching the FRift threads is not on at the moment.
