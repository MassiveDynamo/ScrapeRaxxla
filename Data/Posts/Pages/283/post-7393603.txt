I finally acquired 3 SAP 8 core containers (can still be found carried by "Military Courier Vessel" in systems with war state). Going to try different things with them. Polaris and HIP 22460 are still permit locked, next i try is Triton in Sol.
Also on the list are the systems with "sap" in the name, getting scanned by a Thargoid interceptor, trigger an emp burst from the Thargoids, activate Guardian obelisk, terminal and beacon, some systems (not going to list all), the new cristaline lifeform things.

Any other things i could try?
