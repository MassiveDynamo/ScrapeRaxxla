Where will Hades show your way? And how? Orcus? Peregrina? I don't get this mythology aspect, but there is some effort in this process. Not that anything has been proven at all, though. Scripted meetings are not entirely unheard of, but those are pretty common names. I think there are pirates with more meaningful names, maybe let them steal some of your trinkets. I love it how Ariel appears in weirdest of places, asking for some tea.

Currently exploring Conflux in a Fer-de-lance. I don't know if there is anything out there, but the chance is tempting. It could prove Salome got it all wrong. It never was about humans migrating.
