Calling old FRifters! Got to post here since the FRift thread was locked.

I’m on DW2 and just heading to the Conflux abandoned bases. Didn’t get out here before during the FRift quest, but thought I’d have a scout around and see if I can uncover anything, especially since I think DW hinted that there was more to find related to the Dynasty plot and we now have the fss and planet probes.

Any ideas what to look for? Whereabouts? I suspect there may be at least one other megaship- makes sense to have one per expedition....

I looked on the galmap and I noticed the FRift bases are aligned loosely along the R-R line, but the Zurara is a fair way further out and offset from the line. However the Conflux bases seem to be aligned roughly along a line but it doesnt seem to point to either FRift bases, Zurara, or anything else which seems a tad odd. But I don’t remember any discussion about the actual location of these bases. Any thoughts?
