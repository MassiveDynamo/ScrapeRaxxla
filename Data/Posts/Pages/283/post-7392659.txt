My First Post for the Great Raxxla Hunt

I'll start my post with a couple of my questions;

Firstly, "Has anyone looked into Omphalos Infotech?"
Secondly, "Has anyone tried to locate the galactic location shown in raxxla's codex entry?"
Last but not least, "What tips are there?"

With my questions aside, I've a few (Hypothetical, need testing) solutions to a few of the communitiesâ€™:

-"Siren in the void" possibly refers to an ASTRONOMICAL Siren- Things we currently use in astronomy like landmarks for space.

-Maybe Raxxla is out of our reach, permit locked maybe, or somewhere like The Lemon Bubble. It would be ingame, never to be seen.

-Maybe Raxxla really is "A bit obvious" but SO OBVIOUS we dont give it second thought.

Those are my thoughts as of right now.
