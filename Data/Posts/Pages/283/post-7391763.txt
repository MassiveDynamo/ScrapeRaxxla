Sounds more like some kind of glitch to me. Anyway next time you post something that might be conspicuous remember to reset your router before and after posting and returning to the game, as the only way I could think of something like that can be done would be via IP Address logging. But actually nah - glitch. I cannot believe someone from FDev constantly monitoring the forums for content taht should not be posted...

Post was made with my in game name. Resetting my router won't release my IP. Flagging a post using a tool and monitoring it's existence is not difficult.
