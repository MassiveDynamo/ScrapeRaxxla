According to EDDB there are 15 stations named 'Laveykin something'. He was a Russian cosmonaut, apparently. All of those will show up in a GalMap search for 'Lave'.

So basically what you're saying is... The Russians took Raxxla?!

I'm kidding, but what is the working theory for Raxxla at this point? Has anyone even scratched the surface of this?
