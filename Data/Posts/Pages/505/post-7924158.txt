This is caused by the incorporation of Rl star catalogues. Some of these catalogues cover areas of the sky where observations have concentrated on a narrow angle only, and therefore there are a large number of stars in a cylinder that faces away from Sol. This is the case in NGC7822 where all the 'S-xxx' stars are from such an observation.

So yes if you see a large area like your plane of M's, its because of some RL astronomy study that got written in from a catalogue.

I had a feeling it might be something like that. That's why it doesn't hurt to ask.

I try to keep an eye out for anything that seems artificial, but I don't think that is going to work here. I thought I had found a stellar stream the first time I saw a 2MASS cluster. That obviously turned out to be a disappointment. I still keep the theory that there could be a stellar stream that acts as a bridge to something just outside of the Milky Way.
