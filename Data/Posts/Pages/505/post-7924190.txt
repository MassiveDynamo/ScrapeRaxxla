Didn't find any streams the first time around the galaxy. Then again, it doesn't have to start at the outer rim...

My main reason for thinking that comes from what I read in CoR's Holdstock Report, which describes The Dark Wheel as being a dark galaxy. The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is in the process of being absorbed by the Milky Way, and has a stream that wraps around the Milky Way several times. The stars seem to be old and at the end of their lives, which may make it seem "dark." A large percentage of the stars in Canis Major are red giants, which could fit with the codex image for the Dark Wheel. The thing is, I think that comes from old lore, and stellar streams may not even exist in the game. Everything seems to lead to a dead end.
