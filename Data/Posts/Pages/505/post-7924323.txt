Credit to you for the discovery. Try using EARTH.

It bounces between two systems, SOL and something called the EARTH EXPEDITIONARY FLEET.

Anyone ever heard of the Earth Expeditionary Fleet? (Closest system is EOL PROU ZO-U B18-28)

Also, while your searching names of systems, be on the look out as each comes up for the spelling of R-A-X-X-L-A

It may be a string of system names which spell it out. Hey man, to date we have found nothing. I think th Galaxy Map was designed to do this, as my results show more than just ending up in empty space, especially with the systems Earth and Lave, both in Elite from the start, and both doing different things.

Earth Expeditionary Fleet now open to all loyal Federation explorers
Thanks to the generous support of the fine folks in Okinura I am pleased to announce the formation of the Earth Expeditionary Fleet (EEF). What is EEF you might ask? The success of the Distant Worlds Expedition has inspired more and more Commanders to visit, explore and catalogue the many...

I'm thinking it was a system awarded to that faction for the Distant Worlds Expedition? EDSM says they are the main faction in that system. I wasn't around for all of that stuff, so I'm not sure.

Nevermind that, I don't think it had anything to do with DW. It does seem to be tied to a player faction, though.
