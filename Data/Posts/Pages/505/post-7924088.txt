I want to believe that Raxxla is indeed in game, that it hosts some kind of portal to other universes with all what it implies in matter of alien knowledge and treasures. I want to believe that DB and MB had enough sensibility and honesty to NOT defraud their customers as well as the creator of Raxxla.
(Amen.)
Well.. What I really would like is just another fresh galaxy to explore...
Patience, there's lots of groundwork to be done yet, but Elite Dangerous: Uncharted will come*.

*Well, we can hope. : ) Actual arrival may be less than implied.
