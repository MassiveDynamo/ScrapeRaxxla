Face value maybe, or it could be a clue (I like clues)

"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts."

Among other, borderline psychotic theories that I have come up with, lets try breaking this down...

Sentence 1 has 1 clue - To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
Sentence 2 has 2 clues - To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!
Sentence 3 has 3 clues - The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts

Could be the beginning of a Fibonacci Sequence.....

1 - My best guess is Sag A - Sag A is sometimes referred to as the "Mother of the Galaxy"
2 - My current thinking is somewhere in the Formidine Rift - Not meaning to mix my mysteries, but the comms at one of the club sites talks about this exact phrase.
3 - My best guess is Aganippe - This is based on Greek mythology, specifically Thebes. New Thebes is in Aganippe

Next in the sequence would be 5, which I have so far been unable to hazard a guess at, based on 1,2 & 3

Having suggested they adopt the Golden Mean for the engineering progression, which they didn't...

I'm not convinced Braben is aware of, or focused on the Fibonacci phenomena. I could be wrong...

[Edit: If they were, we should be observing this factor in Thargoid (bio / plant) aesthetics, but we don't. They seem to have applied a binary factor: 32, 64, 128 tharglets, the same as cargo capacity increase.]
