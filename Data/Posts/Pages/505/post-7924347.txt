I think it may have to do with the different designations. For example HIP 73849 is also HD 133708. I'm pretty sure that what I was searching could be a dead end, but you actually got a pretty good idea from it.
I originally searched that just because of "1337" being in the name, since it would be a reference to Elite. Then thinking about it after that, HD 1337 sounds like "H-Delete," which made me think of "Hexedit" and erased memories from the FR story. It was probably just a bunch of empty connections.

Lave is definitely interesting, though. considering the history of it, and the number of systems that seem to be associated with the name. How far apart are the systems that show up when searching? Would it be possible to jump to all of them in a single path?
