Also, is it normal for there to be a flat plane of stars of a certain class? In the Rift, there's a a layer of M class stars, in other areas I've seen it with L class stars.

I've only been playing for a few months, so I'm still catching up.
This is caused by the incorporation of Rl star catalogues. Some of these catalogues cover areas of the sky where observations have concentrated on a narrow angle only, and therefore there are a large number of stars in a cylinder that faces away from Sol. This is the case in NGC7822 where all the 'S-xxx' stars are from such an observation.

So yes if you see a large area like your plane of M's, its because of some RL astronomy study that got written in from a catalogue.
