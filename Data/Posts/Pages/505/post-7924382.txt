I was aware that stations and planets show up, I just think it's odd that so many would start with "Lave," but I haven't been to every system. "Holdstock" brings back 10 results, all in the bubble. I think if there is something to find, it would be outside the bubble. I've been trying everything, though. I even played around with the "hollow earth theory," and with more than just Earth.

"Holdstock Platform"
"Holdstock Enterprise"
"Holdstock Vista"
Yeah, I don't think that one is going anywhere either.

According to EDDB there are 15 stations named 'Laveykin something'. He was a Russian cosmonaut, apparently. All of those will show up in a GalMap search for 'Lave'.

Yuri Gagarin has 18 stations. It's just coincidence that Lave matches up with a Russian cosmonaut.

I remember getting excited by something similar, back in the Formidine Rift days, until I figured out what the search was doing.

I guess we shoukd be grateful there wasn't a cosmonaut named 'Raxxlaski'
