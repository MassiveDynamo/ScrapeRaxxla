Technically I think the whole game is amazing TBH. My point was less about technical and more about cost. As in, it would not be costing FD anything (or very little) to have a 2nd galaxy sat there, not being used, until we find it. Hope that makes sense.
The whole game is definitely amazing. However, being that's it's getting old to a lot of cmdrs and the fact that anyone who wouldn't want this in game is lying, it seems like the smartest option.

Is there someone that seriously doesn't want this?
