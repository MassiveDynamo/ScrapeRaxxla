I was aware that stations and planets show up, I just think it's odd that so many would start with "Lave," but I haven't been to every system. "Holdstock" brings back 10 results, all in the bubble. I think if there is something to find, it would be outside the bubble. I've been trying everything, though. I even played around with the "hollow earth theory," and with more than just Earth.

"Holdstock Platform"
"Holdstock Enterprise"
"Holdstock Vista"
Yeah, I don't think that one is going anywhere either.
