Granted, this is most likely a bug in the galaxy map, but I wonder what the search would reveal if we used the names of systems from the original game (1984) or if we used system names from Greek mythology. One thing I taught in cyber warfare is to find a bug in the system and then figure out if you can exploit it to your benefit.

To me, the system list may be a trail, if the right system name was used?

Maybe Frontier hid the path in the Galaxy Map.

I have nothing better to do, I will play with this "bug" for awhile.

EDIT: I tried this with "Lave" and it took me through about 14 systems, and then back to Lave, and ended there.
It does not work at all when I use REORTE or LEESTI, but it does work with LAVE.

This may not be a bug, but a search list.

I hadn't thought of this. I know you can cycle through systems by continuing to search, but it does seem odd that Lave would bring up multiple results. I can't get on until I put my little Thargoids to bed, but I'm going to try some other systems to see if anything happens.
