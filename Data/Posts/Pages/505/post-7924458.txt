A while ago I tried finding PSR J2222-0137. The main star is a pulsar, but the second star is a faint white dwarf with a temperature of only 3000 K. Apparently at this stage it is just compressing carbon, forming a planet size diamond. I thought it would be a good candidate for the "Jewel that burns in the brow of the mother of Galaxies," but I can't find it anywhere. There's no other designation for the system, and I tried searching the area where it should be. Has anybody else tried to find it?
