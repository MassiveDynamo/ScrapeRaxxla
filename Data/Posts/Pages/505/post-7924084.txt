So you mean, technically, it wouldn't be anything amazing to be able to "jump" from the current Milky Way to, let's say, the Large Magellanic Cloud ?
FD ! I want this !
Technically I think the whole game is amazing TBH. My point was less about technical and more about cost. As in, it would not be costing FD anything (or very little) to have a 2nd galaxy sat there, not being used, until we find it. Hope that makes sense.
