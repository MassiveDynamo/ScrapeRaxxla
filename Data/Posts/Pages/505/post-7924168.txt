I had a feeling it might be something like that. That's why it doesn't hurt to ask.

I try to keep an eye out for anything that seems artificial, but I don't think that is going to work here. I thought I had found a stellar stream the first time I saw a 2MASS cluster. That obviously turned out to be a disappointment. I still keep the theory that there could be a stellar stream that acts as a bridge to something just outside of the Milky Way.

Didn't find any streams the first time around the galaxy. Then again, it doesn't have to start at the outer rim...
