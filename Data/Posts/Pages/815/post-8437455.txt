Hate to say it bit I don't think anything will be 'connected' to Raxxla. Its the biggest and best secret or treasure hunt there is and fdev don't want it found as such because that would be the end of it. Nothing can compare with the search and they know it, as do we if we are honest. What a let down it will be the day after its found, regardless of what emergent gameplay may come from it, it cant compare to the fun of looking for it. Anybody remember the Remember Salome thread, 2 years of amazing fun and then it was just solved and that was the end of that. The buzz of it being solved soon wore off and there was nothing left.

Wrapped Christmas or Birthday presents are amazing, they could be anything, the moment they are unwrapped they just become 'things'. The act of unwrapping changes the object from the potential possible to the quantifiable actual and even if its what we always wanted its just another 'thing' to add to our collection of things. The unknown is far more exciting than the known.

I think fdev know this and its why there are Beacons, Comms Beacons, Guardian and Tharg sites, Megaships & Gen Ships - they keep trying to put mystery in to keep us going and I thank them for that. Keep the distractions going please fdev.

Given the choice Id like to find Raxxla when Im on my deathbed, just to finally know what it is and what the story is without the longer term deflation from actually knowing theres nothing left. And I wouldn't tell anyone coz I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone else either.
