Or:

We find out that Salome's Remlok suit did its job, sealing off her severed parts within the suit - which we hunt down to reanimate her. Only to find out- most of her body was blown into witchspace, saved by the Thargoids.

Salome returns as a Thargoid hybrid, controlling their Fleetcarrier (Basestar). She no longer wants to deliver a message - she's come back for revenge on the human race. She can be heard saying, "Jump!" on all system channels as her Fleet carrier gets closer to it's attack on Sol.

After most of Sol is destroyed with black-hole weapon tech, Sol's survivors find Raxxla - discovering it's jump-gate ability and flee to Colonia which has a lot of new Grade 6 engineers and mech upgrades for the Cmdrs.

Different anamolies can be captured in special cargo bays for bonuses to weapons or jump range. Some generate specific cargo daily while in captivity. Rare ones generate pieces of a wayfinder to the real Soontil, where the weapon to take Sol back from the Thargoids exists.

But after wiping out the thargoids and destroying their Dyson Sphere around our old sun, the Guardian Exiles return fighting the AI constructs and their Comet Empire, meaning we have to grind for new weapons- pick a side - adopt a guardian AI SLF pilot.

Opening witchspace with the severed-hybrid-hand-of-Salome and take the fight back to their homeworld, but only after modifying our cmdrs for Ammonia based worlds.

So witch is it? Black Hole or Dyson Sphere?
