If that were the case, wouldnt it be in their best interest to to not put it in the game and just let all of us run in circles? It would save on the time spent developing whatever may have been needed to be done. Then confirming it is in game...

Then they get all uppity because people were chasing after that Gan Romero news story and as a result pretty much ended news stories in game.

To me, this implies that they wouldnt want us wasting our time looking for something they dont want to be found, when we could be doing things they intended for us to do. Just my view on the situation from my logic's stand point
