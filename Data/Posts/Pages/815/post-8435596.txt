I found another book potentially connected to Raxxla in some way. I want to say specifically i am only assuming it could be connected based on the description on the site.

Space Wars, Worlds & Weapons
Space Wars, Worlds & Weapons, Steven Eisler w/ Foss Crescent Books, New York, 1979 96pp, 92 full color illustrations, 5 b/w illustrations I suspect Space Wars, and its stablemate The Alien Worl...
www.terrantradeauthority.com

It's by Steven Eisler aka Robert Holdstock. Also i would suggest that either the people who run this site may be unfamiliar with Steven Eisler or he also has more pen names then we are aware of. Sorry that the site doesnt offer any useful information and i can barely find any info on this book at all. But perhaps some of you may have this somewhere and forgot about it or have heard of the other pen name they give for him , Steven Caldwell.

I hope this someone can find this useful in some way.

Edit: i personally do not believe Steven Caldwell to be one of his pen names however I found this list of pen names he did use on google....

Robert Holdstock's pseudonyms included Robert Faulcon, Chris Carlsen, Richard Kirk, Robert Black, Ken Blake, and Steven Eisler.

I have this - Its a little weird, kind of a thematic introduction to sci-fi and fantasy novels - chapters on Space Vehicles,Wars, Creatures, Fantasy.. but referencing other authors works and stories. Also the standard set of amazing 70s scifi art, but he has put his own spin on things and woven it all into a sort of history. The glossary has some interesting tidbits
