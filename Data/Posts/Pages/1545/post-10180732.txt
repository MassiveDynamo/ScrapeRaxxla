Just like how the Thargoids and the Guardians are one and the same.
any foundation for this other than "i think"?

I wonder why Titans fly instead of jumping like aircraft carriers. I read somewhere that the first guardian ships had no engines and were thrown from catapults.
you mean the stargoid light we were getting? i thought those were energy byproduct of a large object traveling through witchspace. carriers dont exactly jump either afaik, rather its tearing a hole in space that we squeeze through in same way goids do. the difference is they can freely operate within, while we do more of a slingshot and splat on an astronomical body.
