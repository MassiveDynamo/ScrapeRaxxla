Citation please. Galactic Cooperative and Old Worlds Coalition were cooperatives. The tourist beacon in Lave says unambiguously that Walden came to power in August 3174. If that is when the first game actually takes place, the Thargoids were not defeated and he did not end the war. I also have my doubts on a single human defeating an entire species in existence long before humans.

If there are Thargoids in 3174, we have much bigger problems. They per multiple sources were supposedly gone by 3151 with no traces.

Walden comes to power as Galactic Cooperative is collapsing. See GCS Saravasti.

The bar here is low. Literally anything from any neighboring systems suggestive of a prior dictatorship in Lave. Otherwise, this was Walden keeping himself in power by altering perceptions of the past by the local population. This is a common tactic for dictatorships ( and ).
Yes, the Thargoids vanishing in 3151 would tally with the events in Elite II, set in 3200, as there were no Thargoids flying around then. Only on some secret military bases could their ships be found, apparently dug up by the military forces studying them.
