I think I have to back to the Old Worlds. Understanding whether the First Thargoid War happened is somehow central to Raxxla. You just don't bury that much history for nothing. More importantly you don't just pretend all of a sudden your system dependent on oak barrels from Earth is in no way connected. A lot of things don't jive with that.
