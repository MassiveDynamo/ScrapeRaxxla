The book for me still brings more questions than answers if Raxxla is based on the lore from it, not least the fact it mentions the Dark Wheel as mythical a place not an organisation, though im sure Raxxla was born from the books idea and not word for word.
I am running with it because the following:

The Dark Wheel is linked to the Naranthu Sector.
Our flightsuits from all appearances match Naranthu.
The orbital installations may be Naranthu based on multiple of the books and designs posted in "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide".
The Dark Wheel novella and Lavian Brandy directly link to Earth.
Reorte links to Earth via Faulcon Manspace and ultimately Faulcon Delacy's work for the Galactic Navy and Sirius Corporation.
Lakon Spaceways Transporter in the original game manual is derived from a spacecraft developed in Sol. The Type-6 and Keelback are the modern equivalent with Keelback being the militarized version.
The Lakon Spaceways Asp is directly linked to the Galactic Navy and thus Sol.
There is evidence to suggest Walden or someone erased Sol from the Galactic Maps to bury the past.
