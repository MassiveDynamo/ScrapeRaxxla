That said, I am not convinced at all that is legitimately gone. The whole of the California Nebula region and Turner Research Group strongly suggests that not is as it seems. This doesn't even get into the weirdness that there are Thargoids in the first game but using clues such as in-service dates of ships and the fact Lave was a dictatorship suggests that something about the past isn't entirely as it seems. Walden comes to power AFTER the "First Thargoid War" in August 3174. The "Thargoids" should have vanished in 3151. I also do not believe Sohalian Fever was retconned based on GalNet and events of Cereberus Plague.
Turner’s activity in the Pleiades have been reconfirmed in ED, in several ways. All that happens before ‘the player’ starts to control the events in FFE. The player must chose to help the Thargoids for the diplomacy to happen.
Only the authors were told that this was the chosen branch, that would be used in ED.
They got a bit miffed, when the branch was dropped, because some of them had mentioned it in their work.
The fist game happens from 3125, during the war. You play as commander Jameson. Most likely John. The guy that ends the war.
No mystery there, Lave had other dictators before Waldon.
