I mean what’s this triangle nonsense about? Likely just a reference to the mystery livestream prize, maybe it’s cheese…


Did you see the blue m&m triangle they made on the desk the other week?

Definitely made a point of blue m&m ones only...

So guardian related?

And they made a point about listening for other things in the scanners a while back when the Maelstroms first arrived but that could have meant the other ones... Think they were supposed to be found that way rather than the graphical bugs they had when they released them ..
