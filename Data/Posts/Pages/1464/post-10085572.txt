Pretty sure I read somewhere that the myth of Raxxla is as old as spaceflight itself. Which means that the low-powered rogue station of the TDW can't be Raxxla.

It's possible that the Dark Wheel station is in orbit of Raxxla, but even that's a stretch, considering old lore states directly that they were searching for it, just like the rest.
It has been confirmed that TDW haven't found Raxxla. At least they hadn't at the start of ED. Unless the DW station is brand new, it's neider Raxxla nor in orbit around it.
