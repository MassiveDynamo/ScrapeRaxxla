It has been confirmed that TDW haven't found Raxxla. At least they hadn't at the start of ED. Unless the DW station is brand new, it's neider Raxxla nor in orbit around it.
The claim of TDW not finding Raxxla is in reference to Soontill and dependent on Soontill being legitimate. There's just several very big problems with that claim:

-Soontill per the book had a brown dwarf. There is no brown dwarf in the system labelled Soontill.
-Soontill 1 where the secret base supposedly exists is utterly unlandable: atmospheric pressure is >9M times that of Earth, the surface is hotter than most stars, and gravity is far too high to be suitable for Thargoids (3.48G). For perspective, this is extreme enough to make Venus look tame by comparison.
-There is Technetium present like the book description. This, however, should be more common in systems suitable for Guardians if you consider the typical zone of habitability.
-When the atmosphere of a planet contains both silicates and iron you know you have truly found an incarnation of Hell/Hades/etc except much worse than the mythological versions.
