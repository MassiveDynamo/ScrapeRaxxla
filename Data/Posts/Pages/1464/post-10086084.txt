The claim of TDW not finding Raxxla is in reference to Soontill and dependent on Soontill being legitimate. There's just several very big problems with that claim:

-Soontill per the book had a brown dwarf. There is no brown dwarf in the system labelled Soontill.
-Soontill 1 where the secret base supposedly exists is utterly unlandable: atmospheric pressure is >9M times that of Earth, the surface is hotter than most stars, and gravity is far too high to be suitable for Thargoids (3.48G). For perspective, this is extreme enough to make Venus look tame by comparison.
-There is Technetium present like the book description. This, however, should be more common in systems suitable for Guardians if you consider the typical zone of habitability.
-When the atmosphere of a planet contains both silicates and iron you know you have truly found an incarnation of Hell/Hades/etc except much worse than the mythological versions.

It has nothing to do with Soontill and the Soontill system being poorly modelled.

In this post, first question: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...eel-may-contain-spoilers.402645/#post-6366667 (Thargoid is John Harper)

"
The second scene on the Behemoth confirms the FFE main storyline and that the Dark Wheel didn't find Raxxla.

WHILE AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS WAS TRUE AS PER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY FD, THE FIRST ENCOUNTERS STORYLINE WAS LATER REDACTED."

The FFE main storyline being redacted is of course 'the great retcon' that angered several authors and lots of players, back when it happened.

The part about Raxxla has nothing to do with FFE at all. It's just a piece of information provided by FD to the authors.

All this happened years ago. TDW have had time to find Raxxla, since then. I doubt that they moved their station there, though.
