Nice set of docs, that’s what’s missing from online games, a good bit of supporting material. I still have a boxed copy of ZX Spectrum Elite including the eponymous Dark Wheel Novella and a superb Pilots Federation manual.

That said what’s missing from the lore and these docs is the Space Station that is Wheel shaped and Dark - they may have been scientific and engineering genius but they had little imagination when naming themselves.
