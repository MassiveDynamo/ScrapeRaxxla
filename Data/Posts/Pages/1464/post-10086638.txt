I might be too straightforward but from the general direction of many of the posts previous it seems unraveling the “Toast” of the Dark Wheel points somewhere or allows you to get somewhere - either their Space Station or perhaps Raxxla. The printed lore however states very clearly “According to accepted spacer lore, membership in the Dark Wheel is by invitation only, and only the most exceptional pilots of each generation ever receive them.”.
