You are forgetting who ran the Soontill auctions and sold the good purported to be from Soontill - Robert Garry (Garry's Reclamations sells the Soontill Relics). The whole of the Soontill saga is very much designed to cover up Raxxla was found. The Soontill story is flimsy at best.

Let me repeat. There is no way in hell someone has ever set foot on Soontill 1. It is beyond inhospitable. In fact, it is a place actively hostile to any life. Soontill is a fraud. Robert Garry is in on pushing this narrative and he is a traitor to human-kind. The same can be said for Jaques who pushed the alien relics alongside Jjagged Bbanner (the Dreamware band).

Also, if I get my hands on the Ryders, Jaques, Robert Garry, or any other members of The Dark Wheel they will spaced while the ship is in supercruise.

Dude.
The Soontil system is confirmed, by the author himself, to be the location of Soontill itself.
The book was written before the galaxy was generated, and they chose only find a star that was roughly in the correct location. They made no real effort to edit the system since to accurately reflect as it is in the book. All this was said as much by the Author himself during an livestream interview also involving Drew, the author of "Lave Revolution", and someone else. I don't remember which video or where it is. I thought it was one of Drew's streams but he doesn't seem to have it. The stream occurred in roughly early 2019 (3305).
Anyway, you cant really judge anything in Soontill Lore accurately as the whole system is mismodeled. No tinfoil there. yet.
