Mmm but here in lies the problem, if there is something in game which no one has ever been able to find because it literally is so obvious, then we need to reassess our practice!

If it’s not related to Raxxla then such expenditure of energy is fruitless, if it is Raxxla then we need to assess the evidence provided to us and the most obvious solutions?

According to Frontier Developments themselves, via their spokesperson M Brookes, it is in the galaxy. Ergo it can’t literally be in our ship? It has a location.

If it’s ‘obvious’ then is it some ‘obvious’ visual clue within the galaxy map, or some obvious concentration or cluster of stars or names or a very obvious nebula which any layperson could find…

One persons idea or glaringly obvious is another person’s idea of earth shatteringly pedestrian.

We are all guilty of overthinking this, primarily because we had nothing to go off for several year apart from our own arcane thoughts or institutional thinking.

It would stand to reason for FD to implement Raxxla or the DW as something very innocuous.

I mean what’s this nonsense about?

I guess we think differently. Personally, I would show the triangle differently. I asked 5 random people to make a triangle out of their fingers and they did the same as in the video.

Maybe he's just asking for a mug of drink to be brought to him, too?
