Looking at this with a fresh-ish set of eyes. It’s hard to think what can be done that’s not already been done to get an invitation to “The Dark Wheel”.
Per Shinrarta Dezra, The Dark Wheel is part of The Pilots' Federation. We are all part of that already. The Dark Wheel and Elite Pilots' Federation are part of the leadership of The Pilot's Federation. You cannot join something you are a member of already. The goal appears to be more exposing them not joining them much like Salomé stated. Joining them keeps things hidden. A large portion of the past appears legitimate. Keep in mind, a sizeable portion of the Engineers have criminal backgrounds. These aren't folks I would call angels but they aren't devils, either. The other thing worth noting is that engineering data from FSDs strongly suggests that navigation computers upload telemetry before a jump happens. The same is true of fleet carrier jumps, as upload of telemetry happens at 40 seconds before the jump. Our jumps are very likely externally configured. I am pretty sure Faraway was just another term for Raxxla.
