Could be anything but a well spotted mention in this weeks frameshift (February 2023) of "something right in front of our eyes that has not been discovered yet!"

Curious statement on the Frameshift Live today…
In the Frameshift Live stream today, around 1:07:20 in, there is a brief 30 second statement by Arthur. Arthur states there are obvious game events and things like the war,… but also states that there is stuff right in front of us that we are missing. Anyone else catch this? Any thoughts?
