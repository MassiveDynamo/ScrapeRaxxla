You are forgetting who ran the Soontill auctions and sold the good purported to be from Soontill - Robert Garry (Garry's Reclamations sells the Soontill Relics). The whole of the Soontill saga is very much designed to cover up Raxxla was found. The Soontill story is flimsy at best.



Let me repeat. There is no way in hell someone has ever set foot on Soontill 1. It is beyond inhospitable. In fact, it is a place actively hostile to any life. Soontill is a fraud. Robert Garry is in on pushing this narrative and he is a traitor to human-kind. The same can be said for Jaques who pushed the alien relics alongside Jjagged Bbanner (the Dreamware band).

Also, if I get my hands on the Ryders, Jaques, Robert Garry, or any other members of The Dark Wheel they will spaced while the ship is in supercruise.
