Did you see the blue m&m triangle they made on the desk the other week?

Definitely made a point of blue m&m ones only...

Our ships interface panels form from blue triangles that look like Guardian Active Obelisks. It is one of the reasons I suspect Thargoids are Guardians and our tech is based off them.
