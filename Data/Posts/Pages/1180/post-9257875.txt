That is certainly an interesting find! I have read up on it and checked some systems in the general region of Serpens Caput, but I think the most interesting thing I took away from it was that the way Hoag's Object looks like, could be related to the center symbol of the Raxxla logo. Hoag's Object is a unique ring galaxy, and it pretty much is a ring with a dot in the middle. It is also surrounded by 6 constellations I think, so... idk. Could be a hint. Could be nothing. But since I never heard of that ring galaxy before, it was definitely educational
And one of the surrounding constellations happens to be a crown with a star referred to as 'the Jewel'
