Henlo frens! I think I found Raxxla. Again. yawn

Buuut, the timing intrigued me. They got out their first stuff in '78, Holdstock published his famous novella in 1980, Elite got out in '84. And btw, it stands for Revolution Axis Opens Lights Ahead. So Raxxla might just well be an acronym.

Nice one. Revolution axis is cool. I also like that the first song is called 84's man.
