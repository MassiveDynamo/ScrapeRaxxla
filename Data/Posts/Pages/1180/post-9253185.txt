Picked up a rescue mission yesterday, for a faction I suspect might be TRDW, to collect 8 occupied escape pods and deliver to some outpost 0.14ly deep in a nearby system. Aha thinks I, might be a recruitment mission! 6 days to complete.
Carried on ranking up young Tyko. Downloaded the Horizons update this morning. Logged in, accepted two commodity collection missions. Flew to a system with one of the required commodities. Landed & entered hangar, screen apparently smeared with petroleum jelly, couldnt see a dam thing! Long delay pulling up the system services screen, game crash-Scarlet Krait!!
Restarted game, loaded hold with first required commodity, flew to adjacent system for second, landed, pulled up commodities market. No mission! Looked in transactions tab-second transportation mission AND the suspect TRDW mission disappeared!



Edit: Mission now reappeared in transactions tab! Thanks FD!
