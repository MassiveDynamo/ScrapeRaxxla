Hi guys. This is my last message on this thread. I wanted to say farewell to you all. I lost my hope and ambition to search Raxxla, and i dont plan to go online in ED for a long long time. Its hard to tell what i feel or think, but i kinda feel lost, betrayed, fooled... I know no one promised us anything, i know it was all space madness, tinfoil and the fun while sharing ideas with other commanders. But searching something for a very long time and finding yourself at ground zero every time you chase a "clue" is very disappointing. Lack of information and motivation made me have this choice. Well, sometimes yo go to the end of rainbow, but you realize the leprechauns booby trapped the pot. I thank you all, especially @[PS4] Filthymick420 @simulacrae @Jorki Rasalas @Han_Zen @Machina Ergo Sum @ScolioTheMost for great ideas and help for lore and knowledge. I hope; "the cake is not a lie" and one day you all satisfy your curiosity and hunger for mysteries.
