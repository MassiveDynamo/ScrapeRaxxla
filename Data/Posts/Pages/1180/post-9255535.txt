Hi guys. This is my last message on this thread. I wanted to say farewell to you all. I lost my hope and ambition to search Raxxla, and i dont plan to go online in ED for a long long time...

Ahhhh ya I know the feeling Sorry to hear you are leaving - But ya we all take "Breaks" from the search - hope to see you back again some time!
