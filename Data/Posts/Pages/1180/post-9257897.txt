Yeah, good old Alphecca/Alphekka. Which I managed to tag with First Discovered when they updated it in the last patch I am pretty much out of ideas though what to try. Is Hoag's Object even visible on the skybox? I tried to find it, but if it is depicted on the skybox, then it is very small and I couldnt see the ring structure of it.
