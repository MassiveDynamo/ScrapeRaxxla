Some of you may remember I've been keeping a secret for a friend while trying to ask vague questions of you all pertaining to it. Well, the cats out of the bag as he has decided to go public with it.
That is certainly an interesting find! I have read up on it and checked some systems in the general region of Serpens Caput, but I think the most interesting thing I took away from it was that the way Hoag's Object looks like, could be related to the center symbol of the Raxxla logo. Hoag's Object is a unique ring galaxy, and it pretty much is a ring with a dot in the middle. It is also surrounded by 6 constellations I think, so... idk. Could be a hint. Could be nothing. But since I never heard of that ring galaxy before, it was definitely educational
