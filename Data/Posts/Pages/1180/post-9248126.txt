Cthulhu go home!
But no, the major tharg invasion of the bubble was due for a week Thursday, but has been delayed until Odyssey console release they’ve made their peanut butter sandwiches and all their mums have made them aluminium foil underwear because they’ve heard how warm it is around here!
Cthulhu is always waiting .... but ya guess we wait till the 3rd to see what exciting thing happens to the Alexandria. Yup summer is upon us - got toasty here today as well.
