Scytale, I am disappointed in you; spreading misinformation!
The quote is “To the whisperer in witch-space”
Whisperer, not whispering. There’s a significant difference!
Present participle, not subject noun
YOU disappoint me when not assuming, after all these years, how teribble my Englich is, Pa !
Make a small effort and try to understand the writing of a Spaniard who speaks English like a French cow bred in Switzerland, please ! (Brexit delights.. pfff...)
I meant investigate the whispers we can hear when in witchspace !
