The whispering in witchspace (the deepest possible void) is what I'd try to investigate through a sound app... if I kept playing.
As this is where we are told that Raxxla "sings".
(Btw, can't remember if you were given our Squadron anti-space madness gear ?)

Scytale, I am disappointed in you; spreading misinformation!
The quote is “To the whisperer in witch-space”
Whisperer, not whispering. There’s a significant difference!
Present participle, not subject noun
