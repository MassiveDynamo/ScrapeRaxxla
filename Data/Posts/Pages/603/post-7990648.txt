Are you sure that’s the NS beams and not just an artefact of the shader due to high light intensity?

Meant to say, but forgot to post, that the green orbs you were asking about seem fairly common. Seen them all over during witchspace tunnel, but never tested if they’re repeatable. What I occasionally see is yellow “spider’s webs”, which is a bit spooky. Did wonder if that’s where goids hatch.
Just strange, I know I'm fairly new compared to "the old guard", but that I have visited about 12,000 systems, and then in the area above Sag A, which is sometimes called the mother of the galaxy, I have seen 3 different witch space anomalies that I personally have not come across before. maybe I'm looking harder
