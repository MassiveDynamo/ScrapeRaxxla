Has anyone investigated the many zero population federal systems? The alliance and empire do not seem to have them except for detention center systems. One of them happens to be a system that is part of Elite: legacy. Many have economies, but other do not. These sorts of systems (excluding detention centers) seem to be limited to federal space. (I did not do an exhaustive search so i may have missed some in the other super powers.)

Just a few examples (there appears to be many more)

How can they have Allegiance and Economy if they have zero population?
Just means Empire & Alliance colonists headed for the greener grass!
