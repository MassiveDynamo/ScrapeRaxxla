Just strange, I know I'm fairly new compared to "the old guard", but that I have visited about 12,000 systems, and then in the area above Sag A, which is sometimes called the mother of the galaxy, I have seen 3 different witch space anomalies that I personally have not come across before. maybe I'm looking harder
Can't help you there. I was so many times told that the witchspace cinematics is just a loading screen without any significance that I came to believe it...
Please, prove them I was / you are right !
