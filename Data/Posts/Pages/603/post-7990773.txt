But don’t forget that TDW are “a legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters”. Somehow I don’t think bounty hunting/massacre missions would be their style.
Perhaps the test will involve having travelled to Sag A*, Beagle Point, Colonia, got Elite explorer and sold Hutton Mugs?

Trade: risky smuggling.
Combat: overwhelming powerful adversaries.
