Can't help you there. I was so many times told that the witchspace cinematics is just a loading screen without any significance that I came to believe it...

Yep. I know they are a loading screen, but when I first turn on the game, I get a loading screen that rotates information for new players. There is nothing to say there cant be hinst for experienced players in these witch space loading screens. They are clearly not the same on each jump, or we wouldn't be discussing anomalies.
