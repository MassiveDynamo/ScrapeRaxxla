But don’t forget that TDW are “a legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters”. Somehow I don’t think bounty hunting/massacre missions would be their style.

Perhaps the test will involve having travelled to Sag A*, Beagle Point, Colonia, got Elite explorer and sold Hutton Mugs? Mmm, thinking about this I suspect Jorki stands a better chance than young clone Tyko! (who has been posting here a lot recently, should never have shown him the password to my forum account!).


Edit: on a philosophical note (for Thatchinho )
Perhaps we participants in this discussion group are TDW, revolving around the thread as the hub, funnelling down (Omphalos rift) into a black hole of endless speculation and conjecture. Raxxla is where we reach a state of cosmic enlightenment and realise it is not important in the reality of things and go off to play Star Citizen? On current state of progress of SC it should take us around another 5 years before attaining Nirvana.

(Of course some may attain that state before others. Such is the way of life grasshopper! )
