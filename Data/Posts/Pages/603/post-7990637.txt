Has anybody seen this in other sectors? The beams of the NS visible for the last 3/4 seconds of the witch space tunnel?

Are you sure that’s the NS beams and not just an artefact of the shader due to high light intensity?

Meant to say, but forgot to post, that the green orbs you were asking about seem fairly common. Seen them all over during witchspace tunnel, but never tested if they’re repeatable. What I occasionally see is yellow “spider’s webs”, which is a bit spooky. Did wonder if that’s where goids hatch.
