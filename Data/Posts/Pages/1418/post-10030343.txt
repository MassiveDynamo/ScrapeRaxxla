bound for Tau Ceti, and the first recorded mention of Raxxla was by someone in Tau Ceti 199 years later.
Tau Ceti is a very interesting lead in this, I got the same gut feel. So much in the Codex wants us to look in that direction.

Itâ€™s also possible that Raxxla is the name of one of the lost generation ships...
Yeah, but are we jumping to conclusions a bit too quickly here? Following the leads from the codex to the gen ships is a healthy idea though.

FTL for about 150 years. Michael Brooks explains it
Ah, nope, I'm staying away from this non-cannon leads now hehe. The whole idea 'how far could we travel in the past/what kind of drive limited us' is something they may have changed due to new teams, new producers, new designers over time.

Remember that the Raxxla Codex says Raxxla is a "definite place".
Exactamundo, good point.

I still think we need to pick the genships as (all including the ignored ones) has shown.
Go one place, find something, then a new direction - repeat - perhaps triangulating a bit.

In all of this, there may be some leads in the text (toast) itself that needs some out of the box thinking.
Like the toast cloud be a number-station message - or something we find along the way. It's out in the open, but some of it may need decoding.
