Interesting!
But note that it’s “parent’s”, which is singular parent (both or many parents would be “parents’ “, unless it’s down to FD grammar again!) so the Generation ship Pleione interpretation wouldn’t fit. But Atlas might well fit. So are there any other mentions of this crewmember? Does the location of that ship somehow fit the preceding parts of the toast? I did get the logs of all the generation ships a while ago but can’t remember anything standing out. Might be worth exploring this hypothesis!
Thinking further, the yearning of our vagabond hearts may be a clue telling us to look for the Generation Ships, as I interpret 'vagabond' in this context to mean 'homeless' and the crews of Generation Ships are certainly people yearning to arrive at a place that they can call home.

Quite right about the punctuation but it still fits if the person making the logs is the individual referred to. I shall have to examine the names again of the individuals that made the logs.
In the meantime, if there are only two individuals in the third line, then perhaps the two Generation Ships, Atlas in Charick's Drift (a white dwarf star - it is just outside the jet cones) and Pleione in Hez Ur, make a line that leads to something?
