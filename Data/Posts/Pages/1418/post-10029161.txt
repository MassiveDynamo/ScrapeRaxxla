I've been slowly catching up on this thread and have had a few thoughts and observations to share.

Hyperspace:
I like the idea of hiding clues here. One thing I have noticed, that I think has only been in the hyperspace sequence since the FSS was introduced, is what seems to be an apparition of the Andromeda galaxy. It appears (always) towards the end of the sequence, alongside what I think is the Triangulum galaxy M33, and I have circled it in yellow on a recent screenshot:
SPOILER

The Raxxla poem:
The third line: The parent's grief, the lover's woe and the yearning of our vagabond hearts.

This stands out as the only line that does not begin with 'To', making me think that it is not referring to a place.
So, if not a place, what it it referring to?
The parent's and the lover's both imply that there is an individual at play: the 'parent' and the 'lover'. So perhaps these are people?
This led me to think of individuals represented in-game who might qualify.
It hit me last night: these might be individuals transcribing the logs from the Generation Ships, as I could think of one or two who might qualify:
Generation Ship Atlas, Charick Drift: the logs were written by a crewmember who had to remain on board whilst his pregnant partner left the ship to start a new life on a new world. This seems to me to be a good match for lover's woe.
Generation Ship Peione, Hez Ur: on this ship there was a problem with the crew only producing male offspring, such that they eventually died out. I think this is a good match for parent's grief.
There are three more Generation Ships that I have yet to visit and I want to do so in person, in case something is secretly unlocked by having the right set of logs. The yearning of our vagabond hearts is less clear at the moment but perhaps you will have some ideas on the subject?
