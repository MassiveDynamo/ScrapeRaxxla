Just to add, we may have not found all in-game Gen ships yet either......Where is the first ever Gen ship

The first Generation Ship was launched from Sol in 2097, as early space colonization efforts had finally begun to make headway on the Moon and Mars after the setbacks caused by World War III. It was followed by approximately 70,000 other vessels over the next several decades.
