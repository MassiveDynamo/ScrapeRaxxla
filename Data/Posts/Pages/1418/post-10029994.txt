Just to add, we may have not found all in-game Gen ships yet either......Where is the first ever Gen ship

The first Generation Ship was launched from Sol in 2097, as early space colonization efforts had finally begun to make headway on the Moon and Mars after the setbacks caused by World War III. It was followed by approximately 70,000 other vessels over the next several decades.
Interesting. I just looked that up, and apparently it was bound for Tau Ceti, and the first recorded mention of Raxxla was by someone in Tau Ceti 199 years later...

Tau Ceti is only around 12ly away, so it's feasible the Mayflower made it.

It is apparently the first colony outside the solar system (possibly due to the Mayflower 97), and the first place alien life was discovered.

Not in game right now, but it could be worth investigating, but I suspect I will not have much time this weekend.

I'm not sure where to find the origin of this information, but according to this post, the Mayflower did arrive in Tau Ceti after 58 years.

Generation Ships: All you need to know
I posted some musings on Generation Ships in a thread in the main forum, and popular demand (well, OK, it was DNA-Decay, but I'm sure he's quite popular in some parts) requested I post the information in the Lore subforum, so it didn't get lost. Rather than simply duplicate it, I'll reformat it...

Given that the codex entry on Raxxla says that the first quote suggested it was in use for some time, it's possible it was a legend known to (or even started by) the inhabitants of the Mayflower
