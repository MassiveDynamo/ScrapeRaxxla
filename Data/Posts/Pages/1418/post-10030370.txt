Tau Ceti is a very interesting lead in this, I got the same gut feel. So much in the Codex wants us to look in that direction.

Yeah, but are we jumping to conclusions a bit too quickly here? Following the leads from the codex to the gen ships is a healthy idea though.

Yes, the repetition of Tau Ceti is interesting, and I like the idea of a generation ship matching the Toast since (finally!) this begins to sound like an in-game Raxxla storyline...can anyone remember when Atlas was first found?

The seventh generation ship has been found in the Charick Drift system. Generation ship Atlas. Full directions, audio logs included. o7 to CMDR Dilliam who made the discovery on Xbox. Good find Commander! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXUUwQ2AGzo

N.B. codex was released Beyond - Chapter Four 11 DEC 3304 (2018) )

But since we “don't know what it is “ a little speculation can’t hurt, & I’m still trying to make some sense of the logo...it looks to me like the representation of a space station & that would imply a specific one. Perhaps that’s where the Omphalos device is hidden? Or it is Raxxla? Just spinning ideas.

But the near bubble, and Tau Ceti especially, has been searched to death; so whatever it is must be well hidden!

Might get back into the cockpit again this afternoon & get Tyko a bit closer to the next destination...space can’t be much colder than my living room!
