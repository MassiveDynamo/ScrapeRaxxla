Interesting. I just looked that up, and apparently it was bound for Tau Ceti, and the first recorded mention of Raxxla was by someone in Tau Ceti 199 years later...

Tau Ceti is only around 12ly away, so it's feasible the Mayflower made it.

It is apparently the first colony outside the solar system (possibly due to the Mayflower 97), and the first place alien life was discovered.

Not in game right now, but it could be worth investigating, but I suspect I will not have much time this weekend.

I'm not sure where to find the origin of this information, but according to this post, the Mayflower did arrive in Tau Ceti after 58 years.


Given that the codex entry on Raxxla says that the first quote suggested it was in use for some time, it's possible it was a legend known to (or even started by) the inhabitants of the Mayflower

It’s also possible that Raxxla is the name of one of the lost generation ships...
Think the info about Mayflower arrival is in the Tourist Beacons somewhere....
Edit: Ah no, just checked the TB spreadsheet & not there. Should be in the codex then. Can’t see anything in Galnet search. In-game system description?
Edit2: “The Mayflower 97 took 58 years to travel the 11.97 LYs to Tau Ceti” according to Sapyx, but no source reference

Edit3: Han_Zen refers to it on 7November
