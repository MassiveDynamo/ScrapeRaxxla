Thinking further, the yearning of our vagabond hearts may be a clue telling us to look for the Generation Ships, as I interpret 'vagabond' in this context to mean 'homeless' and the crews of Generation Ships are certainly people yearning to arrive at a place that they can call home.

Quite right about the punctuation but it still fits if the person making the logs is the individual referred to. I shall have to examine the names again of the individuals that made the logs.
In the meantime, if there are only two individuals in the third line, then perhaps the two Generation Ships, Atlas in Charick's Drift (a white dwarf star - it is just outside the jet cones) and Pleione in Hez Ur, make a line that leads to something?
“Homeless” is one, perhaps the most common current interpretation of vagabond, but it also means “wanderer”. So a rogue planet or comet could be called vagabonds, and so could the inhabitants of a generation ship...
