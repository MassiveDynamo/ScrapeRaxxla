For the jewel, people say either:
NGC 7822 nebula (look for S171 34 tourist beacon)
Sirius

For the start, Sol, one of the old worlds? Tau Ceti? I don't know.
Im so glad you said Tau Ceti...On the of codex relates to something in that system. Maybe a Planet that changed its name?

Also Panzers Star... you need to look at that one in relation to where it is in the constellation
