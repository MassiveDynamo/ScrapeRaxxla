I almost wish I knew VR programming, because having a VR environment that populates the points and letting me walk thru them would be super amazing, but even without that, creating an interactive galmap of know stars, outside of the game, with lost of additional plotting and searching abilities, would be a huge thing....
But ultimately I'm not capable and know no one who is :-(
Sometimes I wish Frontier would retract the "No Ship Interiors" stance because this would be the perfect reason to expand on the VR experience. Just being able to move to a room with an Expanse-style hologram of the galaxy map would be awe inspiring.
