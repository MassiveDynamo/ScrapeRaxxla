Im so glad you said Tau Ceti...On the of codex relates to something in that system. Maybe a Planet that changed its name?

Also Panzers Star... you need to look at that one in relation to where it is in the constellation
"A planet that change its name", i think it's the first time someone say this. Why not.
For Panzers Star, i don't get your point. When i google it, it show me some IRL milittary stuff but nothing related to stars or constellations.
