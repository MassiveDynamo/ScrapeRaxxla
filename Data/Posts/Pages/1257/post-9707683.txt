(used for expressing direction or motion or direction toward something) in the direction of; toward:from north to south.

That's how I took that line in the Codex. We are talking about a time when Travel was limited in how fast and how far you could travel. So i dont think we are looking for anything too far away from SOl.

Secondly I belive the jewel to be a direction a heading. I'm still sitting with the fact the mother of galaxies is Cassiopeia. I have other reasons to believe this as well, as the rest of the Codex has 2 other clues in it that suggest the area of space we are looking into is Cassiopeia, Andromeda and Picies.

What i dont have is a start point. or which star is the jewel that burns.

For the jewel, people say either:
NGC 7822 nebula (look for S171 34 tourist beacon)
Sirius

For the start, Sol, one of the old worlds? Tau Ceti? I don't know.
