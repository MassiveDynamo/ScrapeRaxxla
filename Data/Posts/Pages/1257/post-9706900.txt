Currently tooling around Eurybia after plotting all relative locations from my report. Seams like as good a place to start than any other.

I doubt being allied with Liz Ryder and the Eurybia Blue Mafia will resolve anything, unless it’s a narrative lock and at some point such ‘actions’ might be needed. But any possibility is as good as any other in the absence of anything conclusive.

Something to do at least!

No shipwreck signals at present to be found here, unless there are listening posts someplace else, pointing here? I’ll keep looking anyway.

My ‘anarchy’ pirates stash concept is pretty simplistic / tenuous; scan every anarchy system in close proximity to Sol etc, based on the ‘pirates stash’ reference, and the absence of any other ‘reliable’ information. I suspect if it’s valid it won’t actually point to Raxxla, but possibly could provide some POI which contains some other reference?

This is as good as a place to start s as far with no incentive to do much else, so will ensconce here for the time being and tool around to see what / if anything occurs.

Then onto the next.

Like any theory I am highly suspicious that such an endeavour may be overly simplistic, and still open to human error. I initially feel Raxxla at some point could have been found just through scanning the system, but I seriously suspect something was altered around 2017, who knows.

Interesting point, after mapping out all of the locations from my report, I noticed Pandemonium actually sits relatively close to Achenar at the base of the sphere of interest. Probably nothing but coincidence?

In the middle of temporal / geospatial mapping to identify (if any) correlations from the various findings I’ve proposed, I’ll update once done.
