I wanted to return to the basis and thought about the Raxxla's text in the codex:
"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!"

But currently there are 3 persons that could describe the mother of galaxies:
Gaia, at the origin of greek titans
Rhea, daughter of Gaia and mother of greek deities
Hera, daughter of Rhea. The milk that came from her breast created the milky way in greek mythology.

Gaia in game doesn't exist but there is "Mother Gaia" that is a faction at sol
Rhea is a planet in SOL
Hera is a system, nothing important reported (no tourist beacon or anything else)

Raxxla's text, IMO, is a map to follow but if we don't follow the exact road, it's useless.
It could also be the locations of Raxxla if it's moving (which makes sense).

So which one do you think is the correct one and why? I googled it but all the explanations seem good

TO
(used for expressing direction or motion or direction toward something) in the direction of; toward:from north to south.

That's how I took that line in the Codex. We are talking about a time when Travel was limited in how fast and how far you could travel. So i dont think we are looking for anything too far away from SOl.

Secondly I belive the jewel to be a direction a heading. I'm still sitting with the fact the mother of galaxies is Cassiopeia. I have other reasons to believe this as well, as the rest of the Codex has 2 other clues in it that suggest the area of space we are looking into is Cassiopeia, Andromeda and Picies.

What i dont have is a start point. or which star is the jewel that burns.
