Pilots Federation/Pilot's Federation/Pilots Federation Local Branch/ ?

?Elite Federation of Pilots (is that right?)

Dark Wheel

Its a weird setup as starts as usual with people saying we are at the top of this thing we are creating, then at least 2 groups form and create themselves above the PF but still affiliated, if that's the right word, with the PF. Wheels within wheels.

Technically a Pilots Federation would be a federation of pilots and a Pilot's Federation would be a federation owned by a pilot or pilots whatever that means how do you own the PF?

Im still 50/50 whether its human error with grammar / typo or actually means anything. By the time it gets translated it may lose any distinction or significance which makes me suspect its error....unless the translation applies its own specific distinction - we could do with knowing the literal translations of some of these to see if theres any crossover of grammar pointing to something. Would probably prove to be evidence against rather than for but you never know. eg Jewel of the toast takes on several meaning when translated so unlikely to be a pointer or bit racist to only be for fluent English speaking who can tell the distinction.
