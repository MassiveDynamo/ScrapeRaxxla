I think it is digged many times. Somewhere on pages 300-400 people was flying around. On 1st pages it was screens of old quests from DW there (now removed) etc.
Also, I think, we COULD not see ... that was before FSS introduced. Now we have FSS/DSS which show many old hidden things immediately.
For example you can google old videos of how to catch Voyager. Now it is shown by FSS right away.
I doubt a low powered station would appear on scanners, think we will have to find it manually as we find the coordinates we receive sometimes from the misterious tips. Otherwise someone would have found it by now.
