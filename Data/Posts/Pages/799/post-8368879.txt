I admit I travel alot, but don't do much exploration other than honking and checking out points of interest. Is there a guide on how to search for systems with a gas giant with at least 8 moons, so we fly to them and scan for points of interest?
Nah, only EDSM ...however as it seems it is incomplete. So just fly and dont be lazy. Also upload all logs to edsm when you turn game off.
