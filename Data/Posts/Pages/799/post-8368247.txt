I doubt a low powered station would appear on scanners, think we will have to find it manually as we find the coordinates we receive sometimes from the misterious tips. Otherwise someone would have found it by now.
Sure ...1st 2 months I was orbitiing each "H" body for paralax scanning ... then I figured DAMN, IT"S A LOT OF THEM. Like you easy met 5-10 of "H" moons per day just flying "there" . I stopped.
Also ...it can be another trick, is any planet named "Unnamed" ?
