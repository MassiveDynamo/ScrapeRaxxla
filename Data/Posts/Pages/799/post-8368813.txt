Sure ...1st 2 months I was orbitiing each "H" body for paralax scanning ... then I figured DAMN, IT"S A LOT OF THEM. Like you easy met 5-10 of "H" moons per day just flying "there" . I stopped.
Also ...it can be another trick, is any planet named "Unnamed" ?
Maybe it means it's a unnamed system, perhaps in the bubble. Are there any of those in the bubble?
