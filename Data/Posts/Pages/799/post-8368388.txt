Well, there is The Nameless, the faction.
"Furthermore, it was a Roman who said "everything that is born must die; all things that grow, grow old." In time, therefore, all things grow old. Indeed, if the end of anything is its old age, then everything not already senile is certainly becoming so: for everything upright eventually falls and the fall is either preceded or at least accompanied by old age. There is no exception; whether they last long or not, all growing things sooner or later decline and waste away. Inconstant Fortune will turn her wheel ceaselessly, and will toss transient kingdoms from one people to another. In her wilfulness she will fashion kings out of slaves and slaves out of kings. She will wield her irresistible power over the city of Rome and the Roman world."

"And men go about to wonder at the heights of the mountains, and the mighty waves of the sea, and the wide sweep of rivers, and the circuit of the ocean, and the revolution of the stars, but themselves they consider not."
