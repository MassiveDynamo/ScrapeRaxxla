Hey, this is the Raxxla thread you know!

You're not going to get very far with that objective mindset here. The one you need is:

Absence of evidence is proof of a cover up. The less evidence there is the more wide ranging the cover up has been. If no evidence at all then it must be because every single shred of evidence has been carefully removed which is in itself more proof of the cover up. No evidence means a high governmental or sinister organisation is clearing it all up and 'removing' all witnesses.

See it all makes it so much easier doesn't it?

Finally! I think we are getting there! The club clearly control Sirius, who are in turn using their influence with UC to keep Raxxlas location hidden.
In the meantime, TDW are using their association with PF to spoon feed inaccurate facts into the codex and galnet, because they dont want us finding it before they do!
Lyra Crane is a secret agent of The Club, who is trying to out TDWs location, so independent pilots out them and do The Clubs dirty work for free.
But who are the club? Really? Well...its clearly Aegis! They have links to all 3 super powers and are clearly manipulating government to keep all of the above a secret, by keeping everybody busy with Thargoids!
Why.....well it's simple. The Club have their holiday home on Raxxla and dont want the view spoilt.
Edit....Did I mention that Sirius have secretly bought out UC. That's why such a major organisation has no home world or system.
