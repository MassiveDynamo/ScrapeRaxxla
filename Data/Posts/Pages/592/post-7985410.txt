Yes well, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

Hey, this is the Raxxla thread you know!

You're not going to get very far with that objective mindset here. The one you need is:

Absence of evidence is proof of a cover up. The less evidence there is the more wide ranging the cover up has been. If no evidence at all then it must be because every single shred of evidence has been carefully removed which is in itself more proof of the cover up. No evidence means a high governmental or sinister organisation is clearing it all up and 'removing' all witnesses.

See it all makes it so much easier doesn't it?
