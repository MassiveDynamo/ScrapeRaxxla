This is important stuff. It's the 'Silent song of the spheres'. I always drop to normal space and listen, when I'm checking systems.

The practical application of the sound aspect eludes me. I just listen and hope something different can be heard.
I bet you still zoom in on the Galaxy Map too and listen hoping to hear something different... Aah, the good old days, when hope still existed.
