Is there any asteroid base in the game discovered so far designated as a pirate base?
I have a hunch there could (should) be one in the game for the trails.

And I still cannot recall that pirate story quite some time ago (not Dynamo), was it pirate mega-ship, station or base.
Behold! The (former) asteroid base of Octavia Quinton's pirate base!
