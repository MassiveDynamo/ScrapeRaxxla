Edit: While MB confirmed to Dj Truthsayer that Raxxla is in the Milky Way and it was part of everyone's journey to find it he didn't say whether or not it was inside a permit locked area to prevent it being stumbled upon at random. If the rumours are correct about it being in the game since gamma we'd need to constrain the search to tourist beacons that were also in game at the time.

There were no tourist beacons in the game in Gamma or at release. There weren't a lot of stuff in space, at all. Basically just stations, planets and nav. beacons.
The game had very few assets compared to what it has now.

The first in-game hints to Raxxla's existence came with the Elite/Founder mission texts. I think they arrived about 7-8 moths after release.
