You really should complete Orion, not many CMDR's have. TBH though, you can't complete it. 4 stars in his bow/shield are locked in Col 70. But complete what you can.
In that case then I'll definitely wait until the DW / Raxxla deadlock sees more progress.

Or, maybe not, lol. Thanks for the heads up.
