This crux / cross idea is an interesting one... but something that would make it much more difficult is the possibility that we could be seeing an Einstein cross, or gravitational lens effect. (For those that don't know what that is, basically we could be seeing multiple images of the same object due to light being bent by a black hole.) We already know that black holes do this in game, and there is apparently a listening post in Maia that suggests viewing objects through black holes. Maybe that area is worth checking out in the context of looking for the title screen pattern? Maia B is a black hole.
Pretty sure there’s not a Listening Post in Maia of that nature. Sounds like a bit of a mix up with the Tourist Beacon. Very different things I’m afraid.

Nice idea in principle with the Einstein cross, but in practice I don’t think there’s anything there which can be used in practical terms for narrowing down the location. Best of luck to anyone who wants to try though!
