Just going back to this "number stations" quote by DB.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station
The mystery and secrecy behind old cold war radio broadcasts seems to somehow fit in with this mystery.

As I am new to the Quest, has this been delved into previously?

The idea behind number stations has intrigued me since I was a teenager. The thought that secret information was being broadcast amongst general everyday radio transmissions is just brilliant. And I guess, here we are, trying to decode anything and everything we come across in the hope that is trying to point us to Raxxla.

Awesome.
