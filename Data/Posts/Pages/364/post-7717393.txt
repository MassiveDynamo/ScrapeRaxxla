There were no tourist beacons in the game in Gamma or at release. There weren't a lot of stuff in space, at all. Basically just stations, planets and nav. beacons.
The game had very few assets compared to what it has now.

The first in-game hints to Raxxla's existence came with the Elite/Founder mission texts. I think they arrived about 7-8 moths after release.
Yeah, is was a flimsy idea at best and it fell apart even more when I started reading what the beacons say and looking at the numerical order. There must be some kind of linear progression behind the incremental count but it doesn't appear to form a pattern other than first in, best dressed until the first 250 or so were dumped into the game en-masse in November 2016 around the 2.2.02 patch and that's if there's no other reason why I seem to have clumps of them "found" on the same date?
