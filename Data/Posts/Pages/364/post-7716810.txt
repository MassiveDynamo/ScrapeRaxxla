Just going back to this "number stations" quote by DB.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station
The mystery and secrecy behind old cold war radio broadcasts seems to somehow fit in with this mystery.

As I am new to the Quest, has this been delved into previously?

The idea behind number stations has intrigued me since I was a teenager. The thought that secret information was being broadcast amongst general everyday radio transmissions is just brilliant. And I guess, here we are, trying to decode anything and everything we come across in the hope that is trying to point us to Raxxla.

Awesome.

In ED the number stations are the Unregistered Comms Beacons. UCB exist in various locations and their transmissions are indeed coded. Canon group were heavily involved in the decoding. See my signature for a spreadsheet of UCBs and Listening Posts (EDâ€™s ELINT satellites). See the Canonn pages for decoding details.
