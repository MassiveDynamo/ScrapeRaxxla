This crux / cross idea is an interesting one... but something that would make it much more difficult is the possibility that we could be seeing an Einstein cross, or gravitational lens effect. (For those that don't know what that is, basically we could be seeing multiple images of the same object due to light being bent by a black hole.) We already know that black holes do this in game, and there is apparently a listening post in Maia that suggests viewing objects through black holes. Maybe that area is worth checking out in the context of looking for the title screen pattern? Maia B is a black hole.
