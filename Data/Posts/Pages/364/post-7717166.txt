Alnilam is called Epsilon Orionis, in ED.

It's an important star, as it is one of the 'Real name' jewels. Alnilam is derived from Arabic 'Al-nilam', where nilam means sapphire.

I think it has a black hole to.
That group of three stars, the "Three Kings" or, wise men is important to many cultures as they align with (follow) Sirius and point to where the Sun will rise on the third day following the (northern hemisphere) winter solstice. In the pagan yule tradition the Sun is then miraculously reborn for the new Solar year moving one degree back to the north to confirm spring is on it's way and nobody has to freeze to death or starve next year when the crops won't grow. (If you didn't recognise the similarities yet, x-mas)

I'm still not convinced those red markings in the image are correct because, why can't we also see the various nebulae straddled by this 1600 Ly deep (from Sol's perspective) formation? Maintaining this pattern without it distorting due to parallax would constrain the viewing location to a fairly tight path directly away from both it, and Sol and help to isolate where it is but we'd want to be pretty sure it's the right goose before we go chasing it on account of space being so mind bogglingly huge in ED.

From Sol, Orion and Crux are roughly 90 degrees apart in the sky, but in this image the two patterns we're looking at are closer together. If that was due to viewing them through a black hole we'd also see some lensing curvature on the galactic plane, which we don't. As mentioned by others, since the first Guardian ruin was found so quickly, apparently using the sky box, FDev may not have pulled this directly out of the game, even if it would have been the easiest way to get a snap shot. We have however, seen two objects in very close proximity before, but perhaps not a station this close to one.
