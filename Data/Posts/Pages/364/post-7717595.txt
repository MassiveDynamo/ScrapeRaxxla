random tinfoil thought:

the codex says:

More than one interstellar treasure seeker has become obssesed with Raxxla to the exclusion of all other dreams, and spent his or her entire life in a futile search for it.

Isn't there a guy who sets treasure hunts, as advertised in Galnet? - I seem to recall that there were several of them - maybe he's the one in the quote? If not who else might be the interstellar treasure seeker?
