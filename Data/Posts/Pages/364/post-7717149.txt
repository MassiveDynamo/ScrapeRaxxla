I find it very strange that out of the 23 (I think 23, possibly more) constellations I've completed, the only one with a beacon in it notifying you that you're in one is Sirius and all it says is that it's called the Dog Star. I was very surprised that Orion's Belt didn't have anything in their beacons about it.
