Yo folks,

I was intrigued by the system names in the image posted earlier. So I got into the Galmap and tried some postions. I don't think that those system names are leading us anywhere. Is there anyone who knows where these come from?

The lower (circled) smudge (not the one labelled M42), and there's another below it off-screen iirc, look like lens flare features to me as they are arcs that have tangents perpendicular to a direct line from them to the light source (that sounded more complicated than maybe it should have done, sorry). Even without a canopy there are still lens flares in ED.
