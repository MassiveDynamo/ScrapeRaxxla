Have been sat in Delphi / The Oracle for a few days playing forums instead of the game and debating whether or not to go explore and clear my Orion constellation bookmarks but you might have just saved me the trip if there's nothing to see.

You really should complete Orion, not many CMDR's have. TBH though, you can't complete it. 4 stars in his bow/shield are locked in Col 70. But complete what you can.
