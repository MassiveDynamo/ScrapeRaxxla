Still contemplating the zodiacal references, eg the Solar disk with the dot in the middle and the six divisions which could be the points between the three pairs of water / fire and earth / air elements starting with the vernal equinox at 00 degrees Aries then Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius and Aquarius.

Obviously the centre of that cross in a geocentric system is Earth but what if we placed the six component systems identified in the Raxxla toast on those arms instead? If we managed to definitively identify one, could we then assume five more spaced 60 degrees of arc around the unknown centre?
