The heros journey is used in all forms of storytelling. In this case it might be thargoids might be 'supernatural' threat introduced, enginers/guardians might be 'mystical' guide, egineering/guardian upgrades might be you yourself becomeing empowered, we beat the thargoids (for now because this is only the early middle part). I think we just have to lose miserably and be 'reborn' from that defeat. I dont really know alk the steps but if memory serves any that should be kinda close to the heros journey, right?
