Actually, I think it was matching stars in the background of a release video!
I suspect that the planet was found using far more shady methods. The background stars may have been used to confirm the position of the system, but the discovery was way to quick.

According to the Codex, it was Halsey's visions that lead to the discovery. The fact that FD credits the NPCs(in the video) with first discovery and not commanders, tells me things didn't go according to plan.
