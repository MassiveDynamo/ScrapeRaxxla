So far all the triggers in the game are by 'achieving' or 'carrying' something (mostly pre-known at the time of success) and then 'doing' something somewhere (sometimes the unlock is known, sometimes not)

eg

Achieve something (engineer requirement - known) - unlock an engineer
Achieve something (faction ranking - known) - unlock a permit
Achieve something (Superpower ranking - known) - unlock some ships
Carry Something (UA or UP - not known at the time) - unlock a Thargoid Base
Achieve Something (unlock a Guardiuan Beacon - unknown at time) - collect key - (unknown at time)
Carry Achievement (Guardian Key) & Achieve charging of guardian pylons (unknown at time) - unlock Weapon Blueprint (Unknown at time)
Achieve (Guardian Relic) & Carry it (Unknown at time) & Charge Guardian Pylons - Other Blueprint (Unknown at time)
Achieve something (D-Scan an UA/UP - unknown at time) - Record the response and run through a program to get a visual clue (unknown for ages until direct clue was given by MB)

And back to 1984 - Achieve Ranking (unknown at time) - visit 1 particular station after ranking up and get a Mission (totally unknown at time). 2nd mission unlock played exactly the same way but in a different galaxy map as well.

Achieve X & Maybe Carry Y and maybe Achieve Z as well while carrying and maybe just maybe those Guardian bases doors will open up - Still unknown but highly likely to be possible, all the visuals are there that its a door and it opens somehow just like the Thargoid ones.

So theres no reason to think if there is a 'journey' in a metaphorical sense that its any different to Achieve Something then Do Something and whatever that is has to be measurable by the game.

Also the 'Mysterious Benefactor' in 1984 was just a clever way for DB & IB to avoid writing a backstory for the character, you made your own up. The whole impress us and see what happens was just to provide longevity for the game for the players.

We made 99.9% of Raxxla up in our heads based on nothing but the first off-screen GalNet story. Theres no reason to think DB has followed us along the same lines, not from any previous game or this one yet. It wouldnt be in character.
