Don’t you use EDDiscovery to keep a track of your travel history?? It’s great. You could install it now and it will recover your travel history from your game log files so you can tell where that “lost” system was.

I use EDSM and one time I would have been scouring the logs to find the system...but Im older and less bothered now...still cant honk n scoop, have to use FSS.....but a long way from 'must map everything' I started out as. I was going to map one and leave the rest for future travellers so I just left them all, I had FSS them all and nothing of note there. Im in PP mode as well.

Think my EDSM travel logs are public, if not I can make them so if anyone wants to look, even just to get your name on something. It was a typical boring system otherwise known as the perfect place to hide something. (Edit: now public, may be under Vetinaris or LateYew843181 my old GT on XB)
