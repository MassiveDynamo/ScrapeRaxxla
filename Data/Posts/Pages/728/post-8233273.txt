if raxxla is alien, there's no reason to think anything based on earth has anything to do with raxxla or where it is.

There's not much reason to think there is any non-random placement of it, as anything with some sort of puzzle to unlock would potentially be figured out ...maybe very early on in the game and be extremely anti-climatic. I doubt fdev wants that...raxxla is far more valiable never being found ...or only being found after many years and when fdev wants it to be found..

The only real need is for it to be somewhat close to the bubble. I dont think there is any additional rhyme or reason to where it actually is other than that. Probably a system picked at random that happened to have the necessary characteristics to hide it in. Nothing deeper than that.
You've never seen an episode of ancient aliens? Literally everything about earth's history's early mythology is inspired entirely by....
Notice the tinfoil-hat hair.
