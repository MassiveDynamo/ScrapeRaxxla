Raxxla is in all likelihood alien. If it isn't, it's a departure from Rafe Zetters description. It's still a fair chance that FD 'reverse engineered' it into earth's ancient history.
We know from the Mars relic that there were alien visitors to the Sol system, before humans visited Mars. These aliens may well have visited earth.
If they did, they could have been seen as gods or monsters by ancient humans. Their stories may have acted as proto-mythology and developed into the myths and religions we know.

This would be easy to implement as our ancient myths are full of references to the stars. FD could basically pick a story they like, find a corresponding location and put Raxxla there. After that, it's time for the vague mythology hints.

I think Ram Tah’s decodings were hints that Guardians visited Sol, and humanity may be descended either from them or our ancestors were their hunt prey. Fits with Mars Artefact. Hence my hypothesising that Raxxla is located in Sol, possibly one of their ark ships, but I’m currently running out of places to look! And from the codex TDW station seems to be relevant but is clearly not in Sol-wrong star type.
