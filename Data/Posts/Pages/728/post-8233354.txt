Im not sure it is...yet but im not trying to convince anyone of anything. I'm not sure I want it to be or want it to be found. I certainly enjoy the hunt more (I miss the Salome thread).

We have self-policed this forum for certainly the last 400 pages so anybody can come and say this is a theory and we all support it usually or point flaws but generally say to the poster 'go ahead its your game and valid as anyone else idea' and we have a lot of fun. We don't say our theory is the only one or pour scorn on players who don't follow that 'journey' as proscribed. We don't say 'overwhelming evidence' with no supporting evidence. Im as concerned with the tone as with the 'found meaning' that is hardly 'tiny bit obvious'. Its as valid as anyone elses, it doesn't overrule them.

We all make patterns, or our brains do, and some of them mean something to some of us. Songwriters are constantly amazed at the meaning other people have taken from their lyrics which meant nothing like that at all like that to them, the author, when they wrote it. Even an 'obvious' clue can be misinterpreted or missed altogether even when presented as plainly as possible (Salome thread again).

Drew Wagar may have made use or reference to the Heroes Journey in his books, I'm not sure either way. That may be where the idea originated.
