if raxxla is alien, there's no reason to think anything based on earth has anything to do with raxxla or where it is.

There's not much reason to think there is any non-random placement of it, as anything with some sort of puzzle to unlock would potentially be figured out ...maybe very early on in the game and be extremely anti-climatic. I doubt fdev wants that...raxxla is far more valiable never being found ...or only being found after many years and when fdev wants it to be found..

The only real need is for it to be somewhat close to the bubble. I dont think there is any additional rhyme or reason to where it actually is other than that. Probably a system picked at random that happened to have the necessary characteristics to hide it in. Nothing deeper than that.

Raxxla is in all likelihood alien. If it isn't, it's a departure from Rafe Zetters description. It's still a fair chance that FD 'reverse engineered' it into earth's ancient history.
We know from the Mars relic that there were alien visitors to the Sol system, before humans visited Mars. These aliens may well have visited earth.
If they did, they could have been seen as gods or monsters by ancient humans. Their stories may have acted as proto-mythology and developed into the myths and religions we know.

This would be easy to implement as our ancient myths are full of references to the stars. FD could basically pick a story they like, find a corresponding location and put Raxxla there. After that, it's time for the vague mythology hints.
