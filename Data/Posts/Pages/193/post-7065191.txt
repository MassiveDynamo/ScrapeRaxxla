No inside information. Just a hunch. Back when we used to get to submit user-created content to Galnet I'd often post articles to try and confirm my theories. Frontier usually wouldn't publish an article if it predicted something that they were planning to do themselves. When they published that one I took it to mean that Jaques was going to make the jump just fine without any interference. I was wrong.

Fair enough, though was beginning to think perhaps you’d been replaced by a tharg in a skin suit during your SNR expedition

Could be you gave them the idea, the misjump & Colonia destination is a better storyline than if it had been successful-Jaques wouldn’t have got much business out at BP; or maybe that was thier intention all along. The Hands of the Architects was a good idea. We’ve heard nothing about Architects since Halsey, & it seems like that was another budding storyline that FD have dropped.
