Tying up loose ends

Dear Artuz (R2, RÂ², Raxxla Researchers),

I want to promote a straightforward strategy I'm working on:
Tie up the loose ends in this 3 year old thread (see bullet list below)
Add all relevant locations to this sheet (with your motivation in the 'info' column or reference column as a url to forum/reddit/...) to coordinate our efforts.
At p.158 of 257 in this 3y/o thread, I've already found over 200 referenced systems (thousands more in ref. regional sectors).
Please add any and all candidates and related locations with relevant information, even if you already explored, abandoned or eliminated them already. I plan on adding the locations mentioned in the remaining 39% of this thread, but I'm tired atm.
Don't report a location as Eliminated until you're sure it's been fully scanned, fully explored (surface exploration and all POI + at least a handful of USS) and at least a dozen missions for relevant factions have been run, all by Elite explorers or -- preferably -- triple Elite cmdrs or 'Elite' backers. This is especially important when the system has candidate status and doesn't produce anything for non-triple Elite CMDRs.
BURN THE HAYSTACK. Work through the locations by process of Elimination (full sweep by triple Elite CMDR) while trying to...
Trigger and/or come up with new and better leads...

While I was at it, I found some leads in our threadnaught that may not have been followed up on (I could be wrong on a couple of these, since the main focus of my search was finding locations and reading 2300 posts gets tiresome).

Please add all relevant information concerning these either in a post or on the locations sheet.
Prepare for the tinfoilery floodgates!!



A sweep of the Pleiades Sector(s) (I forgot why and can't find the posts mentioning why)
Finding the nebula from the client startup animation ("FDEV: raxxla has been in-game from the start" + "DWMISSION: place that isn't a place, door that is also a key")
Finding the system or systems (horizon + non-horizon client) displayed on the main menu screen ("FDEV: raxxla has been in-game from the start" + "DWMISSION: place that isn't a place, door that is also a key")
The search for Rogue Planets & eXotic stars, do we have the means to find them? Have we found any? (except the neutron/white dwarf/pulsar/Black holes)
I saw at least two pages of the thread dedicated to capital ships, how did you (Macros Black?) figure they were related somehow?
Has anyone properly (fully and chronologically as triple Elite) retraced the steps (locations) mentioned in the TDW novella?
Finding relevant information in the Elite Federation of Pilots missions. Does GalNet have any?
Unlocking all unlockable permits, does it trigger something?
Theta Orionis C, "transaction errors", bug or feature? resolved?
Macros Black mission assignment: Go to the Tharg map base with the SAP 8 core, AI relic, UA and UP.(may not be relevant, considering Raxxla's been in the game from the start, but I'm still curious)
Has the French Cmdr's "?" to "Raxxla" planet been identified as hoax or verified?
Are INRA bases related?
The 'door-shaped' Keystone Asterism. Fully explored and eliminated?
Chiron in Sol. Has it been found ingame? (anyone approached where it is supposed to be?)
Did we manage to clarify "outer rim"?
Based on this interaction, and many other posts like this, how confident are we Raxxla should be in or outside the bubble?
First mention of RAXXLA in 2814, what's interesting about the period preceding it? (ships, expeditions, strange events) Do we have a timeline somewhere?
SalomÃ© had a tiara with the ancient dark wheel symbol engraved in it, does this mean old Dark Wheel and new Dark Wheel are one and the same? Mr. Wagar? Are you still around?
Castellan Belt Cluster 2 lead, did it produce anything?
Shinrarta Dezhra celestial sphere mapping, any anomalous stars in the sky?
Rim Nebula (NGC 6188) sectors sweep?
Hassan's Homeworld location (I know, more a Rifter thing, but might be relevant, because SalomÃ© --> Dark Wheel --> Raxxla)
Sirius Corp ship movements
Strange EAFOTS Elite ships, has it been solved/reproduced?
The Blue Dot Galaxy? RAXXLA's Bethlehem Star??
Perhaps most important would be the question, if we happen upon Raxxla, would we realize we've found it? No point in searching a needle in a hayFIELD if the needle looks and feels exactly like hay. Has FD said anything on this?



The Dark Wheel Emblem,
note the three discs around '12 to '1 o clock, that could very well be three celestial bodies.
fan-made

Even if FDEV decided RAXXLA isn't an active line at the moment, keep in mind we will have all of this to fall back on when it is active. The fact that they gave so little information and reassured us it was in the game should, however, be reason enough to conclude that discovering it is possible.


On closing:

Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread.

Â—H. P. Lovecraft, "The Dunwich Horror"

(no system named Yog-Sothoth or similar, but there are plenty of systems starting with Soth*, Sothis, Sotho, Sother, and a handful of Soth* Sectors, added to the list of 'interesting' to be sure, even though it probably refers to hellenist designations for Sirius)

P.S.: ~15% of the internet is cats

Will update the sheet regularly if new leads/locations are found interesting
