Can you please look up:

Dironothaxaurian (some sort of fossil mentioned in Dark Wheel story)
Mymurths (Mymurth = home to the turtle-like creatures that later in the DW story are revealed to be Tharg larvae)
Oresrians (look like and don't want to be confused with Thargs apparently)
Tionisla (is the system, but are there inhabitants called Tionislans or any other reference to it?)
Cirag, Ciragians: they -- as may have been part of the lie -- worship the Tharg larvae, any information might help though

If any of these species' systems are found under other names and subsequently ingame, they might help find Raxxla.

I also invite everyone here to for finding/eliminating Raxxla candidates and any and all relevant systems/regions.

Two hits:-

Mymurth: (Paraphrased) A race of diminutive humanoids enslaved by the Uan-irec to service vast musical structures on the planet Wyath.

Cirag: (Paraphrased) A race of vast 2000m high jelly fish like spirit creatures that inhabit the world Shulmeirik.

Also...

Ciraq: "a world infested with truly ancient ruins, too decayed to properly excavate and analyse."

All three of those references are within a few pages of each other in the chapter describing the Uan-Irec sector.

Ruins.... brain trees...
