Well, in IC1805 just past the Heart &Soul there is a duplicate name-two systems, one name, totally different bodies. I reported it as a bug a year or two ago. You might check it out and support the bug; I expect it won’t have been corrected. I remember it was one of the 2MASS stars-I surveyed a load of them. In Drew Wagar’s second book (starts off with Zurara) it was claimed she had been deploying terraforming equipment and beacons to highlight them; we never found any but it would be nice to know if any exist. There are also hints in the FRift base logs (worth doing if you haven’t already) of strange things, unknown heat signatures, lurking evil... this might have been detections of Zurara by the bases, but might have been something else-thargoids? Guardian AI? Rogue human AI? Who knows (FD!!), but Bovomit sector is locked for a reason!
With any luck there might still be a few survivors still out there in the rift. I think one group went to a nearby terraformable world while another went to an Earth-like. If we could rescue those people (and they haven't gone crazy) then maybe we could get a bit more of the story.
