kinda odd since sol is custom. Very weird that such an artifact still exists. Perhaps something in the engine prevents it from being removed (similar to how certain stars are stuck inside other stars and will never be fixed without re-seeding the entire galaxy).

Star within a star? Thorne–Żytkow object??? (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorne–Żytkow_object)
Ought to be filterable as an Xotic!
