i can't select it either, but (on the ps4) i can bookmark it when i hover over the belt in the system map. and via the bookmark it is then selectable.

Mmm, didnt try to bookmark it without selecting it, didnâ€™t know that worked. Will try out later

edit: yep, can bookmark it without selecting it in sysmap, then select it on the bookmarks tab and it shows at the star. Presumably a coding bug since there is no cluster shown or selectable at the asteroid belt.
