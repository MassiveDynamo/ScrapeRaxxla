From Drew Wagar’s two Elite books, the FRift base logs, etc, it seems there was only one survivor of the Dynasty expeditions-Rebecca Weston, the Old Lady, who (somehow) managed to make her way back to the bubble and recruited Salomé into TDW to expose The Club and their plot. There are no other known survivors from the FRift, Hawking’s Gap or Conflux expeditions. There might be two other megaships to find to match the FRift’s Zurara, but that is pure speculation with no evidence in any of the books or in-game lore to support it, just possible storyline symmetry that may not exist.
