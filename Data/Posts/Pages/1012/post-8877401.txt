In Odessey you will have to buy explorer suite, that will differ from default. Then long upgrade for it. For walking.

If you pre-buy Odyssey now you get the Pioneer suit. I think there will be new engineering arrangements for upgrades to weapons, suits, hand tools, etc. Yippee, more grind!!

Edit: But I think the initial Pioneer suit will be sufficient for limited ground-based exploration without engineering; though if there’s any possibility of encountering Thargoids I want at least a handheld chain gun (though I recall it didn’t help that guy in the first Predator film! )

I want to engineer my ship’s coffee machine...I want some drinking chocolate, mocha, and also cappuccino capsules, extra frothy milk, and an extension spout so I can get a mug when I’m sat in my pilot’s chair- I get damn thirsty at the moment, the machine is out of reach!!!
