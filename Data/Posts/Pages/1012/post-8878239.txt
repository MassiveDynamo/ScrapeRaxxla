There are no belt clusters and hence nothing is targetable, which seems strange. Especially for Sol, humanityâ€™s home system. Back in around 2016 when I first got the Sol permit the asteroid belt was targetable but it showed as being within the sun.

the belt is still inside the sun and you can target it indirectly: first set a bookmark via the system map, then select/target it via the bookmarks.
