Just in case anyone is getting a little tired of the negativity that is allowed on the forums, there is a discord created for all Raxxla hunters. It is the Independent Raxxla Hunters discord and is moderated enough to cut down on people who are rude and damaging to the community. To give you an idea of the kind of community and openness that we have a user provided to everyone, without restriction a Library that provides searchable access to galnet, beacons and other resources.

If you come come knowing:

There is no membership or hierarchy
There are no leaders
Come willing to learn and share

Join, be nice, have fun
