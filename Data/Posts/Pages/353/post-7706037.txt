Data canister reported by Hanerib is fake. Forums are pointless, don't bother looking here.

mach10z: We are trying to eliminate possibilities for Raxxla, was your post about a data canister a work of fiction or was it found in-game?
Hanerib: All are fiction in the eyes of Tothos

It's one thing to come here and be rude about everything said here, and another to not contribute to anything.

There are people here who spent 4+ yrs trying to figure a lot of things out and they are leaving no stone unturned. They don't need to be subjected to horrible criticism without someone contributing to the topic themselves.
