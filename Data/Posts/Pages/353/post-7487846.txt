Quick search produced a wiki result: RaLa Experiment

Seems legit, for highly questionable propaganda

Edit: Minus the typo, "spent considerably resources"


From Wikipedia page on Lanthanium:

“Since lanthanum's properties differed only slightly from those of cerium, and occurred along with it in its salts, he named it from the Ancient Greek λανθάνειν [lanthanein] (lit. to lie hidden).”


“To lie hidden” seems like an odd coincidence to me...
