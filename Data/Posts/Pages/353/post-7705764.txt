Hi Everyone I think I have cracked the identity and meaning of the center piece of the Raxxla Codex image. Please take a moment and read my findings. Disclosure: I believe this to be symbolism and a way of pointing us in the direction of Raxxla without specifically mentioning what it is.

I did a bit of research on those phile things a few moths back. Didn't find anything conclusive, but I wouldn't rule it out completely.
