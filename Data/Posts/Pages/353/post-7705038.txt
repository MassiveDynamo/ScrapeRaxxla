Is this in-game, or just more ?

"A battered data canister lies somewhere close to Neumann Camp"

"...You see, the Raxxla symbol is depiction of an implosion assembly. An array of explosives compresses subcritical shell of fissionable material inward, resulting in supercritical mass of radioactive material. The term Raxxla is originally derived from a certain phase of a process known as the Manhattan Project, more precisely a series of tests called the RaLa Experiment, RaLa standing for radioactive lanthanum. During those ancient times, creation of uniform, symmetric explosive compression was not easily produced. Some scientific principles from this era, such as explosive lensing, are still being used in modern spacecraft. One of the unexpected results from these experiments was an occurrence of unexplainable data bursts observed during one of the tests performed by divisions associated with nuclear weapons research. High energy physics was poorly understood at the time, as they were for several subsequent centuries, and the division assigned with study of the assembled data was simply known by as "Raxxla", initially. The nature of these data bursts still remains a mystery, as all associated data has since been highly classified, even to this day. Our organization has over the centuries spent considerably resources on intercepting restricted, and often fragmentary information, and gathering from diverse sources we have come to believe having created a fairly reliable account on what results were made in this study. It would appear they were convinced having contacted some kind of artificial network of wormholes, or higher spatial dimensions capable of passing through information. Some more speculative remarks mention some kind of intelligent design, and "witch space", a term repeated in several documents..."
