Ya i see i have alot of catching up here

Im thinking this is a bread crumb type quest - The first bit being Astrophel and the spiraling stars... (along with the nice bit about the 8th moon of an unnamed gas giant) - will probably lead us to the Dark Wheel station which will lead to the next bit...


Anyhoo I didnt see anyone point this out ...

From: Astrophil and Stella, Sonnet 13

"Jove’s golden shield did eagle sables bear,
Whose talons held young Ganymede above"

Joves golden shield with an Eagle ... sounds familiar



He is referencing the taking of Ganymede by Jove in the form of an Eagle. Both the Eagle: and Ganymede (as later water bearer to the gods) : are constellations

Well thats where I am going to start looking for gas giants with eight moons.
