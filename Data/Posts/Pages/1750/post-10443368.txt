Well my tinfoil hat idea of the week is that the "Omphalos Rift" is an arbitrarily locked region of space put in place by powerful people. Could it's name in the codex be like a hint to this? I don't know I'm just obsessed with all the weird permit locked systems and places recently. Actually had a nightmare the other night.
