Wasn't there a theory that Universal Cartographics and the Pilots Federation control all permit locks? Like obviously it's a way to lock systems for future plans but I read about Wreaken Construction amasing a fleet and working on a secret project in COL 70. It's an interesting galnet article IMO because it states that permit locks are lifted for corporations and somebody apparently got past these locks anyway. I dunno if it's even relevant but hey
