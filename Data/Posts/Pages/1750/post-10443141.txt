None accessible locked areas are for narrative purposes yes.

Very early on FD directly confirmed that pre launch certain zones were locked off for the 10 year narrative. Certain systems likewise are equally non accessible for this same reason and have no accessible permits as they are tied to narrative elements.

There have been a couple of examples were NPCS do travel to theses and your example was one of them yes.

Certain Galnet posts and Dev forum comms have gone some degree to say, these areas are locked for our ‘safety’ but I doubt it’s any more than a method to explain it away than anything else.

I think FD has used one or two areas for narrative Galnet posts, which probably was evidence they were prepared to open them at some point, but by the same hand equally evidential that FD changes its narrative for none game reasons, and so such examples may have been intended to have been opened, but then they decided not to?

It’s alluded to through third hand knowledge off statements made by certain FD staff that certain narratives, eg the Thargoid story, was to start elsewhere but thing’s changed, so it’s possible some of these locked areas are now totally redundant, or have been repurposed, but this is speculative.

If locked areas are integral to Raxxla it logically negates any and all existing content, as they are by their very nature ‘narrative gates’.

The fact the Codex exists is - some have speculated - contrary to this logic, although that not outside the realms of probability, it would not be an intelligent nor productive conclusion, but considering all aspects it’s not improbable.

But who knows. FD changes things.
