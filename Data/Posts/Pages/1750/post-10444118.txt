Well my tinfoil hat idea of the week is that the "Omphalos Rift" is an arbitrarily locked region of space put in place by powerful people. Could it's name in the codex be like a hint to this? I don't know I'm just obsessed with all the weird permit locked systems and places recently. Actually had a nightmare the other night.
Interesting thought. Probably not locked as you couldn't enter it to find anything...The Formidine Rift played a crucial role in the storyline of Elite Reclamation (well worth reading) which ended with an in-game event, and may still be related to some mysteries. There are other Rifts in-game, not sure if they're named as such but irl astronomical rifts are represented. Trouble is they are huge areas, where would you start looking?
