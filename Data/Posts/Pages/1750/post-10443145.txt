That Wreaken galnet post re Col70 was to tie in with Drew Wagar's book Premonition. It has always struck me as a little odd that Wreaken were supposedly constructing a fleet of anti-goid ships right in the area where the goids were appearing!

P.S. I was putting off download of last week's game update until I'd transitioned to gigafibre internet which happened yesterday. Internet speed test 900+ Mbps upload & download...ED download speed started at 20Mbps and dropped to 11Mbps. I checked the settings and I already have multithreaded download selected.
Bah!!
