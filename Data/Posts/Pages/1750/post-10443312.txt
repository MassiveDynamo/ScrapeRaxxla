I believe so. I think it's important to remember that FD view this as a simulation (within commercially feasible game dev constrains) and have explicitly said in-game characters can lie, while clearly "The Club" have been manipulating humanity for yonks via the media. I think this must include Galnet posts. So when something is posted on Galnet and then disappears there could be a message behind that. I suspect that is true of "Omphalos Cartographies" as much as the deleted message regarding Halsey's "secret meeting" on her ill-fated voyage (though I suspect this happened more frequently during MB's oversight).

However I no longer monitor Galnet daily, in fact not at all.

I do suspect FD have given us clues in Galnet posts etc to various mysteries. The trouble is that they're so cryptic they don't help!
