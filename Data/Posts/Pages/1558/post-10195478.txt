Yes PP came a bit later in the version rollout & I agree it is unlikely to have any relevance to the Raxxla puzzle, but the three Superpowers have been in-game from the outset. It might be that MB was giving us clues (with that Dev Diary vid and Legacy) to look in Alliance space, but clearly your Underworld region is part of his puzzle. Just wondering how the Superpower regions of influence overlap with it, specifically any Alliance systems within it.
