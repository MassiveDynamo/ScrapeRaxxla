Just took the time to map every underworld, otherworld, lost world or related entities that Wikipedia could point me towards.

Apart from a handful of them (Hel, Yama, Naraka, probably some others I forgot) they seem to form a half-sphere centered on Achenar. This brings me to two hypotheses:
this is just Imperial theme naming and we're chasing a false track
they point in the general direction of Raxxla... hopefully

Dont forget universal cartographics are owned by Pilots Federation- I’m convinced there’s a Guardian/AI running that!
Yes, and his name is Jaques amongst many others.

Throwing this out there. Facece seems to be unusually important and technically Facece is a close match for Soontill given it has an actual ringed brown dwarf. That system is very possibly the most secure system in the Bubble outside of possibly Eta Cassiopeia (Federal Navy HQ). Perhaps we should check Facece 6 (believe it may have the correct number of moons based on maps in Elite Encounters RPG). There is also Holdstock lore to the effect that there a system with a brown dwarf with rings with a time anomaly from "Where Time Winds Blow", "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide", and "Tour of the Universe". System was known by Altuxor and Kamelios. The main character Leo Faulcon who's family almost certainly founds Faulcon-Delacy.

Yes, Facece 6 has the correct number of moons. Anyone got that permit?
