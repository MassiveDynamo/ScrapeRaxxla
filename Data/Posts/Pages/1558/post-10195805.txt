Just took the time to map every underworld, otherworld, lost world or related entities that Wikipedia could point me towards.

Apart from a handful of them (Hel, Yama, Naraka, probably some others I forgot) they seem to form a half-sphere centered on Achenar. This brings me to two hypotheses:
this is just Imperial theme naming and we're chasing a false track
they point in the general direction of Raxxla... hopefully
