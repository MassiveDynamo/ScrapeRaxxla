Codex says of Raxxla “the location of which is a deadly secret”; which increases my suspicion that the location is hidden in an anarchy system....it’s going to be hairy carrying Trinkets while searching an anarchy, lots of pirates will be interested!
(Mmm, maybe time to swap my exploration Phantom for combat Krait II or Corvette!)
Famous anarchies from the lore:

Elite:
Onisou (insufficient info to locate)
Xeesenri insufficient info to locate)

Frontier:
Bedaho (Astrogator/Saud Kruger/Narwhal/Brenquith/Gold skins)
Phekda (likely settled too late but very resource rich, home to Ancients of Mumu)
Zelada (aka Veliaze)

First Encounters:
Acksoex (aka Bedaho due to planet Home)
Ackwada (Brenquith)
Arexack (due to long-standing religious war)
