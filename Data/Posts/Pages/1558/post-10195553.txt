what's a green filled triangle marker on the galmap? got two popped up & cant see it in the legend. Not bookmarks...?? Unfortunately cant remember the system names.

(Edit : don’t think I was in Commodity View, and wasn’t looking for any commodities!)

Mmmm, finally got a trader with Trinkets, Hatch breakers wouldnt work....then he exploded when I was trying to shoot his cargo hatch. Needless to say none were dropped!
