Thinking about named systems…. Han Zen made a point that we cant know why they were named … probably by the inhabitants… but what about the un-inhabited systems with just a star or two that have these interesting names…. I would assume it was named by universal cartographics? A shady bunch if ever there was. - i guess im just wondering if maybe focusing on empty named systems might work -because the only reason for naming them might be as signposts…
Dont forget universal cartographics are owned by Pilots Federation- I’m convinced there’s a Guardian/AI running that!
