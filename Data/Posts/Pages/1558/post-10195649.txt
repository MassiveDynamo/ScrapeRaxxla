Hatch breakers are vulnerable to point defence turrets, so it can be tricky to get one to lock on - keep trying!

Today I have focused on looking in uninhabited systems with non-procedural names. Many of these are in the 'lost realms' region below Achenar. Almost all are empty, though there are a couple of exceptions (e.g. Mot, which I had previously visited, is almost right next to Achenar itself). As such, it feels like these are pointers to look around this region of space and not themselves the location of Raxxla or The Dark Wheel base.

I have a bit of exploration data on me now, so I will probably turn that in tomorrow and then start looking in the procedural systems around this region, with an emphasis on ringed moons.
