FD Support and Devs confirmed in a ticket that the Trinkets were linked to the now removed DW missions, it was asked why the Trinkets were still in game whilst the DW missions were not, was this an oversight or bug, FD replied saying the trinkets were now at most a ‘curiosity’; whilst the ‘story’ linked to them may be turned back on at some point?

Hypothetically I take this to indicate they were to be utilised in either the DW missions, or their own narrative, but now they are ‘environmental narrative’.

The reference FD recently made, although touching, is a direct link to Brookes book Elite Legacy and they are tethering this to Raxxla.

If there is any active function for Trinkets it is either now redundant, or they contextually direct us to the same area through their mythical links, or there is some older unknown mechanism similar to the work implemented with unknown probes!

There exists a Dev video of Brookes saying something similar, about being careful about transporting certain illegal cargo in Alliance space, it then cuts to an amusing ‘reaction’ he pulls with a Brookes smirk and appropriate ominous music!
