To me it sounds like the trinkets are used for smugling. Low price objects, with something valuable hidden inside. Anything small an valuable can be shipped discreetly, with this method. That could include mysterious tech and crystal maps, but mostly drugs or gem stones probably.

Trinkets come in the standard cargo container. I don't know if they have any hidden game function, except for story telling.
Are they used to gain favour with a particular faction, ike Crom Silver Fesh?
