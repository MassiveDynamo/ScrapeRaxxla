Yes - I’ve had the same assumption and I believe it’s highly likely.

Currently I’m re-mapping the ‘Underworld of Lost Realms’ to be more in line with Holdstock, as I built it based upon my assessment of the Codex, I suspect some part of it does fall in this area but I’ve not assessed it as was unsure of its full shape. I’m now more confident of its relevance than ever thanks to Holdstock, but I feel there are elements I’ve missed which might hold greater relevance… currently still reviewing Holdstocks Lost Realms (between RL stuff). Right now any correlation with a power is an unknown - it needs development but it feels likely.
