Yep, tried listening. Tried shooting, honking, dropping in BH, dropping midway between binary BH -all nothing!

Just musing, but:
“This container appears to hold an assorted collection of low-value trinkets, knick-knacks and statuettes. Such trinkets are generally used by superstitious pilots to try and win favour with the lady Fortuna. However, these particular knick-knacks have a much more valuable prize hidden within.”

Maybe it’s actually the “alien omphalos rift” device hidden within? Perhaps we need to carry one in a certain place to activate it, or (more likely?) carrying one will activate the OR when we get to the appropriate area (like a GG planetary ring which otherwise are too huge to search)? They carry the same side number as SAP8 containers which IIRC were supposed to carry a “crystal map”, and Guardian crystals were alien and seemed capable of mysterious things. Six-fold symmetry that Han_Zen mentioned above is typical of Guardians technology.

No, they may have to be acquired through piracy or exploration (two systems where they are common are a fair journey away from the bubble), but I suspect a different mechanism would be needed to trigger them-MB wouldnt want Raxxla to be found by happenstance but by someone undertaking the “personal journey” by following his clues.
To me it sounds like the trinkets are used for smugling. Low price objects, with something valuable hidden inside. Anything small an valuable can be shipped discreetly, with this method. That could include mysterious tech and crystal maps, but mostly drugs or gem stones probably.

Trinkets come in the standard cargo container. I don't know if they have any hidden game function, except for story telling.
