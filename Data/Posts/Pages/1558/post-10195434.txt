FD Support and Devs confirmed in a ticket that the Trinkets were linked to the now removed DW missions, and were now at most a ‘curiosity’, the story linked to them may be turned back on at some point?

There exists a Dev video of Brookes saying something similar, about being careful about transporting certain illegal cargo in Alliance space, it then cuts to an amusing ‘reaction’ he pulls with a Brookes smirk and appropriate ominous music!

Dev fiction diaries 1 around 7:11.

Yes, I referred to this the other day. From Legacy
“Julia as a girl ... dreamed of being the first pilot to discover Raxxla...She hoped to keep her Eagle as she’d grown accustomed to its idiosyncrasies”...”whether it was a suitable ship for travelling all the way to Alliance space was another matter”

So was this video clip a hint that Raxxla is located in Alliance Space? I thought he portrayed the Alliance as evil men? (Which would fit Holdstock’s mythos for Raxxla).

But how would this fit the Underworld region you identified? I know Hecate is owned by Pranav Antal, but cant remember the Superpower influence in this region. Only seem to remember Independent & one Fed system...but I didnt sleep well last week on holiday (mattress too hard for my ageing hips) & am still a bit slow. Also need...more coffee!!
