Nice- ya there do seem to be several blobs of related named systems - but this one is a considerable size.

Ive been wondering if Achenar … being the end of “the river” is the bottom of an axis.. especially as the beginning of “the river” is Orion…
Achenar marked the end if the river Eridanus, the river of the Underworld
Eridanos (mythological river) - Wikipedia

Nothing about rivers in the codex is there?
