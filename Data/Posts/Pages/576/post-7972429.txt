The first thing I did after reading the dark wheel was go to tionisla to try to follow Ryder's footsteps. I thought the cobra 3 signal would be dark wheel or raxxla related but it wasn't. Feels like that would have been a good starting point.

The Cobra III signals were Formidine Rift - because DrewW (as stated above) loves the Tionisla Graveyard.
