Since his departure from ED (though not from Frontier) that importance seems to have waned.
Just what I have been saying. Raxxla (the genuine) has left ED when MB was put aside and the E/F missions taken off.
All the lore and "clues" prior to the Codex must be retconned, imho. Myth, door and key, place that isn't, portal to other universes, twisted men, journey, etc...

The Cobra III signals were Formidine Rift - because DrewW (as stated above) loves the Tionisla Graveyard.
Lot of ghosts in the graveyards..
