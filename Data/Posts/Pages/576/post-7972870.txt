I just like the fact that a wonderful ( too soon lost ) writer such as Robert Holdstock has left a legacy that has encapsulated the minds and imagination in Elite. I expect he did not even remotely consider the hold and grasp his Raxxla legacy and the amazing adventure in his Dark Wheel novella in years to come. Even his Alien Worlds book ( that i had on my shelf from the 80's and had no idea it was him ) watered the garden where my imagination grows. I will still hunt for Raxxla. It's part of the journey.

It's one of my biggest regrets that I never got to meet Robert Holdstock.

I was fortunate enough to find out there that is a bench (with a plaque dedicated to him) in a woodland in Kent a few years back. I went on a bit of a pilgrimage there and wrote it up on my blog. Unfortunately the pictures have gone awol (I'll try to locate them) but you can get a sense of my thoughts about it all. The links are busted too, I'll try to update the article when I find the photos.
