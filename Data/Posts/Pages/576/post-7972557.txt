I just like the fact that a wonderful ( too soon lost ) writer such as Robert Holdstock has left a legacy that has encapsulated the minds and imagination in Elite. I expect he did not even remotely consider the hold and grasp his Raxxla legacy and the amazing adventure in his Dark Wheel novella in years to come. Even his Alien Worlds book ( that i had on my shelf from the 80's and had no idea it was him ) watered the garden where my imagination grows. I will still hunt for Raxxla. It's part of the journey.
