I definitely did not write 'poopoo'.

You know, if there's one thing I've learnt from writing in Elite Dangerous, it's never ignore a poopoo. I knew a CMDR, who got poopood, made the mistake of ignoring the poopoo. He poopoode it! Fatal error! 'Cos it turned out all along that the CMDR who poopood him had been poopooing a lot of other CMDRs who poopood their poopoos. In the end, we had to disband GalNet. Morale totally destroyed... by poopoo!

* With apologies to General Melchett.

Cheers,
