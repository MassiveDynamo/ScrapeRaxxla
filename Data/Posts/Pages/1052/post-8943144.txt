How about Permits? Does anyone know what they really are?

Well, obviously you are asking questions to nudge people into a certain direction because the Codex answers this question, but I don't remember now exactly which corporation controls the navigation computer which tells the FSD to which star to lock on. The permit is actually a "block" which blocks you from setting a star as a target for the FSD.

So I obviously suspect that Sirius or another corporation might be blocking access to Polaris or other stars (well aside from the Meta that FDev wants to block certain systems and regions for future story lines like currently Jupiter Rochester/Jupiter Division).

There's also the possibility that our Nav computer does not show certain stars at all but which are visibly there.

My first impulse was to look at the center of the Odins-Herme-Thoth-triangle, but nothing seems to be there in a 10 Ly-radius. But I didn't do an exhaustive search, as it's difficult to get the coordinates right.
