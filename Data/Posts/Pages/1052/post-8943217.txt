Ok, last crazy idea for today.

Chemistry was mentioned and at first I wanted to discard the idea, but after the emerald and gold revelation, it got me thinking.

Take a look at the periodic table: https://ptable.com/#Properties

Look specifically at the 4th and 5th row. You have two columns of alkali (earth) metals and you have ten columns of transition metals.
Do we have something like this somewhere? Indeed, the Isis-system!!!

We have Isis 1, Isis 2; then we have Isis I, Isis II, ... Isis X. We have 5 gas giants in the Isis-system; 2 gas giants (VI and VIII) are the same. 3 gas giants (VII, IX and X) are the same. This could be a hint like Fe+Ni or Ru+Pd and the other Co+Cu+Zn or Rh+Ag+Cd.

Also crazy coincidence even for real life: Au = Gold = the sun and Hg = Mercury are right beside each other, same way the sun and the planet mercury are beside each other.
