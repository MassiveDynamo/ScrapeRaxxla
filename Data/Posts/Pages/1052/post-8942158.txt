They didnt have jumping ... the used to have less than supercruise...
I didn't play the other games but the impression I got from the books was they had 'jumpgates' to witch space and then kind of high supercruise speeds while there then in system it was all normal space. Travel time had to have been ridiculous, like days or weeks to get places
