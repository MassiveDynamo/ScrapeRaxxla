However, if he really has found Raxxla by accident (and/or Bug) and messed up Frontiers narrative plans, how likely is it that they have made him an offer to keep quite about it? No Dark Wheel needed...

Yeah, sure. No Dark Wheel. We know who you are and when we finally do find Raxxla and see the "First discovered by Eadghe" tag you'll have some explaining to do.
