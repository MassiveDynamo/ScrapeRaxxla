Btw Drew, someone in JV.com French forums is stating that he found a planet named "?", afterward he scanned it again and it says "Raxxla".
Not sure if hoax or not, but he will provide us with a screenshot/video tonight.
He's 15k LY from Sol.

Was there ever any screenshot/video or any follow up about this? or was it just someone wanting attention?
