negative, CMDR ... It still doesn't show up for me and if it matters ( and i think it must ) , i only stared EliteDangerous game about 8 months ago so my SPACE combat rank is only 'Master' level and i only have TRADE 'Elite' rank. My other boxes in panel-4 still haven't gotten to 'Elite' status yet.
And, of course, you saw my graphics. It's def. there. I am a bit shocked by this because the poster Darrack also stated in a few posts back that it's not in game as well. That surprises me quite a bit. This should be looked into. It also shows in EDSM. So it's in the data bases...
