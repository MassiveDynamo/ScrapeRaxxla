LGM-1 is certainly on the Gal Map and is uniquely labeled for it's location. It's around 9,130 LY's from Sol. Let me know if it doesn't show up for you. This could mean it wont show unless you are something like 3X elite or in my case 4X elite+'s.
Negative, CMDR ... It still doesn't show up for me and if it matters ( and i think it must ) , i only started EliteDangerous game about 8 months ago so my SPACE combat rank is only 'Master' level and i only have TRADE 'Elite' rank. My other boxes in panel-4 still haven't gotten to 'Elite' status yet.

So maybe this means an inexperienced player like me can't actually discover RAXXLA ingame at all , unless/until i become coded 'Elite' status x 3 ( or x 4 ) ?
