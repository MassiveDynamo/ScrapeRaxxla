Re LGM, are you aware of website EDSM which gives you information on the known ED systems?

Lgm-1 (LGM-1 Pulsar) [#8900430699]
Coordinates
This system is located at: -7533.46875 / 557.34375 / 5124.125
yep i'm aware of that website , but see this post exchange above here--> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10518608 .... from me & D7 , cuz regardless that system isn't showing up at all for me ingame within GalMap. ( and that posts ^ there between me & D7 might explain why )

i have only ever purchsed & played 'Odyssey' version of this game though, if that matters?
