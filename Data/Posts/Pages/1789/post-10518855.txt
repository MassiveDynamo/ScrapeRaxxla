most are prose way of describing an astronomical body but with a double meaning. For instance the mother of galaxies is both a person and an astronomical body. Its more than I care to write here, so if you catch me live I'll explain a bunch but not all of it.

Good work!
Those pulsars have very interesting periods.
Looking forward to seeing what you come to with.
Take your time.
