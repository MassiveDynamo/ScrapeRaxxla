I pasted the EDSM link to the system. Try just entering LGM and let it autofill. https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/677507/name/Lgm-1
ok that's cool but that system won't show for me on Galmap since did you by chance see what @D7 was posting about with me just above--> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10518608 ....? -- Because now i'm just wondering: How many 'ELITE' ranks do you have in panel-4 boxes?

I have not shared my final destination, I am currently on the way to a pulsar that I will hold to myself until I get there.
Totally understandable, considering i'm gonna presume you wouldn't want anyone to umm Neil Armstrong your 1st-footing credit while getting a sip of Tang.
( don't worry it won't be me anyways, since as i mentioned already i def. don't have anywhere near enough time right now during holidays to travel 20,000 LYs ugh )
