yep i'm aware of that website , but see this post exchange above here--> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10518608 .... from me & D7 , cuz regardless that system isn't showing up at all for me ingame within GalMap. ( and that posts ^ there between me & D7 might explain why )

i have only ever purchsed & played 'Odyssey' version of this game though, if that matters?
It showing to me, in case it's relevant. I'm triple Elite.
