I am Deadly in combat, elite in exploration and trade. This access theory would need to group tested to examine the results.
Well yeah , hence my continuous query . hmm... Just still can't figure out why the 'LGM-1' system won't appear for ME , yet it seems to appear for you & @D7 ( and @Zimous and many others? ) .
Maybe it's permit locked somehow? Maybe there's a sequence-of-permits ( relating to every Engineer ) that i just haven't finished unlocking yet i dunno. --- Or maybe it requires only a SPECIFIC 'Elite' rank aka Exploration Elite.
