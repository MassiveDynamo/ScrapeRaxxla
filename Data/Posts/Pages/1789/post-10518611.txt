Bingo ^ exactly what i was thinkin' too yep.
And as to your 1st sentence, looks like we're in agreement again lol since i also suggested that very same thing to him earlier over here--> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1788#post-10518434

btw, a few things i pondered ( which of course mostly seem rather "obvious" now post-haste ) after @mach10 started answering with a bit more detail & data:
'SOL' system has 'The Mother of Gaia' ( aka EARTH? ) which is also considered the "mother of galaxy/universe" to us humans, yeah?
If, as noted within the intel/link i posted above which mach10 confirmed, the 'RA' in 'RAXXLA' could symbolize a Right Ascension , could that be a directional starting point vector? And if so, could the 'XX' = celestial coordinates ( number, degrees ) ? And then if so, could the last 2 letters 'LA' = ?
Click to expand...
There is no Left Ascension, only Right.

I pasted the EDSM link to the system. Try just entering LGM and let it autofill. https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/677507/name/Lgm-1

I have not shared my final destination, I am currently on the way to a pulsar that I will hold to myself until I get there. Then use spoilers if needed, or there will be a post with nothing.
