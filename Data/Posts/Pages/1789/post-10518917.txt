hmm , then how come, as discussed above ^^ , players like me with only ONE 'Elite' rank can't see the exact same system 'LGM-1' on GalMap ingame panel-1 but other players WITH 'Elite' rank x 3 can see that same system ?

Thanks for the intel, CMDR!

Thankyou for posting for Community's sake and the sanity of this nearly 2000 page search thread. And i really hope your journey leads to a RAXXLA "ending" ( with screenshots/video as official proof , if possible ) . Godspeed CMDR! o7
p.s. Can you please answer the question a couple of us have already tried asking you earlier, about whether or not you have 'ELITE' rank x 3 on your panel-1 boxes?
