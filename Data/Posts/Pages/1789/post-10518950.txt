LGM-1 is certainly on the Gal Map and is uniquely labeled for it's location. It's around 9,130 LY's from Sol. Let me know if it doesn't show up for you. This could mean it wont show unless you are something like 3X elite or in my case 4X elite+'s. I doubt that, but it would be quite a find in and of itself if that were found to be the case.
Rank makes no difference im Elite V x4, my wife is single Elite and it still shows, however i think you misinterpreted what i meant.
The pulsar that was originally designated LGM-1 is not in the game CP 1919 (PSR J1921+2153) in the constellation of Vulpecula (291LY).
LGM-1 which i know is in game (ive been there) is over 9K LY from SOL.
