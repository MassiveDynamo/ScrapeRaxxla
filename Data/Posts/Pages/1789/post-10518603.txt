Bingo ^ exactly what i was thinkin' too yep.
And as to your 1st sentence, looks like we're in agreement again lol since i also suggested that very same thing to him earlier over here--> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1788#post-10518434

btw, a few things i pondered ( which of course mostly seem rather "obvious" now post-haste ) after @mach10 started answering with a bit more detail & data:
'SOL' system has 'The Mother of Gaia' ( aka EARTH? ) which is also considered the "mother of galaxy/universe" to us humans, yeah?
If, as noted within the intel/link i posted above which mach10 confirmed, the 'RA' in 'RAXXLA' could symbolize a Right Ascension , could that be a directional starting point vector? And if so, could the 'XX' = celestial coordinates ( number, degrees ) ? And then if so, could the last 2 letters 'LA' = ?

RE your point #4: "i checked ingame and cannot find any system listed within GalMap named 'LGM-1' nor 'PSR B1919+21' nor 'CP 1919"

LGM-1 is certainly on the Gal Map and is uniquely labeled for it's location. It's around 9,130 LY's from Sol. Let me know if it doesn't show up for you. This could mean it wont show unless you are something like 3X elite or in my case 4X elite+'s. I doubt that, but it would be quite a find in and of itself if that were found to be the case.
