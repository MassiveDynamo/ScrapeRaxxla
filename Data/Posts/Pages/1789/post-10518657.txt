Then why not just post it all instead of dangling?
Plus i mean, the 'Crab Nebula' is like 6000 Ly's away , no? Sorry but i'm not spending that much travel time just to go on some player's wild goose chase , unless i know for certain it's gonna yield actual discovery results. I'm guessing you're just having a bit of fun with the mystery or whatever , but i mean isn't that FRONTIER's job?
Ive been to the Crab Neb during an earlier hypothesis testing phase, then carried on towards some deep black pulsar- IIRC in Legacy my ship is a few 10kylies rimwards of Colonia
(See my posts on Gravitational Wave hypothesis)

Nothing found!

Edit
Re LGM, are you aware of website EDSM which gives you information on the known ED systems?

P.S. also visited as part of the same hypothesis. Nothing found!
