Wasn't the psycho clone named after a cat?

Yep. Hassan's sister's cat.
We should be looking for planet Garfield.
Oh true! Although, i'm not sure that name's origin completely discounts connection to the mythology.

It's hard to keep track of Salom√©'s time line! I forgot that she already had the title before her disappearance. I'm still confused about her disappearance apparently being linked to the dark wheel, but when she comes back she is newly affiliated with the CoR and still no knowledge of TDW. Am i missing something here?

Edit: clearly i need to read Reclamation again.
