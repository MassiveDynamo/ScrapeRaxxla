TDW are part of the PF.
I dont think there is any evidence that TDW are evil. It was a member of TDW that was assassinated for gaining evidence of Raxxla.
Government evil...almost certainly...but the corporations worse. Sirus, Aegis,etc

I truly hope we are not TDW. That would be such a cop out. It would ruin the game for me

It's possible they did a CIA type of hide in plane sight tactic. In fact it could be purposeful. Maybe they used something more formal like that as a part of the game infrastructure.

It's also potentially hiding other information. Or a test of how stupid we are too see how to imbed other information into media to send messages over our heads. You notice media doesn't really last that long despite people saying otherwise.
