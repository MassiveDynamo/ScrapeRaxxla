I can confirm that neither Altair, Vega, Sadr or V1357 Cygni has any shadow object in the local map.

I haven't checked Cygni X-3 yet.
I had a look around on the Galaxy Map and I think the nearest system to Cygni X-3 is about 500 LY away. Cygni X-3 is a few hundred LY above the Galactic Plane but if you go down to the Galactic Plane then there is a sparse population of stars out there. Definitely max range Conda territory (with plenty of reserves of jumponium). Fleet Carrier range, though? Or the Gnosis? At one 500LY jump a week it would take nearly a year and a half to get out there!
