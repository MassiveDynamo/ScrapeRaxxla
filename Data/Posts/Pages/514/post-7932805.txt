another recent (read: ancient) consideration: Salomé and her ship, the Seven Veils. Although unnamed in the actual Old Testament, Salomé was the daughter of Hesiod. Hesiod wanted John the Baptist, who was imprisoned by her bother (Herod Antipas), to be killed. She convinced her brother to do this by making her daughter dance for Herod. Later, Christian scholars would name this daughter Salome and her performance was dubbed "The Dance of the Seven Veils". Are the names of the character and the ship the end of the references to this biblical account? The vessel Seven Veils was discovered after Kahina Loren had disappeared. It was on this recovered vessel that the galaxy at large first heard the name "Salomé" etched into Kahina's tiara along with the Dark Wheel logo. Perhaps this disappearance and distraction was the dance. Are there any other parts of this story that fit into the ED universe? Who is Hesiod, the person who convinced Salomé to dance? Who is John, the executed baptist? Who is Herod, who was convinced to actually commit the execution?
