That’s exactly what I said “we suspect Elyssia as the original”, i.e. Elyssia Fields from the original novella. Perhaps you misread what I said; probably my fault-I used a comma & should have made it a separate sentence. The suspicion is that Emperor Arissa is also a clone since the phrasing of her description in Premonition seems to draw attention to her similar looks to Salomé. Presumably “sister” to Salomé and Octavia, and perhaps Rebecca too. Why she would be a clone is debatable, but it does fit with The Club manipulating governments for their own ends.

Edit: yes, my bad. Just reread what I wrote and I definitely messed up the phrasing. Elyssia is quite likely the original (although with clones it’s difficult to know). Arissa is not the original, but may be one of the “sisters.”

Actually I’m getting less certain about the relationship here. Surely a clone is the same as the original. So if Octavia, Rebecca, Salomé and Arissa are all clones of Elyssia then they’re all five “sisters”, though of different ages.

Elyssia can't be the original she was a clone too. That's why she was hiding in the tionisla orbital cemetery waiting for Ryder. The fact that her appearance would give away she was a clone was stated in tdw novella iirc.
