Oh true! Although, i'm not sure that name's origin completely discounts connection to the mythology.

It's hard to keep track of Salom√©'s time line! I forgot that she already had the title before her disappearance. I'm still confused about her disappearance apparently being linked to the dark wheel, but when she comes back she is newly affiliated with the CoR and still no knowledge of TDW. Am i missing something here?

Edit: clearly i need to read Reclamation again.

FDev dropped the ball after the crazy bint's first disappearance - there was apparently supposed to be more storyline, but it never got put into Galnet.
Subsequently DrewW got involved with CoR and they did some 'unofficial' roleplaying with the loony bird doing lots of portentous speechifying.
FDev realized there was some cash to be made from all of this, so asked DrewW to create another book (presumably) requiring him to crowbar in the previously unattached Thargoids.
Obviously DrewW didn't want to dump the whole CoR history, so when Princess Memory-Loss reappeared she was now affiliated with CoR and the TDW linkage was dropped. Or, she could have just forgotten it - that was kind of her thing.

Basically, there were 3 phases and none of them really link up properly.
