Mmmkay..
Just playing around with that plotter..
SPOILER
Could be interesting to confirm that both Altair and Vega don't have that shadow object in game. (Tin foil time, you did say ? )
I can confirm that neither Altair, Vega, Sadr or V1357 Cygni has any shadow object in the local map.

I haven't checked Cygni X-3 yet.
