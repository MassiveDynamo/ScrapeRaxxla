Actually there are several layers of story, most of which probably were planned to have more contents. (Like when Shinrarta Dezhra was supposed to be a secret system, with special missions) The Salome/Zurara/Teorge logs part can be viewed as somewhat separate part, that can have alternate interpretations, to tie it into some larger in-game picture. It's made rather vague for a reason. Of course they wouldn't just leave it all for Drew. The anticipation for Thargoids was a story told in a hundred small fragments, it was quite interesting. It started to become inconsistent with the new Pleiades surface sites, Aegis, INRA. They didn't really figure out whether Thargoids were supposed to be secret anymore or not. You can also see it how the world built in this game reacts to a Thargoid "invasion", it didn't really. PF fighting the ax-conflict is almost like a secret Thargoid war all over again, but it's not, anymore. The Codex is already way out there, it's so different from how M. Brookes represented Elite lore. In beta you could see unfinished sketches for Codex articles, they quickly filled those up. Finding Jameson's Cobra, and INRA, was probably planned earlier, but they likely had a new team working those too. Now we have these snippets in Galnet that may or may not have any in-game relevance (I think they are written on post-it notes and put on a calendar), MMORPG style in-game events (but it's not a MMORPG), some alien pods floating somewhere in the galaxy, and some slowly moving storyline, like when Palin moves from one place to another. On the other hand, the game is mature enough for all sorts of weird sci-fi and vaporwave memes.
