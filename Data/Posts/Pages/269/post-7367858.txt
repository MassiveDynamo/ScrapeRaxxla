If you get used to it it's easier than the old system. You basically scan to allow you to selectively pick close range planets like before. And the pay out is exponentially higher. A high end teraform or earthlike are 3,600,000 credits. That is full fss, discovery, efficiency etc. It's the same as before except you don't waste time going to targets you don't want to. Nice once you get the hang of it. You can also reduce the stuff you fss scan if you are good with it probably. I'm not but I think it's possible. I just scan them all to get my name on stuff. Easy as most visited places only have the old discovery and alot have partial system scans. I have lots of stuff with my name on it now. 8)

I just got a system with 9 mill credits from like 4 big hits. It had previous discovery, but if it had been a totally new system it would have been 20 mill for one system.

I agree the FSS is worth getting used to, however I watched Ed Lewis’ final ED livestream last Thursday & was amazed at the speed with which Will was scanning around each system. Clearly the FSS has been optimised for xbox controller ‘cos it’s a bit tedious moving around the scan space using a joystick! I have a bug report raised on this; come on FD, give hotas users some love!
