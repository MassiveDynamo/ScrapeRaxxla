Mother goddesses tinfoil

The virgin mother goddess that gives birth to the universe, seem to be an important aspect of the Dark Wheel toast.

One goddess that seem to fit nicely into the story, is Neith.

Neith is a primordial creator, war goddess, goddess of hunting and weaving. She is the mother of Ra, Apep, Sobek and Heka. She is said to have always excised and to have created everything.
Her tempel in Sais had the inscription: "I am the things that are, that will be, and that have been. No one has ever laid open the garment by which I am concealed. The fruit which I brought forth was the sun"

Other interesting descriptions:
- “Opener of the Sun’s Paths in all her stations”
- "deity of the unseen and limitless sky"

SPOILER







I recommend reading the links above, as there are lots of details.

In Astronomy Neith has three representations:

- Asteroide 1122 Neith: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1122_Neith
- Neith crater on Ganymede: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neith_(crater)

and my favorite, the hypothetical Venus moon Neith: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neith_(hypothetical_moon)
This one would be fun as a basis for Raxxla, as it was observed by a dosen top astronomers between 1645 and 1768 and was never seen after that. There are also a few bits of orbital and size information, that makes searching possible(if it didn't jump, that is).


I have more on Neith, for a later post. It may not be directly Raxxla related, but may help us understand some of the ideas behind the ED universe.
