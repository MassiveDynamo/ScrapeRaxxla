Dear CMDR Puffler,

I know that this situation looks awful, and you don't hear or see anything connected to Guru and Raxxla. But could you please read at least this letter - at least because I can help.

I can hardly imagine what could happen with Guru to behave his so. But I really think that investigate this can be still useful. But, of course, not only through ancient Greek Myths. It is really a hard work to look through every name you see to find a connection - I've tried it on my home station, and found what Guru could name a Key to Raxxla. So not. But, as you see, the weakest part in every conspiracy is human. Even if it is all bull, making a riddle that will create a hype wave among several Discords, explorer groups - from USA to Russia - is not an easy task. So creating a kind of masterpiece always leaves traces. Some photos, strange words, and so on.

You are a happy man, CMDR Puffler. You are the chief of 46&2, and you are the man who has not keys to Raxxla, but keys to Guru. Of course, I understand you wanted to be famous not through your subordinate's craziness, but well, happens. I can help. I can take all this on myself (and, of course, on the shoulder's of Guru's fans), if you just contact me that we can exchange with the materials, clues and all the work Guru left. Don't worry, you'll not fill sorry for that. In the memories of all CMDR you'll be known as Guru's Savior, a man who did everything right.
