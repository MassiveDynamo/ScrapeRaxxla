Commanders,

Regarding CMDR Guru951's latest statements - As a former member of the (now disbanded) 46&2 group, I would like to apologize for all of this. I'm currently trying to understand what determined Guru to behave this way, as he has disgraced our group, abandoned his brothers and continues to torment seekers with misinformation and delusions.

From what I've managed to piece together, Guru did indeed NOT uncover anything of note, let alone the greatest mystery there is (RAXXLA).

For now, all I can recommend is steering clear of CMDR Guru951, and anything he has to say or offer.

I'm thankful you clarified this. Especially, because at Canonn, it created sorts of a sect. Believers, throwing their blatant faith around without being able to accept facts. Not only that, but even labelling everyone, criticizing either Guru or his theory, as trolls.

Sad to see Canonn ended up being rather a church to non-evident based bull.

That being said,

Etherealreality: You're one poopy Ambassador.
