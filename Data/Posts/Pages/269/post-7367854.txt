The idea that Frontier paid developers upwards of hundreds of thousands to work on content people might never see is absolutely bonkers. It is more than likely that Raxxla will be added as some sort of future content

If you don't believe FDev would task development with adding it in the past, why do you believe they would add it in the future? This makes no sense.

In any case, just because the development team wage bill is undoubtedly not small as a whole, that does not mean it cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to add something around Raxxla to the game. That would depend on how much effort Raxxla took. Even if no-one ever finds it, if it meant MB could say 'it's in the game' without lying, think how many players and how much time has been spent looking.
