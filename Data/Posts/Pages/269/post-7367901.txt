may I remind - to those still feeling unhappy about the new scan-mechanics - EXACTLY this change is in the biggest interest for those trying to solve
this question here - sheer amount of data.
The "old" System led to a dataset full of cherry-picked systems, unreliable for any statistic analysis. The new system will boost that dataflow by factor 10 at least...

Spot on Xenia!

I must point out to everyone complaining abou the FSS that during the Formidine Rift hunt we had a great amount of discussion on exploration and the need for better search& discovery tools. I made a thread to summarise the points for FD https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...earch-improvement-requirement-amp-suggestions.
I think the new planetary mapping probes are the bees knees, but there does seem to be a problem in that it has failed to localise some things I would have expected it to, like an INRA base and Jameson’s Cobra, although I’m sure the FSS did indicate human signals for these on the planets (well, actually said Guardian, but we must allow FD the occasional silly bug! )

To my mind the problem with the FSS is the slow scanning speed using joystick, and the tie to a separate analysis mode where you’re isolated from the hud. I forsee a new form of ganking - wait for an fss scan to start before attacking the explorer who cant see the griefer sneaking up on him.
