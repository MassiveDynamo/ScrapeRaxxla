It's just a hunch, but I think Raxxla is the remnant of a technology used by descendents of the Guardians and/or their AI (constructs).

Raxxla may have been used by these entities, to visit earth. These visitors would then be the basis for the gods in our ancient mythologies. Raxxla would be the Olympos, Ã…sgard or any other old form of heaven, that houses the gods.
The period of these visits might have been from approximately 12000 BC to a few thousand years BC. This is long after the main Guardian populasjon went extinct.
Someone has been reading Zecharia Sitichin.
