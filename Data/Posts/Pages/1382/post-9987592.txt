I’d agree with the last couple of posts. We’ve used the term “fluff” to indicate galnet posts which aren’t actionable in-game, but often they can still add to the “feel/immersion” of the game. I think Rochester’s point about the reporter/s we know to produce such content is a good idea- whatever happened to Ricardo Bentonio and his lizard people? I liked him!
Flint Lafosse seems to have taken over on the "might be reasonably accurate sometimes but gets carried away" side, and Kit Fowler on the "wrong but might be hinting at something important" side.

I've definitely appreciated the work that's gone into developing somewhat distinctive voices for journalists and newspapers in the last couple of years - it's more subtle than FFE since you don't get the same issue reported on simultaneously by multiple sources that often, and especially for superpower-focused stories it'd be good to have more outside perspectives, but within the constraints it's pretty good.
