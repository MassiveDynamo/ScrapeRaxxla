... pure speculation here of course, but I am of a mind that Raxxla is something different from Guardian or Thargoid. A remnant, perhaps, of something far older in the galaxy that is of concern to the Guardians and Thargoids alike. Could be something of a threat to either/both, and I still think it is somewhere between the bubble and Barnard's.
