Serious question:

Who thinks Raxxla is linked to either (or both) Thargoids or Guardians?

Or is it something separate (and therefore new) entirely?
Definitely one &/or the other. The omphalos is said to be an alien device (I‘m guessing the gateway to the Raxxla server instance)

We were told that’s a topic in the alien lore bible that is hidden from us, so it’s gotta be & my guess is Guardian as they were the ones interested in technology...I still suspect one of the Guardian ark ships.
