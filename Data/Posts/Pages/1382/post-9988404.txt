I haven't, but perhaps I should. I've seen a some ancient aliens episodes that mentions him.
He was into the Babilonian era mostly, wasn't he?

Giving new meaning to old stories that someone else wrote, is a nice trick though. It gives you a free backstory.
He's a pseudoscientist who made a fortune by creating a narrative that stitches together a collection of ancient myths with alien conspiracy theories. His first book, The Twelfth Planet was publisihed in 1976.

The writing is very cleverly layered. You read the first couple of chapters, which seem almost like the work of a genuine archaeologist and historian. He builds on these, taking you in an astonishing direction, establishing the Anunnaki and the concept of the Twelfth Planet. It is highly plausible fiction, which is why many people believe in his ideas (which are entirely bunk).

The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982) is a similar book, although the writers are genuine historians who were duped by a French hoaxter. Their theory was the basis for Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code (2003).

Interestingly, Holdstock, Poe and others make use of similar techniques in their work. Using authority figures, creating myth and weaving speculation into their stories.
