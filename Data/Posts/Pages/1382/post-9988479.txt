I do suspect that there was an earlier narrative, focused around the DW missions, with a presumed original intent of either foreshadowing or directing us to the existence of the Guardians.

Not wanting to presume too much, but the existence of the Yggdrasil systems and a potential John Milton sphere of influence (!) if real and not space-madness could indicate some type of journey via either Norse mythology which utilises portals (rainbow bridges etc) ‘bifrost’ and/or John Milton’s idea of a ‘Jacobs ladder' / ‘Heavens gate’ leading towards a location 'on the outer rim' of these spheres of influence which held some type of relevance.

This someplace else being either a narrative conduit or a literal one.

However, I do presume too much, I suspect this was actually just the rough draft of an unfinished or paused, Easter egg reference to M Brookes ‘The Space In between’ book and not Raxxla… which MB has confirmed recently in his blog he hasn’t actually begun writing, to date. Therefore their existence in game if real and not apophenia, is more likely an archeological artefact (if so I’d go so far to want to hold it up for celebration, and if Raxxla is just something silly, we get FD to complete M Brookes work - or at least turn the DW Missions back on)!

Discarding that, I presume the DW missions just pointed us to the Guardian narrative, and they were just hints and red herrings; the intent to take us into the Guardian narrative, which we are now in, so my suspicion is FD actually altered the Raxxla narrative because the player base jumped several chapters, forcing them to give it greater importance than it originally held!
