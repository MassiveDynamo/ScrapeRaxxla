Serious question:

Who thinks Raxxla is linked to either (or both) Thargoids or Guardians?

Or is it something separate (and therefore new) entirely?
Anyones guess.

Based off the logo being a hexagon, not an octagon it’s less likely to be Thargoid.

Based off the older (now removed) DW missions descriptions of data crystals, it’s more likely to be Guardian…

The spacial locations attributed to Guardians could link it, as our information (limited) is predominantly focused around the bubble.

If the Raxxla codex is linked to Delphi (still an unknown) that places it close to the Thargoid space, but who knows!

I recall M Brookes once gave a little clue about where Thargoids appear, and how it related to their resource needs, I don’t think that was ever followed up but I simply presumed it related to nebulous areas.

So my bet its Guardian AI tech, but maybe FD has changed the story?

But we don’t know really…
