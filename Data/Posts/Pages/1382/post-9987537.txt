Galnet since its return in 2020 has had a consistently-used mechanism for articles:
- articles headed "Pilot's Federation Alert" refer to something immediately actionable in game (a CG, a new POI to find, a new module being available, etc.)
- articles without that heading might still be important for knowing what's going on but you don't need to hunt around every system mentioned in them just in case
Any particular story arc will usually have a mix of both types of article.

The actionable/unactionable distinction isn't quite the same as important/unimportant, of course, and I'd rather that they didn't feel that they had to highlight it even subtly like this, but overall I think the post-2020 stories have been stronger than most of Galnet's previous eras of storytelling.
Here's the problem with that -- there are 3 distinct layers of information present:
Exoteric - information available to all who can read or hear

Esoteric - Knowledge available only to those who go looking and learn (e.g. some systems had differerent names and the named planets or stations are often keys in deciphering this hidden history)

Anagoge ("the hidden of the hidden") - You can deduce from small details (e.g. colonization patterns by degrees of resource utilization, types of stations present, etc.).

This is why we have terraformed, terraforming, and candidate for terraforming). This goes a lot deeper than just colonization. There are TONS of ammonia worlds with hybrid ammonia-oxygen atmosphere in the Bubble ( see HIP 15310 ) where apparently those system may have more going on than meets the eyes.

Standard disclaimer: Examples provided barely manage to touch on the depths to which this can be utilized.
