I’d agree with the last couple of posts. We’ve used the term “fluff” to indicate galnet posts which aren’t actionable in-game, but often they can still add to the “feel/immersion” of the game. I think Rochester’s point about the reporter/s we know to produce such content is a good idea- whatever happened to Ricardo Bentonio and his lizard people? I liked him!
