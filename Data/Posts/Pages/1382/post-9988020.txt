The trouble with the Gan Romero story was that it was too detailed, so it led us to think that it was hinting at actionable gameplay. In a way it was-it was supposed to be a follow up to Halsey’s “Caretaker of the Galaxy” visions and lead us to Guardian sites, so I dont think that particular storyline was handled well. But then FD overreacted by putting a total gagging notice on the Galactic News Service....

So I suspect the problem wasnt “fluff”, but the way the FD storyline team were managed &/or operated. Hopefully lessons were learnt & that problem has been resolved.....

So let’s get this thread back onto the Quest for Raxxla!
Pretty please?
