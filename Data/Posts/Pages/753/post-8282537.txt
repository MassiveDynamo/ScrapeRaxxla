I was trying to get to the Cone nebula way before the Gnosis... almost got it done but Frontier fixed the neutron star FSD Charge double stacking.

To get there I'd need about 21 days in SC, consuming 1.17t of fuel/h with all modules turned off except by FSD and Thrusters. See below my waypoints:

Cone Nebula Jump
1. PLAA THUA LM-D D12-4 (low fuel tank);
2. PLAA THUA PN-B D13-0 (fill fuel tank);
3. CONE SECTOR ZE-Z B0 (392.40Ly);

I was going to do IRAS 21565-3937 without the gnosis and before the gnosis before I began to think it wasn't possible.

From HD 202844 > HD 203755 > HD 205448 > IRAS 21565-3937. You can also go directly to IRAS from HD 203755 as it's only 280ly's away.

I discovered everything in HD 203755 but the main star. It's very close to the last two stars.

HD 203755 > HD 205448 = 200ly approx.
HD 205448 > IRAS 21565-3937 = 203ly approx
HD 203755 > IRAS 21565-3937 = 284ly approx.

They form a bit of a triangle. Not sure which path would be faster for the last jump. I'm guessing the two jumps are better as you can manage fuel to get max jumps and gives a save point. I assume all have refueling stars. Could be wrong though.

I wish they had not done the gnosis trip like that. I wanted to be first to get it the old fashion way.
