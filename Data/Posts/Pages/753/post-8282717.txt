I just got around to checking this out. EDD will do it for you.

Go to History, hit the Filter section, select 'none' to clear them all and then go and select Rank, Reputation, Progress and anything else you're interested in. Looks like the log has an 'unknown' but unsurprisingly I don't know what that is...

SPOILER: EDD - FILTER ON PROGRESS/RANK ETC

What it doesn't do though from what I can tell is allow us to track Minor Faction status (i.e. Allied). I can't see that anywhere, so it may be only an FDEV stored value.

Thanks!
I asked the question on the EDD thread and Ian666 answered that these Cmdr stats are not updated in real time in the journal, just on game start. So obviously stored by FD & downloaded on start- guess its an anti-cheat mechanism. But will be more efficient than frequently typing them out myself into a progress spreadsheet!
