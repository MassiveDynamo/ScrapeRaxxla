If you start at point A and jump to point B it cost X fuel.

If you travel half way to B from A and jump does it cost 1/2X or X.
If by travel you mean supercruise, then X*.
If by hyperjump (to a hyperjumpable point in between = another system), less than Â½X, because fuel usage grows exponentially with distance increase.

*any perceived reduction in fuel usage is not caused by the travelled distance, but by reduction of mass (fuel used for the travel).
