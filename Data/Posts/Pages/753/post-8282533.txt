I spent way more than 200 RNGs rolls for grade 5 FSD range on Felicity Farseer trying a better result...
Why ? RNG gives something close to fixed maximum. Once you got maximum - u cannot have better ever.
Furthermore, not obvious part ... you may skip finishing lower grades. For example u click-click random 3rd grade. Once 4th grade update activated - u can stop doing 3rd. And click 4th. This will autoset 3rd complete to maximum.
