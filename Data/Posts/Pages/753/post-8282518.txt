These 21 days in SC was just to reduce the distance to be able to make the hyperjump. Back then, the most I got from my Anaconda was 77.3Ly jump range... they tweaked the engineers after this so now we can get more than 80Ly.

I spent way more than 200 RNGs rolls for grade 5 FSD range on Felicity Farseer trying a better result...
