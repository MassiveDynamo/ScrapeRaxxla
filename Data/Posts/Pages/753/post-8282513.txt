I was trying to get to the Cone nebula way before the Gnosis... almost got it done but Frontier fixed the neutron star FSD Charge double stacking.

To get there I'd need about 21 days in SC, consuming 1.17t of fuel/h with all modules turned off except by FSD and Thrusters. See below my waypoints:

Cone Nebula Jump
1. PLAA THUA LM-D D12-4 (low fuel tank);
2. PLAA THUA PN-B D13-0 (fill fuel tank);
3. CONE SECTOR ZE-Z B0 (392.40Ly);

last one is permit locked.
IF u're trying to avoid lock by direct fly into ... you will fail. Hyper jump is a must. It is "loading screen". It's even changes background star positions. Go try what you want on some close systems with less then 1 ly between. I saw couple near bubble.
