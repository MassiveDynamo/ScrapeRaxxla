True enough.
I'm just trying to help people read it by pointing out that treating it as a set of waypoints isn't going to work


Even though it's not a clue

Ive been thinking about the waypoint issue. One is that extra info could be found at each of the waypoints that makes it more solvable.

The other is a bit sneaky... We know universal cartographics is tracking us... What if raxxla only becomes visible on our maps if we visit certain systems and meet certain criteria? Would be a little annoying but might fit the "we know why no one has found it" and how it would be a personal journey for each commander.
