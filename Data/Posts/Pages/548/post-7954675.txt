Did you never play with treasure maps as a kid? Go to the tree at the bottom of the garden, walk 5 paces left, then 3 paces forward. X Mark's the spot.
You dont need to go to the tree, you can go straight to the X, but how do you find the x, without going to the tree and following the directions? Assume it's a big harden and you cant just :see" the X. I mean like 400 billion systems sized garden)

Sorry - "lover's woe". Makes a big difference.
