Hypothetically speaking if someone in the dark wheel, possibly Ryder at one point in time in the past, did have a 'map to raxxla' in a certain sense. Perhaps that person dies before anyone else ever sees the alleged 'map.'

now perhaps years later someone else in the dark wheel going through that person's belongings finds the alleged 'map' but doesn't realize what it is, other than at face value.

Now imagine the 'map' is more of directions in the form of a riddle, that way if found, wouldn't provide straightforward directions. Suppose it says..

Just asking: Did we ever find the wreckage of Ryders ship in Leesti? The ship would be a nice place to store a map...
