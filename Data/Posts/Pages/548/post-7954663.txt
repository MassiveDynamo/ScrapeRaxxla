If it's directions then surely the last step is the only important one. Like, I can get to Heart and Soul without needing to go via NGC 7822, so just tell me to go to H&S. Unless Raxxla has magic powers and knows where I've been.
Did you never play with treasure maps as a kid? Go to the tree at the bottom of the garden, walk 5 paces left, then 3 paces forward. X Mark's the spot.
You dont need to go to the tree, you can go straight to the X, but how do you find the x, without going to the tree and following the directions? Assume it's a big harden and you cant just :see" the X. I mean like 400 billion systems sized garden)
Edit
It makes sense that Jason would use a riddle/treasure map, instead of stating a system name, in case it fell into the wrong hands. After his death, TDW find the riddle/map and use it as their toast.
Why care if anybody overhears it, it's like having an encrypted email stolen...meh. Good luck decoding it!
