Ive been thinking about the waypoint issue. One is that extra info could be found at each of the waypoints that makes it more solvable.

The other is a bit sneaky... We know universal cartographics is tracking us... What if raxxla only becomes visible on our maps if we visit certain systems and meet certain criteria? Would be a little annoying but might fit the "we know why no one has found it" and how it would be a personal journey for each commander.

If they waypoints contain clues then they're either extremely well hidden, or the systems we need to visit aren't any of the obvious ones.

I firmly believe that TDW is hooked into UC and will contact us when we've visited whatever collection of systems their entrance criteria are based on.
