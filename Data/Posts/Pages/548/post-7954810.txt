Yes there is that...but...in the Codex it says the 'Alleged Toast of the Dark Wheel' so they're not even confirming that and its under the Raxxla topic not the dark Wheel topic so theres that as well..

Don't know if its relevant, if any of it is in fact, but just noticed the toast has 6 lines:

To the Jewel...R
To the whisperer...A
The Siren...X
The parents grief...X
The Lovers woe...L
And the yearning....A

Just maybe if you come across a Siren beginning with X for example, it may lead somewhere, maybe.

Well, I thought it is 6 too initially >:. But decided it is not. In "SG-1" movie each star was descibed by 6 symbols, guess 6 points shows unique pos in 3D.
