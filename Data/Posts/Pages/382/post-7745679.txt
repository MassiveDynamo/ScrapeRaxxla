I've been running TDW missions for over a year chasing an invitation. The staggering amount of things shipped, salvage recovered, rocks mined, and people silenced... As of yet, no dice.

I done this for 3 weeks as well. I once in while would get mission in space from an unmarked (No Ship ID) Type 10 (Defender I think) telling me to buy certain commodities and deliver it to the targeted system for certain factions.

I haven't skipped out on these missions either hoping for something different an unique to do.
