some tinfoil here looking at this it states...Ancient history believed the moon of Lave to be Raxxla;however Lave has no visible moon... what if there was a moon then! just now its called castellan belt castellan we all know to be a governor/warden but as a massive doctor who fan I know this word to mean High ranking time lord.. has the castellan belt ever been searched something could be there in my head

Has anyone tried to look for a Rogue Planetoid in the outermost regions of the Lave system? Perhaps it escaped orbit. If it was ejected, it likely wouldn't have an orbit line.

Im thinking it might be like the voyager probes in that it's WAAY out there in the system and wont pop up on the scanners/nav panel till your close to it.
