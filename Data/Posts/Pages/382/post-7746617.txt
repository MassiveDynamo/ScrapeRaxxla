Has anyone tried to look for a Rogue Planetoid in the outermost regions of the Lave system? Perhaps it escaped orbit. If it was ejected, it likely wouldn't have an orbit line.

Im thinking it might be like the voyager probes in that it's WAAY out there in the system and wont pop up on the scanners/nav panel till your close to it.

So I'm gonna assume that's a no........
