I've been running TDW missions for over a year chasing an invitation. The staggering amount of things shipped, salvage recovered, rocks mined, and people silenced... As of yet, no dice.

Are you now allied with all the factions that's seemingly on good standing with TDW?
One thing that I've noticed, is that both benevolent & non-benevolent missions are made to the same faction, which seems to muddy the waters a bit. The assumption being that TDW knows what they're doing, i.e. why hurt friends?
