Maybe, if it exists...
@Emperor IIRC we only have Lyta Crane's (a name that itself sounds suspicious to me given the first four letters represent star types) about "the TDW stealth station"...is it really a toroid? Does it really exist? Is it really stealthy? It all sounds promising, but could it be that she made it all up based on some rumours about "a legendary group of adventurers, explorers,
investigators and treasure-hunters , the existence of which is so lacking in corroborative evidence that it is generally considered a myth" ... how come she knows so much about them? I have very little faith in any part of her codex entry!

I suspect if it exists this forgotten/hidden station might be a dodecahedral Coriolis...."In 2752 the first Coriolis station was in orbit around the world Lave. Each Coriolis station has a diameter of 1 standard kilometre" (from original Elite manual), so almost 600 years before current date; I think there should be instances of very old Coriolis that might well have been forgotten.

Cool... I knew there'd be a reason why you hadn't overlooked the toroid design....
