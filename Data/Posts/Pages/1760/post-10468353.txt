Yes I completely agree with that. I'm more than happy for this topic to meander off for a few posts every now and then, as it oft does, because you never know when you might make a random connection. And it might help keep you all slightly sane... maybe...

But spreading over multiple pages is a bit much
Mea Culpa!
But sanity, in this thread??

I am an internet luddite (it wasnt invented until I was well into my twenties) but I fully accept that I (unintentionally) overstepped the mark!

(I was overkeen because Ive had another Raxxla hypothesis floating around in my mind for a couple of weeks, and Ive been eagerly awaiting the Mandalay to get a reasonably armed (DB reported to have said "Raxxla will reveal itself ... if you are at the right place and you scan it enough...You have to be Elite." ) long-distance ship to test it out.)
