LOL... We're generally a helpful bunch here... The main topic is the hunt, the odd slight distraction and side discussion within reason is more than welcome in my view...


Yes I completely agree with that. I'm more than happy for this topic to meander off for a few posts every now and then, as it oft does, because you never know when you might make a random connection. And it might help keep you all slightly sane... maybe...

But spreading over multiple pages is a bit much
