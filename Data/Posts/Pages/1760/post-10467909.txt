Get back on topic, and stay on topic. New ships and steam installations have nothing to do with the quest.

Also that's a Coriolis station, look at the triangles. It's been there for years
LOL... We're generally a helpful bunch here... The main topic is the hunt, the odd slight distraction and side discussion within reason is more than welcome in my view...

New ships and extracting the maximum jump distance can help in exploration if you think heading in to the black is the way to go.... So could be considered in topic....

Am I missing some rules outlined in this thread I am unaware of?

Also if someone is struggling to get the game to work to engage in the hunt (or use a quicker way of installing updates) does it cause harm in some way?
