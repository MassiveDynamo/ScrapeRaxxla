It was a good book - worth a read.

I feel it necessary to provide a slightly better version of the "V" I made a while back. As the one from my original post was very rough.




I will add that the name of the Book "And Here the Wheel" is from the poem "The Waste Land" by TS Eliot... the poem is (i understand) a reaction to the Great War - and it starts with the Burial of the Dead...
There is the Broader context of the "Wasteland" - I think Campbell had something to say about the idea of the Wasteland and the path of the Outlaw... But also there is the interpretation of a "Wasteland" being created as a response to the imprisonment/stealing of the child of the Nature Goddess.

The Quote:
"Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel" - Eliot himself in his notes said the man with three staves (a tarot card) is the Fisher King... Back to the Grail... or is it a Cauldron?
