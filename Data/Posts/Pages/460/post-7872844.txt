Hypothesis:
For each user, Raxxla is in a unique location. (A place that is not a place - a journey each of us has to make)


That hypothesis is seemingly contradicted by announcements saying it was a "definite location" and Fdev knew "where it is".
However , a definitive location might be something like 500ls from a star and knowing where it is might depend on input variables (your cmdr name?). Also considering "somewhere in the milky way" doesn't help a lot to disprove the hypothesis.

Now, please, go ahead and shred it...
