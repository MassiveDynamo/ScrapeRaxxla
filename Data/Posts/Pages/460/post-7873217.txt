Time to turn around and head back to the bubble check list:

The week to 10 days trip started over a month ago - CHECK
No paint left on ship - CHECK
Hull integrity < 80% - CHECK
No heatsink left - CHECK
No standard conductors left - CHECK
Space madness kicked in to the point I swear the space pumpkins are whispering to me - CHECK
Found Raxxla, killed the evil men and stuffed the Omphalos Rift in the back of my SRV - DARN IT! There is always something I forget at the shops....

Crossing over into Hawkins Gap shortly. If anybody wants anything checked out in Lyra's Song/Hawkins Gap, let me know whilst I'm still having to manually plot my route. I'll be picking up the pace towards Sol once my Nav Com can start plotting again.

You might visit the Hawking’s Gap Dynasty bases & supply us some aerial photos. I’ve just been doing some more thinning of my Distant Worlds2 pictorial records (now down to 40Gb from 80!) and have spotted a strange linear feature on the ground at one of the Conflux bases that I visited. Don’t understand how I missed it when I was there. Would be interested to see if there is similar near the Gap bases. Just closed down gaming PC; will put that shot on Imgur tomorrow & append a link to this post so you can see what I mean.

Edit: This is the image I'm talking about:

and here I've annotated the odd features I just spotted yesterday:
