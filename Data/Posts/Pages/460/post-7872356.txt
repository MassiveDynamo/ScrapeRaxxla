'Weh' is Nepalese for 'red panda'.
Red pandas eat ferns (possibly, I'm not an expert).
Pandas also do kung fu (definitely seen that written down somewhere).
Kung Mu is a system with an ELW - where pandas might live.

Definitely a clue!

All these blatant clues are reminding me of red dwarf episode "back to reality" !
