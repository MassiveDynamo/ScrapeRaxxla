'Weh' is Nepalese for 'red panda'.
Red pandas eat ferns (possibly, I'm not an expert).
Pandas also do kung fu (definitely seen that written down somewhere).
Kung Mu is a system with an ELW - where pandas might live.

Definitely a clue!
It's science yo! I'm glad to see standards haven't slipped any in my absence. If the "h" in "Weh" is italicized in Nepalese is the meaning any different?
