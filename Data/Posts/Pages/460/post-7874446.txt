Sorry no attachment attached.

Did something for you last night: Jumped over to Sol. DSS/FSS on Mars. Nothing found. Where the heck are Phobos and Deimos?

Concerning Eurybia: System scan complete. One planet with 47 Geologicals and Eurybia 3 has multiple Vopal sites. Um yeah and got jumped by a Chieftain while scanning the planet Liz is on. Good idea to bring the Vette.

Besides: Following Jorkis idea I went to Sylvias. Nearly only aggressive missions there. Will take some of them and wait for results.
