Time to turn around and head back to the bubble check list:

The week to 10 days trip started over a month ago - CHECK
No paint left on ship - CHECK
Hull integrity < 80% - CHECK
No heatsink left - CHECK
No standard conductors left - CHECK
Space madness kicked in to the point I swear the space pumpkins are whispering to me - CHECK
Found Raxxla, killed the evil men and stuffed the Omphalos Rift in the back of my SRV - DARN IT! There is always something I forget at the shops....

Crossing over into Hawkins Gap shortly. If anybody wants anything checked out in Lyra's Song/Hawkins Gap, let me know whilst I'm still having to manually plot my route. I'll be picking up the pace towards Sol once my Nav Com can start plotting again.
