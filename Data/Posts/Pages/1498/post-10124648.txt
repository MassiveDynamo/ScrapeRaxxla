where can I find what DB said about these missions?
Look in my signature for link to a thread I created to capture important information utterances from FD & the source link is there.
DB was saying that they expected players to follow the missions & they were intended to guide you around the universe....most of those missions are within the bubble, but passenger missions take you to scenic views at long distances.
