I read this in Jorkis Summary:

David Braben:
“There are missions out there I know almost no players have seen,”....I wasn’t making friends with the minor factions.

I accepted a mission by TDW today .
i was asked in a message to do a "chaos" mission and kill 20 civilian ships.
so I asked myself what if becoming enemy to a faction triggers events in game?
