It could be tied to those missions Braben says hasn't been triggered because the players don't play the game as planned (what players? What was planned when Cmdr Jameson himself stated he settled for money and fame?). If so, the "asset" might be triggered in a specific location by the specific mission given to the specific player, so it would be impossible to just go out and look for Raxxla, and still, it would be accessible to every player who can trigger it (if no other prerequisite it is still in line with the quote I believe).

It is, in my opinion, almost certainly tied to TDW. The key is to contact the esoteric circle of TDW, I believe. How ? I don't know.
Famous explorer missions. Most of which are reputation locked. Passenger missions can further be locked based on cabin type and/or size requirements.
