Didn't DB say something along the lines of 'it might be easier to find if more people scan for it' ?

Cant find the source for it.
This was reported by someone within this thread, cant remember who, but I never found a source for it and I believe he was the only person that reported it. I have repeated it a couple of times in the thread in an effort to jog peopleâ€™s memories, without result. The trouble is that it rings a very vague bell in the depths if my memory. I seem to remember some livestream where someone asked DB about Raxxla and his answer was that it might be found if enough people honk it so might be best found by a wing. Some of the very early livestreams were deleted from the FD YT site, perhaps in one of those? It would have been between mid 2015 to end 2016, when I stopped watching livestreams (at my age life is too short!). Whether this is memory or imagination I do not know. Nothing similar has ever been repeated, so even if he did say it then it might have been misdirection? It may also have been retconned!!
