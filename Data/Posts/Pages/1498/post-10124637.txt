Didn't DB say something along the lines of 'it might be easier to find if more people scan for it' ?

Cant find the source for it.
Yes but no source, I might presume this was a misinterpretation from back when he talked a lot about exploitation, I feel it might relate to how dark systems were to be discovered, but itâ€™s all 3rd hand information now so nothing is conclusive.

All we really have is the Codex.
