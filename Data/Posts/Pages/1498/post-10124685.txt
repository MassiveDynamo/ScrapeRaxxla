I read this in Jorkis Summary:

David Braben:
“There are missions out there I know almost no players have seen,”....I wasn’t making friends with the minor factions.

I accepted a mission by TDW today .
i was asked in a message to do a "chaos" mission and kill 20 civilian ships.
so I asked myself what if becoming enemy to a faction triggers events in game?

Try it and see!
(If your moral compass allows you to kill civilians, and if you don't think that will count against you in some way)
P.S. Ive pointed out in the past that TDW are described in Codex as “adventurers and treasure seekers”, and in the Elizabethan era “gentlemen adventurers” was used to describe pirates!
