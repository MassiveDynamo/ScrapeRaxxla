The book clearly states that Ahmed navigated his ship/probe through the Urgenirk Darks, (a line of Black Holes) and reached the Raxxla sector.
Orion Molecular Cloud Complex has a lot of black holes chained alongside neutron stars. This may be the Urgenirk Darks. It is one of the more massive nebula regions in the galaxy. I just haven't figured out. The sequence starts towards the center of a star cluster with names of star lovers (astronomers and astronauts). Seek the Orion Nebula Vistor Center at PMD2009 48. The first black hole isn't far. This was part of first Raxxla theory years ago. FDev keeps leading us there. It's clearly important.

You'll need to plot a route through Witchhead Nebula. It is otherwise impossible to reach.
