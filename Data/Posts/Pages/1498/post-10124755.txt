Back to basics.
So whilst mining ive been looking back at my Journey, where it all started with that Novella.
When Robert Holdstock wrote it, the Alien World must still have been on his mind as it was only four years after and i am assuming that the complete guide was the first ever mention of Raxxla.
So IF, IF!!, he had that universe in mind when writing 'The Dark Wheel' we already know where Raxxla is and how to get there (admittedly vague).
Bare with me.
Raxxla is in the Green section (A) depicted as a swirling galaxy, we (The Milky Way 12) are in B the Human sector divided from it by the Frontier and Samarandara's Pearls.
The book clearly states that Ahmed navigated his ship/probe through the Urgenirk Darks, (a line of Black Holes) and reached the Raxxla sector.
The Dark Wheel is described as a galaxy inhabited by Human type life forms and fabled by the Narathnu, it also tells of a Human Generation ship that discovered that region.
Still with me?

So its still my belief that Raxxla (as such) is not in game because its not in the same Galaxy, BUT the way there is, we just haven't found it.
For me it still hinges on Black Holes and a way to travel intergalactic.

However there is a huge flaw in my plan Blackadder, the Universe depicted in the Alien World doesnt tie in nicely with Elite
At the time of publish (August 1980) the book lists the year as 10674 AE, which would make our current year (3309) 10716 AE meaning we invented space flight 10k years ago, obviously not right.
The book also lists the first stellar age as 2987 AD - again doesn't fit the ED timeline.
My conclusion? i have none, i would love to think that Holdstock's vision of the Universe was Elites, but im beginning to think that only the Idea of Raxxla was put into the game and maybe im barking down the wrong rabbit hole.
