Side note :
I still believe Cassiopeia is a prime candidate for exploration, here is why :
Cassiopeia is a constellation in the northern sky named after the vain queen Cassiopeia, mother of Andromeda (I know, mother of galaxy/galaxies).
The appearance of the Milky Way supernova of 1572 belongs among the most important observation events in the history of astronomy, it was visible in Cassiopeia ((burning jewel)
Cassiopeia A is a supernova remnant and the brightest extrasolar radio source (burning jewel again)
α Cassiopeiae (Latinised to Alpha Cassiopeiae) is the star's Bayer designation. It bore the traditional name Schedar, which was first encountered in the Alfonsine tables of the thirteenth century. It derives from the Arabic word صدر şadr, meaning "breast" (brow, round, breast, mother) : https://inara.cz/elite/starsystem/27552/
It is visible from Earth circumpolar. Could it be the true meaning of a Dark Wheel?? An orbit!
