Side note :
I still believe Cassiopeia is a prime candidate for exploration, here is why :
Cassiopeia is a constellation in the northern sky named after the vain queen Cassiopeia, mother of Andromeda (I know, mother of galaxy/galaxies).
The appearance of the Milky Way supernova of 1572 belongs among the most important observation events in the history of astronomy, it was visible in Cassiopeia ((burning jewel)
Cassiopeia A is a supernova remnant and the brightest extrasolar radio source (burning jewel again)
α Cassiopeiae (Latinised to Alpha Cassiopeiae) is the star's Bayer designation. It bore the traditional name Schedar, which was first encountered in the Alfonsine tables of the thirteenth century. It derives from the Arabic word صدر şadr, meaning "breast" (brow, round, breast, mother) : https://inara.cz/elite/starsystem/27552/
It is visible from Earth circumpolar. Could it be the true meaning of a Dark Wheel?? An orbit!

Well, doni forget Mother Gaia-main faction in Sol, the birthplace of humanity. Gaia created the Sky, which contains all galaxies! Also a 20th Century astronomical research satellite.....

Search this thread for my hypothesis about Dark Sirens, neutron stars, black holes, supernovae etc. I did a lot of exploration but found nothing and got burnout from the travel. There are several RL supernovae remnants that are not implemented in game, several quests were attempted to find them. MB said they weren’t in the star catalogues that were used to build the ED galaxy.
