Further, since a lot of them are precisely orientated to the cardinal directions (NEWS) and many also factor in major star constellations and celestial objects we've only 'officially' learned about in the recent past, there's a possibility humans were significantly smarter thousands of years ago than we are right now.

Pharao Zero was recently traced (artefakts) to 5000 BC. Oldest known megastructure - 10.000 BC. Drastic climatic change (extinction of many species) - 10.800 BC.
Incas explicitly stated to Spains (documented) that they had NOT builded those structures - they already existed long time ago. Fascinating.
