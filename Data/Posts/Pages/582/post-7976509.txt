I thought Atlantis was based on Thebes or a Greek island that got destroyed by a volcano, its a popular area for volcanoes and islands made of volcanoes. Pompeii wasn't the only one.

So Prester John is most likely a fraud rather than a myth? Interesting, so Raxxla is now compared in the Codex to 2 myths and 1 fraud...maybe the Codex is trying to tell us something but unlike Fox Mulder 'I refuse to believe!' that.

I am seriously wondering what else is in the game from the books, probably not of FR depth but who knows.
