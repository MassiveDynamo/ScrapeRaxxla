Btw, if anyone still has doubts about weird things happening in the Bermuda Triangle, even major hurricanes may loose their way over there:
SPOILER
I spent a week there, sailing from Bahamas to Bermuda. Didn’t even see a mysterious light. It’s a quiet place i April.
Met a huge whale with her calf though. She was friendly and came so close I could have jumped on top.
She probably didn’t notice that I’m Norwegian.
