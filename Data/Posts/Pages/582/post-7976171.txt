A Request:

I'm currently sitting in Miami waiting for Hurricane Dorian to show up. I'm likely to lose power for a few days, so if you could all hold of on finding Raxxla until next weekend, that'd be much appreciated.


Mmm, tempting!
But I thought youâ€™d already found (& moved ) it

Keep your head down!
