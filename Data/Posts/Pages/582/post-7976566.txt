I hate to be one of those people.. But the current fascination with "fake news".... Gerrr< stomps around shaking fist at sky>( Fdev)
Its all subjective... The myth of Prester John was an active part of the Wests view of the East for a period of time... Just like Eldorado in the Americas and Atlantis for the Greeks ( all of which were theme based on older tales- yes even prester john) . They symbolzed wonderous lands beyond the boarders... And affected very real world decisions. So Myths yes... Fake? Sure they are all fake. But also all very real.
