Recent Galnet articles about the Art Thief.
Some of the names (of the artists and the investigators) are anagrams. For example, Madoc Evander = More Advanced. Femi Abram = Mamba Fire. Imogen Ryang has a whole slew of anagrams, though few make sense in the context of the game. Barclay Uxor has the letters for "Raxla" in it, though only one x. I'm not very good with codes or anagrams, perhaps you guys could also check the link to the full articles posted by Oblackhando and check for anagrams.

This may not be related to Raxxla; it may be something about the next expansion.

Also, I wonder if we can see this (or something similar) on Mars, heh. Don't have time to check today, unfortunately, sorry about that.
