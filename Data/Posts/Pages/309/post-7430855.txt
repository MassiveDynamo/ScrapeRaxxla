People.

I believe to have found another clue to Raxxla or DW.

Recent Galnet articles about the Art Thief.

Look into the pieces that they stole. Now find the connections to the Nereids. Those are connected to Cassiopeia.

Now look into what the art thief stole the first time...

Holy moly, let the speculation begin
