here are some of my notes on the cat thief..

Rembrandt in an uncharacteristically defiant pose, and the famous Picasso on the pain of war and an early cubist picture..

Terra Absentia means 'missing ground', but of course, no wikipedia page for a painting done in 23xx.

feel free to browse the rest of my notes..

Terra Absentia would have been painted in 22xx, wouldn't it?

23. century is usually 2200-2299.

It's in the Raxxla period.
