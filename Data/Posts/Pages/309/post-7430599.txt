I can't. Because in order to take Raxxla seriously, you must take ED seriously.
But so many disappointments and inconsistencies ...

Well, I don't mean serious outside the realms of the game itself, but in-game. What I mean to say is that I hope people on these forums don't just post random things to say they found something when they really haven't. That's what general Discord channels are for.

I would hope that if something were legitimately found, such evidence would be posted. I feel this is a community effort.
