There is a system named "Gurney Slade", which is a reference to the title of a cult 60's surreal sitcom that was apparently beloved of DB... (It is also the name of a village in Somerset with a jolly nice pub )
Anthony Newley, 6 episodes, very surreal and fun and out on DVD. Braben has good taste!

You probably won't believe me then, when I tell you that not too far from Gurney Slade is a village called Midsomer Norton...
My grandfather was a miner there. Before all the murders
