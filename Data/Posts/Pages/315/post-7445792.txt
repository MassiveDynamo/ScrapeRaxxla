Here's Obsidian Ant's post of 2015, so others can see what we're referring to. I've always noticed that region and thought it a bit odd looking as there are so many bright stars all in a line. Kept meaning to go have a look, and I'm not _very_ far away at them moment. Maybe I'll swing by for the hell of it.

According to edsm, NGC7822 is known as The Siren of the Spinward Stars.

where did that come from? Search for the term and only ED stuff comes up - who added that to EDSM? Is there an out of game reference for that name?
