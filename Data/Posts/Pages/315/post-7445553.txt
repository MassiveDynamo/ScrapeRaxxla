According to edsm, NGC7822 is known as The Siren of the Spinward Stars. Been through every Class O in it. Mapped quite a few. S171 9 is my favorite system of them. It has 3 black holes. Just favorite for beauty, not due to anything riddle related. S171 34 has the Cupids Arrow tourist beacon. That was the 2nd step in our process. "Ours" being the 46&2.
