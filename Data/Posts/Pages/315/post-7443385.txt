Well there is a utopia in the game. I thought it was a system. I still think I saw a system name utopia. Maybe if you get allied with utopia you have found raxxla?!

Thanks for the link. After reading recently reading on galnet about the Utopians I had wondered where to find them. Seems theyâ€˜re a bit in the tradition of Thomas Mores Utopia.
