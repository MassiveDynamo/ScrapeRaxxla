It has always generated the proper ellipse to my knowledge - here is an extreme example I posted back in 2015:

I do wonder that, if Raxxla is indeed a planet, it might have an extreme orbit like this, having been found initially within scanner range (of the time) of a star but then heading way out into deep space. I wonder if a hyperbolic orbit/trajectory could be manually inserted by the devs (they don't seem to be generated by Stellar Forge) - and how such an object might be represented on the system map or whether it would have to be a POI.

The one in your example is probably circular. It just looks elliptical, when viewed from the side. If yo check it now in the orrery map, you will see.
