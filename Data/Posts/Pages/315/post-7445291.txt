What is the exact system you are refering too?

It’s the NGC 7822 Nebula. From Sol it’ll appear like a planetary Nebula does from a jump or two out or like the smaller, dimmer, galaxies in the skybox we see. Almost confused it with lemon slice as I got closer but as it was obvious that it’s appearance was changing, becoming more defined and brighter as I got closer, it was apparent that it was a visitable place. I’m sure it’s been visited a lot a while back by the Rifters and Co, but seems not since the new tools have become available.
If nothing else it’s got a whole lot of interesting systems in it.
