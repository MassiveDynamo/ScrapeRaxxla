I have an idea (although Guru might as well change his name to BadWolf, seems every time I chase a hunch the moment I reach my destination I’m greeted with “first mapped by Guru-951. Ahhhhggghh! Lol.) anywho, there is justifiable debate on what “the mother of galaxies” means. Whether it’s a reference to Cassiopeia, the MW, or the largest of galaxies, or some reference to Hera etc etc I suppose nobody knows. But, if it means the largest, as far as Elites map and Skybox goes I think that title actually belongs to the Andromeda galaxy in actual, physical size. I was on my way to Andromedae System (which Guru beat me to) and what I always thought was some globular
Galaxy turns out to be a tiny little Nebula near the cave and elephant trunk Nebula (I’m sure many of you have been there but it’s new to me). It’s tiny yet very visible even from sol on account of the sheer volume of A,B, and O class stars in it, and a mind boggling number of Black Holes. I also couldn’t help but notice that from Sol this very bright object sits right “above” (the brow) of the Andromeda galaxy. I figure I’ll go in and jump to all the notable stars. They’ve all been visited I’m sure, but I have noticed not many systems this way are mapped, so perhaps our new tools will reveal something. Just figured I’d mention in case anyone else is interested.

Excellent find, great work, anything is plausible.

Do we travel to these locations or do they triangulate some obscurity?
