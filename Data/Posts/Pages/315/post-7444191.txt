In RL you get an elliptical orbit, as soon as there is orbital eccentricity. that's how gravity works.
Stellar forge has used off center circles as an approximation, in stead of the correct orbit shape. I believe this is still the case for all proceduraly generated orbits.

You are right. Even though we have eccentricity as a parameter, it doesn't look like affecting the shape of orbits. I also suspect that only manually added bodies have real eliptic orbits.

Proof:
This is not a 0.11 eccentricity looks like
