Just noticed that Sedna in Sol, has an elliptic orbit. I don't think I have seen that no any planets in ED before. I didn't even know it was supported.
LOLWUT?
Orbital eccentricity has always been a parameter.
Just looking at orrery view & info on one Ammonia World with orbital eccentricity of 0.8382 - that orbit is no circle!
