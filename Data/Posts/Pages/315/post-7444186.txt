In RL you get an elliptical orbit, as soon as there is orbital eccentricity. that's how gravity works.
Stellar forge has used off center circles as an approximation, in stead of the correct orbit shape. I believe this is still the case for all proceduraly generated orbits.
It has always generated the proper ellipse to my knowledge - here is an extreme example I posted back in 2015:

I do wonder that, if Raxxla is indeed a planet, it might have an extreme orbit like this, having been found initially within scanner range (of the time) of a star but then heading way out into deep space. I wonder if a hyperbolic orbit/trajectory could be manually inserted by the devs (they don't seem to be generated by Stellar Forge) - and how such an object might be represented on the system map or whether it would have to be a POI.
