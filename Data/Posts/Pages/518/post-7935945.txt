I know that, but they could change their minds.. Being realistic I assume raaxla is most likely in the bubble. However, it is assumed to be in 1 out of 20,000 systems(is this number correct?), orbiting the 8th moon of an unnamed gas giant(per the codex entry). The interesting part is , how could the gas giant be unnamed? Every body in every system in this game has a name. So maybe the gas giant is hidden in that particular system(out of normal fss view) or what we are looking for is in plain sight and we have been passing it by all along. Well, that is my probably wrong 2 cents.

Orbiting 8th moon is TDW station, NOT Raxxla. You are mixing your codex entry.
Unnamed gas giant - this means, it was not named by the journalist that reported it. It doesn't mean it has no name in game
