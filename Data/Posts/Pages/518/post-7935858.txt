And tied to Yelboc's answer I feel that we might be getting over our heads here. IF Raxxla was added in-game ( as early as hinted ) then I would think that Frontier Developments would not have made it such a puzzle to find. Only difficult. There are a lot of stars out there.
Unless they decided recently to make Raxxla more important then I would hold Occam's Razor to be the way we should be thinking. Similar to the ongoing Salome puzzle that Drew gave us, I'm sure Drew did not sit up nights on end to make it 'that' hard. He's a writer, writers do like things to be found eventually.
So Raxxla, it's out there. Can you find it without the Dark Wheel connections? Probably unless it's permit locked. Can you randomly find it in a 400 billion star system galaxy? Absolutelyblimmencompletelynot.

I know from my own experience how hard it is to make a challenging puzzle. Its a very fine judgment between making it trivially easy and making it utterly impossible. For something that will last a while like this, its all too easy to use some piece of knowledge that isn't common or to make things just a little too convoluted, so that nobody will follow your slender thread to the answer.

I wager that Drew's puzzle is meant to be solvable, but he made it ' a liitle more complex' and thus he lost us all for 2 years.. perhaps he can comment, in a general way.

Its very frustrating when you listen to people trying to solve your puzzle and none of them are getting it..
