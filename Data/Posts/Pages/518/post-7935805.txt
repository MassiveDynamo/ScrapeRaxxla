My take on this is that FDev aren't going to post any more random fluff pieces - like the Gan Romero storyline.
My hope on this is that FDev are going to focus on actual ingame playable stuff and go on with that GR storyline, (despite that GAN = generate data from scratch - thing...)
Optimistic much ?

And tied to Yelboc's answer ..snip..
When the game was released, FD made part of the Raxxla Quest a tiny little bit obvious so people know what they are doing. And many players did.
But, alas, it seems that this FDev statement has to be retconned...
