A logical argument said:
As far, as the galnet thing we will have to see if it turns out well. Or if it turns more akin to the april update. As far as raaxla goes, if its supposed to be in game don't ya think we we would've found it by now. This thread has 500+ pages of discussions and is 4 years old. A clue or something would be nice.

"There will be no clues"

FDev have previously talked about developing ED for 10 years, so I don't think there were in any rush for us to find Raxxla. They could easily have set the trigger requirements to be something that would require hundreds or thousands of hours of gametime for someone to achieve.
