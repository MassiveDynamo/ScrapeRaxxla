And tied to Yelboc's answer I feel that we might be getting over our heads here. IF Raxxla was added in-game ( as early as hinted ) then I would think that Frontier Developments would not have made it such a puzzle to find. Only difficult. There are a lot of stars out there.
Unless they decided recently to make Raxxla more important then I would hold Occam's Razor to be the way we should be thinking. Similar to the ongoing Salome puzzle that Drew gave us, I'm sure Drew did not sit up nights on end to make it 'that' hard. He's a writer, writers do like things to be found eventually.
So Raxxla, it's out there. Can you find it without the Dark Wheel connections? Probably unless it's permit locked. Can you randomly find it in a 400 billion star system galaxy? Absolutelyblimmencompletelynot.
