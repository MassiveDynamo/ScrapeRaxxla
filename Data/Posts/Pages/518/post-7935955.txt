Eight moons are rather rare ( unless you count twin moons. ). I am intrigued why this would be in the Codex, to be honest. I doubt the DW would be so lax in their security especially as stories tell that you do not find them, they find you. If some chap in a sidewinder on a lazy drunken hop to hop system trip finds the Dark Wheel station by accident then all of the credentials go out of the window. And Raxxla... then that might well just be a moon named after a particular three-breasted hooker that went into hiding.
