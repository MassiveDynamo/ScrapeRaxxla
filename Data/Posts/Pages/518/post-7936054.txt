Jaques station was found by accident.

True - because FDev were stupid and forgot to hide the population from the Galaxy Map filter.

However, FDev also WANTED us to find it, which is where there were coded nonograms hidden in the local Galnet news of a number of systems in the Bubble. This is how we were supposed to figure out where Jaques was - it's just that nobody (except me and @MadDogMurdock) ever looked at the local Galnets, so the mystery was spoiled.
