Well, in Horizons: sold the Trinkets I got in the Seagull Sector, went to Orrere & got some more. Dropped one into space, moved the ship away and went back to it with the camera drone. No sounds were detectable with standard audio capture settings- â€œNight Time" mode selected & music disabled. Repeated twice, same result both times

Edit:
Quite a few comets detectable in Orrere, no Omphalos found!
