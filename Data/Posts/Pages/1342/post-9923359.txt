Seems like Fortuna is the most used name in space especially in Elite Dangerous, FD use it as a way to throw off the pilots to make the search difficult.

For instance Pars Fortuna is a mathematical point in the zodiac derived by the longitudinal positions of the Sun, Moon and Ascendant (Rising sign) in the birth chart of an individual.

To add to it we got an Asteroid in our system called 19 Fortuna that is within the main belt and is one of the largest asteroids in that belt. Which is 225 km in diameter.

It was first seen in 1852 by J R Hinds, and observed in 1993 by the Hubble Space Telescope.

It's symbol is a Star over a Wheel.



It's speed is 18.94 km/s and has a 3.81 day orbital rotation.
