Yes, a manifest scanner will tell you what cargo the target is carrying. On my Phantom I now have a manifest scanner and a combination limpet controller so I can hatchbreak, refuel or repair, depending on my mood

I hadnt thought if hanging around an anarchy station mailbox; Ive only tried nav beacons, where Trinkets have been a bit thin on the ground.

Note: if you’re carrying trinkets and get scanned by local police you’ll get a large fine for carrying illicit goods! They are illicit everywhere, but I cant figure out a lore reason for this!
Yesterday I got interdicted by a pirate, had a fight, police showed up, I killed him and got a 4,500Cr fine fir the Trinkets and downgraded from Allied to Friendly; but got a 200,000Cr bounty on him...
