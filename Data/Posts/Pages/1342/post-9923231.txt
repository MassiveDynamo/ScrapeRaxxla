Mmm, that is one of the old Elite/Founder missions that were given out at Shinrarta/Jameson Memorial. Long deleted from game, just about the same time I started playing so never got the chance to try one...See Macros’ summary on the first page of this thread! Interesting it’s in HIP 118321 though and not Shinrarta
@Rochester @Han_Zen @Macros Black -any comments/thoughts gentlemen?

Apparently they led nowhere and were dropped (or replaced by something else yet to be discovered?) in the mission system changes in late Dec2015/early2016. They did seem to be aimed at the Raxxla myth, and seemed to be handed out by Pilot’s Federation working against TDW faction in Shinrarta. Make of that what you will!

Edit: Fernweh is a German term, so perhaps not unsurprisingly used as a Cmdr name by a German player; doesn’t seem to be a hint etc to me. Could have been seen and triggered a thought in FD’s collective consciousness ( I think they’re governed by a Guardian AI! ) for later use in the Codex.

Might be worth checking out that system though...I’m really surprised it appeared anywhere other than Shinrarta.

Edit2: and it’s also on Reddit, with no pictorial evidence that the claim is genuine...Reddit is notorious for trolling!

The mission 'Obfuscated In The Outer Rim' was given in many systems.
@AndyJ gave a good recount of the story of the missing missions.
