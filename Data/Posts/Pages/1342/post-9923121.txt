Historians Eratosthenes and Hyginus associated the constellation Virgo with Tyche (Fortuna), ‘eyes to see’?

John Milton describes Astraea (Urania) as Virgo in Paradise Lost. Milton also invokes Urania as a muse, and he himself was a musician who was an exponent of the ‘silent song’… Urania being one of the outermost spheres of the silent song?

John Milton was blind - eyes again?

Virgo was attributed likewise to Princesse (Queen) Elizabeth I as Astraea (Urania)?

Virgo was also seen as the spring goddess Persephone. Kore, Kira or Cora as well as Demeter (drunk / pirates)?

And Virgo contains the ‘Realm of the Galaxies’ which contains several thousand galaxies!

Is Virgo the mother (Demeter) of galaxies?

Could be the mother of galaxies, but what then are the Jewel, Whisperer and Siren?
