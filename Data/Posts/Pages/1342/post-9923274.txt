If the noises die down after a period of time or.. x jumps.. should be determined as well as if the artifact switches hands does this cause them to 'reboot'?

On another note, I'm going to head to the Zurara this weekend but would love to have a trinket prior to the trip - for science of course. So I'll look at hittimg a anarchy nav beacon. Any specific targets I should aim for or just kill everyone?
Its anarchy so there is no law. Take a manifest scanner and find the ones with trinkets. Hatchbreaker and a good collector helps to. Once you spill there trinket not only will they try and scoop them up but so will everyone around you. So best to pick on an npc on their own not in a wing at the edge of the grouping. Otherwise, open season.
I often end up scooping them by hand - the krait is the perfect pirate ship in this regard - cargo scoop is much easier than most ships.
