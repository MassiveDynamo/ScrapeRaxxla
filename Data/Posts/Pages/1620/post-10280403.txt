The effort that Michael Brookes has put into crafting so many systems and locations in a systematic manner is, as has been said on this thread, a work of art and an Easter Egg in its own right, regardless of whether Raxxla is found. It deserves wider recognition, so that other players, who might otherwise only note a few interesting names in passing, can understand why that happens, the importance of it and the dedication that was required to create it.

As someone who plays Elite not only for the 1:1 scale simulation of Milky Way and the stories and legends contained within but who also races spaceships for fun with the Buckyball Racing Club, I decided to pay my own small tribute to Michael Brookes, the effort he put into the game and the authors who inspired him. So I am staging a Buckyball Racing Club event over the holidays (23rd - 31st Dec), called Obfuscated in the Outer Rim and the race thread is now up here:

I do hope you will stop by, have a read and say hello, even if racing is not for you. It could be an interesting journey!
