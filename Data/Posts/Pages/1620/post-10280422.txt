I was watching an interesting video-essay on the development of Elite recently, it focused a lot on the technical innovations and coding that went into it (most of which I wasn't previously aware of). At one point they talked about the procedural generation seed:

I wondered briefly if that number was coordinates in the Elite Dangerous galaxy, there's no system at those coordinates, sadly, but... maybe there's a hidden system there? It would be quite beautifully poetic in many ways. EDIT: Those coordinates take you to almost the exact opposite side of the galaxy from Sol btw, basically 47000ly away.
I am actually about half way between Colonia and Beagle Point right now...
if you can supply a system name, or a group of systems, that is at those coordinates, I would be more than happy to go there after Beagle point, and FSS any systems of interest and report back... (I've played my last 100hrs on Steam Deck, so galmap coordinates are hard to see and find, but systems I can search for)

I'm planning to get to Beagle Point by the end of this weekend (if not today/tomorrow), so I could head to this area next week easily...

Edit: I'm exactly 300 jumps away from Beagle Point now. And I forgot I'm kinda busy this weekend, but I'll definitely be there by mid week, and then can start headed out anywhere anyone suggests
