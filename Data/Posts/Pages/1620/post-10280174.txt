I've been looking a bit more into the idea that there could be hidden systems. I have no idea where they are, so I made one up.

My hidden system is at the coordinates 85, 20, 55. These are the simplest coordinates I get fro the word Raxxla. It's just the Roman numerical values for RA, XX, LA, using standard form and medieval Roman numerals. This gives:

R=80
A=5
X=10
L=50

RA= 85
XX=20
LA=55

This point isn't to far from Shinrarta Dezhra at 55.71875, 17.59375, 27.15625, so I wanted to have SD as either start or end system for the jump. The best target system I have found so far, is Nariya at 105.40625, 22.0625, 75.09375. A jump from SD to Nariya passes 0.3590892392606653 ly from 85, 20, 55.

I've tried a few locations to jump from in both systems. Raxxla has not revealed it self. I might try to supercruise to to the perfect jump of coordinates to pass exactly att 85, 20 55, but that is a long journey to 56.23892876, 17.09306171, 26.67937395 (0.8652661285187726 ly).

Fun testing though. Even if the jump is a bit long at 69 ly and I need a basic FDS boost to do it.
