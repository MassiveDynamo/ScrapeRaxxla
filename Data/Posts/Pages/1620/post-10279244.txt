Interesting findings Louis Calvert!

I think there is one thing to be wary of here and that is the fact that, for hand-crafted systems, they are not being procedurally generated - instead it is my understanding that the information has to be pulled out of a database. That would mean that increased loading times are a sign that you are jumping to a hand-crafted system. I am not sure if the number of bodies in the system influences the loading time, or to what extent - Jackson's Lighthouse has few bodies but an increased loading time, for example. (I remember Maia, a system with many bodies, has always had a long loading time - raced through there several times! Why HR 1185 should have the same loading time, I don't know).

This does not mean that loading times are to be dismissed! It could still be a clue - especially if the visuals are different jumping into those systems.

I'm going to be spending some time around the Lost Realms this month but am struggling to manage my time this week. I can think of some other people who may be doing the same, so I'll make discreet enquiries as to any oddities in the hyperspace tunnel or loading times.

Reminiscent of the loading time method for finding the Formidine Rift bases...it worked for hard discs but not for SSDs. I used to use the data transfer monitoring mode as a more reliable method (CTRL+B, though so long ago I may have that wrong).

I remember a bug that often caused the hyperspace transition to be extended, sometimes to the point where the PC had to be reset...seem to remember it was related to poor internet commsfailing to find peers to connect with....never understood why that should affect it!
