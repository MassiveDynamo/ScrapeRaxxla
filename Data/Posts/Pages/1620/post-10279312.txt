I like the runic analysis...if "Raxxla" can be translated as "Riddle" then perhaps we have a major clue as to finding it. I've long thought the heart of the codex entry to be the paragraph "Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed. These details, however, were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to the children's story Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars, and soon lost credibility. Undaunted, some Raxxla seekers insisted that the story's author had cunningly concealed facts about the mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to see"...it just sounds so obviously like a riddle that needs to be solved! MB also highlighted that childrens' story in his book Legacy "As a girl Julia grew up without toys with a single possession, a book “about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon"
Looks like I'm doing some reading tonight , lo and behold I discovered I have the Legacy novel in my files, I'm guessing from the kickstarter reward or some other bonus.
