Hey Drew, I’ve a question for you. I started cataloging the HIP systems some time ago and came across one early on that bothered me as I could see no way to get to it: HIP 53. I can’t find any in-game info on the system having been visited or any mention of it as a “dev” system, but I’m curious if anyone else has actually managed to get there.

Edited to correct autocorrect.

6,000 LY below the galactic plane. Yeah, that's unreachable.
And it looks like it's misplaced. Simbad gives it the ID CD-29 18916. There's a bunch of CD-29 xxxxx stars in a cluster about 900 LY down, almost directly below Sol, so it belongs with them in Blanco 1 sector
