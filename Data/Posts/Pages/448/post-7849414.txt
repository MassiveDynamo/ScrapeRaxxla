I'll take a look tonight when I get online.

There have been a few HIP and HD systems (though possibly with other main names) that I've looked for but not been able to reach - usually because they're wildly out of position in ED. Beta Pheonicis is my go-to example of that, at something ridiculous like 13 kLy below the galactic plane, when it should be within a couple of hundred LY of Sol.
If FDev had actually given us a reasonable amount of bookmarks I'd probably still know where they are
One of the best mini-games in the game - getting a bookmark on the aforementioned system!
