6,000 LY below the galactic plane. Yeah, that's unreachable.
And it looks like it's misplaced. Simbad gives it the ID CD-29 18916. There's a bunch of CD-29 xxxxx stars in a cluster about 900 LY down, almost directly below Sol, so it belongs with them in Blanco 1 sector

Thanks! I probably should have checked to see if it was misplaced before. I wonder why some of them are so far off like that...
