Err... Sorry, guys, but did I miss something about Raxxla related to HIP/HD systems, please ?

Not that I know of - it's just my own personal quest.
Sometimes I like to pretend to justify it by arguing that the first stars that humans visited would have been the bright ones we could see from Earth, at that by extension that's where whoever found Raxxla was more likely to have been travelling - but mostly that's just garbage

Edit:
Also, it meets the criterion of being a 'journey' quite nicely
