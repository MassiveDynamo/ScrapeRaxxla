Probably a little bit more than a legend ... there are elements from The Dark Wheel that have been confirmed as canon. It may be good exercise to identify what those elements are. Some examples:

- The existence of The Dark Wheel as an organization: Confirmed in And Here the Wheel, the existence of a faction by that name in Shinrata Dezhra, Premonition and the Codex.
- The legend of The Dark Wheel being connected to one Jason Ryder: Confirmed in And Here the Wheel.
- The existence of Oresrians: Confirmed in Frontier: First Encounters

I think that there is enough to suggest that the basic story line of The Dark Wheel is valid but that specific details may not be.
