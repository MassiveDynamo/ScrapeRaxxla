Mmmkay... In this line of thought, I still think Raxxla was found in the early days of Tau Ceti and Co. (Codex and timeline)
But maybe it would be too... consistent for this story line...

Edit: imho, the point is/was a personal journey. Only personal things in ED are rep, rank and permits. But just imho, hey ?

Everything we do is personal to some extent.
The Engineers shows that FDev are tracking our activities beyond just 'rep, rank and permits' so I see no reason why they couldn't be using some kind of metric that isn't visible to the players as a mechanism for 'unlocking' Raxxla. We know it's not simply rank, or Dark Wheel rep and it makes sense to me that it would be something obscure that a player isn't going to stumble across too easily. I'm not saying that HIP/HD stars are it, but they COULD be, and it gives me a nice long-term goal to aim for while I wait for CoR to figure it out
