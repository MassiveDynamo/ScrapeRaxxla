The Dark Wheel and probably also Imprint are not canon in the way that they accurately describe events that really happened, but they are considered to be stories that are known in the ED galaxy. MB explained that TDW should be considered an ingame legend.
Probably a little bit more than a legend ... there are elements from The Dark Wheel that have been confirmed as canon. It may be good exercise to identify what those elements are. Some examples:

- The existence of The Dark Wheel as an organization: Confirmed in And Here the Wheel, the existence of a faction by that name in Shinrata Dezhra, Premonition and the Codex.
- The legend of The Dark Wheel being connected to one Jason Ryder: Confirmed in And Here the Wheel.
- The existence of Oresrians: Confirmed in Frontier: First Encounters
- The existence of one Trader Elyssia Fields: Unconfirmed but highly suggested in Premonition and the Teorge listening posts.
- Raxxla: Confirmed in And Here the Wheel, Elite: Legacy and the Codex
- Tionisla Orbital Graveyard: Confirmed in And Here the Wheel and Premonition (Galnet?).
- Thrumpberry Juice: Confirmed in Premonition (where can I get some?)

I think that there is enough to suggest that the basic story line of The Dark Wheel is valid but that specific details may not be.
