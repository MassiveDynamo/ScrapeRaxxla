As the fellow who re-introduced the topic of hyperspace spinning into this forum. I just want to clarify a few things:

(1) I notice a pronounced spin towards the end of jumps in and around the Horse Head Nebula;
(2) this does not occur anywhere else;
(3) I’ve noticed this phenomenon on two separate occasions months apart;
(4) both times, I was playing in solo mode with a wired high speed internet connection.

That said, I’m not convinced there is anything significant about this. Others have tried to re-create the spin I was seeing and were unable. Also, some folks have viewed my footage and said the spin looks totally normal to them. I’ve not seen that kind of spin elsewhere but who knows.

TLDR: hyperspace spin probably doesn’t equal “spiraling stars” hint.

I play Elite Dangerous on Linux via Proton. When I first started playing on Linux, after a few hundred jumps, I'd get stuck in an infinitely spinning hyperspace screen. I eventually located the config file on my system (I don't remember which file or parameter just that it was a system config file in /etc) that let me fix it. Its one of the reasons that I'm fairly certain that the spin is just a natural part of the FSD load screen and that whether or not you see it is entirely dependent upon how long it takes the game to load the next system.
