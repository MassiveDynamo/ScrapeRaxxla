Mmmkay... In this line of thought, I still think Raxxla was found in the early days of Tau Ceti and Co. (Codex and timeline)
But maybe it would be too... consistent for this story line...

Edit: imho, the point is/was a personal journey. Only personal things in ED are rep, rank and permits. But just imho, hey ?
