I doubt there are any tests in the game to become a member of the EFP. This was idea was probably scraped at some point. The founders permit is the defacto membership certificate for that bunch. Being a founder is the shortcut to membership.

I agree that The Dark Wheel is a separate group to the EFP. To me it seem unlikely that there are any active in-game criteria that triggers contact from TDW either.
The way the Codex is written it would seem they do contact a few of the best, but there is no evidence or even hints of this ever happening. If brave and competent is what they look for, one would think that at least some would qualify by now. Unless finding their station is part of the competence requirement.

Raxxla is another story. TDW does not know where it is, so we can't expect more than a few hints from them.

I think it’s likely you have to gain alliance, and maybe influence, for the faction by a series of test missions & at some stage if you pass they’ll reveal themselves as TRDW. I hypothesise that is the start of a permit chase to get to the station & maybe some clues as to Raxxla’s identity & location.
