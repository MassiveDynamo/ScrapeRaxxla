Installation probably a bug, friend in Colonia has one on their Nav Panel with no name but can still be targeted and flown to, just says unauthorised when you get there iirc, no name of it at all anywhere, so put it down to bugs.

Would make sense lorewise, but I think it’s not combat necessarily, more likely Exploration since they’re a set of “adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters”

Sounds a lot like the Engineers huh? Been thinking for a while that they are the DW. Felicity refers to DW in Codex as being real (only one who actually does rather than say theyre a myth), names like Turner & Jameson imply certain heritage and Ryder is a direct link. Quite a few have to go through nefarious contacts to access, the others require a test of 'skill' in various roles - combat, trade, smuggling, explo. Cant quite make their bases into a wheel on the GalMap though....
