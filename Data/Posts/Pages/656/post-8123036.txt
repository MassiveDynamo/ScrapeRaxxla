Was Salome ranked Elite btw? I got the impression she wasn't but may have been let in because of her exposure of the whole Exodus saga, otherwise it kinda falls down flat there in terms of lore consistency but that's nothing new so not that worried. Do you have to be Elite to join DW these days? Back in 1984 Dark Wheel story said yes or at least Alex father said start there, but nowadays Im not sure that's still lore.

That video basically says that the EFP allows lesser ranked pilots in to do the lower rank needed missions and because they 'recognise' that the pilot is elite, they just haven't played long enough (made enough kills) to actually get the rank yet, so it allows us to be in the EFP from Day 1 at Harmless and do their missions. Its more for gameplay than story I think. (That Royal Navy analogy confused me, if English isn't your 1st language it may have completely confused what he was saying, or at least what I think he was saying, I may be more confused than I currently know) Rank is not based on skill it is based on a 'kill counter' and the EFP know and recognise this.

I have a horrible feeling the whole DW saga will be part of an update or CG (shudders at the thought) and open to everyone at the same time. I hope not. So we all have to promise not to spoil it for each other, if we get invited, we wont tell anyone else here how its done or even that we got the invite.

Made me laugh that DB never got to Elite in 1984. not just me then I got to Deadly 3 times and Dangerous a few more but always reset the game as all the challenge had gone by that point.
