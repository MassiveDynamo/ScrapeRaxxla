I'm assuming this is nothing new. But do the new surface deposits usually look this thargoid. I usually only do fissures. And not usually up close. I was exploreing and looking in asteroids because of the other thread. Couldn't remember if this is a normal look and can't find any good pics online.

I could actually see this from a pretty good distance away. As in multiple asteroids away. Not what I normally think of as a normal asteroid deposit.
