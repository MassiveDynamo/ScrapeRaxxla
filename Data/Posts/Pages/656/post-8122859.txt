Interesting, hadn’t come across that vid before. Wonder how many more like that there are out there? I’ve watched all the dev diaries etc from the FD youtube website but not come across a hint of this vid.

He was talking of a test for the Elite Federation of Pilots from a combat focus, so it may well be there is a test which Combateers can be offered to join EPF, but I don’t think that is the Real Dark Wheel for the Raxxla Quest. From the Codex TRDW are a “legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters” rather than combateers, so I think their test will be offered to explorer-traders. I’m still working on building a relationship with a likely candidate (iaw my current hypothesis); think I may have failed the test first time around by taking a mission from another faction so I restarted, but haven’t been offered the Cr40M donation mission again-couldn’t accept it first time as I wasn’t Elite trader then. But the test may be buggy since there was one Cr1M donation mission I had the rank and funds for but couldn’t accept, also there were a couple of missions to retrieve items which were bugged as there were two instances of each when I landed at the planetary search zones.
I’m working on this hypothesis as my Tyko clone, but wondering if I have to bring Jorki back from Colonia to restart. Perhaps you only get one chance.......

Those missions were a placeholder to prevent mission screen freezes once you got to the bottom of the list. They took them out when they fixed it. Everyone had those for a day or two.
