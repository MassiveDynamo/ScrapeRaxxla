Yes, think there’s one at one of the moons in Shin Dez. It’s an installation that you can’t land at, like the orbital farms etc that crop up in various systems.
Yeah, I'd noticed a bunch of new agriculturally flavoured installations seem to have popped up near the primary stars in multiple systems, roughly coinciding with the blight II/CG. Hadn't noticed them prior...
