If youâ€™re talking about the 40mil missions from September, they were something that FDev put in to stop the mission board locking up for people that scrolled to the bottom of the list and were not acceptable for anyone.
Ah thanks. I did enquire here if anybody had come across such high donation missions but nobody responded. Mmm, another part of the hypothesis knocked down...
