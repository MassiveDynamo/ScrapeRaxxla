A lot of things, recently found a new signal from the center of the galaxy; here guys solve riddles with Raxxla and the Dark Wheel. The guys from the sectors with aliens are waiting for the developer to open the admission to the closed system; finding abandoned old points of interest. One group return from a long expedition. And in the bubble, we are still losing the war with the Thargoids.
I'm interested in the bold part, but more in the "solution" and where people are actually looking for Raaxla / The Dark Wheel. I'm assuming at least a few folks in this thread go out in their spaceships and "look around". I found a place of interest, and while it's still an interesting oddity (likely due to a bug in the BGS), I no longer think Raxxla is there.
