forget about the the dark wheel, its mystery is solved (for all player, who have any Elite rank). We are interested in Raxxla and other things

Solved?!

That i know the station is still unaccount for... And that is linked to the raxxla problem.

Ad that is another thing that makes me wonder... And if that station is not an abandoned station as some believe but actually one of the missing generation ships that currently sits off the 8th moon of a gas giant in some system close or around the bubble that hasnt been yet discovered and in it we will find the next big clue to were to go to find raxxla?

I in one hand am almost betting that raxxla, the thing we are looking for is some sort of guardian structure.
