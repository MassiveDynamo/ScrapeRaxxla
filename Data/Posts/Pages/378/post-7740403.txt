I'm interested in the bold part, but more in the "solution" and where people are actually looking for Raaxla / The Dark Wheel. I'm assuming at least a few folks in this thread go out in their spaceships and "look around". I found a place of interest, and while it's still an interesting oddity (likely due to a bug in the BGS), I no longer think Raxxla is there.

It exists, but we do not know what it is ... hence the misunderstanding and lack of mativization. We have nothing to catch. so we continue to explore everything in and around the habitable bubble
