So where is everybody actually looking these days. I'm talking systems or even galactic sectors / regions, not stanzas in poetry.

A lot of things, recently found a new signal from the center of the galaxy; here guys solve riddles with Raxxla and the Dark Wheel. The guys from the sectors with aliens are waiting for the developer to open the admission to the closed system; finding abandoned old points of interest. One group return from a long expedition. And in the bubble, we are still losing the war with the Thargoids.
