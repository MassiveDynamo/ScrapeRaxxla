So where is everybody actually looking these days. I'm talking systems or even galactic sectors / regions, not stanzas in poetry.
I'm looking in the Smootoae Sector, but I dont expect to find much other than the rest of the DW2 fleet.

Although, I share your sentiment. This thread has gone a bit wonky with all the mythology and theory crafting. I get it, but it just seems so far from the hunt.
