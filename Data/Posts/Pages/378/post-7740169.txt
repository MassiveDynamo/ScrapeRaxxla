Interesting find.

Which gen-ship? Just one container, or many of them, and how many gen-ships?
Did you check Canonn / image searches in case they've been 'found' already?

Lazarus Expedition. 8 containers. There is no big opening here yet to broadcast to Canonn, but the logo is very similar to the Raxxla logo at the center.

"Transport company Raxxla, if our container with our equipment is present on your ship - you will not return back" (Reminds company Vault Tech with their experiments )
