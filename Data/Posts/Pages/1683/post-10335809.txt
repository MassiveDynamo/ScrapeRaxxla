Yes, this cropped up a while ago when we were discussing triple goddess (e.g. Luna/Selene/ Hecate, the moon being tied to witchcraft).

Going back to the garden design, I'm currently thinking RHS suggests:
1) star, 6 planets (fifth may be ringed)
2) star, four planets of which third has a ring (or two) and a moon.
Ah, Spansh system search has a body count parameter...for option (1) there are10,000 systems with body count=7 within 600 ly of Sol; 832 within 60 ly
