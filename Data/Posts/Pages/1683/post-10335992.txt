Howâ€™s that work exactly?

How many systems with 4 or 5 bodies?
Open Spansh system search, set desired distance (60), set reference system (Sol), set body count (4, so 3 planets/moons since star counts as 1), click search...result 692

Count=5...723
Count=6...761
Simples! (Wot, no meerkat emoji??)

4 bodies within/touching the middle part of the garden design, plus two on the right hand side....is the RHS an expansion of the larger body within the middle? ...if so then 5+star=6 total, if not then 6+star=7 total.

I ain't going to attempt that large a search (I've been on this quest for 8 years now, I'm all fernwehed out!
) ...Great potato hunt should already have covered those systems. We are unlikely to find Raxxla without having some idea of what we're looking for since it's clearly obfuscated (what does an Omphalos Rift look like? can you even see it? Do you have to fly through it to detect it?)

I'm assuming Raxxla =Paradise and MB would have located it in Heaven (FD server) only accessible (instanced) by finding and travelling the golden staircase (Omphalos Rift). So we need to find Heavens Gate!
