One can never have too much tin-foil!....unless you're a Christmas turkey!

I was thinking of the Raxxla logo when I took the pic of L Qing Jao's docking lights, and because I hadn't noticed before how different it is from other stations. No, I don't think it's Raxxla; I suspect the Raxxla logo is actually for a dodecahedral station (maybe TDW's) which may or may not be named Raxxla....just a thought!
