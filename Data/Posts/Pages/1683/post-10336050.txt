According to some reference Ive browsed this afternoon after the expulsion of Adam & Eve God moved Paradise from Earth to Heaven...
Just taken two more pix inside Li Qing Jao station, the docking light and the statue- might this represent Adam & Eve reaching for the Forbidden Fruit on the Tree of Knowledge?

Lets assume you are right. Earth / Sol is the jewel.

Once upon a time, some aliens (God) came to earth. They found an ape species (humans) with potential, did som modifications on them and gave them some education. They also left their construct (tree of knowledge) on earth, for easy access.
Some other rebellious alien (Satan) manages get to earth and promptly persuades the humans to use the forbidden construct, to gain knowledge and power.
The God aliens quickly finds out about this and relocates the construct to Raxxla in space, leaving the humans without the benefits of the construct.
The humans are back to living of the earth. They now have a lot of info without context. The stories turns into religions and mythology.
The gods continue to visit earth on an on and of basis, for a few thousand years. Then they give up.

It could work. Just insert you favoritt ED aliens as God and Satan.

If the point of relocating the construct was to stop humans from interacting, they didn't have to move it far. Raxxla might be closer than we think?
