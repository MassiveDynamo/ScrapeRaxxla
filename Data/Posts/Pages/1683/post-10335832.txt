Ah, Spansh system search has a body count parameter...for option (1) there are10,000 systems with body count=7 within 600 ly of Sol; 832 within 60 ly
How’s that work exactly, what’s the steps?

I’d like to know why you chose systems with 7 bodies? How many are there with just 4 or 5, from the garden pictured it looks potentially like 4 or 5 bodies?
