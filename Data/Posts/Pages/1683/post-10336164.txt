Jorki's screenshots gave me an idea for one of the other gardens:

If I was reading the literature correctly, as a result of the Fall of Man, the Earth's axis was tilted
Some say, he bid his angels turn askance
The poles of Earth twice ten degrees or more
From the sun's axle; they with labour push'd
Oblique the centric globe: some say, the Sun
Was bid turn reins from th' equinoctial road..
I had noticed some gardens have inner circles with paths that don't align to the main 'axial' paths:

Furthermore, if we presume this represents Earth, then the centre of the circle from this angle does resemble a mountain - like the great mountains of mythology that represent the home of the gods / access to the heavens.
This particular garden also has the 10 lights.
Stretching the symbolism even further the two homes could depict Adam and Eve, and the red tower being Satan / the Serpent??
