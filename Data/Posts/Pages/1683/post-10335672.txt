Just something that i noticed in another Game.
There is something in the german localisation "Moiren" that is in the Englich localisation "wisperer" and its a reference to the Triple deity.
And after finding this on Wikipedia:
In the Old Norse Völuspá and Gylfaginning, the Norns are three cosmic goddesses of fate who are described sitting by the well of Urðr at the foot of the world tree Yggdrasil.
I haven't followed the Yggdrasil theorie much but i am aware of it.
So maybe the Wisperer in Witchspace is also a reference to the Triple deity.
