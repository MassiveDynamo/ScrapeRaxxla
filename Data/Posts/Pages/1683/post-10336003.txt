Happy I cpould help



Yeah, I'm no botanist, that works better!



At the time I said 'sometimes a bench is just a bench', that was only my best duess at what they where



Yeah, I keep meaning to go through it all - so many stuffs, so little minutes!



Could be they confused more than helped - I think the Codex Entries are probably 'bare minimum content' to raise awareness/create interest/give a starting point.



One can never have too much tin-foil!



Again, just happy to be throwing idea's around.



Yeah, I often take screenies of my ships inside the docking bays, and there are so many cool touches in them.



Looking forward to it myself, probably be a while before I get to it, though.



Isn't it all hyperbole, until someone finds something?



Now I'm wondering howe that SRV got into the docking bay, and if you tried it with Odyssey now, could you disembark from the SRV and 'swim' around the docking bay?

Good way to end up plastered over the nose of an Orca, but still!





I really like this observation/idea!

I don't think it would matter too much where the Statues occur in the bay - they will always be reaching towards the centerline of the bay, and from the entrance, look like they're reaching for the lights I keep crashing in too.

The only other observation I have to offer on that front is if the 'Symbol' at the end of the docking bay represents lost paradise, and Raxxla is analogous for our purposes, then that makes something 'true' that I have always wanted to be so...

Context is king, if you look at the context I was replying to Jorki asking what the cartoon was in the previous post, it's from an artist called 'Hyperbole and a half'...

Irony right there.

The answer is almost alwsys much more simple and straightforward than you think.
