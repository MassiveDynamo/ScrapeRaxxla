Brilliant, I never would have made that particular jump regarding those statues and yes God relocated Eden after the fall. Eden was always to be the ‘new heaven’. Paradise was always extended to be an earthly pastoral paradise in Milton’s version.

Really hope all this is actually what this all means. This sounds totally genius.

The tourism station I was in last night, I can confirm those statues were not directly under the spire in my instance, but still there is no reason why they can’t be, except those statues are wearing Remlok suits.
I've been called smart, I've been called a smart-r se, but never been called a genius!

There seems to be two possible hypotheses here. Either the whole garden is just a pointer to Milton's cosmology, and we'll have to rely on your explorations (mythological and galactic) to lead the solution search, or only the first part of the garden is the Milton cosmology reference and the rest of the garden is a hint to the solution.

I suspect the former is the case, else why would MB spend all that effort setting up the Milton cosmology in-game. However the second hypothesis might provide a quick set of system possibilities to be tested... I'll try to come up with some thoughts.
