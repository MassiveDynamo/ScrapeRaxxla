Brilliant will give that a go, and compare it with my maps, it might highlight something, didn’t know it could do that.

Given the potential search area it’s highly likely a Cmdr will have mapped it already, although its possible no one has too, but that’s not to say it’s not there.

Given the description in the map - if accurate then it’s drilling down into the system arrangement and advocating we look at or scrutinise a particular celestial body.

I think this might outline that Raxxla might not appear in the scanner and we need to get up close the body it’s around/on/is?

I’m hoping the colourisation of the map and numerical markings; such as the potential presence of rings, or number of Cedars - is integral. If that’s the case the system ought to be instantly recognisable to those familiar with that image?!
