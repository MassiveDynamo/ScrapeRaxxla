Nice to see all the fun with the Garden Axis

The connection to the Milton Diagram by Sprague is great. It makes alot of sense with MBs love for Milton. I like to think that the left symbol in the Garden Axis was related to the Thargoid Symbol in that they were both symbolizing the Orion Nebula complex. If that is the case - we now have a map…. Hmmm where to search first …. Heaven or hell

Ya i do think that the other spheres are designating planets/moons possibly giving us a system description.

So do u think this is a path to the Dark Wheel Station?

So, how to search for that system? IIRC Spansh doesn't do logical AND operations in the searches.....Anybody skilled in EDSM queries?
