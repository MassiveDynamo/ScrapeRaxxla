Just something that i noticed in another Game.
There is something in the german localisation "Moiren" that is in the Englich localisation "wisperer" and its a reference to the Triple deity.
And after finding this on Wikipedia:

I haven't followed the Yggdrasil theorie much but i am aware of it.
So maybe the Wisperer in Witchspace is also a reference to the Triple deity.
Yes, this cropped up a while ago when we were discussing triple goddess (e.g. Luna/Selene/ Hecate, the moon being tied to witchcraft).

Going back to the garden design, I'm currently thinking RHS suggests:
1) star, 6 planets (fifth may be ringed)
2) star, four planets of which third has a ring (or two) and a moon.
