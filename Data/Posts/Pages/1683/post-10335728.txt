Just something that i noticed in another Game.
There is something in the german localisation "Moiren" that is in the Englich localisation "wisperer" and its a reference to the Triple deity.
And after finding this on Wikipedia:

I haven't followed the Yggdrasil theorie much but i am aware of it.
So maybe the Wisperer in Witchspace is also a reference to the Triple deity.

Yes the Moiren or Moirai in game, I’ve mapped previously as part of various alignments. It’s an interestingly located system.

Technically in comparison to my ‘Mountains’ hypothesis it sits slap in the middle of that construct.

In relation to my maps of the systems named after the Norns and Greek Fates it’s too far below; however, its Y coordinate does align with the Greek Fates midpoint!

Ironically there is a system at that relative location called LHS 2037.

One thing I’ve always been wary of is the knowledge that ED is broken, so it’s highly likely some systems are just wrongly placed or the design that implemented them broken.

For such a complex ‘hand crafted’ construct for which we’re describing / uncovering there are in my opinion, just too many variables not to rule out the possibility.

We will never know if it’s intentional or an error, such a possibility could be another reason the PF/DW missions were removed, it simply didn’t work and would had taken too much time to fix, hence the codex, which I’ve always presumed is a retro-fix.
