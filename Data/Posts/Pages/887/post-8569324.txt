I picked up an original copy of the dark wheel novel and Alien World: Complete Illustrated Guide by Steven Eisler that my kid is reading looking for clues. I am stuck believing that LFT 509 is the answer but it is just getting the permit. I am thinking that it has to be a permit chain that has to be completed.
