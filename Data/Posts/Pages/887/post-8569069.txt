Nice idea and I've almost done this, except for the CQC permit and the thargoid bobblehead. No chance of my getting the former, as I've played enough CQC to know I'd rather not play it again, it was my worst experience in ED, partly being farmed by better players (boom, respawn, boom, respawn etc.) and partly that it made my hands shake. The bobblehead was added recently, so I hope it's not vital. I could be wrong... . There is an implication of getting a mission from the Codex text but all the missions people have done for all the factions, all the tip-offs etc. as well and no one has got anything? I wonder how many people meet the above conditions...

Im allied with most if not all the big factions in the bubble, most of the small factions, have maxed powerplay with all powers at some stage and done multiple types of missions over and over until my eyes bled... If there was a basis to be given a mission fdev have seriously over stepped the mark on how it works either that or its broken
