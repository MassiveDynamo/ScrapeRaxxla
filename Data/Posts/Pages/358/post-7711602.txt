Hi Guys - I posted this bug report a while back and got no response from FDEV

https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ays-even-though-disabled.480936/#post-7705965

Has anyone else come across this effect? I usually fly with music disabled. Only combat music is enabled on my settings (don't mind it for combat). When I went to the system mentioned, there was music playing when DSS'ing this planet - quiet bell like sounds..

Can anyone else reproduce, and submit, so we can tease it out of them if this is intended special behaviour or just a bug ? (its a pretty place, btw)
