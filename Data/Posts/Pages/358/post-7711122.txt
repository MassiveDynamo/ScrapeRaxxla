About star class X (=exotic):
Nowadays scientists (Dr. Kip Thorne et all.) calculate that in order to make a safe/stable transitable wormhole, you'd need, among others, some kind of exotic matter.
MB told to Drew Wagar, antigravity (as well as Raxxla and Thargs) was off limits in the novels.
What tech do the Thargs use to travel throug hyperspace?
Would that turn out to be a link between exotic matter-antigravity-wormholes-Raxxla ?

Books spell it as Salomé
Original Cmdr (Drew Wagar) who flew the Seven Veils untill the Wizard PepewKid blew it, appeared as Salomé in the HUD as well, back in time.

358 pages of running up and down the same, well worn logical rut and it seems we're not much closer to a solution. A to B, B to A, A to B, B to A, train of habitual thought suddenly derails due to a maladjusted tinfoil hat and hey presto, you suddenly find yourself at C...
It's comprehensible, as new players are eventually coming and veterans leaving. IMHO, i'ts seasoned Chymera Hunters', Rifters' and so pleasure to adjust some unbalanced or repetitive tinfoiling.
