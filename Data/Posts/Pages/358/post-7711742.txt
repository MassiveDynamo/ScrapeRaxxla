There is a system called Amber, in the bubble. Next to Phekda.
It might be interesting as Amber in several languages has a name meaning 'burn stone'. Bernstein i German, for example.
Amber is often referred to as 'tears of the gods'. That might put it on the brow of someone?
It can also be trinkets of hidden stuff, as it may contain fossilized plants or animals(often insects, as in the other FD title).

It's in Ursa Major, in the Big Dipper part.

I'm way out in the Eulysian fields myself, so I want be back in the bubble for a while.
