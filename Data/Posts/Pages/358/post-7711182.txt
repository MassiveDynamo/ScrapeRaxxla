That, is an excellent lateral drift CMDR!

Even though MB said there would be no clues it would be logical that anything added to the game since DB hid Raxxla, would be a product of the same thinking that subconsciously knows where it is.

Breakthrough!
This also explains the whole " Cmdrs have to make their journey's themselves"
