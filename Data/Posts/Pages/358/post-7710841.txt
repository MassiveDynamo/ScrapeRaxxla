358 pages of running up and down the same, well worn logical rut and it seems we're not much closer to a solution. A to B, B to A, A to B, B to A, train of habitual thought suddenly derails due to a maladjusted tinfoil hat and hey presto, you suddenly find yourself at C...

Looking back towards A from C, the tangential path becomes obvious

People have made careers out of disrupting habitual thought processes.
