Additionally MB in Legacy wrote "Julia as a girl dreamed of being the first pilot to discover Raxxla", and "She hoped to keep her Eagle as she’d grown accustomed to its idiosyncrasies...whether it was a suitable ship for travelling all the way to Alliance space was another matter".

I was too young to work, so while my mother and father slaved in the mines, I remained locked in the cell alone. I had no form of entertainment except for a book, a single book about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon. My father must have bought it on the black market. He couldn’t have got it from anywhere else.
“I still have that book.”
