Alioth was the Federation name for the system before the formed their own superpower. Quphieth was the Imperial name.
In FE2/FFE those are two different (and not nearby!) systems, with the latter being in a vaguely coreward direction from Sol - is there a reference in ED retconning the FFE Quphieth to be an Imperial alias for Alioth?
