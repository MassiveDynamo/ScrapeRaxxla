I've been doing a lot of experimenting.
I'm reasonably certain that these aren't noise or random patterns, since they remain when I filter out the heavy noise and they remain completely consistent between jumps.
Much like the Landscape Signal, they are strongly left-channel biased too (I don't know why this might be, it could be my setup for reasons I don't understand?).
This has noise filtering and tweaked spectrogram settings:



This shape is consistent in all the recordings I've made of hyperspace, always in exactly the same place. Actually, it's .

This shape appears in the middle of a blobby shape that I think of as being "shadows":





You can see in the spectrograms above that the little slanted vertical lines overlay the shadows and are not part of the same audio layer - these slanted lines are what we hear as the whispers. The blobby shapes don't exactly coincide with any visual or audio in the jump that I can see so far, they appear to be very subtly part of the background.

As D7 said, it's much harder to see on these images than it is on Audacity itself, so I highly recommend (as usual) everyone give this a go for yourself and try to bust it.

So - these are indeed intentional shapes: What could they mean? Can anyone get a better, cleaner image of them?

And the triangle/circles image can be seen in a CARRIER jump as well. This tells me it is indifferent to ship types and FSD types.
