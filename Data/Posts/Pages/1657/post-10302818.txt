So was he telling us that Raxxla lies in Alliance space?
The Northern Edge in FFE is Alliance space. The reference is written from the perspective of Sol. Therefore Draco, Usrsa Major, Ursa Minor, and Cassiopeiae are all Northern Edge because these are the Northern skies as viewed from Earth. Alioth (capital of the Alliance) is a star in Ursa Major.

Alioth was the Federation name for the system before the formed their own superpower. Quphieth was the Imperial name. In the Quphieth entry, Donaldson starport is referenced.
