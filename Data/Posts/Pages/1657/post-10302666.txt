"much like the ancient myths of Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John" - "much like" led me to look for other mythical places in mythology / literature / history (those who went searching for Atlantis/El dorado/etc just like the obsession with Raxxla)....

I feel from reading the footnotes from Drew on the recent Formidine Rift review I posted previously that direct references (like Astrophel and Stella) would have been far too simple for MB, but he may have enjoyed sending people on a wild goose chase....

Thinking about it Astrophel being star lover is logical and fits in with Elite... but extrapolating it to a fairy tale as a clue is a valid thought.... even though there will be no clues
In the codex the phrase is "Princess Astrophil and the Spiralling Stars", while in his book Elite Legacy MB wrote "As a girl Julia grew up without toys with a single possession, a book “about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon”". Logically these ought to be the same; perhaps these are two parts of a single clue & we need to combine them?

I've never been convinced that a reference to Phillip Sidney's prose was the intention (though I did spend a while exploring the hypothesis that the Spiralling Stars were coorbiting black holes, since Stella had black eyes).

Additionally MB in Legacy wrote "Julia as a girl dreamed of being the first pilot to discover Raxxla", and "She hoped to keep her Eagle as she’d grown accustomed to its idiosyncrasies...whether it was a suitable ship for travelling all the way to Alliance space was another matter". So was he telling us that Raxxla lies in Alliance space?
