One abstract thought - a children’s story. What if it’s not an actual story about a princess named Astrophel?

What if it refers to the term ‘fairy tale’?

The term might be applicable I suspect because in relation to the works of Robert Holdstock. In one regard his ‘Lost Realms’ book, within which he touches upon the lands of The Tuatha Dé Danann, and in other chapters of how contemporary writings may have helped re-drew those myths as the Fae folk.

As an idea, what if the Codex is hinting at a certain writer, a certain ‘fairy tale’. Is this another reference to Holdstock, is this another reflection upon The Tuatha Dé Danann mythology and their links to the concept of an ‘Otherworld’?
