One abstract thought - a children’s story. What if it’s not an actual story about a princess named Astrophel?

What if it refers to a ‘fairy tale’?

The term is applicable I suspect because if the works of Robert Holdstock. In one regard his ‘Lost Realms’ book. In it he vaguely touches upon the lands of The Tuatha Dé Danann, and in other chapters of how Victorian fiction re-drew these myths and helped promote the concept of the Fae folk.

As an idea, what if the Codex is hinting at a certain writer, a certain ‘fairy tale’. Is this another reference to Holdstock, is this another reflection upon The Tuatha Dé Danann?

"much like the ancient myths of Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John" - "much like" led me to look for other mythical places in mythology / literature / history (those who went searching for Atlantis/El dorado/etc just like the obsession with Raxxla)....

I feel from reading the footnotes from Drew on the recent Formidine Rift review I posted previously that direct references (like Astrophel and Stella) would have been far too simple for MB, but he may have enjoyed sending people on a wild goose chase....

Thinking about it Astrophel being star lover is logical and fits in with Elite... but extrapolating it to a fairy tale as a clue is a valid thought.... even though there will be no clues
