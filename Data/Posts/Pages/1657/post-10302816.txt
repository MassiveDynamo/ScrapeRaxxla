"Alien dragon"...Draco? Thargoid?
Just tried anagram solver but it didn't come up with anything obvious.
I'm not convinced there's a ship criterion involved, no lore to indicate that.
The ship idea is probably nothing, but to me the alien dragon sounds like a big flashing neon sign saying "CLUE".

First thing I thought of was the Argo Navis narrative
Jason fought the Dragon of Colchis which was guarding the Golden Fleece. Medea was a priestess of the goddess Hecate (depicted as holding torches, keys, or snakes) who aids him on his quest.

Not a 1:1 to a princess needing rescuing, but I think breaking down the relationship between:
[1] the fictional children's tale of ED lore, and
[2] legends, myths, poetry relating to lovers and the Astrophel / star lover theme, and
[3] Brooke's fascination with a shiny golden thing hanging around
Finding how these are reflected in the game in some way could help narrow this down.

In Legacy, the star lover is the princess, and the odd variable is an alien dragon.
alien = foreign? bizarre?
dragon = alternate forms can be a drake, serpent, wyrm etc
