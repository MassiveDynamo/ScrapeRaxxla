I see it too on your recordings Louis.
It appears to be associated with the 'loud whisper' track that repeats during transit - you can see it each time the sound occurs during a recording. So either it is just a pattern that looks like something, or there is something to investigate about that particular whisper sound.

Here is the shape with some context for where it sits:

Using 2048 window size helps with the clarity a bit.

Keep in mind, while studying the landscape signal in the past, I could sense my brain was trying to see letters, patterns, shapes, all kinds of things out of just scattered noise. I'm not saying it's not something, but stay vigilant of your brain's evolved pattern recognition. If it was a clue it would be more overt IMO.
