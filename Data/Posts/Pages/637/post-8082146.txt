So, if it's true, our nav computers (and then PF, TDW, The Club, my Grandma, etc...) knew the location of Raxxla since the start ?
And nevertheless, our GalMap doesn't show it ?
Traitors !
We could discuss about ED mechanics on how a star (Raxxla is a star ?) can appear as selected in the skybox with its name but not in the GalMap. Or could it actually be in the GalMap, but the search function gets somehow overrided when the word is written ? Or he discovered it when jumping into a procedural named system and then the name Raxxla appeared and kept there ?
Anyway.. far-fetched...
41 KLy from Sol ?
A supraluminal+++ rogue !

The screenshot looks like it says 800 or so Light seconds, implying Raxxla is found within a system. Apparently the screenshot is not his, but was sent to him. He found Raxxla as well, but did not screen cap of video out of respect for the hunters and devs. Sounds like a crock to me, yet I'm still really fighting the urge to check
