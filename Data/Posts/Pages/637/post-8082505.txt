Done a bit of catching up in the thread. Boy, we are really at the end of our rope if we are looking for barcodes in cosmetics for clues.

As to the Instagram CMDR who found it, he didn't. Load of bio-waste, that is.

imo the end of the Salome mystery seemed to tie in with the decline of this thread, at least before we had something tangible as well as Raxxla, now its all alone and just not enough there to chew on...so barcodes seem like maybe something at first, just anything.

To sum it up:

What do we know, actually know for a fact? - zero
What actual certified clue do we have? - zero
What do we hope? - that 'it exists' that 'its in the game and discoverable'

So hooray for barcodes et al is what I say
