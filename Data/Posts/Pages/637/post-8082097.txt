So, if it's true, our nav computers (and then PF, TDW, The Club, my Grandma, etc...) knew the location of Raxxla since the start ?
And nevertheless, our GalMap doesn't show it ?
Traitors !
We could discuss about ED mechanics on how a star (Raxxla is a star ?) can appear as selected in the skybox with its name but not in the GalMap. Or could it actually be in the GalMap, but the search function gets somehow overrun when the word is written ? Or he discovered it when jumping into a procedural named system and then the name Raxxla appeared and kept there ?
Anyway.. far-fetched...
41 KLy from Sol ?
A supraluminal+++ rogue !
