Someone on IRH Discord said they’d talked to a dev and there is a way, just feed the Goid with things it wants. It builds up an unseen rank. How you test that and what good it does I don’t know. With the Alliance terrabombing Ammonia World’s in the Coalsack I suspect it’s a bit too late to get friendly with them.
Ayyo, time to get me one of them transforming flower ships. Hope they come with preinstalled RGB lighting so I can have a true gaming battlestation.
