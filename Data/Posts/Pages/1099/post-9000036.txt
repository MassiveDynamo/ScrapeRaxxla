Yeah there’s a number of fairly large swaths of the galaxy locked behind an “unknown permit”. Been waiting to get into the Horsehead Dark Region for what seems like an eternity but apparently FDEV hasn’t finished with whatever it is they’re doing in there yet. Either that there is a way to get the “unknown permit” that no one has figured out for a few years.
Just like col sector 70, have they finished horsehead yet?
