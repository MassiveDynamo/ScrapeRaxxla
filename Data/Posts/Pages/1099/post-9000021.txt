I still cant believe salome was killed in game wasnt she?

Yep, by “Cmdr Harry Potter” but renamed in the book to avoid copyright issues. you can google it, there are some youtube vids.

The spiky haired woman was Elyssia and the theory is that she, Rebecca, Salomé, the pirate woman, and possibly Emperor Arissa are all clones. You’ll have to read Drew’s two Elite books and make your own mind up on that.
