Oresrians, Klaxians, &c. &c. It is interesting that the central portion (the image used in the Codex) is seemingly standard across all variations (found to date at least) however. If only there were ways of interacting with them other than shooting them for mats. Sigh.
Someone on IRH Discord said they’d talked to a dev and there is a way, just feed the Goid with things it wants. It builds up an unseen rank. How you test that and what good it does I don’t know. With the Alliance terrabombing Ammonia World’s in the Coalsack I suspect it’s a bit too late to get friendly with them.
