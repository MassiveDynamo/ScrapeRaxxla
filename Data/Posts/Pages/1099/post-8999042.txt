Someone on IRH Discord said they’d talked to a dev and there is a way, just feed the Goid with things it wants. It builds up an unseen rank. How you test that and what good it does I don’t know. With the Alliance terrabombing Ammonia World’s in the Coalsack I suspect it’s a bit too late to get friendly with them.
As the things it wants tends to be live humans IIRC, not sure if that is my preferred First Contact approach either... ;-)
