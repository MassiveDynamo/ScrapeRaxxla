Raxxla may be a "rouge planet", moving through other systems on a very, very long circular path. In all the threads I have read referring to the locations of permit locked systems coupled with the Raxxla symbol and it's 33 dots in somewhat of a circular pattern, these dots may be where the "rouge planet" Raxxla will appear or be present at a particular time in space. The symbology in the center may give some reference to the timing of the event of appearance.

We expect planets in Elite to be at a set of coordinates and always be there. If I were going to hide something from you in this game, I would put it where no one looks or expect it to be, like a moving (rouge) planet always changing location, so if you found it and reported it, even with video, when everyone else comes back to check your results, it's no longer there, and in this way, I could make anyone reporting "I found it" look foolish.

I think Raxxla is a rouge planet>> (and real ones are suspected to exist in the MW Galaxy, even though we have yet to prove it).

Yes this is what I had originally thought when it talked about witch space as rouge planets ‘lurk there’
