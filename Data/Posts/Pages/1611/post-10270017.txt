there is something similar to inhaling and exhaling after the middle of the recording. This is not necessarily something organic, but the rise and fall is recorded... at least by my gadget and the sound settings on the headphones. If this is a simulation of Sagittarius A - Frontiers really tried
It does require a lot of editing to isolate the sound from all of the humming and whirring going on. Even if it was just a really creative way to generate an ambient sound of the Milky Way / SagA* from a simple gas mask then it has been a fun exercise in deconstructing the sound designer's work

In saying that, it would be great if there are longer recordings of it somewhere. 2 minutes is a very small sample size, so perhaps a larger clip would help determine if it is an actual rhythmic 'breathing' effect.
EDIT: Nevermind, it sounds like from Canonn's expedition research the audio typically repeats just under the 2 minute mark.
