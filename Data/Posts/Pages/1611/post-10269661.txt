We know there are hidden systems in the game. At release you could search the galmap for test or test2, and the map would move to locations in the central bubble. one of them was very close to Sol. You cold not select them jump to them. They were used by FD for testing.
Hmm... curious. can't you remember where it was on the map and how far it is from Tau Ceti?

The solution to this riddle itself should be simple, I am far from thinking that during the crunch before launching the game, Braben sat in encyclopedias about Ancient Greek or Egyptian mythology (at least to such a deep level as we are currently looking for) in order to fit this Raxxla secret into the framework of such things. And although the game is full of such names, these people (devs) are still closer to mathematics, logic, etc. than to theology and philosophy. Therefore the solution should be simple, a mystery at the level of 2012-2015 (if it really exists)

By the way, doesnâ€™t the jump into witch space itself give some kind of signal that draws some pictures, like a signal from the center of the galaxy?
