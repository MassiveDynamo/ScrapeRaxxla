Got a system name?
PSR J0024-7204O but maybe I was too hot, it's very difficult to get there.

I'm working with the theory where Braben said that it is enough to have a regular scanner. I’m trying to build routes from Tau Ceti towards the center of the galaxy. We know that with a “scanner” we can hear the “call of the serenas” by directing our ship exactly to the center of the galaxy. (Omphalos this means not only the navel, but also “center”, which can mean exactly the center of the galaxy). For now I’m looking for a rift somewhere nearby, going into the arms of the galaxy. So far no success. Considering the picture that we can get by analyzing the sounds of serens (a certain mountain or something similar, and put it on a map)
