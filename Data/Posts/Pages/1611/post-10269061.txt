I was also talking to our friendly AI about witch-space and Raxxla today
SPOILER: CHATTING ABOUT HYPERSPACE AND RAXXLA




Just saying it for anyone that doesn't know at this point cos of hiding under a rock. Chat GPT is a cool robot that has the ability to make anything sound factual, but in reality most of it isn't. I was using it here to bounce ideas off and see if it said anything interesting - I think it did a good job of summarising the topic.

And some stuff from real folks from years back makes me wonder if we've just gotten so used to the whispers that we stopped thinking about them?:

Could have sworn I heard some weird voices in the last jump. "

“I can’t bear another jump. The lights in witch-space are coming for me, the lights… always the lights… they’re calling to me… a siren song… I must join them…”

Someone has to have done some sort of Canonn-style analysis of the whispers??
