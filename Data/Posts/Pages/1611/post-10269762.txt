I knew of test systems (I think that there even used to be a star in one that appeared on the skybox from surrounding systems - the Sol test lights or something iirc) but I did not know that they were searchable in the Galaxy Map.

It would not then be inconceivable for Raxxla to be searchable but under a different name - and maybe there is something else in the game that will provide us with that name, that lurks in the Lost Realms? If that is the case, then it fits the old lore (Jason Ryder finding evidence for Raxxla's existence but needing an expedition to get there) and it could be right under our noses (as somewhere 200LY or so from Sol is these days). Alternatively, Raxxla itself might be in the Lost Realms but the clue could be anywhere, even in a book, perhaps, without being in-game.
They just used to be searchable. They aren't any more.

There isn't anything mysterious about the test systems. FD talked about them openly when asked. Like EvR said, they were used for light testing among other things. I just wanted to highlight that there are mechanics to hide entire systems, in the game and that they have been there since release.
