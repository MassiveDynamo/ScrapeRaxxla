i still think that part of road to raxxla is some kind of exotic fsd behaviour. misjumps (as they were) arent in the game anymore, but perhaps there are some conditions that still could trigger some kind of unnatural jump.
so ive been wondering what kind of situation would make sense to cause fsd to malfunction in this way. perhaps something that only an elite could do. and it occured to me that we can jump ships from exclusion zones of stars.
wouldnt it make sense that white dwarves and neutron stars, which are able to supercharge our fsd, would be able to super-supercharge the fsd when successfully jumping from its exclusion zone? i tried it once (long time ago, by a mistake ^^ ) and it certainly seemed to be a challenge for a skilled pilot in a well equipped ship... maybe theres some kind of supercharge to be achieved in wolf-rayet stars. maybe we just need to drop to sag a, position to have the bh between ship and sol, target sol, synth jumponium and engage... maybe i dont really know where i want to take this, but it seem to me like a possibility, so im just going to leave it here ^^ ill do some testing sometimes and if i find anything ill come back
