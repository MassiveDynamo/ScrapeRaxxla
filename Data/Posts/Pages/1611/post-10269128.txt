The thing about hyperspace is, it’s just a loading screen.

Now it’s not outside the reach of plausibility to set an incursion zone, and any transgression into that zone ought to trigger a sound in the loading screen period.

However such a mechanism would be very obvious, unless you specifically toned this noise down so it was inexplicable.

Now FD has always used sound as a mechanism since day one, sadly in my opinion this is a design flaw because their are some of us with hearing impairments, so logically if such a mechanism existed you ought to apply a secondary visual cue too… if that were the case such a mechanism ought to be obvious. So we ought to have found this by now.

Again we fall into that old chestnut, does a mechanism exist in game that only applies to one element, or has it been utilised for other elements - see Thargoid interceptions.

Disregarding that, the reference to the Siren of the deepest void in the Codex initially has always made me think of those Galnet ‘Whispers’ stories, so for me it has always been the most logical outcome, with those stories acting as way points, and either a sound exists at those points (?) or those points themselves correlate somehow?

Personally I have never gotten around to investigating this, as there has usually been some other distraction.
