I’ve never gotten involved within the landscape signal, however I noticed how Cmdrs describe the signal as looking like a mountain range.

My own research into Holdstock, Gilgamesh, Milton, the Celtic Otherworld and Norse Yggdrasil, has identified a recurring theme of ‘mountains’. Michael Brookes likewise talked of mountains in his blogs and writings and I have a suspicion this is a reference to the cosmological world mountain.

In game I may have uncovered a series of systems and bodies named after real life mount ranges, these are all relatively close together, within the area of influence of our Raxxla research, a few segments of this hypothetical range do correlate visually with other constellations, which may identify its intentional.



I do wonder if the landscape signal is a huge clue, and simply is an encoded visual message transmitting a communication to look at mountains in game?

The brow mentioned within the Codex I now suspect is a reference to the brow of a mountain range, outlined in Paradise Lost as the exterior wall of heaven. This mountain/s may also double as the passageway to the Otherworld, or where upon that mountain the deceased go to rest…

Interestingly the origin for the word Fernweh outlined in the Codex, originated out of a 19th-Century German romantic naturist movement, and relates to a yearning for distant lands.
