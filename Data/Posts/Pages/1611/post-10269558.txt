Regarding the whisper in witch space. This does not have to be overly complex, to be a possible implementation of the Raxxla mystery.
Even though the hyperspace sequence is a loading screen, it's not entirely static. It does change a bit, depending on the target star. Some form of data is loaded into the sequence animation. The sound probably has the same option.

We know there are hidden systems in the game. At release you could search the galmap for test or test2, and the map would move to locations in the central bubble. one of them was very close to Sol. You cold not select them jump to them. They were used by FD for testing.

FD could easily made another hidden system and put Raxxla in it. If so they would only have to override your target system for the hyperspace jump, if all the required criteria were in place. If they use Shinrarta Dezhra as either the jump from system or target system, you even get the Elite requirement for free.
