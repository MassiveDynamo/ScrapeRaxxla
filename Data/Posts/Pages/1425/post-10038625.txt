"Searching for Raxxla requires not just understanding science and stellar development (past, present, and future), human history and cultures, Thargoid history and culture, and Guardian history and culture. "
I believe this is purely your view, but its only as valid as any other of the other thousands of views/theories/guesses/musings here unless you've actually found Raxxla?

Otherwise it is pure conjecture....

Good luck with your search but please be polite to others with just as valid wafflings as your own
