It is also not up to you to decide what other people can and can't do because of what you think may or may not be something.


So to everyone, let's stop discussing each other and their perceived intentions, and get back to the topic at hand.
I am not contradicting myself. Further, I only pull public scan records via EDDiscovery. The data downloaded by EDDiscovery is submitted by CMDRs to Universal Cartographics. Anything searchable on EDSM's website is fair game. All my research is based purely on in-game lore and official sources such as official novels, game manuals, and occasionally supplemented with Holdstock stuff where books are believed to be intentionally highlighting ideas that were later put into Elite Dangerous. But everything first has to be in Elite Dangerous before I go looking to understand what we are supposed to pick up on from various events/places.
