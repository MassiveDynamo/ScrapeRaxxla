Only problem right now: Even whit the reduced text my PC has to check 135k Lines against 75 million known Systems. (approx: 43 Days computing)
Also i am not quite Sure if the reduced text has still everything in it. It seems a bit small. It got from 4.5 million lines down to 135k lines.
Sure there have been a lot of Duplicate Lines (From QuotesCMDR and all the CMDR Names) but it is a bit strange that it got this small (383130kb to 13986kb)
I try to get my Raspberry running and than wait maybe i will hock a bell to it, or make it bark when done.


Edit: first match 39 Lambda Orionis which is strange and makes me more doubtful about completeness, cause it should bee 4 Sextantis
Brutal! Is there a way to share some runtime, like with citizens science projects? I'm very happy to help by lending computer time if that's in any way possible?

I'm excited to see the list, I wonder how long it's going to be?
