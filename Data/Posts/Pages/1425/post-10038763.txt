Some good advice and a friendly warning:

Having a chat with https://chat.openai.com/chat tonight:

Me:
must I keep an open mind to be able to find raxxla?

ChatGPT:
It is not clear if keeping an open mind is necessary in order to find RAXXLA in the game Elite Dangerous, as RAXXLA is a fictional location whose existence has not been definitively proven within the game's universe. Some players believe that RAXXLA is a hidden location within the game that can be discovered by solving puzzles or uncovering clues, while others consider it to be a mythical or legendary location that may never be found.

If you are interested in trying to find RAXXLA within the game, it may be helpful to approach your search with a sense of curiosity and a willingness to explore and try different strategies. It may also be helpful to keep an open mind and consider different theories or ideas about the location of RAXXLA, even if they seem unlikely or unconventional.

However, it is important to keep in mind that RAXXLA is a fictional location and its existence has not been confirmed by the developers of Elite Dangerous. As such, you should not get too caught up in your search for RAXXLA and should be prepared for the possibility that it may never be found.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to have fun while playing the game and to enjoy the experience of exploring the game's universe.
