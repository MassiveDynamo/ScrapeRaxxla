This is why I was making the point that searching EDSM is only of very limited usage unless you have much more additional context.
That makes perfect sense for you. But keep in mind, we're all in a different state of mindset here.
Personally I refrain from telling people "what not to do". Instead I try look for suggestions on how they can improve their work.
Quite often it's a bit of work to respond in such manner, hence why I stay silent and just give people a +1 because they are trying to work through it on their own.
It's a passion of their, let's respect that. And the people here.

This is just a friendly reminder to us all really. It's easy to get upset over others ideas. Don't.
Keep calm, find a way add to their ideas instead of tearing it down. Contribute, do not deconstruct.

Phew. And being able to do that takes quite an effort. I know. Feelings, passion about subjects etc. I get it
PS, some of humans strongest emotions are triggered when we see something we think is WRONG. This is why Wiki works so well and have such a success.
It's quite human to react on 'wrong info'.

Stay strong folks. o7
