But rather to brute force whit all known Systems, brute force whit only the ones from this tread may make it doable in the lifetime of our universe
May I ask why we are trying to brute force this? We have established the real Soontill must be the Guardian homeworld due to presence of Technetium and how Technetium is ultimately forged via S-process nucleosynthesis. Soontill 1 where the secret base was supposedly located is utterly unlandable by any species and the surface is hotter than most stars. We have had discussions on types of stars inhabited by Guardians and what they would have looked like at varying points in stellar evolution. Why is this being made unnecessarily complicated? We know exactly what we are looking for and the varying forms it could take. Thargoids appear to actually be natives to Witchspace so why are we trying to make them something they are not? Do you enjoy suffering? This doesn't need to be hard.
