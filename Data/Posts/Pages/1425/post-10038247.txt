I’m getting old and forgetful...Remind me again what the logic is behind this?
Nobody in this thread has (demonstrably) found Raxxla, so we haven’t got the answer.
But in total the amount of explored systems is still, I believe, a tiny fraction of the in-game total.
And since we don’t know what it is......searching based on an unsubstantiated rumour that MB said the system had been entered but it wasnt found is a bit like a blindfolded bull in a china shop

I shall finish my Gravity Wave theory-based search, but then one of my accounts will return to the bubble. I have had another idea (actually two, I’m spoilt for choice! ), but got a load of diy & gardening to do.

But the GW hypothesis testing is proving slow. Both accounts still have quite a lot of kylies to fly, and almost every system is proving to be undiscovered, and quite a few AW or WW to map (I’m not bothering with terraformables)!

But rather to brute force whit all known Systems, brute force whit only the ones from this tread may make it doable in the lifetime of our universe
