I am not contradicting myself. Despite knowing precisely how to craft requests for non-public data I have never utilized it as a method in searching for Raxxla. Further, I only pull public scan records via EDDiscovery. The data downloaded by EDDiscovery is submitted by CMDRs to Universal Cartographics. It by definition doesn't include regions which are presently locked to players. Anything searchable on EDSM's website is fair game. Hidden systems are explicitly excluded because no player has access to areas that are region-locked. All my research is based purely on in-game lore and official sources such as official novels, game manuals, and occassionally supplemented with Holdstock stuff where books are believed to be intentionally highlighting ideas that were later put into Elite Dangerous. But everything first has to be in Elite Dangerous before I go looking to understand what we are supposed to pick up on from various events/places.
The information that is on 3rd party websites and applications can only have got there from in game sources. They all have the same available data.

I would advise against saying you know how to search game files for non-public data again.

Now back to the topic at hand please.
