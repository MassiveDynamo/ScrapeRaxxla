Yesterday, I had planned to finished my AX Corvette. I was in the neighborhood of Pranav Antal PP space.
I ended up with another Yak-Shaving for Raxxla because of that relation.

The Toast. Re Jewel being Earth (accord Pranav Antal, his speech - them being all Utopia focused etc).
Again thinking about "from where would Sol appear as a Jewel, on the brow of Cassiopeia (mother of Andromeda)?"
Looking around, Shinrarta Dezra is having a splendid view like that. One candidate. Probably 500 or more left to go.
How can I deduct "whisperer & siren". I decided to use Thetis Megaship for that.

The last phrase is still pulling my leg. Parents, Grief, Lover & Vagabonds .. well it could be some of the megaship again. Brain meltdown in-flight.
I end up without no pattern that makes any sense. No specific direction either.

I did fly the route (SD, Sol, Thetis), re-inspecting planets, the ships logs, the systems along the triangular paths between the systems.
No sightings, no bugs, lot's of boring USSs. I did even check an Asteroid belt with 170+ times the mass of the Moon (gawd; it MUST be something there I told my self)
... well it was a nice journey. But that's all.

Tonight I SHALL finish my AX build!
