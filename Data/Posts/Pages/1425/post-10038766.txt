It's been a long time since I've been in the USSs for these (Encoded / Degraded), just happened to see the F-63 Condor again.

In case some of the new-comers may not have gazed upon the F-63 Condor wrecks with these strange hints / eggs.
I brought the underside reg number as well.
5 imgurs in a album. Nothing on the Condors have changed from what I can see.

The reg numbers on the Condors are:
1LAR1A-X
3-R1K-A 4821
