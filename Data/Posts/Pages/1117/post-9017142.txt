The unknowns left are what happened exactly in that last system and what exactly happened to all the people and cargo.
There's also a date in the Adamastor's logs where the contents are missing. It's prior to arrival at the LP.

Also a question tied to the above about whether the Adamastor started at Chukchan, went somewhere, then went to the LP, or whether it started elsewhere, went to Chukchan, and then went to the LP.

Lots of unanswered speculative stuff as well, of course, but the missing data from the date stands out as a clue that has not been resolve.
