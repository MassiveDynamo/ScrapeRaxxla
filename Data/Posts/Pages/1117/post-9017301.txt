Wasn't it when 1.3 hit? Going by my very poor memory of course.

The disappearance of those Elite missions in SD still troubles me somewhat. It may have been due to a retcon, but I’m wondering if a game update obviated them. Does anyone know when they actually disappeared?

I paid my fines after trying, & failing, to hack Adamastor’s transmitter. Now wonder where to start looking. She was fuelled at Chukchan for a 370ly journey but went via the Synuefe LP which is 365ly from Chukchan, so presumably the base out towards Barnard’s Loop should be nearby? I suspect there is more to be decoded in that LP message.

And on returning from Coalsack after collecting Carver’s team and their findings her hyperdrive failed when at HIP 69200, which is NOT on the way to BLoop, but approximately at right angles to that route, back towards the bubble but missing the centre, so she must have been headed to another facility! So I think there are two Azimuth sites to be found, and one of them may have the wreck of the Hesperus after a Goid (Klaxian?) encounter. That may be more likely to be at the BLoop site.

The Quest To Find Raxxla
Apologies if this has already been discussed, but I was just offered the following mission from Galcop Colonial Defense Mission on Dervish Platform in the Ogma system. http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z272/romilayu/IMG_4096cfaf-27bb-4ae2-9131-2d6f25912602_zpsu6tfyjt2.png...
