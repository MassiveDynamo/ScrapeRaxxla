My personal suspicion on this is simply that the actual rate of people getting an Elite rank far exceeded the forecast rate which those missions had been designed to tie in to.

Could be wrong about it being the cause of removal, which could very well have just been down to a bug, but I'd bet the actual situation is as per above, and a rethink was needed at some point.
In addition to that, I also sort of had the impression that they were supposed to be chained missions, i.e. Completing the first one in a chain would unlock the next part of the mystery mission, etc. Which never happened, so they may have been broken as well. Somewhere (may even be on this thread) there is a long post by the commander who logged their disappearance as a bug, and the various non-responses he got from FD, including in person at one of the public events.
