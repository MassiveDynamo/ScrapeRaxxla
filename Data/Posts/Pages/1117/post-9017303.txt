But no record of anything connected to Azimuth or the other one in Chukchan itself, no abandoned station or base or anything, just some text from the PIs about the history of the 'company'? I may have just been expecting too much or maybe its like the hidden NMLA base that apparently disappeared and is meant to have existed and then disappeared, if we believe the Empire side of the story anyway. Just seems like a big gap in the story but not sure if meant to be or not.

I mean they could have tied it into an abandoned base, or a hint at INRA or connected it to Black Flight or the PSJ-17 base or something else but theres just a big hole there.
And FWIW neither Azimuth nor Pharmasapien appear in any of the old lore either like the FE2 journals or the like, that I could find. It was 200 years ago, so even an abandoned base may have long disappeared to be fair. Or we just have not found it (there was a lot of noise that was never decrypted in the LP signal also).
