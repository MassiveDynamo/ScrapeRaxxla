Long time lurker and player of the game here, (and my first post here, so please be gentle) but has there been any noticeable changes in the Odyssey countdown pics? I seem to recall a couple of pages back someone saying they were getting clearer?
Welcome to the mass insanity. I don't believe there have been any major changes, taking a look at what is here, but I have not followed it very closely after the first couple of days, can't see anything recognizable (to me at least, which doesn't mean much as I suck at these sorts of things) in the star formations: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/countdown.567512/

Not sure if they have been using the same background on their equipment and other preview images as well.
