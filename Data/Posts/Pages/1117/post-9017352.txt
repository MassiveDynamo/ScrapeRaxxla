My personal opinion.
All missions are missing that were associated with finding any objects in the game (INRA, base guards, base Thargoids, etc.) after it has already found and wrote about them on the forum and the wiki, these missions have lost meaning.
Or similarly, it may be the case that these were not procedurally generated missions, and when the decision was made that the new mission system would only be proc gen missions, they were killed off.
