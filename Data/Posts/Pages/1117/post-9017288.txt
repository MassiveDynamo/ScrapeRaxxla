I think they said Chuckchan was the home of Azimuth ( somekind of bioscience i think?) And they were later bought up by another bioscience corp that also went belly up at some point. - so ya shell companies for the Club (Ask Davanix)

But no record of anything connected to Azimuth or the other one in Chukchan itself, no abandoned station or base or anything, just some text from the PIs about the history of the 'company'? I may have just been expecting too much or maybe its like the hidden NMLA base that apparently disappeared and is meant to have existed and then disappeared, if we believe the Empire side of the story anyway. Just seems like a big gap in the story but not sure if meant to be or not.

I mean they could have tied it into an abandoned base, or a hint at INRA or connected it to Black Flight or the PSJ-17 base or something else but theres just a big hole there.
