I think they removed them because possible content behind them was changed (TWD and Raxxla).
They probably blocked missions when they had plan for interactions with engineers.
Right now only engineers have 'invite' mechanics. Also they had huge impact on lore like Palin, Ram Tah etc
Sadly this theory would also fit with the engineers being somehow linked to unlocking TDW invite perhaps, which would be, well, ugggh.
