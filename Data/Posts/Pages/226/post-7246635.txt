Don't think of my hypothesis as something fixed and written in stone, Scytale. It can evolve an adapt to new evidences and I like a lot your idea. The "Sirius escape route" may be something valid, except that Raxxla may be a planet in another dimension that occasionally appears in our universe. Perhaps is a problem of where... and when. I find your hypothesis very interesting.

What if Rho Cassiopeiae vanished completely as an entire solar system, with Raxxla orbiting it? It would have been moved to another dimension or witch space. Guardians would have survived going there. Perhaps moving another stars, too. Although a way to travel to a new galaxy would be fine for exploration, but if they did it they may have invented intergalactic travel.

Forgive me for trying to find a pattern in all this mess. The fun is in creating theories and test them, that's how I spent a lot of time exploring the Formidine. Although... the creators of the game perhaps haven't created any clues yet!

Tranquilo, amigo paisano, this is the Chymerae Chasers thread ! Old Rifters with the brain fried by space madness, young Explorers with greedy shining eyes ready to fly thousands of Ly wherever a chymera shows its tail, famous erudite Cmdrs looking for unexisting SNR... all class of tinfoiling is welcome. Imho.
Anyway, I bet all of you, excellent fellow-threaders, are much more imaginative than the "story tellers" left in FD... So, I wish you, compa√±ero, were right.
The thing is, it's difficult to imagine where Raxxla is, when we are not even sure about what Raxxla is. I mean, what "Raxxla" has been implemented in the game? RH's ? Oolite's ? etc...
