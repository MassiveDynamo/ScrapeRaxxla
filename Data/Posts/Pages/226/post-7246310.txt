But where are these?
The only Q-type Anomaly I saw in the Codex earlier today was in a system inside the Bubble. If you select the Reported item in the Codex it will tell you where they have been found, when and by whom. I'm not sure how many get into the list for each type but I think you get a Codex voucher if you get on the list and possible one of less value if not but it is a new thing for you (not sure what the rules are for that yet). There should also be a list of what is known about the environments where the object selected is found (e.g. the systems with which star classes it is found in or never found in).
