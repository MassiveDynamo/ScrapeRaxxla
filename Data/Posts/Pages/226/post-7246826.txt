Does the Codex get updated immediately with a new find, or only when docked & data sold to Cartographics? When fss scanning my first system this afternoon I got a message about a new find (something like a green gas giant?) & it mentioned the codex, but when I looked in my codex I couldnâ€™t see anything out of the ordinary (although, admitedly, by that time I was brain dead).
The Codex updates your own discoveries immediately but I'm not sure yet if they are put into the Codex for others to see until you have turned in the vouchers to the authority contact. I suspect it is not required, since there are some mentions of things in remote parts of the galaxy (mostly just star types but some Xeno findings in a region near the Galactic Core), where I doubt the discoverers would have been able to return from already in order to have turned the vouchers in.
