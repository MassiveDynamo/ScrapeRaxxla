They turned out to be different sectors of the MW. Not really other galaxies.
And DW said repeatedly that Raxxla is not linked to the FR mYsTeRy.
Though Raxxla could be anywhere in the MW... including witch-space.

Except the Guardians werenâ€™t wiped out by the Thargoids, and if the info from the Guardian obelisks is to believed, they were never really in danger of being wiped out by the Thargoids.

Don't think of my hypothesis as something fixed and written in stone, Scytale. It can evolve an adapt to new evidences and I like a lot your idea. The "Sirius escape route" may be something valid, except that Raxxla may be a planet in another dimension that occasionally appears in our universe. Perhaps is a problem of where... and when. I find your hypothesis very interesting.

What if Rho Cassiopeiae vanished completely as an entire solar system, with Raxxla orbiting it? It would have been moved to another dimension or witch space. Guardians would have survived going there. Perhaps moving another stars, too. Although a way to travel to a new galaxy would be fine for exploration, but if they did it they may have invented intergalactic travel.

Forgive me for trying to find a pattern in all this mess. The fun is in creating theories and test them, that's how I spent a lot of time exploring the Formidine. Although... the creators of the game perhaps haven't created any clues yet!
