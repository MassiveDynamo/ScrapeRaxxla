I haven't seen them in person, but they are in the codex. Type -Q anomalies, I think. There are other lettered ones showing up in other regions too (in the codex), that look different.

I have no idea what they are except the extremely brief codex text descriptions.

These were found very quickly? Vids seem to indicate they move / interact and defend themselves...sentient?

I was hoping they were stable wormholes...were do they fall within the Codex / Stella objects or other (outside the game at present)?

Initial guess is AI - so lets not go poking it with any big sticks now.

Edit: agree its most likely more St. Elmos fire to keep Cmdrs chasing their tails.
