Welcome to the new ED Explo mechanics, Pa !
FDevs new kiddos spent a lot of time designing them in the mood of the current Zeitgeist. "I want all, now, at zero cost and with no effort."
Times are a changin'.
I for myself can't just stomach them. My beautiful space exploration game is broken. Thx new FDev kiddos!
