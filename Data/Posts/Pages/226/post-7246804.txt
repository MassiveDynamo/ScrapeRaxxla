Tranquilo, amigo paisano, this is the Chymerae Chasers thread ! Old Rifters with the brain fried by space madness, young Explorers with greedy shining eyes ready to fly thousands of Ly wherever a chymera shows its tail, famous erudite Cmdrs looking for unexisting SNR... all class of tinfoiling is welcome. Imho.
Anyway, I bet all of you, excellent fellow-threaders, are much more imaginative than the "story tellers" left in FD... So, I wish you, compa√±ero, were right.
The thing is, it's difficult to imagine where Raxxla is, when we are not even sure about what Raxxla is. I mean, what "Raxxla" has been implemented in the game? RH's ? Oolite's ? etc...
