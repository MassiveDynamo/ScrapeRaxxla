You can see a pic of those green orbs in the codex. It's in the codex wether you have seen them in person or not. It's in the section of the codex for either xeno or normal biological life. I haven't seen any in person yet. I assumed those were already in game.

Ah, so the green orb is a xeno/biological? I thought the message said it was a gas giant. I looked in the wrong part of the codex then. But, as I said, I was brain dead having taken 2 hours to do the fss scan....

edit: went back To check. no definitely a green gas giant in the codex, though doesnt look very green to me.
