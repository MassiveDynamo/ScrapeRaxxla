Any way to relate Deneb to the jewel etc... ?

Not sure about the jewel, but I think Princess Astrophel is Vega.

"In Chinese mythology Deneb is associated with the story of the Celestial Princess or the Weaver Girl. In this story a Girl (the star Vega) is separated from her beloved (a cowherd represented by the star Altair) by the Milky Way. Once a year, the girl and the cowherd are allowed to meet briefly when a large flock of magpies form a bridge across the starry river. Deneb represents the bridge."

And the six arms of the axis mundi symbol looks a bit like the Raxxla codex symbol, doesnâ€™t it?
