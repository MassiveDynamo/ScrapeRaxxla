I reached the Star of India system today but the FSS shows nothing. I'll fly a circuit in SC to check via parralax for anything hidden nearby later today. What is the system map anomaly you mention? It looks normal to me. There is different music that is played when zoomed out and zoomed in, perhaps because when zoomed in you're within the perimeter of the star and every type of body has it's own music.
If you look at the system map for about a minute, a strange morphing object pops out. This seem to exist in a layer between the star and the backgrund stars.
Itâ€™s best to start zoomed out, as it can fall behind the star otherwize.
