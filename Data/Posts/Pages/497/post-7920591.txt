I see a lot of ideas thrown out casually, and most of them immediately shot down by a member of the "been there done that" crew. So I'm volunteering myself and my ship for any expeditions, because I believe in the possibility that even the legendary few that were here 400 pages ago could have missed something. If there is a system that needs checking or a combination of game mechanics that needs exploiting let me know, I'll add it to my todo list.



If you have a particular permit locked region in mind let me know. I have my DBX fully gutted with 70+ jump range from when I was testing the BH in 27 Gamma Cassiopeiae. When it's supercharged it has a range of 297ly, maybe that's a requirement to get into an isolated system.

As I said. There may be one not yet discovered.
This thread is, also, meant to share experience. I think. That's not "shooting down" anyone's idea.
And there is only one legend, here. The Boss. (The psycho penguins don't count !)
