I see a lot of ideas thrown out casually, and most of them immediately shot down by a member of the "been there done that" crew. So I'm volunteering myself and my ship for any expeditions, because I believe in the possibility that even the legendary few that were here 400 pages ago could have missed something. If there is a system that needs checking or a combination of game mechanics that needs exploiting let me know, I'll add it to my todo list.

Want to throw another theory out there. You could potentially hide something in a permit locked sector AND have it be accessible. If there was ONE non-permit locked system in the middle of the sector and ONE path of unlocked systems that lead to it, it would be pretty unlikely someone is going to just casually scroll over it and see that a system in the sector doesn’t require a permit. It at least adds up to the “a cobra can reach it” prerequisite.

If you have a particular permit locked region in mind let me know. I have my DBX fully gutted with 70+ jump range from when I was testing the BH in 27 Gamma Cassiopeiae. When it's supercharged it has a range of 297ly, maybe that's a requirement to get into an isolated system.
