By that logic the whole search should be disregarded seeing as everything else has produced the same results.
Hardly. I'm simply pointing out that the game dynamics, as a whole, either allow for something or they don't. There is no way in-game, currently, to "jump through" a stellar body. The game doesn't allow for it. If you can't "do it" in-game then "it" can not be a way to find Raxxla.
