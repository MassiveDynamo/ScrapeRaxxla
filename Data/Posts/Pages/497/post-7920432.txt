Want to throw another theory out there. You could potentially hide something in a permit locked sector AND have it be accessible. If there was ONE non-permit locked system in the middle of the sector and ONE path of unlocked systems that lead to it, it would be pretty unlikely someone is going to just casually scroll over it and see that a system in the sector doesn’t require a permit. It at least adds up to the “a cobra can reach it” prerequisite.
