Anyway, obfuscated planets, just like stations which avoid detection, are not meant to be so easily detected. Imho.
I mean, I doubt Raxxla can be detected like any other celestial body. There must be something else to point us right to the hidden place.

Except
We don’t know what Raxxla is, even DB has said so!
It might be a planet, or a black hole, or a derelict megaship, or a station, or an asteroid, or a particularly elusive npc sidewinder or .........
All we know is that it’s obfuscated,
And I’m not sure about that any more!

And I do think we have some indication to where and what Raxxla is, my last remaining hypothesis......
Tyko’s on his way to test it.
