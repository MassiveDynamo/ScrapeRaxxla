If you look at the system map for about a minute, a strange morphing object pops out. This seem to exist in a layer between the star and the backgrund stars.
Itâ€™s best to start zoomed out, as it can fall behind the star otherwize.
I spent five minutes this evening fully zoomed-out watching the system map for the Star of India, whilst in-system. There were no changes at all.
In supercruise, I completed a circuit of the star at a distance of about 290 Ls in line with the Galactic Plane and another at close to right angles to it but I did not see any moving points, so I don't think there is anything hidden off the system map close to the star. I'm in my long range AspX, Orpheus, so I have a good field of view.
It will probably be a day or two before I reach V1357 Cygni, depending on how much time I can make to play this week.
