As I said. There may be one not yet discovered.
This thread is, also, meant to share experience. I think. That's not "shooting down" anyone's idea.
And there is only one legend, here. The Boss. (The psycho penguins don't count !)

It's not my intention to give offense or cause any drama, but when every idea is quoted in the next comment followed by "I remember back when we did that and found nothing, it's pointless" it might cause someone to abandon what could be a valuable lead. It seems counter productive, but perhaps I'm taking it too seriously. In any case I volunteer to follow up on any leads.
