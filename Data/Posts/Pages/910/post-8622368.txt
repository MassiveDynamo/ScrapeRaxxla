These ones are interesting... why put them in if you can't get there? (and why can't you at least see them without having to watch frame by frame on a recording)

There's supposed to be an extragalactic planet in there Hip 13044 B, but not searchable...
End game story line.....taking the fight to the goids home planet? Or a quirk of stella Forge.

Mind you, until FCs there were a good number of systems you couldn't get to
