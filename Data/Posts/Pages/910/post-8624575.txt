Yes, forgot to mention that. We had another commander doing the same thing. We suspect it related to some issues with FC though, seem if you follow a FC into the system the game doesn't detect you 'jumping'. You may have the Black Market (and other data) from a previous system.
You may have to jump out and back in again with your ship instead of your FC.

I just jumped in system and docked normally. Didn’t ride in with my FC. But that’s good info to know! I’ve jumped around a bit and it’s still there.

Also of note I have stolen cargo and such and both systems -LTT 11159 and LP 413-18 show that I have “illicit cargo” when jumping into system. Something that doesn’t happen with uninhabited systems
