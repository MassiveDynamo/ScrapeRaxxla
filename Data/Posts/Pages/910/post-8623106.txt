CMDR's, if it hasn't been flagged already (old and slow here...), something has come to light that you may all find of interest. That persistent rumour someone had already entered and left the system containing "Raxxla" apparently has a primary source claiming they heard MB say it in a Q&A at Lavecon in 2017.

Check out this CMDR Ascorbius video on twitch from about 20 minutes in...

[Edit: Note: I've already contacted them to query their video and they're adamant they heard MB say it.]

I did listen to that section again, but as far as I can tell Ascorbus only said that MB had said it at a Lavecon during a closed Q&A. Where does the Lavecon 2017 come from? I’m trying to tie down the specific date it was actually said. Sure it wasn’t Lavecon 2015?
