I dont have the ability to do this, But has anyone looked at the sounds from the FSD jump to see if they are they same when going in a particular direction?

Whitchspace seems to be a clue of sorts and i have noticed that the "whispers" are slightly different each time, I wonder if they might be the same, or if a particular sound wave
is more apparent when travelling in a direction.

NS whispers if you FSS target it. That only 1 I heard so far.
I've done quite extensive audio analytics while I've been playing. Not so much popping out. The 'wooshing' sound while in jump have had nothing in the past, mostly it's the ship noise that pops things into the audio gram but it's just random noises.

I have to admit I've listened to many sounds, celestial objects, ship computers, background radio traffic and much more.
Bonus is that I've learned how limpets speak now, so perhaps we should continue the convo in Limpet?
