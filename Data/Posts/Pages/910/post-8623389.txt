Its in the Turning the Wheel thread I think Jorki. But theres 3 separate sources originally saying 3 separate dates, still 2+, one saying LaveCon 2017 and the other saying they didnt attend that so must have been elsewhere, plus the streamer. Theres bits all over the place, its only when you get it all together you see the gaping holes in it that just stands out as being urban myth and false memories. Its amazing what the brain can do.

Are we seriously saying we have 'found' systems on the GalMap that cant be 'found' by searching for them? Incredible if I understood that right. What happens if within 20LY of them or cant we get within 20LY for NavPanel? Im not saying one of them is Raxxla but theres something going on either way (bugged?)
