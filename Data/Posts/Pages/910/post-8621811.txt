I dont have the ability to do this, But has anyone looked at the sounds from the FSD jump to see if they are they same when going in a particular direction?

Whitchspace seems to be a clue of sorts and i have noticed that the "whispers" are slightly different each time, I wonder if they might be the same, or if a particular sound wave
is more apparent when travelling in a direction.
NS whispers if you FSS target it. That only 1 I heard so far.
