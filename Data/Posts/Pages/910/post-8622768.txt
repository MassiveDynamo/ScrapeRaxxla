Raw thoughts and speculation: been thinking about those "dark systems" and how, if they exist, it might mean they're hidden by Universal Cartographics.
Taking the reasoning in reverse, if this was the case, then how would they be "unlocked" in-game? Technically, could there be a mechanism that would allow some systems to appear on a cmdr's map but not on others? I guess it's feasible.
What could be the process to unlock them? A reward for the execution of missions or tasks? Offered by which entity? The visit of specific places (maybe in some specific order or at a specific time) that somehow triggers something? Interaction with specific objects? Combat against a particular faction?
In short: if something needs to be unlocked in this game, what can we expect the process to be?
