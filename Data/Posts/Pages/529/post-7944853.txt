If DrewW wrote the logs, without FDev intervention, then it means that the witchspace whispers concept doesn't have anything to do with Raxxla or TDW. Whoever then wrote the Codex just thought it sounded cool in the toast - like all the rest of it.
I don't quite understand tour thinking. Take this VERY hypothetical timeline:

1) DW & FD agree on the novel and FD ask for it to be based in the rift (Knowing R is there)
2) DW OR FD write the logs (although I would strongly assume this was FDev anyway)
3) The in-game story plays out
4) We fail to find R
5) FDev write the toast, pointing us back to the Rift

Why would it matter who wrote the logs? Im suggesting the logs themselves were not necessarily a clue to Raxxla, but when the Codex was written, FDev thought to themselves "How can we point them back to the rift? Ah! We will point them to the logs..."
