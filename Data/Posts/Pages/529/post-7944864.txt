I don't quite understand tour thinking. Take this VERY hypothetical timeline:

1) DW & FD agree on the novel and FD ask for it to be based in the rift (Knowing R is there)
2) DW OR FD write the logs (although I would strongly assume this was FDev anyway)
3) The in-game story plays out
4) We fail to find R
5) FDev write the toast, pointing us back to the Rift

Why would it matter who wrote the logs? Im suggesting the logs themselves were not necessarily a clue to Raxxla, but when the Codex was written, FDev thought to themselves "How can we point them back to the rift? Ah! We will point them to the logs..."

That timeline leans very strongly on two assumptions:

1. There are clues
2. FDev want us to find Raxxla soon

It also takes as a starting point the idea that FD wanted to entangle the only two mysteries in the game at release - which makes absolutely no sense to me.
