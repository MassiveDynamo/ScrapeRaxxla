Can you explain your reasoning here?

If you have two big mysteries in the game, why would you deliberately try to entangle them to the extent that both end up getting solved at once? It's not like FDev have been continually adding storylines so that there will always be something for players to try to solve. In addition, it relies on the fact that FDev put both their mysteries in the same area in the first place, which to me makes no sense. It's a huge galaxy, so why cram everything together?
There was never really a big frift mystery. It was really just an easter egg, from Drewâ€™s book.
Players made it a big mystery. Drew and FD just tried to keep up.
