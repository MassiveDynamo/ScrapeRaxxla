I totally get your point. I honestly do, and I certainly wouldn't have done this myself, if I were FDev...But read the logs and then TDW toast!

Edit: Could it be because the two are intrinsically linked? For example, the club being the twisted men

Okay, that makes sense, but just remember that DrewW doesn't know any more about Raxxla than the rest of us - so the question that needs to be answered is did DrewW create the Exodus logs, or were they provided by FDev?

If it's DrewW, then we can discount any direct tie in between the logs and the toast. If they came from FDev then yeah, there's the potential for a connection between them. From posts made around the time of the log discovery, I always got the impression they were DrewW's work - but I could be wrong.

Edit:
Also - there's witchspace weirdness reported in one of the Conflux logs. Although that could easily be FDev putting the logs in the wrong place.
