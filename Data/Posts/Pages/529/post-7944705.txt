Can you explain your reasoning here?

If you have two big mysteries in the game, why would you deliberately try to entangle them to the extent that both end up getting solved at once? It's not like FDev have been continually adding storylines so that there will always be something for players to try to solve. In addition, it relies on the fact that FDev put both their mysteries in the same area in the first place, which to me makes no sense. It's a huge galaxy, so why cram everything together?
I totally get your point. I honestly do, and I certainly wouldn't have done this myself, if I were FDev...But read the logs and then TDW toast!

Edit: Could it be because the two are intrinsically linked? For example, the club being the twisted men
