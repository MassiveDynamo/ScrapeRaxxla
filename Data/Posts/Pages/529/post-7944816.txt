If I have my timelines right, the Codex came well after the Rift mystery. To me, that means Drew needed no involvement at all. My hypothesis is, when FDev created the Codex entry, they worded it based on the pre-existing logs, that were already in the Rift. Basically, we didn't find it when we were meant to, so they gave us a nudge. See what I mean?

If DrewW wrote the logs, without FDev intervention, then it means that the witchspace whispers concept doesn't have anything to do with Raxxla or TDW. Whoever then wrote the Codex just thought it sounded cool in the toast - like all the rest of it.
