I can't just imagine FD putting Raxxla in/near the Rift and then telling DW to write a story unfolding there but without touching Raxxla...
Or can I ? Oh yes, after all I can. They even could have done all this expressely...
"This area of space is freaking me out. Could have sworn I heard some weird voices in the last jump."
"The lights in witch-space are coming for me, the lights… always the lights… they’re calling to me… a siren song… I must join them…"
"It’s an apt name, some of the guys are going space crazy out here in the void."
Any of this sound familiar from a RAXXLA perspective. I think I'm going to postpone my trip around the rim and head out there. I think that there is a good chance we were meant to find Raxxla during the Rift mystery.

EDIT: Whispers in witch space. Sirens in the Void. Club/Rift mystery aside - WHY is this not our primary objective for investigation into Raxxla. Yes, I know there will be no clues, but this is a pretty big one, if you ask me! Or specifically, the codex entry is telling us we missed Raxxla when we were in the Rift!

Is this not a tiny bit obvious, so we know what we are doing???
