Okay, that makes sense, but just remember that DrewW doesn't know any more about Raxxla than the rest of us - so the question that needs to be answered is did DrewW create the Exodus logs, or were they provided by FDev?

If it's DrewW, then we can discount any direct tie in between the logs and the toast. If they came from FDev then yeah, there's the potential for a connection between them. From posts made around the time of the log discovery, I always got the impression they were DrewW's work - but I could be wrong.

Edit:
Also - there's witchspace weirdness reported in one of the Conflux logs. Although that could easily be FDev putting the logs in the wrong place.

If I have my timelines right, the Codex came well after the Rift mystery. To me, that means Drew needed no involvement at all. My hypothesis is, when FDev created the Codex entry, they worded it based on the pre-existing logs, that were already in the Rift. Basically, we didn't find it when we were meant to, so they gave us a nudge. See what I mean?
