'There will be no clues'. Makes absolutely no sense to me. Just because they said it doesn't mean they can't/won't change their minds.

Do you have kids? As a parent, saying one thing that you definitely mean, followed later by changing your mind or doing something you said wasn't going to happen is a really big part of life. to just faithfully assume that they will never go back on anything they've ever said is also seeming like nonsense to me. It isn't like they're contractually obligated to never leave clues.
