Styx would be quite close to MB’s “that’s a journey we all must make”. The journey through life to death....

But the lore says Raxxla was found much earlier, so not so sure it has to be all that close to the bubble.

Edit: sigh. Jorki’s docked in Rohini & Tyko’s mooching around near Altera’s Eye. Do I really want a second clone to investigte the bubble? With all that roads to riches & ship engineering effort
Meh!

Does Styx (or any of the other bubble systems) fit the Codex toast? Omphalos? Astrophel & Stella? As well as “journey we all must make” etc?

I think the E/F missions were “obfuscation on the outer rim”- “SD thrumpberry juice deliveries” and FD took them out because of all the salt farmed after the Salomé event; they didn’t want that level of adverse publicity over Raxxla.

Hmm... strictly speaking the lore doesn't say Raxxla was found. It just says that the myth/legend existed. Given that the comparison given is with other places for which the myth existed, but hadn't been found (because they couldn't be as they didn't actually exist), I think we'd be on risky ground going from 'myth exists' to definitively 'was found'. Not least because it would lead us to disregard mechanisms that we know exist in the Elite Dangerous universe for a myth to start without the thing actually being found.
