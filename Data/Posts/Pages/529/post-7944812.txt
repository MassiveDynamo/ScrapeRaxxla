Yes, I've read all the logs. I've also been out to the Hawkins Gap and Formidine Rift sites, but I only started playing after the rift mystery was solved, so no, please dont cut to the chase!
Have PM'd you the rest just in case anyone else who's reading and wasn't there at the time wants to join in.
