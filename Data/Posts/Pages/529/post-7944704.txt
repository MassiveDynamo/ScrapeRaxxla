Just had a read back through the dynasty expedtion logs, and yeah there's some interesting stuff there which I'd largely forgotten about.

There is a reason for that though. So what I think needs to be borne in mind is the sequence in which events at the time should have happened, but didn't (due to a CTD bug).

Want to actually recreate it slightly for dramatic effect? If so, what needs to be done is to imagine the Dynasty Expedition sites being discovered, then read all the logs, and then imagine a lot of speculation about what they were all about and the general sense of foreboding in them.

Not sure if you've done that already but let me know when you have and I'll post the next part.

(Just trying to do this in a way that'll provide you with a little taste of the experience that everyone should have got but didn't. Feel free to just tell me to cut to the chase. )

Yes, I've read all the logs. I've also been out to the Hawkins Gap and Formidine Rift sites, but I only started playing after the rift mystery was solved, so no, please dont cut to the chase!
