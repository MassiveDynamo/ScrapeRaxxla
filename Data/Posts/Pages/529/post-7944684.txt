Any of this sound familiar from a RAXXLA perspective. I think I'm going to postpone my trip around the rim and head out there. I think that there is a good chance we were meant to find Raxxla during the Rift mystery.

EDIT: Whispers in witch space. Sirens in the Void. Club/Rift mystery aside - WHY is this not our primary objective for investigation into Raxxla. Yes, I know there will be no clues, but this is a pretty big one, if you ask me! Or specifically, the codex entry is telling us we missed Raxxla when we were in the Rift!

Is this not a tiny bit obvious, so we know what we are doing???

Just had a read back through the dynasty expedtion logs, and yeah there's some interesting stuff there which I'd largely forgotten about.

There is a reason for that though. So what I think needs to be borne in mind is the sequence in which events at the time should have happened, but didn't (due to a CTD bug).

Want to actually recreate it slightly for dramatic effect? If so, what needs to be done is to imagine the Dynasty Expedition sites being discovered, then read all the logs, and then imagine a lot of speculation about what they were all about and the general sense of foreboding in them.

Not sure if you've done that already but let me know when you have and I'll post the next part.

(Just trying to do this in a way that'll provide you with a little taste of the experience that everyone should have got but didn't. Feel free to just tell me to cut to the chase. )
