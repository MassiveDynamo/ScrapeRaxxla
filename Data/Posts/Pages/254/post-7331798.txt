... and going down all along to 8 ? (Carcosa, Aldebaran <= anything to do with Berenice ?, nah .. Taurus.. near the Sisters)

I have really no idea what 8 is. I have trouble seeing which parts belongs to which creature.

I think the entire bottom section is som kind of Tartarus, as the victims there are all angels(fallen). This is in contrast to section 4, where the inhabitants are regular people. This would then be Hades/Hell.

If so, the 8 might be the Typhoon.
