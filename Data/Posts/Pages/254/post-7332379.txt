Could be, but it does not sound like it's news. It's presented more like a rumor that is well known, but never confirmed.

By the way, there used to be a constellation in the southern sky, called Siren.

The four stars on her head(next to Crux), is possibly the Diamond Cross asterism. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Cross

The diamond shape with a cross is used on the gate in MBs tattoo.

The Siren would have been placed on the edge of the Coalsack nebula.

A bit obscure, even for this thread.

Quite possibly that's the one.
