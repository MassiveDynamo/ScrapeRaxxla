Could be, but it does not sound like it's news. It's presented more like a rumor that is well known, but never confirmed.

By the way, there used to be a constellation in the southern sky, called Siren.

The four stars on her head(next to Crux), is possibly the Diamond Cross asterism. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Cross

The diamond shape with a cross is used on the gate in MBs tattoo.

The Siren would have been placed on the edge of the Coalsack nebula.

A bit obscure, even for this thread.

Great work. Obscure maybe but who knows.

On my way back to bubble, I'll swing past there and rescan that area. Coalsac was one of my first trips - back in the day and I seem to recall there's a few stars in there as opposed to other dark sectors. Always meant to return there and map it properly but never did.

Loving all this tin foil, it provides so many reasons to head out and explore.
