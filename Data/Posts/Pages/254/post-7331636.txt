Anyone tried bringing one to formidine rift?
Where woud it point from there?

They have been brought to every corner of the galaxy. FRift, Sag A, Beagle point, Conflux and Hawkins Gap.

They always point to Merope.

I also think the toast of TDW predates UAs and UPs with quite a bit.

The UA and UP do however have a distortion field around them, that is similar to what we see when we enter/exit hyperspace/supercruise. This could indicate that they hover on the edge of frame shift?
