Another thought....Maybe we need to start looking for a black hole that sings? Find a black hole that emits some form of "sound" to analyze? it's a stretch, but would line up with the "siren of the deepest void". Can't get cmdr Guru's post out of my head, regarding Maia's BH. If still taking that line literally instead of following the Lyre theory, maybe take an audio sample from the new FSS scanner?

If anyone found raxxla, you think they'd keep it a secret from the rest of us, to keep the hunt going and laugh at whatever absurd theories we have on this thread?

Grabbing more tinfoil.

It's a nice idea about FSS spectrum sounds.
Personally, most siren-like sounds are emitted by diffrent gas giants.
I know those sounds were taken from reallife data, but it doesnt mean devs didn't tamper with it.

As for finding and not telling - don't think so. Though it is possible, depending on what Raxxla really is. If it's just some surface based ruins, or a derelict Megaship with some log-files, one could've not even bothered with telling anyone.
If it is something huge - don't think it could be hidden if found by anyone.

I'll records those and put them through spectrum analyzer. And i'll try to do the same with some BH and Neutron in Formadine rift (in case i find one there, closest BH was in H&S Nebula).

Speaking of, I've had some of these odd hyperspace jumps recently, all in a fairly contained bit of space... coincidence?



Looks like a gateway to me!

Happens some times. To me it looks like a visual bug, but who knows.
