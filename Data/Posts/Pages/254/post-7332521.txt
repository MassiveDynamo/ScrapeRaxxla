May I ask a my noobish question? It is good mystery, so I started to read this topic. Was there some investigation of the picture from DW Codex title? I mean that star, planet and part of station. May be someone checked sizes and proportions for star and planet? Star class? Distances?

If it is old picture, sorry. I think people still looking for the true DW station as a trail to Raxxla.
