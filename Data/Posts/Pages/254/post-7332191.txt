Going back to the old adage of "a player has jumped through but didn't investigate", and basing it on the assumption that A) they honked the system and B) cashed in that honk:

Is there a way to search EDSM for a list of all systems that have only ever had one player go through them with a basic system scan? That might help narrow the field somewhat...

EDSM is filled by players that upload data.
So if that person didn't use any tools that uploads data - it might be not on EDSM at all.

They have been brought to every corner of the galaxy. FRift, Sag A, Beagle point, Conflux and Hawkins Gap.

They always point to Merope.

I also think the toast of TDW predates UAs and UPs with quite a bit.

The UA and UP do however have a distortion field around them, that is similar to what we see when we enter/exit hyperspace/supercruise. This could indicate that they hover on the edge of frame shift?

Actually we have no info on when that toast was written, it has no links to any timeframe.
As far as tinfoily ideas goes - that Artice as a whole could be secretly written by TRDW (the real dark wheel) member in such puzzling way, that on the one hand - it goes through with approval by anyone who censored the articles before submitting, but still giving clues to someone with eyes to see.
In which case that toast might have been written like a couple of months ago ingame time.
