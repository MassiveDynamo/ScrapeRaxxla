Actually we have no info on when that toast was written, it has no links to any timeframe.
As far as tinfoily ideas goes - that Artice as a whole could be secretly written by TRDW (the real dark wheel) member in such puzzling way, that on the one hand - it goes through with approval by anyone who censored the articles before submitting, but still giving clues to someone with eyes to see.
In which case that toast might have been written like a couple of months ago ingame time.

Could be, but it does not sound like it's news. It's presented more like a rumor that is well known, but never confirmed.

By the way, there used to be a constellation in the southern sky, called Siren.

The four stars on her head(next to Crux), is possibly the Diamond Cross asterism. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Cross

The diamond shape with a cross is used on the gate in MBs tattoo.

The Siren would have been placed on the edge of the Coalsack nebula.
SPOILER

A bit obscure, even for this thread.
