Speaking of all the sirens, I've been thinking. Was there anyone who did any research into the sound of witchspace? I know that majority of time (if not all the time) it sounds pretty much the same, but what if (grab more tinfoil) we get a bunch of witchspace sound recordings from all across the bubble / galaxy and overlap them? Maybe there's something noticeable in there? Process of elimination.
If Raxxla is supposed to be this big gateway, portal or whatever to some new land, could it be that it leaves an effect or a ripple in witchspace?
