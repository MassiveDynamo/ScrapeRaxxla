Another thought....Maybe we need to start looking for a black hole that sings? Find a black hole that emits some form of "sound" to analyze? it's a stretch, but would line up with the "siren of the deepest void". Can't get cmdr Guru's post out of my head, regarding Maia's BH. If still taking that line literally instead of following the Lyre theory, maybe take an audio sample from the new FSS scanner?

If anyone found raxxla, you think they'd keep it a secret from the rest of us, to keep the hunt going and laugh at whatever absurd theories we have on this thread?

Grabbing more tinfoil.

Just a thought, but Siren of the deepest void could be a UA or UP.....
