I suggest checking the video from the game folder like Han Zen suggested. When I did, there was a point where Barnard and Witchhead looked a little clearer. Unfortunately, it didn't show up as well when I tried to screenshot it.

Yes, I did (thanks Han_Zen!) & had the same problem; but it does seem clearer than my Shadowplay recording so I've deleted that from Imgur & will update my post about it.

Yes, my mistake, I have a streaming cold & not functioning on all cylinders. Rigel is indeed visible from aways! https://imgur.com/a5EkUDY
