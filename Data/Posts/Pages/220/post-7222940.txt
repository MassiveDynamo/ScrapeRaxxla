I got it up this is just your enhanced picture with what I'm sure must be Rigel circled in red.

Had a look. it’s about in the place that Rigel would be, but I don’t think it is; Rigel isn’t bright enough at the distance needed to give that size & aspect angle of BLoop & Witchhead, it’s not even visible from Dahan. I think those bright stars around BLoop and Witchhead are fairly close to the viewing position, and will move in relative position very quickly as the viewer’s position changes- makes finding the right spot a bit of a b*****!
