You are probably right again.

I have some new tinfoil brewing. Iâ€™ll post after release, to avoid spoilers on the codex stuff.

At the risk of being pedantic, has anyone been to SYNUFE EN-H D11-28, EOL PROU PH-V D22 B 6, or EOL PROU DA-V D2-256? Or would those be too obvious places to go looking for anything new? (Or has the stuff being shown in the latest trailer at those locations already been found before this update?).
