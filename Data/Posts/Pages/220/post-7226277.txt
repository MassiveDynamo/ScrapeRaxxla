So both Raxxla and Cass A have been "lost "...
mmmh...

Jaiotu will probably remember the details, but I seem to remember that Michael Brookes said Cass A wasn’t in game for a very mundane reason- think it wasn’t in the star catalogues they used to build the galaxy?

why TDW lost Raxxla is indeed a mystery. Perhaps there’s a mindwiping energy field there?
oh no, if I find it I’ll forget everything!
hang on, who are you?
who am I?
