When I looked at Rigel from the far side of the bubble, it was still the brightest star in that part of the skybox. Don't forget that there are stars in the video do move. (Suggesting that POV is changing, or that this is a composite. If it's the latter, then the endeavour of finding the view certainly is pointless).

I'm pretty certain that one doesn't. (I can't check the video on my phone, it won't load).

I’ll check it again later today!
It may be a composite, that’s what I meant by FD possibly “fixing” the sizes & aspect of BLoop & Witchhead, though I’m not convinced yet on that; I find it difficult to judge the aspect of BLoop with all the obscuration in the video. What makes me wonder is the mysterious feature “B” that I annotated- it looks like a small dark nebula in the video but floats up from between the horns/wings of the Elite symbol to finish just to the top right of feature “A” & I can’t match it to any of the nebulae listed by Dr Kaii, nor anything else I can see in the galmap. I’m wondering if it is actually something else which FD have obscured to make the image harder to decode; it seems too definite to be artificial, if you know what I mean (sorry, may not be making sense, in the last 6 weeks I’ve had 3 weeks of flu, trapped nerve in my neck, torn shoulder muscles, & I’ve now got a second stinking cold...I need a good night’s sleep & some sunshine!). It may e that the image was constructed without the distance cut off that we suffer in galmap so things may be visible that we wouldn’t see, & maybe vice versa. In any case it wouldn’t necessarily make the image incorrect, I still think Raxxla’s system is the G type system between the horns/wings.
