i dont have much to go one, and i have only been looking into raxxla in passing for the past yearish. Some things stand out to me though, and im sure they've been discussed before, but because this thread is 300 pages long, i dont exactly have time to sift through all of it. just some thoughts...

Thargoid connection: The star map of the other galaxy in the thargoid base. Could this be where raxxla leads, or one of the many places it leads? is it possible the thargoids came from raxxla? if this is the case, its more than likely that raxxla is in the FRift. But that doesnt work with the "obvious" attribution that has been given by the devs. which is my next thought. This would also fit with what we learned in Reclamation when it's hinted that raxxla is beyond the FRift.

if it really is obvious, we can assume as many have said before that its probably inside the bubble, or damn near. I think we need to figure out a way to make a checklist of all the systems in the bubble, and begin systematically crossing them off the list. if this has already begun, please point me to where i can help.

now a couple questions:
Are we sure there are no more missions from the dark wheel that may have slipped through the cracks?
Are there are discord groups dedicated to the hunt?
As obvious as it sounds, are we sure we have fully explored Sol?
Finally, where the heck do we start? blindly searching systems without ANYTHING to go off of seem futile. theres no way that our current methodology is going to get us any result.
