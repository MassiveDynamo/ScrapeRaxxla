Had a look. it’s about in the place that Rigel would be, but I don’t think it is; Rigel isn’t bright enough at the distance needed to give that size & aspect angle of BLoop & Witchhead, it’s not even visible from Dahan. I think those bright stars around BLoop and Witchhead are fairly close to the viewing position, and will move in relative position very quickly as the viewer’s position changes- makes finding the right spot a bit of a b*****!

When I looked at Rigel from the far side of the bubble, it was still the brightest star in that part of the skybox. Don't forget that there are stars in the video do move. (Suggesting that POV is changing, or that this is a composite. If it's the latter, then the endeavour of finding the view certainly is pointless).

I'm pretty certain that one doesn't. (I can't check the video on my phone, it won't load).
