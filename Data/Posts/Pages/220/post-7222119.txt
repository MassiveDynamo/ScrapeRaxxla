Hello all, I have been lurking this thread for a while. When the update drops, I am setting off to search for Raxxla. I wanted to thank you guys for all the useful information.

I play on XB1 and I am planning on starting a squadron called "The Wild Hunt" for like-minded XB1 players, unless fellow from this thread are already on XB1.
