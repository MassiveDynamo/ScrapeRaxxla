OK its gone past my bedtime - bleary eyed after days - weeks in Barnards Loop - I'm here for the journey; I don't give two hoots who finds Raxxla, frack I hope it never gets found. But here's a bottom of the rum bottle bit of tin-foilery, not sure if its been discussed but... Cassiopeia!

"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies"
Cassiopeia...
"The parents grief"
Heart...
"The lovers woe"
Soul...
Heart and Soul nebulas are in Cassiopeia.

Now it just so happens these guys are on my to-do list of exploration. No idea where to start. I don't expect it to be in Cassiopeia but a star in that area / near the H&S nebula...

In fact I think there was a big operation to find Cassiopeia A but its not in game...or is it?

Its a long shot but its a simple analysis of the Dark Wheel toast...just question of finding the right star from this perspective that's close to the brow of Cas and H&S?

Is it too far outside the bubble? Not much 8-9,000 ly but its a bearing to stear by and I'm itching for the deep.

Edit: Constellations may be far apart as seen from Sol, Cas A sector could be something or its a lot closer to home / just along that declination.

Next time I get chance to dry-dock I'll repair get some limpets an SRV and toddle off.
