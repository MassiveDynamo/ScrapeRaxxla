I'm not so certain. I'm not convinced this opening is anything related to Raxxla, but as I currently have no other plans in game, in at willing to help. Also, ruling something out is generally a step forward as well.

Has anyone been following this thread:

I only ask, because I had a dream about 3.3 going live last night (yes I'm ill atm). In it, that thing from the trailer was found very quickly by dinner other commander. I went to visit the location and it showed up as a "mysterious portal". It didn't seem to be Raxxla itself, but the other end if a portal from Raxxla. Then it led me to a field of wooden chests (felt rather like a Zelda game then) filled with gold.

I really need to stop reading the forum before going to sleep. It's like the one I had where I was attacked in a hyperspace jump around 2.0 when hyperdictions weren't yet a thing. Perhaps Han Zen can remember.

I'll be dreaming about gormaganders next.

You are probably right again.

I have some new tinfoil brewing. Iâ€™ll post after release, to avoid spoilers on the codex stuff.
