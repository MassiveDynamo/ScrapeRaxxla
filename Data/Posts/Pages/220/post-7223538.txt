Hello all, I have been lurking this thread for a while. When the update drops, I am setting off to search for Raxxla. I wanted to thank you guys for all the useful information.

I play on XB1 and I am planning on starting a squadron called "The Wild Hunt" for like-minded XB1 players, unless fellow from this thread are already on XB1.

Hi. I'm also on XB1, and on a mission to get my CMDR's name in the lore. Normally this happens when one makes a "major" discovery in game (like finds a previously undiscovered Gen Ship for example). However, when the 3.3 update drops i will have a golden opportunity to physically "map" my into the lore. I have already positioned my ship around this chosen world. Anyway just thought i'd share (and no its not Raxxla. But it IS famous).
