Hello all, I have been lurking this thread for a while. When the update drops, I am setting off to search for Raxxla. I wanted to thank you guys for all the useful information.

I play on XB1 and I am planning on starting a squadron called "The Wild Hunt" for like-minded XB1 players, unless fellow from this thread are already on XB1.

Fly safe 07

On a completely unrelated - but somewhat tangential - note, last night, whilst trying to dock on the Damask Rose, an NPC named "Big Al" was hogging the large pad...in Open. Getting pad hogged by an NPC in Open...such is life, Pozzo. He seemed unable...to depart.

So then I checked my subb'ed threads and saw your post and was all like, "It's you! The pad hogging NPC from last night! Why I oughta...." and then I realized that Mike isn't spelled "A" "L." And then I thought, "What makes NPC's do what humans do?" And then I got into a weird headspace and questioned most of my morning's decisions.

Also, still haven't found Raxxla.
