Yeah, but if you did ask him, do you think he'd say "Well no, there's no way for you to find it, and you've been wasting your time for the last 5 years" even if that was the case?
I would just be okay with either a yes or no. To be totally honest, however, I expect there to be no reply at all. I mean, that would be a hint, and Mike Brookes said that there would be none.

However, what I'm trying to figure out, is that "but I think you'd have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious so people know what they're doing." part of the quote.
