Yeah, I was thinking more to something like "Hey guys ! I am a member of TDW now and their station is ...., their current ops are.. , I was given ... mission, etc.
I bet only YTubers and "Influencers" under NDA will ever be invited to TDW and land on Raxxla.
EDIT: No, sorry, what I really think is that all that Raxxla and TDW mumbo jumbo... is just fluff.
Hear that:
" 2014: we know why Raxxla hasn't already be found "
" 2018: what a silly question! Of course. " (What a silly answer !)
Just look at Will's (?) face, while he thinks "Am I going to loose my job because I didn't filter the incoming questions on the chat ? "
Come ooooon !
I tell you Raxxla left ED when MB was put aside and the E/F missions taken off. (< Macros' fault ! ) FD never answered to dozens of posts asking: "Why?".
EDIT-re: Actually they did! "Aw, they should be there, actually. I am going to look into that."
Was at the times of the 2.1 patch, iirc.
ED is a sandbox. A sandbox with a beautiful Stellar Forge but just a sandbox. (You aren't allowed to build sand castles, though.)
Every attempt to give some depth to it ended out somewhere between "..meh.." and " total disaster".
PewPew works pretty well, though !
