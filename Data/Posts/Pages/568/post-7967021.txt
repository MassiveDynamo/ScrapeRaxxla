just a little two cents.

"everyone has to travel for themselves"

this specific sentence makes me think that raxxla must be a unique thing for every everyone. it is not a shared thing between players in the same universe. only you, can find raxxla for yourself, in your own journey. and when you find it, nothing else changes for anyone else, but you.

it also could mean that, everyone should be capable of finding raxxla for themselves, without any exterior help. wich hints that it is not hidden by some complex math puzzles, or complicated mechanics that only a set few can solve. the difficulty of finding it is at reach of everyone. since "everyone should be able to find it for themselves". some type of "hidden under your nose" kind of puzzle.

i realise this leads no where. but hey.

I took it to mean that when I find Raxxla and give you the coordinates, you won't simply be able to travel there directly - you'll need to make the whole journey yourself.

At it's simplest interpretation, Raxxla is permit-locked.
