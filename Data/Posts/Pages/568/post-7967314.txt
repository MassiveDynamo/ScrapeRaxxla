SD is just a facade we were told. The show goes on somewhat differently. Test, invite, etc... imho. Now, I can't imagine how it would be managed inside a game with thousands of players... I mean, there is a community. All the secrets of TDW would be revealed in no time.

the fact that they have changed the lore around it suggests its for a reason other than just plain background.
I don't think the lore has changed. Codex just adds alternatives.
