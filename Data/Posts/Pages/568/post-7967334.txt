SD is just a facade we were told. The show goes on somewhat differently. Test, invite, etc... imho. Now, I can't imagine how it would be managed inside a game with thousands of players... I mean, there is a community. All the secrets of TDW would be revealed in no time.

That somewhat depends on what it takes to trigger an invite from TDW. For example, if it's handing in UC data 1,000 HIP xxxxx systems you'd not necessarily know what it was that you'd done - especially if you'd just handed in 50 systems. It could be even further obfuscated by not triggering the invite until next time you'd logged in. Nobody would know what the trigger was and everyone would have to make the journey themselves. Obviously as more people pass the threshold it will be possible to figure it out, but it's not a case of once one person gets it everyone can.
