Perhaps a set of missions only 'unlockable' through certain conditions.

However our only way of having that were those Dark Wheel tip off missions that are currently no longer in the game, as per OP's current OP.

Something like that. If this is the case, then that leaves the following:
-Polaris
-The entirety of the Col 70 sector space
-The areas in and around the Horsehead nebula and Barnard's Loop regions
-Mingfu, Witch's Reach, HIP 22460 and others.
-Don't forget Lave 2, and finally Triton in Sol

Regor sector
Bovomit sector
All the other locked Col sectors apart from 70

Alternatively, it may be a system that doesn't show up on Galmap until you're told about it.

This is why I'm not looking for Raxxla. I'm looking for the key.
