just a little two cents.

"everyone has to travel for themselves"

this specific sentence makes me think that raxxla must be a unique thing for every everyone. it is not a shared thing between players in the same universe. only you, can find raxxla for yourself, in your own journey. and when you find it, nothing else changes for anyone else, but you.

it also could mean that, everyone should be capable of finding raxxla for themselves, without any exterior help. wich hints that it is not hidden by some complex math puzzles, or complicated mechanics that only a set few can solve. the difficulty of finding it is at reach of everyone. since "everyone should be able to find it for themselves". some type of "hidden under your nose" kind of puzzle.

i realise this leads no where. but hey.

Perhaps a set of missions only 'unlockable' through certain conditions.

However our only way of having that were those Dark Wheel tip off missions that are currently no longer in the game, as per OP's current OP.

I took it to mean that when I find Raxxla and give you the coordinates, you won't simply be able to travel there directly - you'll need to make the whole journey yourself.

At it's simplest interpretation, Raxxla is permit-locked.
Something like that. If this is the case, then that leaves the following:
-Polaris
-The entirety of the Col 70 sector space
-The areas in and around the Horsehead nebula and Barnard's Loop regions
-Mingfu, Witch's Reach, HIP 22460 and others.
-Don't forget Lave 2, and finally Triton in Sol
