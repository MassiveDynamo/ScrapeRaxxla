I took it to mean that when I find Raxxla and give you the coordinates, you won't simply be able to travel there directly - you'll need to make the whole journey yourself.

At it's simplest interpretation, Raxxla is permit-locked.
A portal could be a series of gates, in different systems.
Some old alien jump gate system or something?
Probably no real gate though. Just a hole in space. Raxxla is a ghost planet.
