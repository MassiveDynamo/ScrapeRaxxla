No station or other POI at HR 6001. From near the 8th moon, the gas giant and the star are both a decent match in terms of size to the image in the Codex, although the image in the Codex shows more detail on the star and the star appears more red than here. (The star is M2III and is over 51 solar radii and the gas giant is about 1 Kls away).
