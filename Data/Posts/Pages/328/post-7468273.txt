Thargoids appear in the FDEV sanctioned books, which are supposed to be canon.

Of course, but not in an "active" way.
I mean, in order to deal with Raxxla, we might be supposed to deal with the Thargs and antigravity in some manner...
What do we know about Tharg drives ? Are they "Newtonian" like ours ? And Raxxla ?
Anyway... just guessing.
