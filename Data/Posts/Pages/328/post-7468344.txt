He has everyone convinced that there is not going to be any clues what-so-ever in any of the books because Raxxla was 'strictly off-limits' to him. I am not saying he isn't a credible source, what I am saying is if he was cut from writing about Raxxla that is one thing, but he gave his position as if he were speaking for every 3rd party writer there ever was. I am not so sure that Drew has the power and/or knowledge to make such a call without confirming with other authors as well, that kind of statement would have to come from above him or from every writer.

Regardless lets suppose Drew is right and no one is allowed to touch Raxxla, there is still a way to write about Raxxla indirectly without directly referring to the planet or even know you are writing about Raxxla. For example: Suppose I am John Harper writing 'And Here the Wheel'. If I was told I could write about a super-weapon called 'Starburst' with suspected capabilities of blowing up a star, that in and of itself is not directly referring to Raxxla. However... If Raxxla is in a system where the star was exploded, turned into a blackhole, or Raxxla was turned into an asteroid belt, then said weapon is the key to unlocking Raxxla. I like Drew, he's a good guy, I just wish he wouldn't have made such a blanket statement convincing people there is nothing to Raxxla.
