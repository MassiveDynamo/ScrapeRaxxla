Of course, but not in an "active" way.
I mean, in order to deal with Raxxla, we might be supposed to deal with the Thargs and antigravity in some manner...
What do we know about Tharg drives ? Are they "Newtonian" like ours ? And Raxxla ?
Anyway... just guessing.
Out Of The Darkness has Thargoids in an active way. Unless by active you mean that things are told from a Thargoid perspective.
