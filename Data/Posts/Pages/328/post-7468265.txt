It had crossed my mind, but I have no evidence for it, that the Thargoids might be looking for Raxxla too and that was why they were in the Pleiades.. pure speculation, but one should ask why the big interest in that region by both major powers and the thargoids..
Hmm... that sounds a little bit like slipping over into seeing Raxxla everywhere and ignoring what's really there. Which is what they want.

There's various reasons for the Superpowers to be there. Primarily there's the presence of a very valuable resource - Meta-Alloys. There's also obviously military reasons to be there. All these start with the Thargoids.

The Thargoid presence goes back to the end of the first war, where they had left the seeds of their own return.

Why would they be in the Pleiades in the first place? Well Thargoids sow areas then return later. Other areas with Barnacles are the Witchhead and California Nebulas. Why Nebulae? Well that's open to speculation, but possibly it's down to deposition on surfaces of the molecules which compose the Nebula.

Anyway... The rumours have always been that it's Soontill the Thargoids were looking for, not Raxxla.
