Question for anyone who has managed to read the sonnets that may be related to the Raxxla codex entry. Taking a step back I think I’ve been looking at things too fragmentedly. Assuming Omphalos and Astrophel and the Spiriling Stars to be different clues.
The Omphalos Rift is said to be mentioned in several stories which seem to originate in an unnamed book that bares a resemblance to the children’s book “Princess Astrophel and the Spiriling Stars” (I think we often forget the Princess part, dunno if it’s significant tho.) so it would seem that we are to look for a mention of an item of significance, power, Magic etc within the works for a clue(s). Has anyone found mention of an item matching that description within the sonnets?
