The Omphalos stone is a stone. The Omphalos Rift is... a rift What is rift? The central rift? The central hole?

Being a structure/object of some kind I assume it’s something along the lines of stargate. Why it’s omphalos idk. Central to the planet? Sends you to a center? Central to the galmap? (Which would be sol which sits at coordnace 0:0:0) idk that part I really don’t have a clue on.
