Maybe not all know there is already thread focused to searching for the Dark Wheel station using Codex picture as main clue. We already did some work.

I like this thread about Raxxla for wonderful theories based on history, literature, old games. Often clever/studied theories I really enjoy to read all time But it is not how we do searching for the station using that Codex picture. It is just about brute force searching and routine. Of course if you can see something more from the Codex picture you are welcome. We need decrease number of candidate systems.

I like the work in the thread, CMDR. Link to the thread is now added to the OP.
