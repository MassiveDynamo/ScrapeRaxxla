What about Bohmshohm?

I’ve been looking into M Brookes Drabbles, in question that about Amun.

Now in game three particular Drabble systems seem to triangulate with a line of site from the Greek Fates and Norse Norns.

Along this line of sight are the system’s of Shamash and Amun.

Following a theme established by Robert Holdstock, I suspect the connection to be linked to Gilgamesh and thorns.

Amun briefly appears in the story of Gilgamesh; whose daughter Ishtar the counterpart of Inanna sets about destroying Gilgamesh with the bull of heaven…there is no Inanna in game but Ishtar is.

Drawing a line of site between Amun and Ishtar we not only go past Shibboleth, but end up at one of the ‘mountains’ systems Bohmshohm, which has the bodies Epirus and of Kailash.

Epirus historically was the home of the Dodona, the oldest oracle in Ancient Greece second only to that of Delphi! It’s literal translation is ‘terra firma’.

The Dodona is the oracle of the Dead on the Acheron River, familiar to the hero’s of Homers Odyssey, where Achilles prayed in the Lilad, it was also the oracle depicted in Philip Sidney ‘Arcadia’.

Kailash could be attributed to ‘mount Kailash’ the home of Lord Shiva and the navel of the universe!

What I find interesting is - if we draw a line of site between Bohmshohm and Axis Mundi, it intersects the triangle of the upper traid goddesses of the Morrigan, it also aligns far below with god Cernunnos.

Cernunnos is recognised in many modern neopagan religions as a god of nature, or of life, death, and rebirth. This I find intriguing because in Holdstock’s Ragthorn where he applied the same tripartite god theme, to hide a mystical secret, except he turned them into ‘male’ gods!
