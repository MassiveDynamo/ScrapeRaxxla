Remember Fdev didn't have to add Raxxla to the codex in 2018. There was tons of content, and people were largely thrilled with 'Beyond' and all it brought. Raxxla was a tiny, very, very unexpected part of something of a 'golden era' for game updates. Prior to the dark times of fleet carriers (shudders). (intonation: joking)

The only reason they did was because there was something to find, and they were giving us a truckload of hints towards it, presumably because it was already there and therefore 'free content', so why not hint towards it.

I think my theories on solving the Codex recently have been pretty solid (because they're basically not mine, I just strung together a bunch of good ideas from other folks!), and I wasn't really looking to link them to the Landscape Signal or anything else, it all just slotted into place extremely neatly.

There's something there to find.

I suspect that finding it is more complex than 'finding it', some sort of method, which is why it's not yet been found.
