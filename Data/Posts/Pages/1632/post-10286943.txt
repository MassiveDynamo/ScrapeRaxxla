I've been wondering about the 'an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven,’ quote too. Adding that to the codex 'for those with eyes to see' and the gauardian biology 'The colouration and structure of the eye indicates that not only they have keener vision than us, but they could also see a wider spectrum', it could be interesting.

Are there visual clues in the sky that we can't see because of the limited spectrum of human vision?
The sky would look very different to someone with a wider spectrum vision. Infrared vision would light up gas regions of space. Dark nebula would probably glow.
Ultraviolet vision would brighten high energy stars like WR and white dwarfs. When we see Gamma Velorum we mainly see the blue giant companion star but if we had UV vision, the WR star would out-shine it by far.

Our monitors aren't really capable of emitting either UV or IR light, so to see this we would need an in-game solution.

That's clever!

I wonder what would be a bright area in other spectrums then? I originally thought of some of the Nebula being quite bright (I know the ED view is already enhanced a bit), I wonder if there's a particular planetary nebula maybe that's very bright?
