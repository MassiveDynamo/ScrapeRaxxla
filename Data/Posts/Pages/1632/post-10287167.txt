I did my sound test, listening for over 30 mins whilst stationary in deep space with everything but life support turned off. The background music still played (though I had turned down the volume in case it obscured something very faint) but I heard nothing else once the ship had cooled down and the ice had formed on the canopy. I recorded it but it would be the most boring video of ED ever made so I'm not sure about putting it on YouTube, unless anyone asks. Oh well, it was worth a try!
XD I literally did this just yesterday myself too bahahaha, I was in Beagle Point, went out 200 000 ls, turned off everything I could, got too 7 degrees, and just listened for about 20min XD
Didn't hear anything peculiar, but still funny I did it too XD

Edit: well, I did hear some stuff, but I'm not sure it was anything, I didn't change any in-game sound settings, so I assume it was just my ship sounds, but it almost sounded like a machine language of some kind... whizing and whirling and beeping....
But yea, I'm sure that's normal for anyone with Space Madness XD
