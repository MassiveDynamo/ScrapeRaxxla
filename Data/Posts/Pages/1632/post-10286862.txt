Came across this in my notes. Worth reposting here IMO for those not familiar with it.

Michael Brookes said in the Elite: Dangerous Fiction Diary #1:


MB lists three "known sentient species" here:
1. Extinct Archenar Aliens (Mudlarks)
2. Alien artefact found on Mars
3. Thargoids

This was vid made before Guardians were discovered. Since we know that (1) is a known extinct, and (3) is currently menacing the bubble, then it's possible that (2) is Guardian, the only other sentient alien race yet discovered.

Having said that, if Brookes was writing this now in 3309 then he have #4 listed as Guardian.

But! I think this go a long way to showing that Brookes was thinking that the Martian artefact isn't Thargoid. So that does lean towards it's either Guardian or some (as yet) other unknown alien.

There might be more. My teams are out there right now. Ripping the map apart for clues that were ignored in the logs.
The AI supposedly wiped out its opposition. So we know that itâ€™s still out there because it was a newly birthed life form in its own right and had just achieved sentence.

This AI had a particular fondness for the exiles, who failed to be mentioned a century before the species goes extinct. So we believe they possibly survived, and started their own colony, using the hardware built for them by the AI.

We are also having trouble swallowing the extinction because

I like that idea, it does explain why human and guardian tech are so similar in so many ways. Retaining the 'best' technology for themselves would also explain how the PF managed to retain power for over 500 years!

I think too much time and effort was put into the Guardians for them to be simply a blueprint vendor. We have more lore on the Guardians than on almost any individual part of human society!

That's a good point. It's known that Michael Brookes was very into Lovecraftian horror though, and in that genre the default assumption underpinning everything is that there are unknowable alien intelligences that exist beyond anything we know, and that interacting with them is often the source of madness and/or death. I can imagine that he might like the idea of some powerful aliens that are god-like that have inadvertently or deliberately shaped humanity

That's a tough one. I think, for me, there's no direct evidence, but there's a lot of 'evidence by association' that there's been a lot of Guardian-Human interactions for a long time. As mentioned: our ship UI using the Guardian-style triangles when loading, how easily Ram Tah translated the Guardian Monolith Network, how easily Guardian tech integrates with our ships - this includes how we use the scanners to trigger Guardian tech to activate, the proximity of Guardian space to ours, the 'direction of travel' of the late-Guardian expansion pointing pretty much directly towards Sol, the similarity between Guardian biology and social structure to us, the relevance of the 'Guardian Story' to humanity, etc. etc.

The Guardians are so human-like even Ram Tah says they have very similar genetics to us!! At the height of Guardian civilisation humanity was just about entering the 'modern human' era of early evolution, it's possible that we were by Guardians at that point - as Jorki says, there are many homages to Clarke's 2001 in Elite games, and that's a central theme of that franchise.

What do you think? Is there anything that might be more solid proof?

True! The investigations on this thread and elsewhere over all these years by so many dedicated people have eliminated quite a lot though, and I think we're left with a relatively narrow range of solutions at this point. Sort of like panning for gold from a river - you have to get rid of that gold...

The is very handy as a starting point although you have to check source for accuracy, of course. The Pilot's Federation lore is entirely in the Shinrarta Dezhra system's tourist spots. The Dark Wheel Novella text can be found , though it's not cannon it's been shown many times that Fdev used it as inspiration for Elite Dangerous lore, the sections on Raxxla are very similar to the Raxxla Codex text. I also find the useful, and the actual (though not searchable). There's collated by the Children of Raxxla which has a lot of info on what's already been checked. contains a list of all known tourist beacons. The is very handy as an archive of past discoveries, including audio recordings and pictures.
