I did my sound test, listening for over 30 mins whilst stationary in deep space with everything but life support turned off. The background music still played (though I had turned down the volume in case it obscured something very faint) but I heard nothing else once the ship had cooled down and the ice had formed on the canopy. I recorded it but it would be the most boring video of ED ever made so I'm not sure about putting it on YouTube, unless anyone asks. Oh well, it was worth a try!
