That's clever!

I wonder what would be a bright area in other spectrums then? I originally thought of some of the Nebula being quite bright (I know the ED view is already enhanced a bit), I wonder if there's a particular planetary nebula maybe that's very bright?
Not sure but I think most planetary nebula are far more visible in the UV spectrum. The the gas in PNs is bright because it's ionized by UV radiation.

For Guardians with a wider specter, probably in both ends, they would see everything. Just in different colours.
