I am amused by this hypothesis, simply because FD for so many years has utilised ‘sound’ to convey an added layer to the game… why no ‘hidden’ visuals. A valid point.

We can alter the saturation of our monitors. It is possible to insert graphical elements into a game that the human eye may not normally perceive; not without for instance - ramping up gamma saturation etc, this can show certain background elements. Eg ‘black’ really isn’t black, its certain blocks of blue etc…

Pre-launch exploration was to involve some type of heat mapping analysis tool, like everything else got dropped.
