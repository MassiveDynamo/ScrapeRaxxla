The problem with such narratives which seem wholly reliable upon yet to be injected content is it identifies that Raxxla might be a narrative gate.

This has always been a possibility, sadly if accurate then it identifies that any searching for Raxxla is potentially ultimately fruitless, because for FD to utilise such a mechanism it would mean we could never truly find it, not without they’re direct actions. Eg it’s drip fed narrative.

The concept is then open to the possibility that the asset is not the ‘ultimate’ objective. It might be some small breadcrumb, but not the whole sandwich.

FD has gone on record to indicate they do use this method to inject their long running narratives. That elements can essentially ‘pop’ into existence over the course of days / weeks in areas of the game which previously were essentially empty.

It may be that Raxxla is such a narrative device and FD are waiting for us to read its first page. However, if a large proportion of the narrative is solely reliant upon that first step it makes that first step ‘valuable’. Which suggests that FD would really want us to find it, so they ought to have dropped some major hints, which they have not…

If the first step was valuable it being ignored over a wider narrative - in my opinion renders it inert and redundant.

It’s a matter of personal perspective but if this is part of some narrative structure I will probably stop playing. I do not like having the story handled down to us…

I however do strongly suspect what we’re currently uncovering is ‘architecture for an archeological’ narrative. A tangent narrative that now exists side by side their main narrative, made redundant when the missions were scrubbed. I don’t believe we were supposed to find these, and I suspect that FD probably didn’t know they were there…
