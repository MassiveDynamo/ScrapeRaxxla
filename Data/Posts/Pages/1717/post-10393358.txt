This is why it feels like it should be in the bubble. Especially when typical ranges were 7ly as opposed to the 68 an average explorer can grab.
I am going to go out on a limb and say preliminarily this reeks of - very hot garbage at that. Note the use of no less is permitted and not maximum or similar phrasing. Show me a method of limiting jumps to only 7 LY and you might have a viable case. Outside of that, we were already told WorldLink data was not reliable in terms of accuracy.

From Independent Raxxla Hunters discord:
Ben Ryder's Gateway

This is false.
This is a rumor that has been circulating for several years. Several researchers have read every available gaming magazine from the early 1990's and not only could we not find this post, there were only one or two mentions of Raxxla at all.
The format of this "tip-off" doesn't match any format we encountered. On top of this, this post says Ben Ryder went missing, but was also in Tionisla.

Additionally, in Orrere there is Herald article message to a Ben (Ryder) signaling distress that leads to a crashed anaconda. The in-service date for the anaconda is 2856. Make of that what you will. This combined with data from TDW novella seems to imply that the Ryders were filthy rich.

Relevant text from TDW novella:
Let’s be clear about trading. Trading between worlds is no game for a youngster with ideas of getting rich quick. You can spend a lifetime carrying food, machinery and textiles, and at the end of that life you’ll have enough saved up to buy a patch of coastal land on an Earth-type world, and spend the rest of your days in quiet, isolated comfort.

That’s all.
...
For his part, Alex Ryder would need a lot more convincing. He was a tall, fair-haired young man, wiry and athletic. He was atmo-surfing champion on the Ryder’s homeworld, Ontiat, and very bright. Like all young men of his age he was reluctant to switch his status from that of student to professional, with all that that meant in terms of settling with one particular girl, one job, and beginning to plan for when, eventually, he would buy his own land.

He still had a year to decide, a year of surfing, free-fall baseball, cloud barbecues, hi-falling, partner selection and SimCombat.
