Is raxxla a thing in this elite? or is it just mere speculation, and if it has been discovered is it permit locked?

But I like it!
"a tiny little bit", even a micro bit!

Wonder if MB used that phrase to reflect back on that concept of Raxxla?
MB: DJTruthsayer [TIQ] Michael Brookes Lore interview 14May2016
DJT: Where is Raxxla?
MB: Where is Raxxla? ‚ÄùWell, It's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where at this stage, it's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves".
DJT: You have always said there will be no clues.
MB: "that is true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious just so that people know what they are doing, there is nothing to be revealed at this stage"
