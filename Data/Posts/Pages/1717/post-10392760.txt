That all seems very implausible, I think.

"SOONJI" breaks down into "SO ON JI" and "JI" isn't a digram used in the original Elite's galaxy naming algorithm (neither is "XX" of course).

The only version of the original Elite game with a ninth Galaxy accessible was the PC "Elite Plus" version ... but that came out in 1991

"Soontil" seems even less plausible to be mentioned since that only appeared in 2014's Elite Dangerous.

"Ben Ryder" was Alex Ryder's great-grandfather, who would have died long before the 3125 timescale mentioned in the article. The exact time period the original Elite took place in wasn't particularly nailed down until long after FE2 (1992) came out anyway

I can't actually find a "Micro Bit" computer magazine at all whereas putting "<name> magazine" into Google for any of the others of that period brings back wikipedia articles, archives, etc. The whole writing style seems "off" and badly edited, too, rather than something a print magazine might publish.


I doubt it's even genuine 1990s bad fanfic rather than a much later (2018ish?) backdated invention.
