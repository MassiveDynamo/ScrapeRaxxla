Actually. There is a much more important rumour that I'd like to raise again...
It’s alleged that DB was interviewed in an early livestream (when the ship’s scanner came in three grades, basic/intermediate/advanced) where someone asked him about Raxxla and the answer was:

DB: "- It would be more likely to reveal itself to a group of players."
Interviewer: "- How so?"
DB: "- If you are at the right place and you scan it enough..."
Interviewer: "- Advanced scanner or the basic one?"
DB: "- Basic scanning is enough."
Interviewer: "- But you have to be Elite..."
DB: "- You have to be Elite."

I think in the context that Raxxla may be hidden in a planetary ring that may be significant. I can't find the original source for this rumour, though I'm convinced first mention was in this thread. What niggles me is that I vaguely remember watching this livestream and it may be from before I started playing, or at the early stages of my personal journey, in 2015. But it clearly suggests being in the right location and scanning is required...what I can't understand is the reference to being Elite. Could mean it's in Shinrarta (but contradicted by the Paradise Lost-related clues), or maybe Raxxla is populated by hostile Elite npc?

So does anyone have the original source reference form this rumour?

Edit:
Apart from Cmdr koben's post, - he was the first to report it in this thread, just found his post
The Quest To Find Raxxla
I see from the latest newsletter that there is to be a livestream (16th?) to celebrate 5 years of the game. DB will almost certainly be involved; now is the time to polish the question set! They need to be short, pointed, and well designed to elicit sensible answers! I rarely do livestreams...
