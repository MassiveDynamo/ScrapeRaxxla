Then there’s this old chestnut circa 1994:
Post in thread 'The Quest To Find Raxxla'
https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10372948.

Both Bell and Braben both essentially establish Raxxla was never in the game. If someone is saying it was, then that, if with any semblance of plausibility would at least be some modded version, or at most total fabrication, not the actual official product.

The whole ‘lizard’ alien concept (within game) is frankly pure invention from my perception of that data and should not be given oxygen, otherwise you will begin the endorsement of internet rumour as validated. Like the whole ‘Brookes said X at X convention’, without a transcript or multiple witnesses it as information is of incredibly low reliability, more so if someone says it simply to obtain attention, irrelevant of any hypothetical meaning.
