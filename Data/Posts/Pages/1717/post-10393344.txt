Thats the picture I was ref.

I see star with a moon / planet or binary star like a dwarf, a ringed water giant with 4 Moons and a ringed water world with a moon pr it's the 3rd planet (maybe). Of course that could be raxxla itself, 6 trees oddly placed..

Well it does make sense, and it is in the game, so this literally could be RAXXLA and we have found IT (the easter egg)
Well it means we've found a map of the system The only problem is that it leaves us searching for a needle in a needlestack
I'm exaggerating obviously, but if we can get a frame of reference to narrow the candidates down then that will be huge progress.
