Yeah the source is an obscure comment on the fandom wiki in 2017 - (scroll down to load the comment section)
There is a modern BBC Micro:Bit product for kids learning coding. No such magazine seems to exist.

The only plausibility of these 'archival' lore snippets, to me, is that the core ideas of old Elite lore were used as inspiration for the current game - ie. MB could have taken the idea of a lizard-like ancient race from DB and incorporated it in the form of the Guardians. Take for example this anonymous person's comment about Thargoids and Raxxlans in a stalemate. It sounds oddly similar to the stalemate between Guardians and Thargs. This does not prove that Guardians are Raxxlans but rather it simply shows where some inspiration came from and that would be as far as the parallels go. To connect the two eras as though they are canon seems like a waste of effort unless FDev state it as fact.

For reference, here is the wiki contribution log of this user's posts.
The comments read like a fanfic tinfoil embellishment of obsolete lore.
