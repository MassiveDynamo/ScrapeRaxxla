Well it does make sense, and it is in the game, so this literally could be RAXXLA and we have found IT (the easter egg)
If you think I plan on stopping at "cosmic enlightenment", think again. That ship sailed a long time ago. This is in multiple places so I would presume it refers to somewhere rather more specific albeit unnamed. Also, the following leaves open the possibility the ultimate goal is outside the Bubble: repeated references to Earth and hydrogen in every game and book, Jason Ryder's return from deep space before his untimely assassination, Early Colonies beacon in Delta Pavonis and era of rapid expansion starting in 2230, fuel scoops in logistical nightmare beacon in Beta Hydri.

Cosmic enlightenment was Oltiqu/Hope/Gateway and Lave being a real star in the Milky Way. There is literally no way I am settling for "cosmic enlightenment".
