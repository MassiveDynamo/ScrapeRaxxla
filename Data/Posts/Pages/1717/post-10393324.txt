It may not have a direct reference from the codex, but there is a link to the garden design from elsewhere in the game that relates it to Raxxla.
The final Brookes Tour beacon includes a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost and also directly references Raxxla.
The largest circle in what we are referring to as the "Milton Garden" in the Tourism interior stations is a verbatim copy of the map of Milton's cosmos from Paradise Lost.

Where it all came unstuck for us is what the other shapes might represent. It can certainly be an orrery - but it is difficult to pin down their symbolism and where it points to. Similarly the other garden designs don't seem to have much symbolic connection to anything yet.
Thats the picture I was ref.

I see star with a moon / planet or binary star like a dwarf, a ringed water giant with 4 Moons and a ringed water world with a moon pr it's the 3rd planet (maybe). Of course that could be raxxla itself, 6 trees oddly placed..

Well it does make sense, and it is in the game, so this literally could be RAXXLA and we have found IT (the easter egg)
