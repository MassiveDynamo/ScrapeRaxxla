The garden is interesting - but could it not simply be homage to Milton with no other meaning? An amusing insert from a developer, like many of the station/system names themselves are homage to other things.

As someone recently pointed out, there are thousands(?) of stations with that garden arrangement in them.

Therefore:

a) The garden arrangement itself is significant, not where it appears.
b) every single station containing that garden arrangement is significant.

If a), then it's nothing new at all, you'd been posting that diagram of Milton's cosmos for years, it's already known, and hasn't helped so far.
If b) ... then what? Map them all? Visit them all? What's the plan?

The thing about 'clues' is that they have to lead to something, or they're not clues.
