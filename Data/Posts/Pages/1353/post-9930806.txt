Well, I'm not so sure. Anyone can get these requirements or levels, but if those levels are needed then not anyone can find Raxxla, only those who full-fill the requirements.
I doubt he would have phrased it like this if levels were involved. More like "Anyone can work his way to Raxxla" or "Anyone can achieve what's needed to.." etc..
Not that it matter a lot anyway


We could be looking for some kind of spiritual center.. One of the religious congregation holds missions & clues maybe?
Ive had suspicions about the theocracies for some time. In galnet item 27 March 3301
Unknown Explorer Returns From NGC 3199 Nebula
"Representatives from the Sirius Corporation, Patron’s Principles, Chapter of Isinor, the Alioth Independents and the Sublime Order of Van Maanen’s Star have expressed great interest Swift Arrow’s findings. The data was sold piece meal to each organization". So why were the Chapter of Isinor & the Sublime Order of Van Maanen’s Star theocracies interested in exploration data?? Could they be TDW (explorers & adventurers) in disguise?

Unfortunately Ive checked van Maanen's system the other day & nothing there; well 3 comets but they dont react when I drop in & honk. Interestingly the outermost station is Thurstan Gateway, i.e. Thor's Stone- god of thunder & lightening, like Zeus who also had a stone (Omphalos)! Had a good snoop around that too but cant see anything.
