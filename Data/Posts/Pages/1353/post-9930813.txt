Ive had suspicions about the theocracies for some time. In galnet item 27 March 3301
Unknown Explorer Returns From NGC 3199 Nebula
"Representatives from the Sirius Corporation, Patron’s Principles, Chapter of Isinor, the Alioth Independents and the Sublime Order of Van Maanen’s Star have expressed great interest Swift Arrow’s findings. The data was sold piece meal to each organization". So were the Chapter of Isinor & the Sublime Order of Van Maanen’s Star theocracies interested in exploration data?? Could they be TDW (explorers & adventurers) in disguise?

Unfortunately Ive checked van Maanen's system the other day & nothing there; well 3 comets but they dont react when I drop in & honk. Interestingly the outermost station is Thurstan Gateway, i.e. Thor's Stone- god of thunder & lightening, like Zeus who also had a stone (Omphalos)! Had a good snoop around that too but cant see anything.

I might try to make ally with some theocracies, sound interesting..
I've read that some "secret" missions pop only the player spend some time (like real in-game time) actively playing within the faction sphere of influence.
