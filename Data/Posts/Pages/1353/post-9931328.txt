Could be a lead, an homage from Braben.
There's IRL a large asteroid named Rubin orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, in game idk, there are several stations, bases and settlement.
May be worth a look.

Of course Sol is heavily traveled.
But the entrance is toward Sol, and many players do not go beyond the closest stations or the well-known worlds.
And who would look for a big rock that doesn't show on map between two major planets? May be silly, idk.

Vera Rubin is one of several possibilities. Search my posts here, I remember I posted a list of them. The galmap search should find every station or body labelled “Rubin”. There are no asteroids locatable in the Sol asteroid belt. I and others have spent weeks looking! A complete list of the bodyids in Sol can be found in this thread:
See spoiler in Pyroboros’ https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-9726705

Of course the advent of the new bodytype HyperbolicOrbiter suggests there might still be new bodytypes to be found that arent showing up, but I suspect not in Sol.
