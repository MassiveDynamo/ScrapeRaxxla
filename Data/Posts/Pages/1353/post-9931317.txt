The mother of galaxies could quite be Vera Rubin!
Don't know how that translate in-game tough!
She's an american scientist, "mother" of modern theories about galaxies, one of the breaktrhough is a theory about how some star groups can spiral reverse in galaxies.
Could be a lead, an homage from Braben.
There's IRL a large asteroid named Rubin orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, in game idk, there are several stations, bases and settlement.
May be worth a look.

Of course Sol is heavily traveled.
But the entrance is toward Sol, and many players do not go beyond the closest stations or the well-known worlds.
And who would look for a big rock that doesn't show on map between two major planets? May be silly, idk.
