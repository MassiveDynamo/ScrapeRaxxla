Q.
Elite Observatory, does anyone have experience with this?

I'm just going through the logs on guthub and it looks really good so far.
The systems and bodies and stations etc you visit, and sell/buy transactions & a whole load more of in-game events are stored in the journal files. They’re readable text & you can manually inspect these (thats part of the comet hunting process as its the only way you can get them identified) but theres a tool EDDiscovery which I heartily recommend to anyone. It keeps your history, allows you to easily search through it, gives you maps and a whole lot more capability, and it will automatically report your journeying to the EDSM database tool which is building knowledge of the galaxy for anyone to access (the game database can only give you information on systems you have visited).

Ive been to Procyon many times, seem to remember its a useful system for getting missions towards the Sirius permit. Nothing found out of the ordinary, but if Raxxla “is very hard” to find then it could be there.

Ive got and occasionally use EDObservatory, but it doesn't tell me about comets in the system which is what I wanted it for. Useful for identifying shepherd moons, binary moons etc. @Pyroboros I gather you’re a software guru. How about creating a tool that helps to identify comets, HyperbolicOrbiters etc etc?

Edit: this is supposed to be a multi-quote response to 3 posts. But doesnt seem to have worked, odd
