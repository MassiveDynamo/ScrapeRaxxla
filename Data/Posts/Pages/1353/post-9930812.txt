Has anyone looked into this? It's been on my mind for a while.

Should we be looking for these places?

I spent quite some time matching the stars with Stellarium trying to identify at least which direction to search in. I came to the conclusion that it did not match any view from near sol. The trouble is that the skybox is quite different from elsewhere in the galaxy, so I can only conclude its not near sol (the view, not Raxxla)

Havent tried the OST one. Maybe thats Earth and one of the stations there - would have to have a proper look..
