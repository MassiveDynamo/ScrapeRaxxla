That rules out any player faction. Good. Only 99.9999% remaining.
But if so few people actually get to the content, there's a game-design problem imo.
How are we suppose to chose the "right" faction, the ones with the most interesting missions?
I'd bet on the weird ones, or secretive ones.
you don't
the point in what was said about follow the missions IMO was/is
Get out!, go here, go there.
even though I never saw that quote before, it is how I have played the game, always.
I still enjoy missions to places I have not been. I hope to see or learn something new to me and I usually do.
following the missions taught me so much about the game.
But then to stay in or near any starter system seemed silly.
This is Space, with enough places that you could fly and never see the same place twice.
back then I knew almost nothing of the lore other than what my Atari had.
and big driving factor too was the starting areas/systems were not friendly, just like now full of seal clubbers.
So a real good idea is get faaaar away from constant death.

as for the rest, from lore many secrets to follow, from not knowing lore, still a lot of things to discover
and the best part being it is alive and new things can be added or old things changed any time.
but keep moving, keep looking.

this thread is pretty much just that, reports and theories on what the game showed cmdrs.
missions make it easier. without them its, where do I go or what do I do today..
remember being aimless.
