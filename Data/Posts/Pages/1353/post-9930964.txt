It’s a good assumption that after 9 years, what ever original concepts were implemented in regards to ‘follow the missions’ might have been diluted or omitted.

It’s also potentially a presumption that DB was speaking about mystery, he just as likely was describing something generic; eg they just wanted players to move around the bubble more, and explore, not grind all the time.

Then again many of the mysteries are in the bubble… but who knows.

I obtained a secondary account last year and set out to just follow the missions which certainly moved me around the bubble but eventually I hit missions which would result in my inevitable death, unless I grinded for a better ship etc.

This is because FD altered missions significantly over the years, at launch I can imagine this would have been more straightforward, but not now.

Although I do love this game, it’s evident what was proposed and what was presented was inconsistent, and terribly communicated, if there were things to find, it logically ought to have been just a case of playing the game.

FD changed this, by messing with missions, making them easier to obtain, increasing payouts, adding more danger etc, which all sounds good but personally I would have preferred they simply spent more of that energy communicating with the community “look your doing it wrong, don’t do that, do this”.

Generally it’s a poorly communicated mechanism, it’s likely there were some very clear signals during that time, but many of us were far too busy either grinding for credits for the ship of our dreams or exploring the other side of the galaxy.
