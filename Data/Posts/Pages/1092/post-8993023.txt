Right but they didn't call it planet 9 or put it in the 9th position. So you can see how one might assume it was supposed to be 399 Persephone. I doubt there will ever be clarification on this. Also 399 Persephone is supposed to be a main belt asteroid. With all the recent speculation on the missing belt I thought this could be a missing asteroid. That's when I noticed the earth masses Persephone is listed to be (in game) and it started me wondering about it.

I'm not an astrophysicist or even have a college education so bare with me here.

Edit: Never had to block someone before but this is pretty much the only thread I care about not being locked out of. Congratulations smh
