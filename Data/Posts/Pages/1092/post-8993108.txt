Mick in this subject, timelines and dates aside, i would like to know your personal opinion. How far do you expect raxxla could be from Sol? A roughly guess between this light year away and that ly away?
To be honest, I've done my best to avoid making conclusions. Mostly I just pour through it a few times a month hoping something will stand out to me or add up in some way. I just like to compare notes with my squadmate who are also involved in the search. I feel it could be with in the range of Tau Ceti due to it already being legend by the time "Cora came home soused..." but also think it could be anywhere due to how misjumps could send you anywhere (allegedly) but we can't miss jump.

There is also a certain track in the soundtrack that raises questions but I'm not at liberty to discuss because it wasn't my find and I was asked to shut my trap about it until we conduct our own research to his satisfaction. Unfortunately RL has been very busy for him and he hasn't had much time to look in to it further at the moment.

I am in agreement about Sol could be a likely place
