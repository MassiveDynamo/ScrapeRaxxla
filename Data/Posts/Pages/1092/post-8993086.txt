Agreed. I also think that the entire rest of the codex has enough dates and informative timeliness to base an idea of how far from Sol Raxxla could potentially be, which isn't very far tbh
Mick in this subject, timelines and dates aside, i would like to know your personal opinion. How far do you expect raxxla could be from Sol? A roughly guess between this light year away and that ly away?
