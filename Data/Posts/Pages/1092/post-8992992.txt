I feel like this has been repeated too many times but here we go again.

I feel like lately I've been saying this a few times a week. The Quest for Raxxla is obscure enough without the propagation of false truths

A while back I found this concept art on a post here in the forums and it seems this may be what TDW station would look like... Talmor Lens made as a Station. The entrance is quite similar to what is depicted in the Codex... even the notches linked by a bridge.

Happy hunting!
