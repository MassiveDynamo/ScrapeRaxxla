I can't understand why they would go to all the trouble of a scale galaxy with hand crafted/placed systems and bodies. And then take our own home system and start throwing fictitious planets in to it. Now I'm worried I've never understood anything in the game
Planet 9 isn't fiction. There is a fair chanse it's out there.

It's more like dark matter. We can't see it but we need it to make the things we can see, fit our models.
Unlike dark matter, we only need better telescopes to be sure if it's there or not.
