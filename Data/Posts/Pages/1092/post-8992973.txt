It was made in 2015, wasn't it?
Not sure of the date. Memory hexedited and all that. Around the time of the start of the Formidine Rift threads or shortly after. I think it first appeared in that thread. For a brief time he used it as his account icon as "The Dark Wheel" on the forums too IIRC, until he was asked not to, which then led to CoR being created as he couldn't use Dark Wheel.
