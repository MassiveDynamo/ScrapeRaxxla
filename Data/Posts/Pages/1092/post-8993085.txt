Beware of false prophets....isn't that what Felicity is hinting at?

Have theories, have fun, waste time fruitlessly chasing the latest unicorn, its all fun until someone takes it too seriously and divides the community for and against or worse pitches them against each other.

We've had at least 2 amateur hoaxers here in the last 6 months alone, some people are in it for their ego and to gain followers, not for fun.

So just beware of false prophets and we'll all have fun.
