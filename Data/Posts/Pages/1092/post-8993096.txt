Sorry again for the translation difficulties. Is it possible to find out the location of a single spiral star in the game?
In the game you can not find a defination like "spiralling star". in gal map you can see stars and planets properties and features. I.e. Wolf rayet star, blue supergiant, tidally locked etc. But the spiralling star only can be evaluated by players. You can assume its a wolf-rayet star, or the course you must take should look alike a spiral to a spesific destination.
