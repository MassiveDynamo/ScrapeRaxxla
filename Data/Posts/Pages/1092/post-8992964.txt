The fan made logo actually predates the Children by a few years. It showed up on the forum, almost at the start of the game.
It was created by the guy who founded the children. I was in his FB group at the time when he did it. Then a certain author who shall remain unnamed used it on his blog and referenced it in Galnet. ;-)
