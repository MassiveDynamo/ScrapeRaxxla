Yeah, just you..

implies perhaps to strong, but someone gave it to us.. 'A Friend' as it says -

I spent some time staring hard at the images in the backgrounds - there are some codes there, but they didnt amount to anything - sure I put them in this thread, but the thread search couldnt find it <sigh>

PL-W 12 229 - see the bottom left of page 10 (mirrored) - there's another number above it too..

Also checked all systems you see in the screenies - nothing interesting.

Never thought of how you would contact Sue,Cripple & Sneer - perhaps a visit to Mars is required..
