As someone suggested a page earlier it might be helpful to get allied status with Eurybia Blue Mafia I flew out there last night to do just that. A thorough scan of Eurybia will also happen. Will report back.

@PeteACarter : Can jump back to Sol, when Eurybia is finished and scan Mars.

Concerning Sue, Cripple & Sneer Solicitors: WHoever came up with that name doesn't seem to be overly enthusiastic when it comes to lawyers or maybe it was a Morrissey fan with "Sorrow will come in the end" on Permaloop - who knows.
I think it dates back to Elite or Frontier:Elite 2, when those solicitors dealt with our Grandfather's will.....so it's from the mind of DB I suspect. Great name!
