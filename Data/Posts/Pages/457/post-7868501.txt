Lori Jameson and Liz Ryder are almost certainly in some way related to their historical namesakes. FD seem to be deliberately vague about this. The most concrete example we have, is Bill Turner. He claims to be the illegitimate son of Mic Turner.
Details in Premonition implies that this is true.
It's even possible that his mother is Meridith Argent. She has enough money and influence to be a Powerplayer, but is only briefly mentioned in a few tourist beacons.

When it comes to The Dark Wheel, the Ryders is the family to keep an eye on. There is no indication that any of the Jamesons have been involved with TDW.
It's more likely that they are involved with the elusive Elite Federation of Pilots.

As someone suggested a page earlier it might be helpful to get allied status with Eurybia Blue Mafia I flew out there last night to do just that. A thorough scan of Eurybia will also happen. Will report back.

@PeteACarter : Can jump back to Sol, when Eurybia is finished and scan Mars.

Concerning Sue, Cripple & Sneer Solicitors: WHoever came up with that name doesn't seem to be overly enthusiastic when it comes to lawyers or maybe it was a Morrissey fan with "Sorrow will come in the end" on Permaloop - who knows.
