Neat. I'll give it a try when I'm through with Mercury.

Btw.: Lori Jameson?

Lori Jameson and Liz Ryder are almost certainly in some way related to their historical namesakes. FD seem to be deliberately vague about this. The most concrete example we have, is Bill Turner. He claims to be the illegitimate son of Mic Turner.
Details in Premonition implies that this is true.
It's even possible that his mother is Meridith Argent. She has enough money and influence to be a Powerplayer, but is only briefly mentioned in a few tourist beacons.

When it comes to The Dark Wheel, the Ryders is the family to keep an eye on. There is no indication that any of the Jamesons have been involved with TDW.
It's more likely that they are involved with the elusive Elite Federation of Pilots.
