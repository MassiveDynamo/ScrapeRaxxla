Sorry, none at all.
If I were to search any ring systems at all, I'd go for Belt Clusters, as they're numbered and can be combed throught methodically.
Yes, I regularly do this now, but there’s only up to around 10 asteroids in each cluster, and not many clusters, so not a great hiding place. IMHO a planetary ring is the obvious place for FD to have hidden it cos they’re so hard to search....
