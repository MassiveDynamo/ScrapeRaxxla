You must be politician and if not you should be, explaining lies seems natural to you.
Codex should be collections of facts and true information and that is how EVERYONE perceive Codex as and for someone to say, no it is not, is just wrong.
It’s a game full of politics. And it’s a game where we’re subject to all the politicking.

You can’t just expect to be exempt from that.

The Codex itself doesn’t even deal in absolutes. It makes clear that there are different versions of things.

People have decided what things should be according to themselves before, and have had a shock when it turns out that’s not how the game works.
