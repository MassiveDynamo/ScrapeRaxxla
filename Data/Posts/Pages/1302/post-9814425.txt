Just noticed and probably noticed before, when entering a system map from galaxy map check out the breif loading ebtween the two, literally looks like the Raxxla logo however 4 semi circles instead of 3 and a circle of dots rather than a hex, hard to screenshot it due to fast loading times on my end
