It’s a game in which we’re all members of the public, and subject to lies, deceit, propaganda and manipulation by the powers that be in the game universe. That is part of the nature of the game. You can’t suddenly go ‘well that doesn’t apply to my area of interest. Any in-game info about my area of interest must be literal truth, and if not FD lied.’
You must be politician and if not you should be, explaining lies seems natural to you.
Codex should be collections of facts and true information and that is how EVERYONE perceive Codex as and for someone to say, no it is not, is just wrong.
