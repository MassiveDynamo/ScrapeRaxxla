It’s a game full of politics. And it’s a game where we’re subject to all the politicking.

You can’t just expect to be exempt from that.

The Codex itself doesn’t even deal in absolutes. It makes clear that there are different versions of things.

People have decided what things should be according to themselves before, and have had a shock when it turns out that’s not how the game works.
Well, I will stick with lying in Codex would be very bad and would hurt frontiers reputation a lot. I'm sure a lot of cmdrs out in the black would agree with me.
