There was a period between Beta testing phase and official launch of E: D. It was called Gamma testing phase, but any progress made then was not reset at launch time. Many (me included) fell to the idea of 'vertical slice' at that time. Alas, E: D 1.0 was just Gamma with some bugs fixed (and some introduced).
The significans of Gamma is that it was the release of the full galaxy. In beta, only a small portion was accessible for players.
There was also a full regeneration of procedural systems at the release of gamma.
The galaxy we have now, didnâ€™t really exist before gamma.
