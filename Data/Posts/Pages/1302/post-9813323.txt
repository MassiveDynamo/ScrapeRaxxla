Yeah. Ring objects i general are interesting. Stellar and planetary rings are probably basically the same object, in the code. If FD can manipulate the density of rocks in a ring, they could have very few or even a singular rock orbiting whatever they want. Planetary rings aren't scannable without probes and they require visual contact.

We know from Sol that ring can be 'empty'. There could be similar setups in other systems.
@Han_Zen , @Zieman :
Have you any ideas for efficiently searching a planetary ring set? Each one must contain thousands of asteroids. I cant see that a single pilot could stand a significant probability. If we have to find the correct asteroid with limited detection range (possibly only by visual detection? and perhaps not in supercruise?) then that would definitely fit with MB’s Raxxla...”is something in the game world (not text) and very hard to find”, “it’s not a random thing” and “anyone can find it and more than once”.

It would even fit with the rumour that DB said
“It would be more likely to reveal itself to a group of players.... If you are at the right place and you scan it enough..."
