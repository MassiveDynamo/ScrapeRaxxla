Well I completely agree that a lot of people would also construe the Codex as being words from the mouth of FD as opposed to an in-game info source, and respond accordingly. They’d be wrong, but that wouldn’t stop them, it never has so far, so I don’t imagine it’d start now.

But it’s bad form. People should pay attention to the nature of the game, and play it accordingly. They shouldn’t expect the game to revolve around what they’ve personally decided. (Like I say though, it’s not stopped people before.)
There are no valid excuses for lying in Codex.
