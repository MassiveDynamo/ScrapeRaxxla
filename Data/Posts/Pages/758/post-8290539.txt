just to let you know that these appear whenever you hang around in a system long enough.

The few times i have gotten that mission (specifically the one shown (same cargo,faction, and flavor text, but with a different npc name)) it has been broken/bugged, and the target ship was not carrying any cargo. The npc was spouting off flavor text like the old UA convoys used to.
