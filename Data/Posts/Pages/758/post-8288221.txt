Checking out tourist beacons and passenger missions from TDW, and noticed a funny one that I reminded me of watching trashy TV shows in the 80's.

So either FDev are stealing names and ideas from random spots on the Internet (likely, and/or there is a secret TMNT fan working for them), or these beacons that passengers are directing us to might have a bit more meaning to them than perhaps we first thought?

SPOILER: MROGG - TMNT ANYONE?





Hmmm...
