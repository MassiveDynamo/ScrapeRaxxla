listen to me. I read the last 6-7 pages where you talked about col70. this system is not related to raxxla, there is a story about the Targoids. The fact that not far from Sol I agree and I have a theory which, thanks to the Koben, was confirmed. There are hidden systems that we can see only through the left panel in the list, but not on the map. I think it's worth checking out.
