So I was watching travel videos today and I realized what number 1 is ... Its Triton from the Pena Palace.. He is guarding the gate between the lower aquatic world and the upper terrestrial one... https://www.parquesdesintra.pt/en/pontos-de-atracao/the-arch-of-the-triton/
SPOILER: TRITON

The similarity is striking. I wonder if the dark patch in the navel region of the tattoo, symbolizes the omphalos rift?

SPOILER: OMPHALOS RIFT?

Omphalos is evidently also a place in Crete, near the Triton river. Infant Zeus supposedly dropped his navel (umbilical cord) there.
