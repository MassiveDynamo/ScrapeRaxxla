The max number on each segment for IPv4 is 255, so an IPv4 address for comms relay 290.422.11.1 does not exist...
It might be a hint to something. I tried to decode it with no success so far...
I always read those as a log number, not an IPv4 simply because it wasn't in the correct value ranges.
Drive Units System Diag(nostic number) = 290.422.11.1
