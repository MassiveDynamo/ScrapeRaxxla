Why not both? Who says a rouge planet can't go rogue?

True, but not necessarily logically linked!
There are rouge (red) planets
There may be rogue planets
There may even be rogue rouge planets
But there may conceptually be rogue planets that are beige, pink, blue, green, or even polkadot
Or some combination thereof..
But the important characteristic here is rogue!

Yes, Iâ€™m getting pedantic in my old age!!
