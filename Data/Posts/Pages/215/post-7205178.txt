Actually, I do quite like Shadow Hunters as a name.

So do I. I think Seekers in the Dark is a bit long, it doesnâ€™t exactly roll off the tongue but can be shortened without losing meaning, in fact it emphasises it. So perhaps we should have a vote for:

Shadow Hunters
The Seekers
Questers
Shadow Questers
Shadow Seekers

& perhaps some other appropriate suggestions. anybody know how to set one up?
