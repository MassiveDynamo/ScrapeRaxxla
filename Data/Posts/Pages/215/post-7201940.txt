Hey, welcome back, long time no see compadre!

edit2: still prefer Questers!

Thanks, burned myself out then got a bit disheartened around the time of 2.4, and the exploration update was the only thing that interested me from Beyond. Despite the complaints about the FSS in the beta forum, I quite like it, and really looking forward to doing some more explain when it goes live. Not decided for certain where I'll be going yet though. However, I've still never visited the Zurara (in spite of my near miss a year before it was found), so perhaps I will head back to the rift.
