Regarding the Squadron name, I suggest 'Shattenjaeger Squadron' (if we can have an umlaut in place of the ae, better yet) or the English version 'Shadow Hunter Squadron'. The name may be familiar to some due to the Gabriel Knight games, although there is an implication of seeking out and eliminating dangers and not just investigating the facts behind myths and rumours.
