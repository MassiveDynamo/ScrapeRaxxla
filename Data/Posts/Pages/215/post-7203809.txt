Ooh, how about the Children of Raxacoricofallapatorius.

I vote for "Orphans of Raxxla" or "The Dim Wheel".

Not that it matters as I am not currently playing, or if I was, likely to ever join another player group of any sort.

I think the original point was a squadron “home” for a group to rival “The Dark Wheel” with their original philosophy (Jaiotu, from Holdstock: "The Dark Wheel was a semi-legendary space unit, star-riders who made it their business to seek the truth behind the plethora of myths and romantic stories that filtered back from all corners of the Universe: fabulous cities, parallel worlds, time travellers, even planets that appeared to be the old 'heaven' of Earth legend”), but they have become twisted from their original lofty goals and focus just on Raxxla, with questionable moral purpose.

I suggested “FRifters” as that was the first such mystery that brought us together; to my mind a name that is anything to do with Raxxla is a bit too focused and obviates the group as soon as Raxxla is found (with the impending new exploration capabilities I think that’s likely to be Soon!). To take up SpocksOddSocks’ idea “Bright Wing” does imply a certain level of intelligence in problem solving, but a wing is a different in-game mechanic from a squadron. “Bright Flight” or “White Flight” seem more apposite to me, as it indicates an opposite mindset to TDW but is not really very descriptive of the goal. However Questers seems to encapsulate it all- the philosophy and the gameplay that this thread, and its predecessor, was all about. We quest for the truth, and the solution to the universe’s mysteries; it exactly captures the philosophy statement. You could expand it if you want:
White Questers
Dim Questers
Quixotic Questers
