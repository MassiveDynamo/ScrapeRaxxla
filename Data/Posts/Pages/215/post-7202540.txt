Thanks, burned myself out then got a bit disheartened around the time of 2.4, and the exploration update was the only thing that interested me from Beyond. Despite the complaints about the FSS in the beta forum, I quite like it, and really looking forward to doing some more explain when it goes live. Not decided for certain where I'll be going yet though. However, I've still never visited the Zurara (in spite of my near miss a year before it was found), so perhaps I will head back to the rift.

Know what you mean, I had a burnout & stopped playing for about four months at the beginning of the year but kept involvement on the forum threads of interest. Now enjoying the Quest before setting out on DWE2 in the New Year. But have taken advantage of the sale to get a second account/deluxe game pack for £16 & Jorki’s distant cousin Tyko will soon start to develop his piloting skills and credit balance before going out to explore the FRift, seems DW has given a hint that there’s more to find out there...think there are a few of us that are of that mind so I suggested a squadron for the purpose. A collaborative search might have more success than solo efforts.
I’m also looking forward to the FSS & probes for exploration, & rechecking some planets that I investigated without result.
