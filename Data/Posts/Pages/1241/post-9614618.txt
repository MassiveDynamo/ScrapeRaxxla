But we see NO in-game storyline related to appearance of Raxxla, indeed we have NO appearances! Just some abstruse and contradictory information (which may or may not be valid clues or red herrings or total fluff) in the codex about Raxxla and TDW (an organisation that supposedly can be joined but in 7 years there is no evidence anybody has had success in this) and several FD statements that Raxxla is indeed in-game, but we don’t know what it is, and nothing said about reality of TDW.

As I pointed out a while ago John Harper, author of “And Here The Wheel” said in his blog “Raxxla itself, the mystery, who's rumours and sightings seem to ebb and flow on a 50 year cycle and we're approaching that 50-year peak”, but this does appear to be instead a reference to the start timeline of the various versions of the game

1984 Elite set in 3120
1993 Frontier Elite 2 set in 3200
1995 Frontier First Encounters set in 3250
2014 Elite Dangerous set in 3300

Doh, and you’ve distracted me from the heat pad on my right hand, ouch!

It would be a bit absurd if Raxxla was Halley's comet. The comet can be observed every day in RL, with the right equipment. It should not be hard to find.
From an ingame perspective we just have to accept that the sensors on and the visibility from our ships, are sub par.

The sensors can not detect smaller bodies. Looking out the window, its even hard to see the moon from earth. The windshield and the Remlock clearly messes with the way we see things.
