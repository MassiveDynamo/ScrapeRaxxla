If Halley's Comet goes by earths visibility that means we would see the comet (from earth technically) in around the year 3336 as it was last seen in 1986 and has been spotted near every previous approximate 75 years before then, Judging the way the storyline progresses in Elite if it is tied to Raxxla it makes sense when we see it
