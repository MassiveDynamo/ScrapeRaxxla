Um, "possibly a dwarf planet with a measured diameter of 200 km" - such small bodies are not in ED, hence why many of the moons of Jupiter and the asteroids are not present (even the big ones).
Are you sure? What is the reference source for that statement?
We know comets are in-game though not visually represented. How big are comets? Iâ€™d be surprised if they were larger than 200km diameter.
