Are you sure? I'we never seen any ecliptic orbits, except in Sol and a few other inner core systems. These are probably hand coded.

The proc. gen. systems all seem to have circular orbits, even when they are way of center.

This could of course be just the visuals of the orrery and that Sol has more small bodies, that makes it look that way. They could be slightly elliptic, without it being obvious.
