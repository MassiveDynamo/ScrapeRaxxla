No, I think Han_Zen is right and the missing body is Halley’s Comet, which is searchable in the Galmap to Sol.
But does it show on the FSS scan??
Otherwise how do we find it? Since we dont know the current stardate for Sol’s planetary orbits (see previous page) we can’t get an approximate position from Stellarium to start a search.

Actually, are the other in-game comets (Pareco??) detectable via FSS?

Edit: I could imagine Halley’s Comet causing the merriment in DB’s voice when he said “but you don’t know what it is” !

Edit2: have we had any lore about size of bodies the FSS can/can’t detect??
