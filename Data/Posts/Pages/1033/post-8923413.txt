Wasted over an hour trying to overlay it onto the Raxxla icon in Gimp!
I don't have a graphical/artistic bone in my body!

it was visible on the forum but now isn't, but the link is clickable to bring it up

Mmm, just looking through some Postit notes - apparently "briefly jumped" from sector 26 to 7, & did twice see green glow in cockpit around sector 26 or 27, no date but must have been in December.
