we've now had reports of glows at sectors 15/16, 27 and 21. These all match the "corridoors" in the unrotated logo.
Interesting!

I recorded seeing "asteroid cluster" at sectors: 21, 17, 6, 15, 8, 11, 19, 5, 19 & 6. (edit: that was sometime after I started circling the belt, when I started to think something strange was happening and started to log some notes, unfortunately only on scrappy PostIt notes)
One record shows a "positional jump" from sector 23 to 3.
