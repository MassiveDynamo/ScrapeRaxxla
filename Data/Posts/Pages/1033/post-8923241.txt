I think the Elite requirement is a reflection of the quality of NPC assassins the mission incurs that will be trying to prevent your delivery. Is your pilot Elite? If not that would explain why it was greyed out.

Ah, no ... I've been lazy in my combat rank effort so am only 'Master' at the moment. However I've done plenty of Wing assassination missions solo in my Vette but won't help here if I canâ€™t get the mission in the first place!

This is certainly something FDev could track as a subtle test of skill discretely administered, and hence a lock out progress towards an Invite for TDW.

Has anyone received this mission type from TDW in another system?

Edit: - Re-read the message, it's trade rank which I am Elite in... so we'll see.
