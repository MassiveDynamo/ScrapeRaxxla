Here's the sysmap with my sector numbering.


Wasted over an hour trying to overlay it onto the Raxxla icon in Gimp!
I don't have a graphical/artistic bone in my body!

it was visible on the forum but now isn't, but the link is clickable to bring it up

Mmm, just looking through some Postit notes - apparently "briefly jumped" from sector 26 to 7, & did twice see green glow in cockpit around sector 26 or 27, no date but must have been in December.

Took a screen grab and popped these into MS Publisher - you can set transparency and move images around.

I've been able to do it (cant post image off my out of date phone), and there are various ways where it aligns, but without knowing where to align, not sure how reliant ithis would be. There are several possible alignments, need more data, I think we're on the right heading.
