That's why I was wondering about different locations in the belt.

If this is kind of a map and the three arcs are the belt, there could be three 'open lanes' for the green light?


Just some speculation. The 'map' could represent something completely different.

It is interesting that there are 33 dashes in the original Raxxla logo and 32 asteroid belt sectors in Sol. Tinfoil stuff here, but the background is also green.

Assuming you're correct, if we look at the map from above: Sol is in the center with a targeting reticle around it, surrounded by an asteroid belt with 33 sectors, which is then surrounded by... something. Hyperlanes? Points of interest? Sector indicators?

Worth considering.
