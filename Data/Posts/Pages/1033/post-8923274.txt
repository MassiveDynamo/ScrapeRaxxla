It's also the Alchemy-symbol for gold.

You guys should start some serious Excel- by cross-referencing your position in the Sol-system with the timestamp at which the green glow occured.
There might be a periodicity when the green glow is visible at certain positions.

If you can calculate a period, then you can check the period against the rotation period of all bodies. Then it's either a ground-based "laser pointer" or its a geostationary satellite.

Also what is the duration of the green glow? Is it the same duration for everyone? Or do some people have very short durations and others have long durations? It's also possible that the short durations are not noticed.
