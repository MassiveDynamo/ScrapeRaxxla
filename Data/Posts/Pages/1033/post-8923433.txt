Here's the sysmap with my sector numbering.


Wasted over an hour trying to overlay it onto the Raxxla icon in Gimp!
I don't have a graphical/artistic bone in my body!

At this stage, we can't determine how to rotate the Raxxla logo so that it matches the sector you marked. We don't know the orientation. We need to find the position of two more green rays at least to correlate the logo with the real map. I am 100% sure that in the end there will be six rays (and I dare say that one will come from Whitchspace, but that's another theory).
