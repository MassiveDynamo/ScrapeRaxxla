Howdy CMDRs,
Has anyone tried dropping from SC the very instant they experience "the green glow"?

And, where are the main bodies of the asteroid belt? I mean, Ceres, Pallas and Eris are bigger than a lot of other solar orbital bodies that are also present in Sol system map, and each and every one of them a perfect place for Raxxla. I wonder if FD was lazy and didn't code them in or they were hidden on purpose. And if the latter is true, how can anyone find them?

Yes, in one of my vids youâ€™ll see I dropped out of SC when I had the glow (& suffered some hull damage); the glow was still visible in the cockpit but faded very quickly.

Edit: maximum duration I've seen for the glow is 6 seconds.
