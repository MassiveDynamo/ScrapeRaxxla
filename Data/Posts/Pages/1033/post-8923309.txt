That's why I was wondering about different locations in the belt.

If this is kind of a map and the three arcs are the belt, there could be three 'open lanes' for the green light?


Just some speculation. The 'map' could represent something completely different.

Yes, it’s interesting that it’s about the same colour green as the glow I’ve seen, and when I encounter an “asteroid cluster” in the bottom sector the orrery view appears that I’ve instantaneously jumped round to the sector at top 45 degrees left. Must put up my numbering scheme! And maybe overlay this icon!! So perhaps these apparent jumps aren’t just a bug- perhaps they’re intentional in Sol and it’s a bug that they happen in other systems? I’ll check my scribbling to see if I recorded the other apparent jumps I experienced while travelling around the belt.
