Took a screen grab and popped these into MS Publisher - you can set transparency and move images around.

But without knowing how to align it / where, not sure how reliant it would be.

I would suggest just set the sysmap numbered sector image to semi-transparent and overlay it onto the Raxxla icon & that will help us to decide. I suspect no rotation is required.
