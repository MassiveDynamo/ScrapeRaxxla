Howdy CMDRs,
Has anyone tried dropping from SC the very instant they experience "the green glow"?

And, where are the main bodies of the asteroid belt? I mean, Ceres, Pallas and Eris are bigger than a lot of other solar orbital bodies that are also present in Sol system map, and each and every one of them a perfect place for Raxxla. I wonder if FD was lazy and didn't code them in or they were hidden on purpose. And if the latter is true, how can anyone find them?
