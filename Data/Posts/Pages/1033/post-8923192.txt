“If it appears, it is always just after the Orrery System Map is closed.” - I’m not convinced by this. It is true that in my videos the appearance closely follows use of the orrery view, but that’s because I’m continually using the orrery view to check my ship position, especially wrt the height/thickness, of the belt since there is no other way to do that. Last Sunday (no video recording) I saw the glow while pootling around in sector 16 but had not used the orrery view.

I wasn't aware there was an example of it happening outside of Orrery, in every video I've watched so far the green glow has appeared about 1 second after the map was closed. Thanks for clarifying!
