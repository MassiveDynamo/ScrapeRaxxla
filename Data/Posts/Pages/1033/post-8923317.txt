Perhaps Raxxla exists in Sol in a pocket of folded space-time created by a wormhole (or the wormhole is in folded space-time and leads to Raxxla) and incidentally all significant portions of the asteroid belt have been swallowed up by it as well. This would (hypothetically) explain the green glow, the missing asteroids in the belt and the space-time anomaly that seems like teleportation between the sectors of the belt.
