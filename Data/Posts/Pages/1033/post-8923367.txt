Guys, I think everything is clear.

The Raxxla logo is a map.


But we don't know what the brackets around the sun are.
This can be a scanner selection or three command ships standing in the path of the green light.
And again, we don't know when or why this green glow appears.
In general, this theory correlates with the old FD statements on the topic that you need to scan something and you need to be in the wing.
