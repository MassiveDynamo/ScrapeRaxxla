I would suggest just set the sysmap numbered sector image to semi-transparent and overlay it onto the Raxxla icon & that will help us to decide. I suspect no rotation is required.
Yes it alligns pretty well. But you can expand or contract the image, but which is the correct alignment. The 3 arcs, the inner hexagon or the outer hexagon.

Currently at work so cant really post more than this.
