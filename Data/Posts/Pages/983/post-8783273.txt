Plus, as we know most of planetary POI's are not visible in the left panel even in proximity (after DSS)

Been experimenting with this.

1. Obviously dropping into planet 'atmosphere' or Glide shows the POIs, we know that.
2. Dropping out of SC in orbit after DSS also shows planetary POIs (hypothesis, its dropping out of SC that triggers it)
3. Dropping out of SC in orbit before DSS finishes and waiting until finished...shows nothing. Going back into SC in same place, orbit, planetary POIs suddenly show up .

Conclusion, first hypothesis is wrong. Its a change of 'instance' from or to SC that triggers them showing. From or to but no need to Glide to find them

it better be a temporary bug for my sanity.
