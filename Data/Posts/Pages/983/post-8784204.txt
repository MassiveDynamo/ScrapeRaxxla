Shame they never gathered so alloys from the barnacles and built their 'cage' out of them, probably have fixed the whole problem.

Did realise that we 'learned' that Thargoid ships crashed before Mycoid or human interference, if that was ever in doubt as such, never really thought about it, all ships can crash surely, but tinfoil extrapolated to Guardians but no evidence...yet, I shall be keeping an eye out just in case.
