On theory is it as was shot down by the enemy Thargs, one side shot down the other, I dint think about it at the site so never really looked for specific damage.

Others? Hard to say, just assumed all the others were result of some combat with humans either Mycoid or other, no reason to suspect otherwise...until now and thats a tinfoil suspicion but worth keeping in mind. Need more evidence...as usual
