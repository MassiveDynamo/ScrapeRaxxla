So, this is pretty OT, but I thought I'd share, given the potential links from the Adamaster.

INRA wasn't specifically quoted in any of the logs associated with the event was it? I was unable to get the one from the LP or the Sidewinder crash site.
The logs are from well before INRA. What happened in the Coslsack was probably what gave the Thargoids knowledge of humans.
A few years later they sent scouts to investigate.
