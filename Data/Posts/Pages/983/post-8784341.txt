Hypothesis, is the 'Omphalos rift' in Elite Dangerous actually a reference to the real geological rift at Delphi, are the various location names relating to the real rift applied in game, are they used to describe the location or woven into the supposed 'journey'?

Currently not in game to investigate.

I recal I've proposed this previously, but I've since found some source material which aligns with my rusty classical memory.

For Delphic Oracle, Fumes and Visions (Published 2002)
Team of scientists produces wealth of evidence that ancient Greeks were correct in suggesting that intoxicating vapors rising from floor were what gave oracles at Temple of Apollo in Delphi their visions and inspiration; geologist Jelle Zeilinga de Boer found hidden fault in mountains in 1981...

Koretas a goat heard was supposedly the first to discover the 'fissure' where the first Pythia appeared in Delpi.

The temple was built around it, and the Pythia prophesised while seated in the 'adyton' from where a pneuma (gas) arose from a small opening, overwhich the Pythia sat upon a high tripod inhaling the pneuma and then delivered her prophecies, in verse or in prose.

Debate has over the years concluded there is a fault line running underneath the temple, the highest point of which is the spring, above the temple, called the 'Kerna' Spring and there also is the kassotis spring which is directly underneath.

This Delphi fault (rift) is linked to one of Greece’s most geologically active features: the great rift, or 'graben'.
