I found the location of the asteroid belt in the Sol system. It is in the middle of the sun.
Probably I'm not the first one who found it there, am I?
Maybe Raxxla is closer than expected.

Sadly not the first, I reported this as a bug in 2016!
So, have you tried to get to it? Perhaps this is the obfuscation??
(Try with a cheap rebuy ship, after docking in Sol)
