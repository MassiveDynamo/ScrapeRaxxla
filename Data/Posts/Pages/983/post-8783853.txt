INRA no, I think the story timeline goes like / will be like

Private Military Contractor using Mercs - Azimuth (may be the original but they were working for somebody poss Pharmasapien) - Pharmasapien - INRA (or merged within or secret within wider INRA)

Either way it went from PMC using mercs to SuperPower backed military outfit to....?

I think The Club is overarching and in control from the beginning and didnt grow out of it.

So Azimuth & Adamastor would be years before INRA in that timeline, but almost certainly an ancestor /predecessor of it.

Dont think I have any real facts though, just thoughts putting some of the details together. Other possibilities as well but its a nice narrative link.
