How do we know the goid ships crashed before mycoid? Didn't think there was any date given in-game

I have, usual disclaimer it may have come from 'unofficial' sources (cant remember whether theres dates on the Mycoid logs or not so not sure where I got this from, may have been DW Lore Tour and not 'official lore' or it may have changed since or may be changing now)

INRA
INRA DEVELOP MYCOID VIRUS & TEST ON LIVING SUBJECTS & SHIPS

Mycoid is developed at INRA bases though, which came into being later, though I dont currently have an in game date.

So just timeline, before INRA, long before Mycoid discovered...well 20-40 years anyway...based on best available evidence but happy to update if anyone has more accurate info. I havent done all the Beacons by a long way so have very few actual dates.
