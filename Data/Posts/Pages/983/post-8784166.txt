I wonder what Felicity Farseer found in Coalsack... She once told me of her voyages while working on a lightweight scanner. I suppose there is a reason she asks for meta-alloys. Also makes sense to reduce extra weight off a spaceship, just in case the rumours are true, and there truly is something lurking in the witchspace...
