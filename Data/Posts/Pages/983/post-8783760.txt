I also agree that it must be within the bubble as Jorki states and that it is possible to reach it. Those Mother Gaia locked locations in Sol, Triton and the Moon, are highly suspicious. Also keep in mind Sol is missing Ceres (unless something changed), with no explanation although smaller celestial bodies were included.

Another more tinfoil relation is Adamastor, Neptune, and Tritons. Adamastor was considered to be a Triton and just so happened to make it onto Michael Brookes cryptic tattoo. Of course I have to bring up again that Alex Ryder named his sons Neptune and Oberon, a clue perhaps. Perhaps the Ryders chose to pursue Soontill because Raxxla was too difficult for them to go after because it’s in the seat of Federation space, Sol.

An alien artifact was found on Mars and immediately hidden. This indicates to me that there was an alien presence previously in Sol yet all we find is a tiny object the size of a child’s hand, what other alien things could they have found and locked away behind permits and red tape.

That’s enough tinfoil for me today.
