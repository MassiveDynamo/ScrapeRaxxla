Shame they never gathered so alloys from the barnacles and built their 'cage' out of them, probably have fixed the whole problem.

Did realise that we 'learned' that Thargoid ships crashed before Mycoid or human interference, if that was ever in doubt as such, never really thought about it, all ships can crash surely, but tinfoil extrapolated to Guardians but no evidence...yet, I shall be keeping an eye out just in case.

If this crash predates mycoid and human intervention, do we have any indication as to what caused it? Was there some sort of caustic object found near the crash site that caused ship malfunction? Have we found other thargoid crash sites with these caustic, ship degrading objects nearby them? What caused the Adamastor to suffer it’s damage? The same object that brought down the thargoid ship perhaps.

To put it bluntly, I think The probe, sensor, and link damage them as well. Why? I don’t know, but that may also explain what one of their motivations are and why they need meta alloys similarly to humans.
