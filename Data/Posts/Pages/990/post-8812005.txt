2849 according to the Beacon

3125 according to the Codex

Or the other way round The new date of 3125 was corrected on one source but not the other iirc. Implies the original date was 2849 and the new date was 3125...which the Halloween story may back up as may be based on the 'known' 3125 timeline.

Its a question to ask the CM tomorrow in the AMA thread.



FFE can be ignored if it doesnt match. Only info in the current game and current official sources is canon. If theres something in game that contradicts or doesnt match up just throw the old info out the window and use the new. So the timeline is.

3125 Thargoid 'first contact'. Officially publicly known. Hints of earlier contact but no video evidence or proof. Some hints from certain events that have moved that actual date forward a decade...the first 'proof' of aliens but it was kept hidden for years until another contact was recorded and released by someone else. We all know what I mean, no need to spoil it.

3150's Mycoid Virus used for the 1st time, the whole history of how it was discovered etc is out there, this is meant to be the lore obviously. No explanation of any previous conflicts, if they happened, or any 'breaks' or pauses in the war if they happened. I think the whole 'pause' has been moved forward to now, we have used the Mycoid once and are awaiting the comeback now. its taken 150 years for the Thargs to recover and the Scavengers imply they can now remove the virus.

So FFE end is kind of right, but the history up to that point may not be, if it dont match just chuck it as retcon.

The original Beacon was 2849, current one is 3125.

Codex says 2849, the pre-2.4 lore summary says 3125.

It could do with clearing up, but they’re all fairly clear that it’s not the actual first contact anyway, so it’s not too big a problem all told.
