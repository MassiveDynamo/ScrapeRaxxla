Frontier are not going to answer such a straight forward question about Raxxla, such as if its in game etc.

It might be more constructive to ask a loaded question that FD would happier to answer or complacent enough about not to realise its importance...(doh their watching this arent they!).

It is a difficult situation and one which may be a waist of energy.

Normally the best questions arent so direct, instead its best to give someone a platform, to get them to talk, at length about a subject they enjoy... once their talking you slip in something partly related, digging slowly....of course this takes hours/days. Which is why its not going to be affective in such an AMA session. But I salute those who are asking already, you never know.

Personally I'd like this one addressed again, as I thought how it was approached was a great example...

Or maybe the Yggdrasil tree in game? (doh again)...but how to ask...

They are not going to confirm or deny anything but if we have an assumption...
