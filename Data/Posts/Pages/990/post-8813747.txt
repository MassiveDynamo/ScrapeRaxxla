Raxxla search unaffected.
Probably nothing but it seems Drew may have thrown in a reference to Crimson Military Uniform Cmdr Hexion in Premonition. When Salome and Hassan are in the orbital graveyard they see a body entombed in a crystalline structure wearing a Crimson Military Uniform. Just a link I noticed. I was wondering why that tomb was included in Premonition.

Apologies if you saw this, I was reading your log on mobile and the format was distorted a bit.
