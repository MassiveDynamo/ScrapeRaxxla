Breakdown of the themes within all novels connected to Elite (inc. Dark Wheel and Alien World). Raxxla NOT mentioned in the ED kickstarter novels at all - only the non-canon Dark Wheel novella and the book which is not related to Elite at all other than as the place where the idea of Raxxla came from, The Alien World.
Raxxla is mentioned extensively in-game though (has its own section in the Codex).
