Nice summary. They are missing one book. Imprint by Andy Redman, that came with Elite+. It does not mention Raxxla, but it explains a bit about the first Thargoid conflict. It also expalins GalCop and it's roll in the greater Galaxy. It's the first indication that something exist outside the eight original maps.
I was not aware of that one, thanks
