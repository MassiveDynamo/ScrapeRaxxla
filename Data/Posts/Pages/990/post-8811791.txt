Thargoids are described into initial paper novel actually. That was some humanoids. And it was some another race which were slightly different then thargoids.
People were collecting thargoids' eggs and making deadly pilots from them for own human ships.
Some when later on thargoids became "big live ships".
Thargoids aren't their ships, their ships are just organic/biological technology. In lore, the Thargoids are an insectoid species but had a war between their two different factions/races. Oresrians and Klaxxians.

There's some speculation on it here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...xians-how-it-likely-all-fits-together.379574/
