True. However I still have some doubts-scepticism comes easily at my age! Agreed this is aiming at TDW invitation, & have already discussed sale of data issue. But if this is TDW membership path & that is required as part of the Raxxla Quest then TDW toast should have logically come out when the SD special missions disappeared....
So the conclusion is
TDW membership is not required to find Raxxla, the two gameplay paths are totally independent?

Just pondering possibilities! But I do like this hypothesis being unrelated to mythology!
Still pondering the second line & destination. Probably need to get in-game and peruse galmap.
How did you find your system with 2BH+NS? I canâ€™t get EDDB/bodies or Spansh/bodies to do a logical AND operation.
