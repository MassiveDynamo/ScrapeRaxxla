In the Codex there’s one NS reported in The Void, Flyae Proae LC-S d5-2
it’s a long way out!!

And The Void is galactic region 42 (https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_regions), and interestingly nearby is “Wagar’s Reach”. I found Void Passage and it’s on EDSM-star islands need 100ly jump range so plenty of jumponium!

But I’m sure I’ve seen another mention of “void”...
Edit: “void extract coffee” (can I have one with my lavian brandy please?) but think also something like “Silentium Void”...
Edit2: ah, “Solitude Void”, region 40, left of Silentium
