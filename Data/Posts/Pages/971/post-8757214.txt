Oops, while calculating the median point (-15554.59/ 1360.64 / 36418.45) of those two possibilites (in case the toast is taking place there on the stealth station) I just read properly the full EDSM description of the Carbon Star @ Goliaths Rest...it goes on to say...

“With its primary Neutron Star, this system serves as a distant point of departure for those trying to reach 3,000ly above the galactic plane. Nearby are multiple black holes and Neutron Stars reachable only with jumponium at the upper limits of the galactic ceiling.”

This sounds to me like a much likelier match for the second line!!!
I.e. we’re a legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters; if you’re a brave and competent pilot interested in joining us go to “the highest burning jewel (Carbon Star) on the brow of (above) the galaxy”, then jump to a NS on the edge of the galaxy (possibly also with a BH, since that really would be the deepest void!). We’ll be in touch....

Mmm, might need to engineer an exploraconda and go walkabout, though I do love my Phantom! Must stock up on Jumponium.
