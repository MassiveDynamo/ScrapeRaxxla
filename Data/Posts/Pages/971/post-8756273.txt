I'm on the way to Sag A to test solution 2, using the super massive black hole lensing to see if something appears when orienting your ship, black hole and destination point in a line. If nothing presents itself, I'll be taking on solution 1.
I did that like year ago. Well, spent like 20 mins only though, maybe missed some. Mostly I looked on remote galaxies.
