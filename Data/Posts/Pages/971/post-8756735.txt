I know lore and mythology suck and don’t seem to provide answers but there’s got to be a reason why we’ve been told to “read lore” and history so many times in the past.

The Zurara for example was possibly named after Gomes Eanes de Zurara, a Portuguese chronicler tasked with voyaging with Henry the Navigator, who apparently was fixated on locating Prester John (mentioned in Galnet article for Raxxla).

Zurara’s accounts were seemingly lost for a long time and found much later on in history. Perhaps drawing a parallel to The length of time the Zurara ship took to be rediscovered. It could be nothing but it is fun looking up the references the writers use.
