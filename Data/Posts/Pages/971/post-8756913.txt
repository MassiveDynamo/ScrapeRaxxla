Yes, SAP8 & data crystals crop up a lot but we found no way of opening/reading them. I believe some were dropped into the thargoid machine just in case with no result. Perhaps there’s another way-perhaps related to Guardian tech? I’m particularly intrigued by the Project Equinox data archive which seems to be set up for a search, but we have no clues yet on location. Maybe there’s another LP yet to be found...

Could well be that these crystals are discussed in detail in the FD internal lore book which was made available to Drew & the other authors (obviously to ensure the lore revealed in their books aligned with the FD game lore) but he/they can’t say more because of the NDA. However Drew has repeatedly said he knows nothing of Raxxla and FD reserved that to themselves; he didn’t have to say that & I don’t think he’s misleading us. It is possible that FD took his or the other books and used details therein without the authors knowledge for some reason we have yet to discover. But several attempts have been made to discover things in-game based on the books & so far no result. More bedtime reading!
