Edit: however the fly in the ointment is that I don’t think neutron boosting was in-game from the outset.
Remeber, this solution isn't to find Raxxla or constrains on its location or date believed to have been added to the game. We are only following a possible solution to the toast, what it will reveal we have no idea. This may be the mission to get an invite to TDW, who themselves are searching for Raxxla. From this premise, a starting point of 0,0,0 to a system on the very edge of the galaxy feels right. Similar to “made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs", a way to measure ones piloting and exploration skill.
