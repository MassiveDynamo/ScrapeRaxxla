Probably not important but I noticed that the name Imogen is used for the third time, for a Galnet character.

First: Imogen Gabrielini (aka Eccy G.), Aislings mother: https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/5f64d21fe255f63e2b17985a
Second: Dr Imogen Ryang, museum historian: https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/5c654c658e7e7d1ef82cf56c
Third: Imogen Luciana, Imperial Ambassador: https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/5f8eccd964813d010413e662

Coincidence or hidden message?
