I am looking at a system that is 2 black holes and a neutron star, very dangerous as you only will have a few minutes of flight time before you don't have enough fuel to return. The other candidate has a white and yellow scoopable and the planets have all the raw material to make jumponium. The second candidate is far easier to get to, but having the ability to scoop and make jumponium could be a designed helper from FDev, not sure.
