'Bad Gateway' link. I modded out a Phantom with FSD booster and AFMU, 64ly jump range and full on mats for jumponium.. I should be good.

Ah, sorry, did wonder if you could access it.
My Phantom was only 58ly cos I went prepared for bear. With 64ly you should have no problems, providing you dont crash into a star or planet!

Swoals IL-Y e0 would certainly suit the first line, but I’m pondering the second. What could count as the deepest void (with a NS) as viewed from there? The deepest void is above you-interplanetary space!

I’m still dubious about having to sell the data to TDW at SD. Since there was no return route planned for DW2 I returned via Colonia and sold my data to Jaques. I’m hoping I haven’t received the DW invitation without knowing, (presumably because I haven’t yet been to the second point), because I can’t rescan the first ... without restarting my character-ain’t going to happen! My young clone Tyko could do it I suppose...

I think I’ve died a couple of times since doing the DW2 expedition (on my drive to get RSI, arthritis and combat elite )... but perhaps if I travelled to the second point that might still count

Edit: however the fly in the ointment is that I don’t think neutron boosting was in-game from the outset.
