That's some heavy semantics you have going in there. Can you expand on that?

Since I had the same thoughts since a very long time now, I think he means the following :

"Raxxla" for example could be 6 ASCII characters anywhere behind a remark Symbol in a Code line. That's it. Just the word.
When asked if "Raxxla was in the game", DB could rightfully answer : "Yes".

After all, it's a remark somewhere in the Code, even if that was a Server-only piece of Code. It's part of the Game.
Exceedingly deceptive - but not outright lying. Not uncommon, far from it.

It's the same as DB telling an Investment Journalist during an Interview "[...]Look at Elite Dangerous. It’s now in its fifth financial year since it was released and every day there’s been a new story in the game, every week there’s been new content" [sic]
All during a time where new content was already (at best) coming once every 4-6 months.
Did DB lie directly? No, of course not. An OOBE doesn't do that, right?
There were cosmetic additions to ELITE every week. He just.... very creatively labeled those store items "content"

Semantics have often been very, very important around here
