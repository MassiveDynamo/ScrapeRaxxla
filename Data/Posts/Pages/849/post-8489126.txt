I also have considered that Raxxla, or the Omphalos Rift maybe, might be not just an asteriod, but perhaps an object INSIDE an asteroid.. something smaller like the Alien Artifact found in SOL, that leads us to the "gateway" or w.e...... Or a gateway lost inside an asteroid that colided with another asteroid and covered the mailbox....

That said, i've never gone asteriod cracking, only paintite mining lmao...

Im going to teach myself asteroid cracking one day and try going thru the Lave, Tionisla, ect asteroid belts and see what if anything i can find....
No. David Braben said Raxxla was available since beta end. No surface (Horizons) and no inside asteroids since mining overhaul is recent thing.
