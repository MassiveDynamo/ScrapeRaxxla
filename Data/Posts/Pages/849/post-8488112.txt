Yep. Raxxla is an asteroid, which is why we haven't managed to find it

No, dont have a mining laser. The Audet Somniare is over-engineered for jump range 70ly on fumes - not bad for an ASP Explorer - but it does mean limited mod cons

I also have considered that Raxxla, or the Omphalos Rift maybe, might be not just an asteriod, but perhaps an object INSIDE an asteroid.. something smaller like the Alien Artifact found in SOL, that leads us to the "gateway" or w.e...... Or a gateway lost inside an asteroid that colided with another asteroid and covered the mailbox....

That said, i've never gone asteriod cracking, only paintite mining lmao...

Im going to teach myself asteroid cracking one day and try going thru the Lave, Tionisla, ect asteroid belts and see what if anything i can find....
