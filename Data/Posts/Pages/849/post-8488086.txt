anyone know if its posible anywhere to search the galmap for specific stars?
I mean outside of the filters list?

Specifically, I want too look for Class M stars with "VI" or "VA" level luminosity....
1. In-game map
2. User maps like EDSM. Some people do copy of EDSM and can run own sql query on this like you need. Check explorers subforum. There is 1 guy doing that there, like drawing maps of W-R stars etc.
