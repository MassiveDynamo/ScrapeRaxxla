Got me peeking around corners and sniffing the air...

I had a shower before breaking into your ship!
And the fish odour has all gone from that old mask, though washing it at 60C seems to have shrunk it a bit. It only covers my nose now, but hey, good Covid protection!
You really should not leave the key in the landing strut well, itâ€™s the first place any good ninja looks.
At least I think it was your ship. There was no BRAYBEN in sight, and the occupier seemed very surprised to see me, had an Australian accent...
