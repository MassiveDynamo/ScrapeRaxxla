Well Beyond Chapter Four was released on December 11, 2018 - so possibly that one?

@Jorki Rasalas (or anyone!) - any idea which video this might be?
At my age my memory isnt good.To be honest it never was, and I’m currently suffering copawlot-induced sleep deprivation. @Han_Zen or @Rochester or @simulacrae are better bets.

But I vaguely remember some discussion, probably in this thread so a search here might turn up something together with relevant discussion, about an FD response to an issue which implied Raxxla is a planet. So maybe search the issues database also. I’d do it myself, but after my current mug of coffee I’m going to have a snooze....

I suspect we rejected it as a valid clue primarily because of the offhand nature of the response and the fact that the issues handlers don't seem to be aware of deeper issues in the game. It might also have been an intentional red herring. Raxxla might be a planet, or it may not. It was in Holdstock’s novella, but it seems that DB wasn’t/isn’t invested in Holdstock’s mythos and therefore might well have changed it to suit the current game. I still suspect a Guardian ark ship hidden in a planetary belt. It might have originally been implemented as a one-off ship design, but I suspect with later updates it may have been improved into an asteroid base/ship hybrid. If it has a terminal link to the Guardian AI comms network that would be really cool (see A B-W comment https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10138817 ).

See Edifying Will with Exo video....
