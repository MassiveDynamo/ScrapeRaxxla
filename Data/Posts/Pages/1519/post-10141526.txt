That's more than a tad dishonest. Considering Mutabilis, Alien Items, and Staus Quo have 200+ mentions of Raxxla between them. In fact, the Adder, Mamba, and Fer-de-lance have lore in-game heavily expanded upon by Oolite (regarding their less than legal origins). You can say that about the official novels. However, Holdstock and Wager are the single most prolific writers on Raxxla.

Authors are of course allowed to write what they want, in their fan fiction. The limitations of the writers NDA are only for the official books.
