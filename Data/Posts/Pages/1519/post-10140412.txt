There is a segment of systems around Axis Mundi which all have a naming attributed to either a sunken or lost kingdom, or some mythical land ‘beyond’ the map.

Some of these systems include ‘Atlantis’ itself; ‘Quivira’ one of the seven cities of gold! and a variety of other systems named after mythical lands.

It’s is my presumption, that this is a pretty big clue and is where the codex relates when it talks of these lands.

The fact that many other elements seem to correlate with this sector only raises this likelihood in my opinion.
