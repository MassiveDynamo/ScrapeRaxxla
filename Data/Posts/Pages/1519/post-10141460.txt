You need to read Premonition by Drew Wagar.

Briefly, they are a group of individuals manipulating mankind behind the scenes who hid the existence of the Thargoid threat, and encourage war between the super-powers in order to allow mankind to arm themselves whilst preparing a bolt hole for themselves in the form of the Exodus Project. As far as we are aware the concept of The Club came from FD themselves, though @drew may be able to confirm this better than I can.

but the book is worth the read, and it is also a kind of compendium of player action during the first few years of the game, so its interesting background for those who havent been in from the start.
