Well Beyond Chapter Four was released on December 11, 2018 - so possibly that one?

@Jorki Rasalas (or anyone!) - any idea which video this might be?
It wasn't a video. It was a joke letter from Universal Cartographic, posted on Twitter.

The text was something like, we have no information on the PLANET Raxxla.

The letter can be fond somewhere in the depths of this thread

Edit: I found it.
