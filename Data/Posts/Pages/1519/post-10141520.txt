The Authors were not permitted to discuss Raxxla and have no information about it. Drew has stated himself that he's none the wiser than we are.

His works are to be considered canon in so much as they relate to the game and are official publications sanctioned by FDev. To some extent, FDev have provided some guidelines to include certain details etc, but not given anything direct about Raxxla ot TDW. And Here The Wheel is written about a splinter group of TDW who set off to chase something else of the Authors devising (Soontil) as he wanted to write about TDW , and this was as close as he was allowed to get.
Premonition is a bit different to the other books. It was written much later and with much more FD involvement.
It's clear that Drew didn't get any inside info on Raxxla, even for that book. He did write a bit about the Dark Wheel, though. We can be pretty sure that this is accurate and FD approved.
The only interesting Raxxla info is that we learn that most haven't heard about it and those that have, generally don't believe in it's existence.

There is of course the possibility that book contains Raxxla hints, without Drew knowing it.
