It's not clear that all of them are directly sponsored by the Club. They might not even know it them self, but the Club are pulling the threads.

As Infrastructure says:
‘What do you think
all this was about? The clandestine technology acquisition aimed at ensuring
that necessary advances took place according to a certain timetable, fanning
the flames of war between the Federation and the Empire to ensure humanity
has a fleet that has a chance in the coming battle. The encouragement of the
space-faring masses to grow their skills in the Arena and weaponise their ships
courtesy of those oh-so-convenient “Engineers.” We don’t intend to allow
humanity to be cannon fodder in someone else’s war.’

Ah ok, see where you’re coming from.
Bill & Elvira were definitely active supporters of The Club from Drew’s books, but the passage you quote could mean that the The Club merely sponsored the other engineers to set up in business (those bases must have been expensive to construct) rather than implying them being active supporters; The Club are arch manipulators...

Could also just be an author’s plot device with no deeper meaning.
