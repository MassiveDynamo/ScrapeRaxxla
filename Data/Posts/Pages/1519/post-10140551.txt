I recall that for some period of time ‘Support’ called themselves that before going back to the more corporate ‘Support’.

Don’t believe it was an intentional joke. Personally I put the typo down to poor typing. Happens everyday, no one’s perfect.

Virginia Woolf’s grammar was terrible, her publisher had to revise her work constantly.

If we take everything so seriously we’ll be here forever.
