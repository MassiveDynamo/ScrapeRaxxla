The Authors were not permitted to discuss Raxxla and have no information about it. Drew has stated himself that he's none the wiser than we are.

His works are to be considered canon in so much as they relate to the game and are official publications sanctioned by FDev. To some extent, FDev have provided some guidelines to include certain details etc, but not given anything direct about Raxxla ot TDW. And Here The Wheel is written about a splinter group of TDW who set off to chase something else of the Authors devising (Soontil) as he wanted to write about TDW , and this was as close as he was allowed to get.
