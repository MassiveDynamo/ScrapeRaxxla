No, i dont care about the dark wheel toast. But the lore people are creating around the assumption that it has to do with raxxla. A neat treasure map that statistically given the number of stars , would be impossible to orchestrate unless all of these required local cultural stories and perspective of earth at a given time were taken into consideration.

And yes, it's possible Fdev went incredible uncreative here, threw out any notion of a believable game lore ... but i doubt that or it would be too easy to find raxxla. And fdev doesn't want anyone to find raxxla until fdev is ready for people to find raxxla - which is never if they're considering the benefits vs the cons.
Sad to say, I will repeat what I wrote here at the beginning of the year. Imagine if one of the players found/learned what Raxxla was.
What happens next ?
