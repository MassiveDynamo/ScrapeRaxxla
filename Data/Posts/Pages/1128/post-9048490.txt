I wonder if anyone has compared the number and threat level of NHSS in Coalsack vs the Pleiades, and if one area is higher numbers/has more of the higher threat NHSS than the other, which might be an indication of Klaxians vs Oresrians or the like. [Shurely those orangey sciency people must have live 3D "bubble" maps by now of where all the Thargoids are? And spreadsheets of things like the above? Moar spreadsheets! Eds.]

Heh, silly me, of course there are!

Unfortunately their 3D map seems to be kaput at the moment, the link only takes me to ad pages. And you have to install some suspicious Canoon eavesdropping software to send the data (and the less-suspicious EDSM), which if the map is not working not sure you can actually view at the moment?
