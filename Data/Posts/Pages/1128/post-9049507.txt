Right on Cmdr,

It is 1st April after all but there are some good sound reasonings here. A lot of which have already been discussed and proposed on this thread already, but probably not so eloquently and well referenced.

Just remember it may be obfuscated on the outer rim, along with the silent song of the spheres and maybe Mars or maybe not or maybe Odin or maybe oak trees....or space dragons.
