A few of my remarks may be irrelevant, but maybe someone will lead to the right thoughts, the collective mind is always good :
1. People usually base their ideas on the thoughts of other people, even science fiction writers.
2. one science fiction writer (I read it long ago, but I think it was Arthur Clarke) wrote about some artifacts found in the solar system (maybe it was Mars) and... I remember who first discovered it exclaimed: it is full of stars.
3. I remember that Clarke's works had something to do with India (if Raxxla is a proper name, it sounds very much like an Indian name) to me, like : Fountains of Paradise.
4. About the triangles : why 3 found systems where we all fly for minerals level 4, form on the map almost an equilateral triangle with a side of 500 ?
