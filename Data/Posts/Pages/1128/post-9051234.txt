Do you mean the DW Toast?

If so, it only makes sense to humans coz humans made the Toast up in the first place, English speaking humans at that. Whether its a treasure map or list of directions (like Da Vinci Code) or whether its supposed to be what you can see from the DW station or Raxxla Im not sure eg

Stand here and:
Look West to the Mother of All Galaxies
Look East to The Sirens of the deepest void etc etc

Or its just another imaginative story they tell themselves, maybe even honouring fallen comrades or just that every secret society has a version of the secret handshake or password or phrase to identify each other so could just be that.

It can be anything you want it to be, just like a lot of DW & Raxxla 'lore' in Elite and ED and probably EDO in time. Thats why its lasted so long and we are still looking for it.

The dark wheel doesn't know the location of raxxla. No living human does or the DW would have found it.

There is no map, or again, raxxla would have been found, as it's been searched for over a hundred years with nobody finding it.

Finding raxxla isn't going to lead to the dark wheel headquarters or vice versa because they're in the same search as all of us. They're as close to finding it as we are.

The only thing hinted at in the game is about the dark wheel's location. Not raxxla's. They're no closer linked currently than finding the location of you or me based on the idea that we're both looking for raxxla.
