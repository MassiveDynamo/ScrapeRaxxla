I'd be interested to hear the lore for why an alien planet/station/ship which either didn't exist until fairly recently and humans just found out about it or has existed since thargoids previously tried venturing in the area millions of years ago as they are apparently currently aware of it and we learned it from them or we found out about it via the martian artifact that is millions of years old and it somehow for some reason was placed in a way that would only make any sense on Earth circa human civilization since that's the only position in the galaxy (and time) where the constellations "solve" this treasure map.

Do you mean the DW Toast?

If so, it only makes sense to humans coz humans made the Toast up in the first place, English speaking humans at that. Whether its a treasure map or list of directions (like Da Vinci Code) or whether its supposed to be what you can see from the DW station or Raxxla Im not sure eg

Stand here and:
Look West to the Mother of All Galaxies
Look East to The Sirens of the deepest void etc etc

Or its just another imaginative story they tell themselves, maybe even honouring fallen comrades or just that every secret society has a version of the secret handshake or password or phrase to identify each other so could just be that.

It can be anything you want it to be, just like a lot of DW & Raxxla 'lore' in Elite and ED and probably EDO in time. Thats why its lasted so long and we are still looking for it.
