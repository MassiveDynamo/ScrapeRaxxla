I'd be interested to hear the lore for why an alien planet/station/ship which either didn't exist until fairly recently and humans just found out about it or has existed since thargoids previously tried venturing in the area millions of years ago as they are apparently currently aware of it and we learned it from them or we found out about it via the martian artifact that is millions of years old and it somehow for some reason was placed in a way that would only make any sense on Earth circa human civilization since that's the only position in the galaxy (and time) where the constellations "solve" this treasure map.
