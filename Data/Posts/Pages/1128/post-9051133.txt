Little bit of advice - stay on target, main problem I’ve encountered with Raxxla is that there are so many variants and influences it’s difficult not to get distracted. See it out to the end and follow your evidence, don’t get distracted by the various influences out there which will only muddy the waters and take you down some rabbit hole.
Definitely, I agree one hund...Look! Shiny thing!
