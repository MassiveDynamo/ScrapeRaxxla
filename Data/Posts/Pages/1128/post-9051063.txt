Hmm.
Since the first Elite 1 I can not understand why the ships are snakes and not birds or eventually fish ...
The snakes must be connected somehow ...

Right on Cmdr,

It is 1st April after all but there are some good sound reasonings here. A lot of which have already been discussed and proposed on this thread already, but probably not so eloquently and well referenced.

Just remember it may be obfuscated on the outer rim, along with the silent song of the spheres and maybe Mars or maybe not or maybe Odin or maybe oak trees....or space dragons.

I actually felt bad posting this on April 1st. I intend to do calculations this weekend with the top 5 matches for and post a follow-up early next week once we have search zones, a path forward, and regions of the galaxy involved. We'll figure more once we know this journey is going to entail.
