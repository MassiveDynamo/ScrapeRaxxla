This popped up on my YouTube list and I wasn't going to watch it but for some reason I did..

Very interesting video. MB the absolute master of saying very little and at the same time leaving us with more Qs than As and always that little hint that Raxxla is out there somewhere if we could just interpret what he is saying correctly, without actually saying Raxxla so it could be anything and always has plausible deniability. I think he has shares in tinfoil hes that good at it

Just for clarity, I aint complaining, little hints at what might be like this are what keep me engaged and the mystery alive.
