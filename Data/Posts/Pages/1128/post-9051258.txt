Do you mean the DW Toast?

If so, it only makes sense to humans coz humans made the Toast up in the first place, English speaking humans at that. Whether its a treasure map or list of directions (like Da Vinci Code) or whether its supposed to be what you can see from the DW station or Raxxla Im not sure eg

Stand here and:
Look West to the Mother of All Galaxies
Look East to The Sirens of the deepest void etc etc

Or its just another imaginative story they tell themselves, maybe even honouring fallen comrades or just that every secret society has a version of the secret handshake or password or phrase to identify each other so could just be that.

It can be anything you want it to be, just like a lot of DW & Raxxla 'lore' in Elite and ED and probably EDO in time. Thats why its lasted so long and we are still looking for it.

No, i dont care about the dark wheel toast. But the lore people are creating around the assumption that it has to do with raxxla. A neat treasure map that statistically given the number of stars , would be impossible to orchestrate unless all of these required local cultural stories and perspective of earth at a given time were taken into consideration.

And yes, it's possible Fdev went incredible uncreative here, threw out any notion of a believable game lore ... but i doubt that or it would be too easy to find raxxla. And fdev doesn't want anyone to find raxxla until fdev is ready for people to find raxxla - which is never if they're considering the benefits vs the cons.
