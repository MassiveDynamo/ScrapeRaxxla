May I suggest reading today's GalNet. The Omphalos is going to be important in a very big way here shortly. Rhea was Cronus' wife.

Someone had fun with Sophia Trevino

Sophia - wisdom

Trevino - “ The surname Trevino is derived from the Spanish word “treviño,” which has its roots in the Latin word “trivium,” meaning “meeting of three ways” or “crossroads.” This linguistic connection suggests an association with a geographical location where three roads converge.”

So earthquakes at Rhea with a reporter named - wisdom of the crossroads ….. They trying to tell us something?

Edit: Also Len Kennelly ….

Len short for Leonard? Lion hearted?

Kennelly - “The original Gaelic form of the name Kennelly is O Cinnfhaolaidh, which is derived from "ceann," which means "head," and "faol," which means "wolf."”

Ya i get a kick out of their name choices
