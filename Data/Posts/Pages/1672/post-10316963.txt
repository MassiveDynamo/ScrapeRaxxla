Very interesting consideration. Since it is found in the hyperspace jump it makes me wonder if that is a clue that you target it with a jump. That is to say, it's in a line from a star system (for example Sol) to the Guardian Galaxy. It is visible right in the Gal Map, but from manipulating the Gal Map it is very difficult to assess what direction it is in... from say Sol.

However, it is also visible in live in-game play. From in-game play, it is very easy to set a vector straight towards it. Since it is visible in-game, by guess-selecting star systems you can go in and see if the guess-selection target is pointing straight at the Guardian Galaxy.... Very interesting.

If the lower left white area (in my pic above) is indeed the Guardian Galaxy, then it appears to be at the lower side of the Milky Way galaxy plane. The last star , closest to there is at or around PRUAE DRYAE AI-Q D6-0 an F8 White star at 2,058 Ly from Alpha Centauri. 30 Jumps with my Anaconda.
