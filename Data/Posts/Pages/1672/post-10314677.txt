This morning I did a SC from Tionisla astroid belt targeting the Fortuna system, but at 0.1 to 0.4 Ly's I didn't find anything.
.
I went for Alpha Cygni. I think it has a connection to the old words. It aligns almost perfectly with the Zaonce - Riedquat line and lies 1489 ly (rearranged 1984) from Tionisla.
The old worlds are very deliberately placed. Lave has a Right ascension: 13h 37m. 1337 is LEET (leet speak for Elite). The systems are also placed to align the original galaxy map perfectly with the current grid. Up on the old map is coreward.

I think the systems might be a map or a compass or something?

Haven't found anything 0.1 ly out yet.
