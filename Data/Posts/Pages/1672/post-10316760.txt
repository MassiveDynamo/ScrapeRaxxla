After some deliberation i have decided that i think the image is that of the "Guardian Galaxy", here depicted on the left.
(the right one being the "Thargoid Galaxy" as evidenced by the markings found on barnacles)



Here's the thing: On the launcher are those very galaxies above, and as literal some clues are in the game, i am absolutely certain that is no coincidence.


What implications or significance there is, i have no idea. I do know that the two galaxies have grown in size over the years.
(they were barely visible in the beginning, and much less pronounced)


Raxxla is in the launcher.
