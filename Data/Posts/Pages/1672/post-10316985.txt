If the lower left white area (in my pic above) is indeed the Guardian Galaxy, then it appears to be at the lower side of the Milky Way galaxy plane. The last star , closest to there is at or around PRUAE DRYAE AI-Q D6-0 an F8 White star at 2,058 Ly from Alpha Centauri. 30 Jumps with my Anaconda.
The two galaxies are the Magellanic clouds. They have always been in the sky box and were added as background for the launcher with the last major release.

The clouds are dwarf galaxies and technically part of the Milky way. The are outside of the region we can target in the galmap.
Lore vise the LMC or SMC could well be the original home of the Thargoids. We know the Guardians evolved near the Regor sector. Thy are not form the SMC. Only possibility there, is that some of them escaped there.
In game, we have no way of checking any of this. We don't even know if there are actual systems in the MCs. The could be just images in the sky box / galmap.

It's not entirely unreasonable to think that a portal (alien construct / Omphalos rift) on Raxxla could be a gateway to one or both the MCs. That just leaves us with the problem of finding Raxxla again.
