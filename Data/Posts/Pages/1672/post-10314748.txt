Speculative question since there's a lot of talk today about expectations:

If Raxxla were finally discovered, or even revealed by Fdev, but it isn't what the majority here had expected, would you:

a) want to know everything anyway
b) want to only know that it definitely can be found, but nothing else
c) not know of the discovery at all so that you can retain the full fun of the mystery, including the speculation over whether it even exists, for as long as possible
