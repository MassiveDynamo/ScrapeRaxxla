After some deliberation i have decided that i think the image is that of the "Guardian Galaxy", here depicted on the left.
(the right one being the "Thargoid Galaxy" as evidenced by the markings found on barnacles)

Here's the thing: On the launcher are those very galaxies above, and as literal some clues are in the game, i am absolutely certain that is no coincidence.


What implications or significance there is, i have no idea. I do know that the two galaxies have grown in size over the years.
(they were barely visible in the beginning, and much less pronounced)


Raxxla is in the launcher.

Very interesting consideration. Since it is found in the hyperspace jump it makes me wonder if that is a clue that you target it with a jump. That is to say, it's in a line from a star system (for example Sol) to the Guardian Galaxy. It is visible right in the Gal Map, but from manipulating the Gal Map it is very difficult to assess what direction it is in... from say Sol.

However, it is also visible in live in-game play. From in-game play, it is very easy to set a vector straight towards it. Since it is visible in-game, by guess-selecting star systems you can go in and see if the guess-selection target is pointing straight at the Guardian Galaxy.... Very interesting.
