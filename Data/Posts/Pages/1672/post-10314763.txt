One of my (unserious) theories holds that we discovered Raxxla years ago but it was so unimpressive that no-one noticed, and Frontier haven't wanted to break the news to us.
I don't have any particular expectations for what it is, and certainly don't expect it to be a game-changing discovery, so I can't really be disappointed if it isn't that.
I'd find reading about how someone did find it (and what'd they'd tried/thought of that no-one else had) to be interesting regardless.
