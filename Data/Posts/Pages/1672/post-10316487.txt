I tried the 0.1 Ly (actually 0.1 to 0.14) SC from the Tionisla sun pointed towards Fortuna, Tyche, Moirai, Clotho, Lachesis, Atropso, Fates, and Wyrd. I also targeted Fortuna from 1/2 way between the Tioinsla Sun and the first planet.

None of these turned up Rafe Zetters Anaconda / home.

I have a few more to try but, am starting to think it's either not there or The Lady of Fate is not a clue for a marker. Time to think more like Rafe than like Alex?
