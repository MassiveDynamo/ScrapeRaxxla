Only that it seems to me this a likely meta consequence of the storyline. Ram Tah told us there were Guardian arkships and explorers, we are told an alien artefact was found on Mars, hence aliens visited Sol and got here somehow.....did they ever leave? Is the in-game triangular PF motif proof the Guardian AI is behind the evolution of humanity? Does lavian brandy go down smoothly?

As for what happens when/if we find Raxxla? Who knows? I’m not fully convinced the CMs do!

Right, enough of this jocularity, I’m off to the dentist! (Tooth broke coffee time Sunday, stem ginger cookies are dangerous things!!)

Edit: and gypsy rose jorki is predicting bad things are going to happen to the Alexandria very soon!
