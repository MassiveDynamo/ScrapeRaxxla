Raxxla is fake. There is no such thing as Raxxla. I am 99% sure. We have been lied to. The codex mentiones two things.
1) Fernweh. It is the opposite of homesick or the feeling of nostalgia. Fernweh is literally translated pain to far away. A need for the unknown. A desire to leave familiar circumstances and open up to the wide world. So Ferweh is actually homesick for a place you've never been to.

2) The Omphalos Rift. It has nothing to do with Raxxla. It just wants to point out the Omphalos Syndrom, a syndrom where people believe themselves that they divinely appointed the center of the universe. It shows its symptoms in the history of cartography as often as in ancient city planning. It happend in ancient and modern mapping, stories, religions, ... It's basicly people believing they found the centre of the universe, earth, ... It's basicly us thinking we found the location of Raxxla with some theory.

I think with those 2 things Fdev wants to make something clear. Everytime you ask Fdev about Raxxla they say something in the lines of that it lies withing the explorers instincts.
I believe they kept the Raxxla myth up to motivate us to explore and it worked. I don't think Raxxla is realy in the game. They often joke about it, act super mysterious about it, ... It doesn't exist.
