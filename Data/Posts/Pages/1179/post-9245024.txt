What's up with Tau Ceti. Avogadro Enterprise is now orbiting Tau Ceti 4 while there is a Tau Ceti 6 and 'Starty Mcstart Planet' with 'Starty McOrbital'.

(I had previously spent a reasonable amount of time trying to see if anything was near to Avogadro Enterprise with no joy)

& you spend all this time waiting for Raxxla, and 3 turn up at once...
