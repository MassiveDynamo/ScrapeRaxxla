I think I am 100% sure the Thargoids build Raxxla. Think about it, they mastered hyperspace and probably invented hyperdrive technology. They can jump very large distances and hover in witch-space. When they first encountered the Guardians, they needed to retreat because they weren't prepared for a big war. Don't get me wrong they had weapons and used it against defenceless Guardians, but they couldn't fight the Guardians in a militairy campaign. So maybe they weren't combat oriÃ«nted? Also it appears the stronger interceptors are older that the weaker interceptors. So they downgraded there ships? Why? Maybe they don't seek out war. I mean if you are aggressive you would bring some strong weapons at least all the time.

Thargoids are very smart creatures, yet there ships still attack anything Guardian related. Again Why? They know the Guardians are gone right? Are there even Thargoids in those Interceptors? Why else bother attacking Guardian tech. If they are drones, How can they control the drones so far out? Their behavior is like an AI (I know, I know they are NPC's but they have the same patern every time). Something to them seems... odd.
