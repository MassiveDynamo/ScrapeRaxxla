Good luck with the dentist!

As for predictions about what it would mean if Raxxla was unlocked... well, from a game perspective, it would probably open access to another region of the milky way, maybe to establish a new bubble of colonized world as a counter balance to the original bubble. Kinda like what happened with Colonia, just that the Raxxla bubble would be primarily used to have new narratives playing out, giving the devs a chance to experiment with new things without having to touch the already established space around Sol.
