Just thinking about the comment by the CM about the "payoff has to be great" for finding Raxxla. What could that be? We can eliminate some things:
more credits would be meaningless (and have been for quite some time now, since they borked the economy long ago)
more ships would be largely meaningless, except access to alien ones perhaps?
access to alien technology - well we are already getting that to some extent for weapons anyways via Aegis et al, so other than new ships or fast travel wormholes or the like probably would be meaningless - is there some other in-game tech that might be beneficial?
access to locked sectors - this one checks a big checkbox. Particularly if Raxxla is a portal of some sort that allows travel to, say Bovomit Sector, where you can actually interact with (and not just shoot) aliens, and get access to their ships and other technologies, plus many new exploration activities/mysteries
access to a completely new RNG alien galaxy, perhaps as a lead-in to a new version of Elite?

Can't think of much else that would be a large meaningful payoff. Other than maybe a new option appearing on the system map to turn off Fleet Carriers?

Any other ideas? I know Jorki has been thinking about his Guardian arkship,,,
