Raxxla is fake. There is no such thing as Raxxla. I am 99% sure. We have been lied to. The codex mentiones two things.
1) Fernweh. It is the opposite of homesick or the feeling of nostalgia. Fernweh is literally translated pain to far away. A need for the unknown. A desire to leave familiar circumstances and open up to the wide world. So Ferweh is actually homesick for a place you've never been to.
Isn't that more like Wanderlust?
