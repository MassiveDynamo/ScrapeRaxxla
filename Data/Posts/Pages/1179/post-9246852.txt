i dont think you'll even get a real narrative impact. If they were smart about it, it would be something that disappears again after being found and placed in some new random location. Where the only news story they need to talk about is some uncorroborated stories about someone finding the legendary raxxla but that it vanished before they could get close enough to it to do anything and that it's likely a hoax. They could even make it so that there is no clear screenshot or anything like that possible (and anyone who found it would have to be recording already since they wont get a second chance).

1000% that is how fdev should roll with raxxla. Maybe there is some way to stop it from disappearing? who knows...and testing requires re-finding it. The hunt continues...as does the mystery. That's the best case scenario we can hope for i think.
