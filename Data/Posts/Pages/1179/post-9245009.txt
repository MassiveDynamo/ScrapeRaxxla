But to be honest, it's been 6 years. We have been searching for 6 years. Turned every clue upside down, usually twice. Haven't found a single thing except maybe https://canonn.science/codex/communication-array-delta-69/?highlight=gravit , https://canonn.science/codex/transmitter-vjs-81/ and maybe https://canonn.science/codex/crashed-ship/?highlight=gravit . But those clue's don't exactly tell much information. I think we can wrap it up.
