I think introducing a new region of major interest to every ingame faction/superpower is needed in the long run. Because I don't think they are going to touch the status quo in the bubble. Many player factions have made it their home, so having it all change drastically due to war between the superpowers and/or alien attacks, will probably not go over well with most of these factions if their home system is going up in flames. So... using something like Raxxla to unlock something outside the bubble is giving the devs a playground where they can have play out all the things not possible in the original bubble: Alliance, Feds and Empire going at each other in a full scale conflict (because if it is a fair bit away from the home systems in the bubble, they can still keep the fragile peace between them), alien and crazy AI guardian invasions, NPC factions rising up but also disappearing/wiped out, etc. And they will probably have to keep player factions out of it, so they can do all these sweeping changes without anyone losing any assets.

Narratively speaking, the game needs this to break up the stagnant situation we have right now.
