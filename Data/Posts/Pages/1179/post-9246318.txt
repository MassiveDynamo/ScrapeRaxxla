Good luck with the dentist!

As for predictions about what it would mean if Raxxla was unlocked... well, from a game perspective, it would probably open access to another region of the milky way, maybe to establish a new bubble of colonized world as a counter balance to the original bubble. Kinda like what happened with Colonia, just that the Raxxla bubble would be primarily used to have new narratives playing out, giving the devs a chance to experiment with new things without having to touch the already established space around Sol.
I like the idea of unlocking access to a new region of the galaxy. FD have said only one galaxy is implemented so no travel to Magellanic Clouds or Andromeda. It would make sense, if Raxxla is a guardian ship, for it to unlock the area/s where the Guardian AI and exiles went to. That would have the potential to open up new technology etc so definitely “alien riches” from the original novella and a big payoff.

Edit
And since there are several of those large locked areas the boost in gameplay would be meaningful. I have pondered why the original “10 year plan” for the game doesn't match the slow progress and amount of universe visited to date (think its now up to 0.05%?).
