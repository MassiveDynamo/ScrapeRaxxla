So, having made the assumption that The Dark Wheel and Raxxla are directly connected, I'm setting off from Sol to Delphi, via economic travel, in search of Gas Giants with 8+ moons. Once at Delphi I will search the Pleiades also for TDW.

I will bookmark all systems I come across with Gas Giants with 8+ moons.
