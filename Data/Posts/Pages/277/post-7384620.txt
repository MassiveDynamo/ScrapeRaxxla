It should be added that Bees were also a symbol of the „Galli“ (wasn’t there something about Gallia a few pages ago?) the castrate priests of Cybele who took part in the annual festivities surrounding the cult of Attis/Cybele. I once read the bee might have been chosen as a symbol because after the marriage she keeps the male part of her murdered partner to reproduce. Another symbol for fertility.
