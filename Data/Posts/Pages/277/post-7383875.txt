This is the curse of Raxxla isn't it? There is so much depth in clues that all seem to lead to dead ends. Nothing makes sense... Until the day it does, the day you realize that it's been right in front of you the whole time but out of reach... The journey is the key to the destination... Everyone one of you need to ask yourself the question: Is this journey the key to untold fortunes or the key to Pandora's box ? Are you willing to lose it all to find out? It requires experience to see what is right in front of you. A journey that will stretch through the entirety of your Pilot's Federation career... Some of you probably don't even realize that you we selected precisely for this journey... Did you just think someone would give you a ship with an unlimited number of rebuys without a reason? While you are out toying around in conflict zones the Elites are pulling at the strings holding together the fabric of the Universe. It takes a seasoned explorer to spot the inconsistencies... While you are on your journey searching the depths of space or the comforts of the bubble for clues you are creating the key... A condition that must be met before your master... My master... Will show you the door that has been at the tip of your nose since day one but always out of reach. Do you remember it?
