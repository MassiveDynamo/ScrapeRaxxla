Uranus and Gaia are Rhea's parents. And Rhea gave the Omphalos stone to her husband Chronus, to save Zeus, her son, from being eaten by Cronus.

The solar system has the following bodies or factions that have names that are related to the Raxxla codex: Mars (alien artifact found), Persephone, Pluto (aka. Hades), Rhea, Uranus, and the faction Mother Gaia.
