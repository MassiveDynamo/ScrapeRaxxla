When I read Raxxla Codex page I thought that Raxxla location may be limited by old ships moving/jump range or max overall distance. Especially for Art's ship. So it is somewhere near Tau Ceti. Not at the one jump distance. More! For example 5-10 jumps. But then I found translation issue with this Codex page. Art said "...Может, по дороге еще на Raxxla заедем?!" in my localization. It's mean: "Maybe by the way we will stop in Raxxla?!" with expression. Then I read English version: "Maybe we should go find Raxxla while we're at it!" Translations aren't equivalent! They may find Raxxla or stop in it? Huge difference. So English version probably is more right. By the context of whole title I think Art and Cora wasn't know where is it.

My mistake after all. I missed meaning of that phrase even in my own language.
