I don't think a hack was used. It was a glitch in the code for the Orthus, that made it sit there and do nothing.

Orthus the two headed dog, may well hint to a combination of human and thargoid tech. Possibly even a human pilot.

I wonder if there is going to be a Cerberus again?
There is still a Cerberus.
This is an old recruitment. We now have a gold anti xeno trophy now too
