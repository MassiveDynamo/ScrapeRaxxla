"...Far-seeing Soma flows, the Steer, the Lord of hymns, the Furtherer of day, of morning, and of heaven.
Mixt with the streams he caused the beakers to resound, and with the singers' aid they entered Indra's heart.
On, with the prudent singers, flows the ancient Sage and guided by the men hath roared about the vats.
Producing Trita's name, may he pour forth the meath, that Vāyu and that Indra may become his Friends.
He, being purified, hath made the Mornings shine: this, even this is he who gave the rivers room.
He made the Three Times Seven pour out the milky flow: Soma, the Cheerer, yields whate’er the heart finds sweet.
Flow, onward, Soma, in thine own celestial forms, flow, Indu, poured within the beaker and the sieve..."

Uhh this just goes on and on. There's entire chapter about taking Onionhead in Rig-Veda. Eagles on Onionhead, Pole-star Moon-god on Onionhead, it's flowing in and out of all holy mountains and rivers, and around the Milky Way galaxy too. I have to ask my yoga instructor about this...

(In case you're wondering what's written on Avesta, sacred writings of the Zoroastrianism, guess what: Zarathrustra's on Onionhead too. )
