Beautiful.
I've always liked the onion metaphor. It's funny how on Elite it's OnionHead, as if the addition of head is alluding to what layers we are trying to peel.

"The onion is used metaphorically to describe sequentially removable layers that conceal an important something. That is, when we use a metaphor involving an onion - such as "peeling away another layer" - we visualize a central concept (a heart or core) that is buried beneath an organized series of increasingly central issues or arguments.
One progresses inward in understanding from surface issues to deepertruths. When we "get to the bottom" of something - finding its "root" or "kernel" of truth - we are finally exposing that which is most shielded from view. This differs from "opening one's eyes" or "letting some fresh air in", in that the onion offers a series of seemingly valid mistruths, rather than a singular misconception. This also differs from a "higher truth" in that each step in a heightened understanding does not totally invalidate the prior; rather, it reveals that it was simply incomplete."
