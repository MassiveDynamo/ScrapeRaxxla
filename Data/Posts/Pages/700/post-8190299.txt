Two things about the Orthrus that likely played into its removal. 1, a player used hacks to kill it and 2 another player respectfully and tactically killed it with the help of a friend. Orthrus was not designed to be killed best we could tell. Likely removed til further development.
I don't think a hack was used. It was a glitch in the code for the Orthus, that made it sit there and do nothing.

Orthus the two headed dog, may well hint to a combination of human and thargoid tech. Possibly even a human pilot.

I wonder if there is going to be a Cerberus again?
