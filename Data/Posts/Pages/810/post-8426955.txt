thanks, hadn't spotted the time, just dived straight into the vid.
Doesnt actually say anything that we havent said in this thread many times. It's nice to have a mystery to chase, the hunt is where the fun lies & finding it might be disappointing, good if one person finds it and perhaps exploits it somehow, maye not so good if many find it, would be nice for finding it to start a whole new mystery...
