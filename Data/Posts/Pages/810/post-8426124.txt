It doesnt necessarily autocorrect. It will take you to a system that starts with whatever was typed or has whatever was typed in system like a planet or station name. For example if you type of Meredith City into the search bar lft 926 will come up. If you type PSR and search you can keep searching it'll cycle through all of the psrs


Yea I knew of the mechanic if you typed in say crab nebula it'll take you to a star within crab nebula. I've never seen it actually take you to a completely different named star when typing what he demonstrated.
