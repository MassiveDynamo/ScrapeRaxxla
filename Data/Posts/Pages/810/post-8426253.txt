Sadly, I can't say that I'm actually back. I was logging into a bunch of sites to update passwords. I'd have to say that it's been over a year since I've done any serious playing or contemplating the mystery of Raxxla. Frontier's stance regarding the place of Lore in Elite Dangerous pretty much put a nail in the coffin for my passion for the game. Lore has always been a huge part of Elite starting with The Dark Wheel Novella and all the way to releasing eight books to go along with the latest version of the game.

I had a lot of fun with Elite and hanging out with all of you on the forums. On the bright side I've lost about 14 kilograms (30 pounds) since stepping away from the game and now use the hours that I once spent each day piloting the galaxy to be more physically active and engaged in my family's lives. No complaints. Fly dangerous, CMDRs.

Congratulations on breaking the loop.
