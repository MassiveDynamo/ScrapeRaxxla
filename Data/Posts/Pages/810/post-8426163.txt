Yea I knew of the mechanic if you typed in say crab nebula it'll take you to a star within crab nebula. I've never seen it actually take you to a completely different named star when typing what he demonstrated.

It happens because there are several different observatories, universities and national space agencies which have quite different catalouging techniques and names. For example if you write HD 91316 to your galaxy map, it will show you my jewel, which is looking upon our galaxy from top. The Id of the stars in the Henry Draper catalogue is HD. HIP 51624 is the reference name for the jewel in the Hipparcos Star Catalogue. Rho Leonis is the Bayer Classification for the star.
