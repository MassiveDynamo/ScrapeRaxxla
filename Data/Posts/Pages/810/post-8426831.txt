It's most probably a bug, but on the galmap, in realistic mode, when I select a system, its star is being doubled or tripled. It happened few times where I am:
LBN 623 sector IH-V C2-14

Any of you experienced this?

Edit:Can't upload photos or videos for now. Forum issue...
It shows the other stars in the system when you target it in the galmap
