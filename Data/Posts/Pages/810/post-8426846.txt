Tip off missions (i believe is what you mean) have so far been inconclusive. I almost always chase them down when I get them just in case though

Yes, I’ve done a few in the past, but never consistently (have refused a few) & definitely not gone looking for them. The “mysterious stranger” phrase is enticing, might well fit TDW, but does the type of mission? And if so would it be the total number of them done? The geographic spread? Is there a count for these in the Cmdr stats?
