Well im on route to a star that shouldnt be here that i noticed I have it book marked however I have never bookmarked a star in the Hercules section of space this far above the plane....this star should be toward Barnards loop! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta1_Orionis_C also notice the lack of a HIP or HD number which it very well should have which would make this system not searchable but why, stellar forge named the systems by their HD and HIP names which means this was manually edited HD 37022 HIP 26221, if you search by these designations they have no results, first visited in 2016 and total 14 ships have ever entered the system according to EDSM, might not even be mapped fully

Also note the constalation of Hercules, not seens from sol like the others and has a strange resembling faction "Keystone of Hercules" which looks familiar ish

This area notable in Dr Who for a suprisingly linked space statioon name https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_in_Space

more thinfoil below

Remember Michael Brooks always had the phraze "Winter is Coming" in reference to Game of Thrones, well it happens so far every system iv jumped through on route happens to have been first mapped by Jon_Snow...most likely coincidence but weird all the same

That ‘Alien’ Signal? New Observations Are Coming Up Empty.
A strong radio spike from a sunlike star took the Internet by storm. But so far, follow-up looks have been raining on that parade.
