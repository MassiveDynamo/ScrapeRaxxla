There are many hypotheses and theories in this thread, take your pick. Nobody has any better idea than anyone else. There are some potential holes in my own current line of thought which I want to explore before disclosure.

P.S. I suggest you bug report the “planet” phrasing difference between the English and Russian versions of the Codex and see what/if there is any response. FD are clearly misleading a lot of people, albeit possibly unintentionally!

The trouble with the planet hypothesis is that, although it complies with the old lore, Raxxla was inserted into the game at gamma & so before the actual first full release version, and well before Horizons which was the first version where we could land on planets. I can’t see them inserting into gamma something that was basically inaccessible to the playerbase (& they wouldn’t have been able to test it themselves)
