Did you hear what the trouble Ian Bell had with Braben after putting up the original Elite source on his webpage....yeah now imagine being under NDA doing it with Raxxla.....
I sincerely hope I am wrong, finding it will be a highlight of the game. It’s hard to explain how deep elite runs in my being. At a little over 50yrs old it’s played a part in my life since I was around 15yrs old. Back then I only had second hand experience of it but it stuck with me. So it’s far from a flippant comment when I say I dint believe it can be kept secret but I hope I am wrong.
