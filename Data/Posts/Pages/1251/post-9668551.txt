On day one, there weren't anything like asteroid stations in the game. Also the object files were not encrypted. Players could see all station types in the game, in plain text.

If Raxxla still is the same as it was on day one, it has to be a regular mundane object.

If I were to bet,my money would be on:
Small planet
Very long orbit
Not scannable

These are things that does not require any special objects / models. It's just settings that can be flipped on a standard body. It also means you can put it in any system you like, without real danger of anyone bumping into it.

FD may of course have switched to a more exotic object, at a later stage.

Mmm
If Santa visits Raxxla is one of the reindeer an exotic Dancer?
