Most versions of Elite included several optional missions for the Galactic Navy.[25] One requires tracking down and destroying a stolen experimental ship;[21] another involves transporting classified information on the Thargoids' home planet, with Thargoid invasion ships doing their best to see that you do not succeed throughout the duration of the mission involving multiple interplanetary jumps.[27] Rewards differed depending on the mission - from cash, gems to esoteric hardware such as a cloaking device.

Q1: is the information on wikipedia correct?
Q2: does anyone remember such a mission ... what was the name of the planet to which we delivered secret data? I no longer remember all the tasks there, or I had a different version
