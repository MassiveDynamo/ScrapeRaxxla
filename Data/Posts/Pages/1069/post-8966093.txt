Well done!
I think you get this “invisible” PilotsFederation ranking through either Thargoid bashing or Rescuing passengers from burning stations; I did some of both. Read that somewhere, didn’t investigate it.
So you decreased rank with two factions on increased rank with PilotsFederation? Seems odd!
From the spelling differences and organisation types it looks like there may be from 4 to 6 “versions” of PF. It would be interesting to explore via missions in AY Indi etc to see if operations there make any difference.
I suspect PF is a hidden superpower, linked to the AI of the Guardian emigrants (from the triangular/hexagonal symbol’s that flash up on the nav panel before alphameric text appears). Wonder if there’s a way to explore this?

Some time ago I did raise a ticket with FD to try and identify if the spellings of factions (given the above as an example) were correct and not a typo. The response (I’ll endeavour to dig it out) indicated that all spellings were correct, so this ‘hidden’ faction, by FD’s confirmation is real!

Im in no mind to attack Thargoids, I still believe they don’t pose a threat and any action against them will only exasperate things. I may however go back to rescuing... an honourable diversion.
