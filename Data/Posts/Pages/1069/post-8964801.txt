Ok, I think I have just crashed the servers.

I was exploring the 20 H moon; I was at the north pole of the moon, I pointed my nose straight up, then I disabled Supercruise.

My ship started accelerating and then the game crashed. Now the servers are gone.

EDIT: I assume it's just a programming error; something unexpected I did.
