Well done!
I think you get this “invisible” PilotsFederation ranking through either Thargoid bashing or Rescuing passengers from burning stations; I did some of both. Read that somewhere, didn’t investigate it.
So you decreased rank with two factions on increased rank with PilotsFederation? Seems odd!
From the spelling differences and organisation types it looks like there may be from 4 to 6 “versions” of PF. It would be interesting to explore via missions in AY Indi to see if operations there make any difference.
I suspect PF is a hidden superpower, linked to the AI of the Guardian emigrants (from the triangular/hexagonal symbol’s that flash up on the nav panel before alphameric text appears). Wonder if there’s a way to explore this?

Thanks.

But it wasn't necessarily a decrease when I allied with the PilotsFederation. It was simply a change in status as I don't have the comparison values to verify if it went up or down. So all of them could be positively influenced by an increase of status with the PF.

I've also edit the original post to include Operation Less Than Three alignment of the factions.
