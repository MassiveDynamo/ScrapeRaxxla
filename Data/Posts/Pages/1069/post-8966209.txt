Dredging up a thread from a while back @Jorki Rasalas, as I just received notification that I've become an Ally of PilotsFederation in my 'inbox' and took a screen shot for you as I recalled you'd posted about it a bit ago. I'm also suspicious as there is no details, nor can I find where that ranking is stored?

SPOILER: PILOTSFEDERATION - ALLY



I checked my log, and there is no entry for the message, just the kills, and the hand-in bond reward.

{ "timestamp":"2021-02-23TZ", "event":"FactionKillBond", "Reward":10000, "AwardingFaction":"$faction_PilotsFederation;", "AwardingFaction_Localised":"Pilots' Federation", "VictimFaction":"$faction_Thargoid;", "VictimFaction_Localised":"Thargoids" }

{ "timestamp":"2021-02-23TZ", "event":"RedeemVoucher", "Type":"CombatBond", "Amount":336000, "Faction":"PilotsFederation" }

Not only that, I've been tracking my minor faction adjustments to see if anything note worthy might occur that might help identify potential TDW (rings?). Now aside from fighting for Jupiter & Silver legal in the recent CG, I haven't done or touched anything for the rest of the factions in the image below (to the best of my knowledge). All I have done, is equip my Krait MK2 for AXI and fly lots of hops to Asterope where I've started my initial steps of defending against the Thargoid threat for humanity.

This is when I received the allied notification, but doesn't explain the reputation changes below, unless they are perhaps aligned fore and against the PilotFederation? Unfortunately I don't have a screen shot to perform a delta against to show the % +/- of the change below to help narrow that possibility.





So questions arise:
1. I assume others have also received 'ally' status for PilotFederation? Was it also fighting Thargoids, or doing something else at the time?
2. Has anyone else tracked a change in minor faction rep that might highlight a 'common' faction from my list, specifically when they've been doing other things elsewhere that are un-related directly to these factions?

I had gotten a combat bond or two from the Jupiter cg while fighting against them which was odd, also got Allied with "Pilots Federation" during it, While also being allied with "PilotsFederation" through rescue and thargoid hunting, Also when doing bounty hunting in Dezhra i have gotten text to state i was made an Ally from the "PILOTS FEDERATION" In cap text in the message instead of the cg's lower case message, what ios the 4th one and where do you know?

(Edit Found the fourth) its Pilots Federation Local Branch and a fifth below this one is based in Dromi and the only one I have no standings with yet
