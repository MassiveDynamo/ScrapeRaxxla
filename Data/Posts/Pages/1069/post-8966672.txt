Yes I know about black flight however I am talking about the Pilots Federation minor faction there which would be separate to Black flight that is federation aligned


I've just put Emperor's Dawn in there... doesn't mean I can get there or the other player in that squadron...

And the Pilot(s) Federations listed on their squadron page have also been entered by the person who runs the squadron....

Apologies if I am missing something, but that's all user created on Inara...?
