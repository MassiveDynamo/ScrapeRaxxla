Something is profoundly wrong with the physics in Sifi KO-G b24-5.

I feel like I'm going mad because it feels as if everything is in the wrong place. The radar acts really weird, things that should recede stay in place.

The distances feel completely off, as if the shown values are wrong? The speed seems off.
When I tried to land on a moon, it took extremely long until I dropped into a glide. I was already almost at the surface!

I have a hunch that the system has non-euclidean geometry?
