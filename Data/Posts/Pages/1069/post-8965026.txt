Fun fact.

Raxxla has been actually found in a previous games and "xx" in it wasn't letters but a symbols.


The planet name was Rainla

Fun fact, The frontier/David Braben/Ian Bell Raxxla was never found, during the time gap between the original games alot of fan art mods created different raxxlas and input them into the old games
