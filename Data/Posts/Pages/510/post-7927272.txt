They are reckless and irresponsible and are the death of all things.
It's no wonder they got backing from all 3 super powers. They have the Imps gun ho attitude, the greed of the feds and the child like naiveity of the aliance, all rolled into one comedy villain bundle.
I can picture their CEO sat behind his desk rubbing his hands and chuckling with Marc Labbett....."ha ha ha...Who cares how many independent pilots died? These meta alloys are going to make me a fortune! The thargoids? Go and get reinforcements? Come back in unimaginable numbers and swarm the bubble? Meh! The independent pilots will sort it out eventually. If 90% of humanity is wiped out...so be it! Ha ha ha ha!"
With allies like Aegis, who needs the evil men on Raxxla!
Yes, I know pilots dont die, they just respawn....but that's not the point
