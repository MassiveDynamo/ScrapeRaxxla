What is Raxxla? We have no clue. I think this is the most important question to answer around our favorite legend.

Let's analyze: we know that The Dark Wheel exists. We know The Dark Wheel is associated with Raxxla. We do not know much more about The Dark Wheel other than their apparent opposition to The Club. The extent of their relationship with The Club is unknown, but currently seem to be at odds. We know The Club controls most of the information that we receive in game, including Galnet and Universal Cartographics.

Speculation:
The Club and The Dark Wheel were both created out of the conflict of the discovery of Raxxla. I believe Raxxla is some sort of FSD tech, as theorized in other recent posts. The Club have shown a lot of interest in supressing FSD tech over the past few centuries. I think they posses "raxxla" (omphalos rift or similar) and wish to control this tech for reasons unknown. TDW is attempting to expose this info and get better fsd tech into the hands of humanity. Most of the information we get in game about raxxla and the codex is part of the obfuscation: these are Club attempts to discredit and and confuse discovery efforts.

This theory goes pretty deep with a lot of corroborating evidence. I am currently in the process of making a write up, will put out in a week or so.

What are your sources of info about the club (in this depth). Sorry for noob-ish question but I started playing just after the rift mystery and never fully caught up
