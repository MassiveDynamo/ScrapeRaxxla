I still think maybe the dark wheel and raxxla has to do with the explorers spirit and the original mission of explorers to discover as much as possible or smoething. If TDW is not dark as in insidious, but dark as in unexplored things then it may be a harmless organization simply attached to many thing in order to do the work. Unless something tried to take it over. But it could that we are part of the dark wheel. Maybe remember raxxla means to remember the mission to find things despite what happens. It could be that the governments are evil and stop explorers because they discover things they do not want us to find that would get them in trouble and the problems come from corrupt government against TDW and explorers or anything that gets in their way. That is already the common story in Elite. The elite are the government officials and rich and powerful. Since TDW base in on an 8th moon it and the pilot federation could be in league and they could be legitimate. The major stories so far are things the main powers did to fight thargoids. Either for legit reasons or for unknown backhanded political reasons. So far that is the one theme of the game. Governments doing things they don't want known being discovered by exploreres. Especially if we are the dark wheel and it's just an exploration group independent of governments. Which they tend do dislike.

TDW are part of the PF.
I dont think there is any evidence that TDW are evil. It was a member of TDW that was assassinated for gaining evidence of Raxxla.
Government evil...almost certainly...but the corporations worse. Sirus, Aegis,etc

I truly hope we are not TDW. That would be such a cop out. It would ruin the game for me
