I am role playing a bit here so do not take offense. Yes, Zorro wore a mask, guess what, we all do but we use Iron &ss ships to hide behind. What is an Iron &ss, well, old talk was a ship with an Iron &ss was a ship fully modded and could take care of it's own. But a ship is a brick unless you have a good pilot. This was the old school thinking.

You think the Dark Wheel is a nice group? I doubt it. They know stuff or at the least they 'think' they know stuff. You think once you find that Red lit Dodecahehron heap of a space station they will let you dock? Give you a hearty handshake and then laugh as they give you a Lavian Brandy mixed with Leesti Evil Juice and say "Here's Raxxla" then here's the rub. You do not see them. They see you.
Likewise on the dont take offence and dont get me wrong, my cmdr is no saint and if TDW do offer me riches and opportunities to exploit Raxxla, I'll take them with both hands, as I light my Kamitra cigar, from a 50cr note!
My only points were 1) why pre-judge them with no indication they are the bad guys and 2) even if they are, they cant be NEARLY as bad as Aegis!
