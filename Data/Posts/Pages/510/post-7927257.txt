TDW are part of the PF.I dont think there is any evidence that TDW are evil. It was a member of TDW that was assassinated for gaining evidence of Raxxla.Government evil...almost certainly...but the corporations worse. Sirus, Aegis,etcI truly hope we are not TDW. That would be such a cop out. It would ruin the game for me

Not Aegis. They are our allies. Also, they have me on a mission with these weird hard backed animal cargo called Mymurths.
