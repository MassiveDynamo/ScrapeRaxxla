All I am saying from my last point is IF you are looking for the Dark Wheel you might not like what you find. We kill or be killed. I have never fired a shot against any Thargoid and probably will not unless I have to. I am a scientist at heart but threaten my science, my ship or my fellow man then I will do what I have to. Like every species.
