Well, your species is underthreat and to protect it, the first thing to do, is take out Aegis! ;-) Thargoids usually only attack if provoked. Remember, we are stealing their farmers crops.

TDW....Like I said a bit earlier, personally I have not seen any evidence of evil from the direction of TDW, only secrecy, which does not necessarily equal the same thing. Zorro wore a mask. I would be inclined to be secretive if my primary goal was finding Raxxla, knowing Jason was killed, just for finding evidence that it existed.
@Thatchinho I know you've read the books. Keep me honest if you are aware of evidence that Jason and friends were evil.
