Well, your species is underthreat and to protect it, the first thing to do, is take out Aegis! ;-) Thargoids usually only attack if provoked. Remember, we are stealing their farmers crops.

TDW....Like I said a bit earlier, personally I have not seen any evidence of evil from the direction of TDW, only secrecy, which does not necessarily equal the same thing. Zorro wore a mask. I would be inclined to be secretive if my primary goal was finding Raxxla, knowing Jason was killed, just for finding evidence that it existed.
I am role playing a bit here so do not take offense. Yes, Zorro wore a mask, guess what, we all do but we use Iron &ss ships to hide behind. What is an Iron &ss, well, old talk was a ship with an Iron &ss was a ship fully modded and could take care of it's own. But a ship is a brick unless you have a good pilot. This was the old school thinking.

You think the Dark Wheel is a nice group? I doubt it. They know stuff or at the least they 'think' they know stuff. You think once you find that Red lit Dodecahehron heap of a space station they will let you dock? Give you a hearty handshake and then laugh as they give you a Lavian Brandy mixed with Leesti Evil Juice and say "Here's Raxxla" then here's the rub. You do not see them. They see you.
