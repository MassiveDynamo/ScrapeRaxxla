Old lore diferenciates the "TDW organisation of legendary Explorers" (good boys) from "twisted Elite men on Raxxla who ordered the killing of Jason" (bad boys.)
Elite Dangerous "lore" never said TDW are those who own Raxxla. On the contrary, they seem to be searching for it (E/F missions).
Now, what FD have done with all this since the Codex... Who knows ?
As the codes states their current objective IS - current tense - I can only assume they are still looking.
