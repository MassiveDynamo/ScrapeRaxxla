That permit lock mechanics is quite unclear in the hypothetic case of TDW...
Permits supposedly are granted/managed by the PF. What would that mean in the case of the station/moon being permit locked ? PF = TDW ?
This would imply a huge revelation and rearrangement of the current lore. But why not ?
As mentioned earlier.....TDW ARE a clique of the PF. Elite newsletter 22. So not really any change in law. I guess this is why they share a system.
