If ( and I am agreeing with Noobilite post here ) there is an explorer spirit here then I think we to look into the history of Elite and maybe study the Codex a little more. How did a bunch of people find Raxxla? Why and how was the Dark Wheel formed? These guys did not have the technology of what we have today. So tracing back history and lore might be a key.
We might think ourselves mighty explorers but back then the Jump Drive was a difficult thing. I have noticed that using max jump range I am visiting the same systems I went to before. Ie, I retraced my steps ( in a longer range ) ship back to the NGC nebulae and I was back in systems I had previously explored, now in a ship with a 30+ extra ly jump range. Almost like the planning uses waypoints. Back in the day the most powerful of ships ( with a drive ) had a maximum of 7ly. Perhaps that is the key. Perhaps if we go old school and plot the progression of colonization and exploration history-wise in something the original pioneers did then that will set us on course.
