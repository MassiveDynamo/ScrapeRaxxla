All I am saying from my last point is IF you are looking for the Dark Wheel you might not like what you find. We kill or be killed. I have never fired a shot against any Thargoid and probably will not unless I have to. I am a scientist at heart but threaten my science, my ship or my fellow man then I will do what I have to. Like every species.
Well, your species is underthreat and to protect it, the first thing to do, is take out Aegis! ;-) Thargoids usually only attack if provoked. Remember, we are stealing their farmers crops.

TDW....Like I said a bit earlier, personally I have not seen any evidence of evil from the direction of TDW, only secrecy, which does not necessarily equal the same thing. Zorro wore a mask. I would be inclined to be secretive if my primary goal was finding Raxxla, knowing Jason was killed, just for finding evidence that it existed.
