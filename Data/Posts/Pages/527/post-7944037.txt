ok, so the original DBOBE utterance was "It exists, we know where it is and we know why people haven't been able to find it..."

Does that give us any more information to help the Quest? I don’t think so. I’m sure FD have monitoring mechanisms built into Stellar Forge, they need them to assist bug fixing. I think DB would have been monitoring the area of Raxxla for player activity, and if anyone has passed it by DB would have known and could see why it wasn’t found. I remember MB saying something like “things are to be found off the ecliptic”; could be Raxxla is one of them. Since we don’t know what it is, where it is, or the required detection mechanism there could be many reasons why people haven’t been able to find it; could be in a permit-locked area, never visited on a friday, or your avatar needs green hair flying a ship named Hope to find it, or it’s a black hole & you need to rotate anticlockwise to enter it (I tried both directions at Altera’s Eye), maybe it’s 20kls or so above/below the ecliptic.....
In my opinion, the actual quote has much less implication that Raxxla exists as something discoverable in game, but no matter. As this is the only real confirmation that Raxxla does indeed exist, i think accuracy is very important.

Edit: it's also quite likely that DW did not quite get the exact phrasing of DB's statement here. In fact, when i asked him about it, DW said the only thing changed from the original quote was the added "(FD)" in "we (FD) know where it is". This shows that our only confirmation has been supplied by rather unreliable testimony, which in itself is pretty significant.
