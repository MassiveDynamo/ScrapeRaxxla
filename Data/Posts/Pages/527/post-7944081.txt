In my opinion, the actual quote has much less implication that Raxxla exists as something discoverable in game, but no matter. As this is the only real confirmation that Raxxla does indeed exist, i think accuracy is very important.

Edit: it's also quite likely that DW did not quite get the exact phrasing of DB's statement here. In fact, when i asked him about it, DW said the only thing changed from the original quote was the added "(FD)" in "we (FD) know where it is". This shows that our only confirmation has been supplied by rather unreliable testimony, which in itself is pretty significant.
It's not the only confirmation. DB has said it exist in other interviews. MB went as far as saying it's in the Milky Way. Raxxla's existence in the game has been confirmed several times. The codex quote "Raxxla is a definite place and that it holds a mystical secret." probably describes it best.

We have never had confirmation that Raxxla is:
Not permit locked.
Scannable
Reachable with current equipment
Recognizable when found

That would have been nice to know.
