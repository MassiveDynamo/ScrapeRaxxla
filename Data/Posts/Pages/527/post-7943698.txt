So I have lately frequented Vitto Orbital in Metztli system, as a visitor of the Tang Clan, taking some courses in feng shui flower arrangement, Shaolin shadow boxing and assassination missions in the Colonia region, when I realized these guys really are into some taoist cosmology, I Ching and divination from hexagrams. There must be a method... Can it be all so simple?
