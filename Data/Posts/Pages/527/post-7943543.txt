Alternatively, FDev knew that there'd be a storm if they didn't put Raxxla and TDW into the Codex, and consequently put in a load of generalized fluff just to pad it out to a page. Bear in mind that every piece of information in the Raxxla codex is followed by the caveat 'yeah, but that's probably garbage', including Astrophel and Stella. Plus the TDW codex is followed up with "Looking for them is pointless anyway".

To me, it doesn't look like FDev are wanting us to find either Raxxla or the TDW - they seem quite content for us to carry on spinning our wheels indefinitely.

Edit:
The one time that FDev DID want us to find something quickly the clues required nothing more than a bit of Googling and a vague knowledge of DrewW's previous work. Even then, we got directly helped to make sure we got the right answer.

Yes, but they got hammered because they made that clue far too obvious.

Edit: but the point remains, the Raxxla mechanism has been in-game from the outset & the mechanism has got to be simple.
