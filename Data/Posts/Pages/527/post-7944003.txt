OH MY GOD, THE THREAD EXISTS AGAIN. HAVE AT IT FOLKS!!!!!


I feel super vindicated because DW told me i was mistaken when i questioned this in his lore thread.

Edit: @Macros Black, i suspect an edit of the OP is in order

Here's a screen shot Just in case:

ok, so the original DBOBE utterance was "It exists, we know where it is and we know why people haven't been able to find it..."

Does that give us any more information to help the Quest? I don’t think so. I’m sure FD have monitoring mechanisms built into Stellar Forge, they need them to assist bug fixing. I think DB would have been monitoring the area of Raxxla for player activity, and if anyone has passed it by DB would have known and could see why it wasn’t found. I remember MB saying something like “things are to be found off the ecliptic”; could be Raxxla is one of them. Since we don’t know what it is, where it is, or the required detection mechanism there could be many reasons why people haven’t been able to find it; could be in a permit-locked area, never visited on a friday, or your avatar needs green hair flying a ship named Hope to find it, or it’s a black hole & you need to rotate anticlockwise to enter it (I tried both directions at Altera’s Eye), maybe it’s 20kls or so above/below the ecliptic.....
