Ok. I've decided based on all the results of my research......

Fdev either sucks at making scavenger hunts or are the absolute best at it, depending on how you look at it.

We know they suck at it if we are to take every other puzzle they've made as an example. This is barely a scavenger hunt. I'd argue you have to know what you're looking for in order for something to be considered a scavenger hunt. Wild goose chase, at best.
