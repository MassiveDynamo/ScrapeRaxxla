Also wanted to bring this up again:

The origin of the "it's out there, and we know where it is" quote is from this thread:

The day I met David Braben.
Wasn't quite sure where to put this, it's not really about the fiction and I thought all fans might enjoy it. Yesterday I ticked a significant item off of my 'bucket list' and, well, here it is. http://www.drewwagar.com/progress-report/the-day-i-met-david-braben/ Cheers, Drew.

This thread was deleted during the last forum migration. If anyone can find an archival of the link here, it will reveal that the actual quote was
"It exists, we know where it is, and why it hasn't been found". I think this change is very significant, as this quote is our only real confirmation of Raxxla.

If anyone can find the thread in question, it would be a great service to this community. I wish i could provide proof of this claim, but i cannot find a snapshot of this link. I wish i would have taken a screen shot of the old forum, as this quote existed online until last summer (maybe fall? Dont exactly remember when forum migration occurred)

OH MY GOD, THE THREAD EXISTS AGAIN. HAVE AT IT FOLKS!!!!!


I feel super vindicated because DW told me i was mistaken when i questioned this in his lore thread.

Edit: @Macros Black, i suspect an edit of the OP is in order

Here's a screen shot Just in case:
