Greetings all!

I've been stuck IRL and haven't been able to contribute much to the quest for a while, so I've continued my trawl of legacy video steams to see if we might have overlooked something whilst unable to launch into the black.

2.2 Release Celebration - ~7 minute mark, DB mentions that some sharp eyed people noticed some frames in the original trailer which has been fixed (removed?).


MB discusses the trailer and they replay at 1:04.31, and I assume it's guardians they're inferring about. Anyone have any recollection of this, or an original copy of the trailer, it was 5 years ago?!

If this is only focused on guardians, perhaps it's nothing. But DB was interviewed with SD station interior behind him...

IIRC it was either a preview if thargoids or a treasure hunt, but I think goids
