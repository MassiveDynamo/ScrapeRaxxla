Welcome aptare.
I'm in the ballpark of many 'gut-feelings' too, and they change all the time. SD, Sol, Sirius, Polaris, Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Pleiades, locked regions, Chutulu (HP Lovecraft), Pluto, Pink Floyd ... new day, new lunch & articles. New hunches.

Nobody is wrong nor right as far as we know.
We have something like 400 billion possibilities, right?
Until we find "THAT concrete clue" that tells us in which direction to look.

And we've only been at it for 7 years.

Welcome to the madness. Have a biscuit with us

Maybe the real Raxxla was the friends we made along the way

By the way tho, since we don’t truly know anything as you said all we can really do is search as hard as possible for stuff. Atm im going to try and race to become Elite so I can search through the system and see if there’s anything there.
