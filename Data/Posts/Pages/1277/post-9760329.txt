Maybe the real Raxxla was the friends we made along the way

By the way tho, since we don’t truly know anything as you said all we can really do is search as hard as possible for stuff. Atm im going to try and race to become Elite so I can search through the system and see if there’s anything there.
Ah, don’t race, take your time and enjoy the journey. If you want to get elite quickly then I’d recommend going the exploration route. There’s a few useful documents on the web & watch
