Yes welcome Cmdr, all are welcome here.

Anything is possible, but remember to begin at the beginning but not at the end, don’t be too keen to follow that rabbit down it’s hole and try at least to back up your ramblings, at least to enable us to follow you along your own trail of space madness.

This is a game. Raxxla exists, apparently, we’re almost certainly in agreement it’s discoverable…maybe.

Its possible the solution is starring us directly in the face and is very obvious so a new perspective is welcome.
