Hi there, my fellow Raxxla nerds. Iâ€™ve been reading your new posts compulsively for a day or so, and I feel compelled to join the quest.

In that vein, I would state that I am in agreement with others that state the Dark Wheel is pivotal to finding Raxxla, and I do believe that Shinrarta Dezhra is potentially the most important single system in connection with this: and there is most likely some hidden clue there.

Welcome to the Tinfoil Life, CMDR!

You'll find that feelings and theories, quests and routes towards Raxxla (yours, and other CMDR's) will change on a whim, or with some seemingly random piece of information, revelation or trivia!

Embrace it! Sooner or later, we'll find our way

Like you, and many others, I feel that Shinrarta Dezhra has a role to play in all of this, and I too am out in the Galaxy, on my way to Exploration Elite.

Heading out 10k ly to Rho Cassiopiae because it tangentialy relates to the quest - 'The Mother of Galaxies'.

To Shinrarta Dezhra, Raxxla, and beyond!
