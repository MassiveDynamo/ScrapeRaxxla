Hehe, not a fan of that idea then? How come?
As a former member of Children of Raxxla, I kind of have a personal vendetta against anyone who was directly involved in cover-ups of the past especially if there may have been larger efforts to hide the true nature of what we call Thargoids (especially if it was done maliciously). Alex Ryder knew about the Oresrians so why the radio silence? Did we unknowingly pick the wrong side to reverse-engineer our technology from? Did that very act of reverse-engineering probably a millennia earlier than we were told set us up for permanent warfare? You'll note we use holographic displays nearly everywhere. Did we set ourselves up for a permanent war with the still very alive traditional-branch Guardians who wants us hunted to extinction? Did finding Raxxla seal our fate as a species?

The only way we get our of this is the reality being widely known. The past is not destiny, but deluding ourselves is certain death .
