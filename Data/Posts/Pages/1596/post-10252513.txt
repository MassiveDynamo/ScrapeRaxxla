Well, so far we lack the station with proof of their authenticity. That said, it is more convincing that Lori Jameson is based in Shinrarta Dezra. Though, it also means the part about Ryders always leading the organization is complete rubbish. However, given the Ryders were added to the organization by Raffe Zetter it kind of goes without saying they weren't first. Nevermind that we also have a Ryder that is an Engineer (Liz Ryder in Eurybia). The same can be said for Mic Turner's son Bill Turner in Alioth. Which is why I kind of always thought Farseer was lying. She hasn't met them!?! No, you are part of The Dark Wheel. You don't see anyone shutting down Shinrarta Dezra or the Engineers because they are the key families that make up the organization.

What was that I said about nightmares are dreams, too?

They've promised that dreams can come true - but forgot to mention that nightmares are dreams, too.

Oh wait, I cannot go to Hell because Peter Jameson has that restraining order on me - for fear I plan on a bit revitalizing TDW's tarnished image. That and if there ever comes proof he's a Construct, I am taking him down personally.
