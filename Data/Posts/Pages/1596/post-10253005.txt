So who's jumping to LFT 509, Hrimfaxi, Blackwell City edition.

Seems like the same pattern, although it seemed to be less frequent jumps to LFT 509.

Wrt wasting time on the permit; every time I startup ED, it's essentially a massive waste of time. I just do it for fun. Besides, I needed Datamined Wake Solutions anyway

Scanning wakes with Tanaga
I spent quite a while trying to wake follow NPC into Witches Reach...it can't be done, you need the permit.
