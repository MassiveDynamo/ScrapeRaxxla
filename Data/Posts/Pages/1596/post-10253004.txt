i just think its so weird that brookes would say that someone had visited the system.
Maybe prior to the introduction of permit locks? but if thats so that means raxxla is currently completely inacessible
Not at all!
Consider an example where the Omphalos Rift is disguised as an asteroid in a planetary ring, or a solitary cargo container in a debris field, or an asteroid belt (not saying it is. Just these are feasible ways of hiding Raxxla). That trigger object could be gently orbiting any planet in any system and it would be very difficult to find. There is absolutely no reason for any system permit lock. The Omphalos could be hidden in this way inSol, Tau Ceti, etc etc.

MB had a mischievous sense of humour...I think the Rift could be hidden in plain sight in a heavily visited system (for those with eyes to see)
