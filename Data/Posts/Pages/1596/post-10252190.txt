I find troubling FD apparent lack of interest or support for this quest line, if it is actually one.
Most of us don't, this isn't a storyline, its something specifically put in game for us to solve and find, its supposed to be difficult and take years.
I am still of the opinion that Fdev hold the keys, once certain things have been discovered they will unlock access and to be fair it maybe one of those things we may be happy never to find.
