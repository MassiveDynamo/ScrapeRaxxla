You missed several:
Supercruise (apparently akin to traveling at a higher dimension or folding space-time - see Alcubierre drive)
Insight and Insight Entertainment (virtual reality platforms originally known as Dream-ware)
Utopia's Sim-Archive
Holo-Me (your avatar isn't you but how you choose to appear to others)
Telepresence



Going to specifically expound on a point: most our travels are not in the "real-world" per se. Your sensors show a template design of what you targeting (especially true with planets, moons, stations, ports, outposts, and settlements). In supercruise, this shows up as a white icon. However, it is the ideal form or most common form. Only after dropping out of supercruise do the Astrogation Console display the true-form of where you are going. Witch-space tunnel just require a hell of lot more energy to generate than mere supercruise.

These are also to varying degree alternate realities, but they are all man made. They are also much younger than the Raxxla myth.

The lore or explanation on how we exist in our ship, in SRV and on foot and what happens when we die is more full of holes than a Swiss cheese. Telepresence is the only thing that actually makes sense.
