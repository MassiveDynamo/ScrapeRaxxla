There was a bug in FE2, that allowed you to jump as far as you wanted. The hyperspaces rage wrapped at a distance of 65,536 ly (iirc). This meant that if your ship had a 20 ly jump range, the game would allow you to jump to any systems that were between 65,536 - 65,556 ly away.
With a little clever triangulation you could basically jump anywhere, in two jumps.
Ahhh, gotta love overflow bugs. 65536 is 2^16, so for unsigned 16-bit integers it tracks.
