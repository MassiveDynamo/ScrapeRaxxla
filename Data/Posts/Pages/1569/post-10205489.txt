Can tell I’m reading too much Holdstock. That phrase now also reminds me of an old magic invocation: “in this place which is not a place, and in this time which is not a time”… Holdstock came up with that phrase, I wonder what his inspiration was?
Possibly, it may be from "Magician: The Lost Journals of the Magus Geoffrey Carlyle". I will have to skim through it tonight. It was another one written jointly by Robert Holdstock and Malcolm Edwards. It is the one that discusses the Eleusian Mystery cult and a lot of other stuff. Interesting read. Not all that Holdstock wrote was light and fun. Some of it is very, very dark.
