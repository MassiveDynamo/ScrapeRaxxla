So, new objective: Find Xezaor

Also, this means Jaques/Jameson/individual with a million aliases isn't quite mobility limited.

Find The Dark Wheel, find Raxxla.

Also, this means The Dark Wheel works directly for Federal Navy Special Operations division (who is unfortunately a double-agent of Imperial Navy). A visit to Morgue's Mortuary may now actually be in order.

Interesting prospect, The Dark Wheel == Black Flight? Their whole mission was literally keep everything a secret on humanity's dealing with the aliens.

It was always suspect that the Galactic Navy used ships almost predominantly from Lakon Spaceways.

Now, let's hope this doesn't reignite the superpower wars.

Understatement of the millennia (possibly the last several).

I guess it takes a Special Agent to find another.
