Not to make the situation worse with yet more possibly misleading information but the phrase a place but not a place has haunted me for a long time. It is a neologism coined by the French anthropologist Marc Aug√© to refer to anthropological spaces of transience where human beings remain anonymous, and that do not hold enough significance to be regarded as "places" in their anthropological definition. Examples of non-places would be motorways, hotel rooms, airports and shopping malls.

There is one very specific non-place that we must always journey through alone...

In ED we have two places that aren't places. Witchspace and the Guardian network, where the Constructs(AI) lives / used to live. Both would qualify as 'another universe', in some sense.

One problem with the place that isn't a place, is that it to some degree contradicts the Codex claim 'that Raxxla is a definite place'.

Most likely this means that there is a definite place you have to go, to be able to access the non local 'other universe'.
