This has better NOT be it. As an explorer, I truthfully enjoy seeing the galaxy. Yes, it would be useful but I spent too much effort reviving and unifying the old lore for it cheapened by this. Give me a Holdstockian Raxxla. Besides, the Witch-space tunnel looks like a simulated wormhole traversal already. I think we need to continue deep diving the Raxxla, TDW codex, the new Brookes trail, and all the other clues and see where that leads us. However, those messages about "first time seeing everyone together" are totally a lore unification hint.
