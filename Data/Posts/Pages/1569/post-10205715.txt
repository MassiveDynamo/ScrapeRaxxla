I’m seeing a lot of wishful thinking.

If Raxxla is a definite place in-game then it must be held on the FD server until a player crosses the Omphalos Rift (it should be noted that a Rift is not a place, cos it’s a hole which could be a door/gateway) to trigger its download....this is the only way that FD could ensure the file miners didnt find it.

But the codex only hints that Raxxla is a definite place “according to the earliest stories” ..which implies contradiction by later stories! And the only hint that said "A certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth" was removed from game in early 2016 so is invalid as the basis for any supposition.

DB said we don’t know what it is, while MB said “It’s something in the game world (not text) and very hard to find”
so it might be a place, but could alternatively be a Guardian AI, a Thargoid Queen, another npc, a tourist beacon... or anything at all
