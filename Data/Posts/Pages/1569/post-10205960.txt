I read the hints a little different.

Raxxla is where you go to find the Omphalos rift. The rift will take you somewhere else.

Raxxla could be something mundane and completely natural, like a planet or a moon. It could also be just a location, where the rift is.

Rafe is very specific on this: "Your father was chasing the mythical planet Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there’s an alien construct that’s a gateway to other Universes, and all that’s in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life…"

This description of the alien construct matches the description of the Ophalos rift, in the Codex:
"Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described
as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed."

I would also assume that early stories can be considered more accurate than later stories, as they are closer to the original.
Mmm, I see where you're coming from...
But if Raxxla isn't the destination, but just the location of the Rift which takes us to the destination, then how will we know when we find it? It cannot be named “Raxxla” in-game as per the previous file-dipping argument. Unless it’s a moon with a tourist beacon saying “this is Raxxla”... doesn't sound likely to me.

We have no evidence that Holdstock’s book influenced the implementation of Raxxla in-game; in fact DB said we don’t know what Raxxla is, but Holdstock told us, ergo it cannot be implemented as per Holdstock.

Gotta disagree with you on the veracity of stories though...a story is a story...it’s age has no logical link to its veracity. In fact it could be argued that more evidence would lead to later stories being closer to the truth. It’s not a sound basis for reasoning.
