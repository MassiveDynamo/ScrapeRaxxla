Not to make the situation worse with yet more possibly misleading information but the phrase a place but not a place has haunted me for a long time. It is a neologism coined by the French anthropologist Marc Aug√© to refer to anthropological spaces of transience where human beings remain anonymous, and that do not hold enough significance to be regarded as "places" in their anthropological definition. Examples of non-places would be motorways, hotel rooms, airports and shopping malls.

There is one very specific non-place that we must always journey through alone...
