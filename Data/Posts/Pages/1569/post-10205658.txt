In ED we have two places that aren't places. Witchspace and the Guardian network, where the Constructs(AI) lives / used to live. Both would qualify as 'another universe', in some sense.
You missed several:
Supercruise (apparently akin to traveling at a higher dimension or folding space-time - see Alcubierre drive)
Insight and Insight Entertainment (virtual reality platforms originally known as Dream-ware)
Utopia's Sim-Archive
Holo-Me (your avatar isn't you but how you choose to appear to others)
Telepresence
There are some people who live in a dream world, and there are some who face reality; and then there are those who turn one into the other.

Going to specifically expound on a point: most our travels are not in the "real-world" per se. Your sensors show a template design of what you targeting (especially true with planets, moons, stations, ports, outposts, and settlements). In supercruise, this shows up as a white icon. However, it is the ideal form or most common form. Only after dropping out of supercruise do the Astrogation Console display the true-form of where you are going. Witch-space tunnel just require a hell of lot more energy to generate than mere supercruise.
