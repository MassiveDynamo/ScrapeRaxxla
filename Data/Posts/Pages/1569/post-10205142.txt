I think it was 655.36LY but yes, it was a bug. It is not canon that there were wormholes in FE2, that was just made-up rumour by players to 'account' for it.
You are right. There wasn't that much side scrolling in the galmap to get the 'Out of Range' to go away.

I remember the bug was very practical for timed missions. If you had a ship with short jump range, time ran fast as one max jump took a week to complete.
