Did you try some trilateration ?

Btw, did someone try to find if the Telescope/Antena at Puleston Arsenal (or is it at Neumann Camp ?) keeps aiming always at the same point?
It’s Neumann Camp. I’ve not checked myself (haven’t got access) but IIRC Genar-Hofoen had said that it always pointed towards Col 70.
