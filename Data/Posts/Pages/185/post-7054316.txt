So, with that in mind, do we think that when we do find Raxxla, if it does have a doorway / portal to another "galaxy", that "galaxy" will really just be another point in the Milky Way?

I say "just": jumping right across the galaxy through portals or "star gates" would be pretty cool in itself.

Might they allow access to regions of space that are otherwise permit locked from outside?

I think that’s an interesting possibility, though I’m not so sure whether FD would go to that much trouble in programming the game. I lean more to the “Raxxla Gateway” station trading in artefacts from a third alien race.

edit: however as Luko said “what better way to hide something than in a myth”, so Raxxla exists (DB has said so) but it may be nothing like the myth as presented in Holdstock’s The Dark Wheel.
