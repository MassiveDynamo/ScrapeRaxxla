Yes, that might be why RoguePlanet is only a parameter in the Star Class type. If reaches a system with other objects then it might well be captured and become a “naturalised immigrant”.

Probably.
A real rogue could spend hundreds of years within the bounderies of a system, but I don’t think Stellar forge creates objects like that.

If it did, they should be displayed with no orbital period at all.
