A Rogue Planet cruising inside a system shouldn't be called "Rogue" as long (very long time...) as it doesn't quit the system boundaries. Rogues orbit Sgr A*, by definition. (btw, incredibly low probability for a system to catch a rogue...)
Protostars, afaik, are a totally different stuff. Nothing to do with a "solid" body.
But, again, why not ? ED/FD definition of "consistency" is wide....
I think we could imagine Raxxla appearing in the GalMap as a class X, and as a rogue planet in the system map. It would fill both descriptions.
If there is only one X in all the GalMap, and maybe even obfuscated, then it wouldn't be surprising that nobody found it for now.
We assume the current ADS detects and maps all the bodies, except comets, inside a system. Don't we ?
