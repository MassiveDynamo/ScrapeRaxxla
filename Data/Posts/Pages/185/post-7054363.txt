Why not both? "Twisted Men" may accept new authorized traders at their "colonial counter" without allowing them to go further.

Then we will have to...convince them to open the Gate to us... And so we recreate a large part of human history in the ED Universe.
(I'll play the Spaniards side !)


I understand this ( as far as my teribble Englich reaches) as Raxxla is much more easy to find, and inventing a myth of ghost-obfuscate-unreachable planet is a way to discourage the plain Explorers. The thing is, there are chimerae hunters like us Rifters who are looking for exactly this kind of exploration !

Here Be Dragons! Rifters chimera hunters Raxxla wonderers!

Here are this week’s chimera results:
Raxxla Wonderers 3......Third Alien Race 14

But I don’t believe Raxxla is anything to do with any portal to LMC, SMC, Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy, or anything else. Someone at FD definitely said there is only one galaxy in ED. I think it was at the time when there was much muttering that the logo on the barnacles could mean they came from the LMC. I credit FD with being honest with us, though also machiavellian...

A station called “Raxxla Gateway” would allow for these twisted elites to be housed, if indeed they are not also part of the myth.

If Raxxla is a RoguePlanet, in its own system therefore a valid fsd jump destination, it may not exist in the galmap & may just appear in the nav panel when you are within 20LY; I’m undecided about this possibility.
