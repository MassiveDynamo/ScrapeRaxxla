If Raxxla is a RoguePlanet, in its own system therefore a valid fsd jump destination, it may not exist in the galmap & may just appear in the nav panel when you are within 20LY; Iâ€™m undecided about this possibility.

My heart breaks at the possibility of finding something like that. The chances are unfathomable.
