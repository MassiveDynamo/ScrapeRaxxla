Might be. Without considering as possible to (RP>) be brought back to my original place and time (<RP), it would be so exciting to have a new entire galaxy to explore. But without a filled-up GalMap, this time. 'Fog of war' -like. Ok, I am pushing my wishes too much up. Best we can hope, imho, is to get some locked system/region opened, just like you said. I'll wait for the DU release for the really exciting stuff...

Small Magellanic Cloud, about 7000 light years across. Raxxla can be found once Frontier have that sorted and we can head on over.

I don't think it's that far-fetched, but it would be a long way off.

Before a new galaxy you'd want to have your planetary tech mostly done really, since it's a shot at a galactic 2.0. And planetary tech will be a good while yet.
