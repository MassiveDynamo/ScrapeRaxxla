About the "Galaxies", they appeared being other sectors of the MW, yes. At least seems so:

I would say the same for the other RZ's "Universes"

So, with that in mind, do we think that when we do find Raxxla, if it does have a doorway / portal to another "galaxy", that "galaxy" will really just be another point in the Milky Way?

I say "just": jumping right across the galaxy through portals or "star gates" would be pretty cool in itself.

Might they allow access to regions of space that are otherwise permit locked from outside?
