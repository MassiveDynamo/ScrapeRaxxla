That's correct, as far as I can read. Interlopers that are caught by the system, are no longer rogues. As soon as they have a permanent orbit, they are par of the system.

It's speculated that Venus may be an ex rogue, because it has retrograde rotation.

Objects like the comet Oumuamua, are real rogues, that just visit our system.

Yes, that might be why RoguePlanet is only a parameter in the Star Class type. If a rogue reaches a system with other objects then it might well be captured and become a “naturalised immigrant”.
