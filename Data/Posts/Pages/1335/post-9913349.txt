Not wanting to rain on peoples chips. But there’s always the possibility that a lot of the ‘oddity’ surrounding various systems could as likely be due to simple slapdashness, oversight or ignorance, the game is impressive but not perfect and some (not all) of the hand crafted areas are a little rough around the edges, or not as the case might be.
I agree. There are many examples of errors in hand authored data entry. For example:

Tarlak which is in CD-73 253 in the book is actually to be found in LTT 2771 which is where smuggler's junction is meant to be, even though the System Description for CD-73 253 says its there instead. Plenty of such mistakes in the game.

Maybe its possible that Smugglers Junction is in CD -73 253, since it only has two stars and an outpost not orbiting a planet.. someone ought to go have a look.. (I would but my PC has been offline for a while)

When he 'yells' SECRET, I think he means there is stuff you should be able to work out, or else the answer is a spoiler for the book.

and another snippet from the author of AHTW here:

StarfleetComms Podcast: S5E04 – Interview with John Harper – Author
<h2>Interview with John Harper – Author</h2><p>In this episode I interview the affable John Harper about his experiences whilst writing the official canon book, And Here The Wheel. We learn some writing hints and tips along the way as well as understand a little more about who John actually is...

where once again he mentions that systems got messed up in the game.
