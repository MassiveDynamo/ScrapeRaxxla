Didnt know that - I must have started about then.. interesting..
It may have been an FD attempt to encourage exploration...I dont know, it just seems oddly phrased.

The actual text was “Puzzled mechanics working in shipyards across the sector have noticed that some Frameshift drive cores have needed replacing much earlier than expected. One was overheard talking in a bar on Smithy’s Claim: “These cores are normally good for 1000 light years, and yet nearly 1 in 20 of my customers has needed a complete drive overhaul, where have these Commanders been flying?””

So not just Dahan
