There was a reference to Dahan/Smithy’s Claim in galnet 5 September 3300, puzzled FSD mechanic said “These cores are normally good for 1000 light years, and yet nearly 1 in 20 of my customers has needed a complete drive overhaul, where have these Commanders been flying?”

Seems like a hint to something, anybody any idea what? I guess something within 500ly of Dahan!
