Well, visited both Thor's Helmet Sector FB-X C1-5 and Seagull Sector DL-Y D3 (anarchy). Checked out the belt clusters in the former (nothing) & got some Trinkets in the latter.
@Pyroboros : Seagull Sector DL-Y D3 was interesting- it has one comet but tried several times & couldnt drop into the instance so always a couple of hundred metres away & it kept moving away from me (while being pestered by a pirate). There were also a couple of bodyids which crashed the game, even when bookmarked. And a few which I didnt check out, before Hell’s Port, which I think was bodyid 17. With only 3 stars, one planet and an asteroid station there’s something strange with this system! I’ll paste the spreadsheet in here later, when lunch has digested & I get back briefly to the PC before the afternoon heat arrives. Siesta time!...
had too much coffee to siesta... here's the sheet:
Body#
SearchString

Edit: I would go back and check the other body search criteria for more comets, but with my hand/wrist problems I was having a painful time trying to avoid the pirates who were after my Trinkets, and I want to check out some bubble comets with those!
Has anyone checked for comets in Sirius?

I'm not really pursuing the comet idea anymore. Currently focusing my search more outside of the game, study The Alien World The Complete Illustrated Guide Researching the artists of the Illustrations and stuff. To your post ID 2 most likly Barycenter of ID 3 and 4 the crashes are interesting. I think the only system I had this kind of crash was Jackson's Lighthouse but not sure anymore. I'm lazy atm so unchecked google translate must suffice
