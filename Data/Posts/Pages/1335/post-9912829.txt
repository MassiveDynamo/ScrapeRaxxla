Nothing odd at all. this is how 2 bodys with comparable masse (0,9258 vs 1,3359) orbit each other. And because each Body orbits the other the period is exactly the same.
CD-73 253 A is a bit heavier so it is Closer to the Barycenter. Draw a straight line between the Stars it will always go through Barycenter, so the Stars are always 180Â° off each other.

I've seen a lot of planets doing this as well. It's especially interesting when their orbits pass through each other.

I know Canonn was researching some sets to see if they'd eventually collide.


Currently I'm just about to leave a tourest site .... (1.8kly from Sol) don't recall it's name off hand (something gem) where almost all bodies have rings including the two orbiting dwarfs.
