I’ll check my logs tomorrow if I get chance. No, fairly sure bodyid 2 was the comet & I did drop out where it should be, only to repeatedly see the uss drift away faster than I could travel.. Guess some of the bodyid 8 to 15 were the barycentres. Lost interest when two consecutively crashed the game, and the persistent pirate attacked... ormally thy lose interest if interdiction broken but not that guy. But the big bodyid gap up to the asteroid base was puzzling, and then why would 6 & 7 cause a crash-I’m sure I applied the bookmark idea.
Faster then a vomit comet? hehe
