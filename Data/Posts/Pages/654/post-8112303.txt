These things "connecting" to Raxxla, like the Omphalos Rift, seems just a connection... for instance if this Omphalos is really the Thargoid device, this could indicate that the Thargoids are currently using Raxxla in witchspace to travel throughout the galaxy and beyond... just that, not that we'd be able to find it using it.
