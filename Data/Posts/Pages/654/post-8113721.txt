has any thorough investigation been done on the "distorted planet noise sounds" that you get from hovering bodies in FSS?
i would imagine, if raxxla to be tied to such easily overlooked (yet FDEV took the time and effort to put it in) mechanic, that it would be behind some sort of out of the ordinary, and quite unique sounding planet, that could reveal something once the sound has been processed in some way. this has been done before, in many puzzle solving activities, where an image is converted to a noise audio file, through use of conversion softwares, wich can be re-converted back into original image form. i came across a few very interresting, unique and strange sounding bodies over the few hundred hours i spent in the game.

i also noticed that these keywords appear a lot around raxxla : whispering, singing, etc... if any whispering would appear in ED, i would imagine it would be from either witch space, or planet surface noise sounds.
it could also be something Dark wheel related. some sort of encrypted noise message from them, coming from a surface of a planet, and only picked up by the FSS noise surface sounds.
