I get that, but I'm getting tired of some of these posts trying to take the p!ss. I'm legit trying to get facts seperated from fiction, not muddy up what we hardly know to begin with even more
As far as Raxxla is concerned the only facts available are "it's out there" and "we know why it hasn't been found"

After that there's what is in the codex. Everything else here is speculation and conjecture. I hope that clarifies things a bit.

Also we are all quite mad here
