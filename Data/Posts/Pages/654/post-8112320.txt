If Earth has disappeared, then where are those records kept?
Don’t tell me, “in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘Beware of the Leopard.””

Actually its quite a nice solution. The 1st Footprint (Neil Armstrong on the Moon) is an historically preserved site with tourist beacons that say '1m years ago, humans first stepped on the Moon' to give the timeline accurately (clever I thought) and then theres a mining colony that got left behind and have come to view Earth as a long lost myth and not real.

They think they know where Earth went, its in a nearby nebula or something, ill get the name of it eventually and I can waste time there looking as well. Its a good distraction that will lead nowhere but will keep me occupied for a bit.
