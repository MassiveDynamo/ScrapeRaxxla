Got a question about "Well - "It exists, we know where it is and we know why people haven't been able to find it..."
After Drew's meeting with DB, his post from the linked Thread was in Jul 2014 (!)

That's pre-Release Beta 1.01 Phase for ELITE : Dangerous, half a year before Release (??!).
And most notably, that was still in an era of the famous old "cylinder" that limited Travel to approx. 500 Systems or so.

I can't recall "Raxxla" even being a thing back in these Days in the Forum, all attention revolved exclusively around working features up towards V1.0 Release and working out bugs.

So color me a tad confused when seeing Raxxla in conjunction with a statement from mid-2014 * scratches head *

On the statement of "it's out there" - by now I call that a case of .

That’s actually an interesting point. DW’s quote of DB’s utterance was in July 14 (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-day-i-met-david-braben.25158/post-536632), which from the change notes thread was at the time of beta 1.04; I think DW said this was when he met DB at Lavecon (5-6 July 14). I was under the impression from somewhere that DB had said Raxxla had been in-game since the gamma; Gamma 1.01 was released Nov 2014. So was it actually in-game earlier? Am I mistaken in my gamma belief?
Could be it was in-game from beta 1.04, or earlier, but still being realised? Seems reasonable to assume that its implementation took a fair degree of polishing since it’s a major easter egg and DB’s baby.

But yes, Raxxla has been ‘in existence’ since circa 1984!
