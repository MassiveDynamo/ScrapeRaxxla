If game creator confirming its existence isnt evidence there isn't anything short of giving you the coordinates after finding it that I could do to prove anything

Unsure how to interpret your statement, my main focus was on my surprise of the Date (mid-2014) and in which early state the Beta still was.

On the game creator confirming the existing of it, my issue is the factor of Credibility.
And of that, there's virtually not much left across the board (I've adopted the very same about i.e. the former Executive Producer btw. , who also was in charge of everything Exploration).
So any statements from those persons I listen to - but take with a huge grain of salt and a truckload of reservation. Just me though...
