Unsure how to interpret your statement, my main focus was on my surprise of the Date (mid-2014) and in which early state the Beta still was.

On the game creator confirming the existing of it, my issue is the factor of Credibility.
And of that, there's virtually not much left across the board (I've adopted the very same about i.e. the former Executive Producer btw. , who also was in charge of everything Exploration).
So any statements from those persons I listen to - but take with a huge grain of salt and a truckload of reservation. Just me though...
I'm sure DB and MB are the only ones that actually know specifically where/what/when/why/how anything about raxxla with 100%certainty. You may as well ask the pope to prove God's existence man. Sorry

After consideration on how frequently fdev seems to 'unintentionally' lie or be not correct. I can understand doubting their credibility
