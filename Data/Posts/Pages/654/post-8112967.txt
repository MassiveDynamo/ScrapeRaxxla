As far as Raxxla is concerned the only facts available are "it's out there" and "we know why it hasn't been found"

After that there's what is in the codex. Everything else here is speculation and conjecture. I hope that clarifies things a bit.

Also we are all quite mad here

Got a question about "Well - "It exists, we know where it is and we know why people haven't been able to find it..."
After Drew's meeting with DB, his post from the linked Thread was in Jul 2014 (!)

That's pre-Release Beta 1.01 Phase for ELITE : Dangerous, half a year before Release (??!).
And most notably, that was still in an era of the famous old "cylinder" that limited Travel to approx. 500 Systems or so.

I can't recall "Raxxla" even being a thing back in these Days in the Forum, all attention revolved exclusively around working features up towards V1.0 Release and working out bugs.

So color me a tad confused when seeing Raxxla in conjunction with a statement from mid-2014 * scratches head *

On the statement of "it's out there" - by now I call that a case of "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence".
