Book, sirens, spiraling stars. Nothing more.

On that note and its a tenuous one I admit but its the only way I can link this in in any way whatsoever, anyway:

Been getting distracted by BBC radio version of James Follet 'Earthsearch'. Hadnt read it but it involves a spaceship returning to Sol from a near light speed journey to try and find terraformable planets that for them lasted 150 years but in Sol a million years has passed. Anyway, Earth has disappeared! Records say it was 'moved' by its inhabitants when the Sun started to go Supernova, moved to a new solar system entirely. Just rang a few bells is all, also they mentioned space Sirens in it, hasn't finished yet so dunno how it ends...haven't mentioned Astrophle as far as I remember but its close
