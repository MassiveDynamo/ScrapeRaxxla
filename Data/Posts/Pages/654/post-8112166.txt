I get that, but I'm getting tired of some of these posts trying to take the p!ss. I'm legit trying to get facts seperated from fiction, not muddy up what we hardly know to begin with even more
When it comes to Raxxla, there aren't really any facts. Even the few bits that are canon are just rumors and hearsay.
Searching for Raxxla will always be based on extrapolation form an unsubstantial base.
The only thing we can do is to check / test out all the silly ideas we have, in game. Each idea will have a close to 100% chance of failure, but it's all we have.

Going new places and taking a close look at stuff, is the way to go.
