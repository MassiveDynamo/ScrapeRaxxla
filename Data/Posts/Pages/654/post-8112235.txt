As far as Raxxla is concerned the only facts available are "it's out there" and "we know why it hasn't been found"

After that there's what is in the codex. Everything else here is speculation and conjecture. I hope that clarifies things a bit.

Also we are all quite mad here

You forgot one. It must be the most important clue cos it came from MB himself: “it’s in the Milky Way”....

So, we just need to find Willy Wonka’s shop and buy the right bar of white chocolate to get the golden snitch ticket to get the permit to Witch’s Reach to attack the military convoy and steal the unknown key which will unlock the Omphalos Rift to allow us to reach Raxxla...
Simples!
