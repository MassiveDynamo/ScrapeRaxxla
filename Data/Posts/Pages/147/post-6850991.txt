... what if the Cobra MK.III - the Ship itself - was the key?

I've done all my Raxxla hunting in a Cobra MK3, allied to TDW, Elite ranked (most triple Elite ranked) - precisely because the thought it was an '84 throwback had also crossed my mind.

The last thing i'd been working on was the old lore about captured stellar objects. So hunted about for bodies orbiting away from the system plane, on the theory maybe that was FDev's "slightly obvious" hint that something was unusual and to look at it closer (and then Raxxla would be a POI near the body).

eg: one of the gas planets in Shinrarta Dezhra orbits 90 degrees to the plane, stuff in Siris etc.
