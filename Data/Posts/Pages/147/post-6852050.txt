She was. Same model as Elyssia and Kahina.

(Alessia Verdi and Arissa to?)

I really don't think so. I just pulled out my copy of Premonition and reread the section where Luko reveals the Salomé that she's a clone. While there is a moment where Salomé questions who she is a clone of ("A clone, of who? The spiky-haired woman? The old lady? Octavia? Are they one and the same? How many? No …") Luko goes on to explain that it started with Elyssia and that Elyssia then recruited the old woman (Rebecca) to help her. It doesn't sound to me like Rebecca is one of the clones at all.

It sounds to me more like Salomé leaping to a conclusion about The Old Woman being a possible genetic match but I don't see anywhere that this conclusion was actually confirmed. The only confirmed clones were Elyssia, Octavia and Salomé.
