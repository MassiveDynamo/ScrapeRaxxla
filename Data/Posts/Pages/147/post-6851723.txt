To be fair, the only Cobra in TDW is the one that kills Jason and is later destroyed by Alex.

Plenty of other ships are used in the book.

The book is also set quite some time before the first game, so the Cobras may well have been MK1s.

Not quite. The ship that Alex and Elyssia Fields liberate from the Tionisla Orbital Graveyard was also a Cobra.
