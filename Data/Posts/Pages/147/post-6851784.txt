Plenty of other ships are used in the book.
Sure but the "Cobra" was the main ship for Elite 84; and typically the main ship for press and media releases (not ship specific); and the only ship FDev built a scale replica of.

So i'd say it's still pretty much foremost ship to Frontier.

It is probably meaningless, but given large ships cannot land at outposts, i'd certainly never go hunting in anything bigger than a Medium. I'd hate to turn up at something Raxxla related and be unable to land
