I was curious... so i visited a station where Holloway Bioscience has a research facility. Security was too tight at the front door... so i decided to visit the hair salon have some nice highlights added... thankfully due to the wonders of standardized station designs... the Salons toilet shares a wall with that of the research facilites... anyhoo after some minor cutting of access panels... I found this presentation on someones desk before i hightailed it out...


SPOILER: PRESENTATION

I like it!
Apart from the unlimited energy source hypothesis.
Energy is neither created not destroyed!
so if you suck it out of the vacuum....
Quantum Space collapses....
The end of Reality and All Things...

Apart from Donald Trump’s hairpiece, which occupies an existentialist reality all of its own...
I suspect it’s actually the eyebrow of Cthulhu
