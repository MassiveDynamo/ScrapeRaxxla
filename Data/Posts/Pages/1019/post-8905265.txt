yes, all true, but i think @Filthymick420 was trying to say, once you TAKE that mission, i think it will be a follow-on or somthing, it could take you to a station in a system not controlled by the same faction, but when you complete the mission, for example, delivery mission, you should recieve the permit at the same time as your reward at that new location....

I think, and if i remember correctly.... havnt getten a new permit in a while now
