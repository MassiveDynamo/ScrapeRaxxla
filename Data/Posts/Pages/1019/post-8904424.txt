Well, it did say they are making some advances, “some with intriguing commercial possibilities.”

I was curious... so i visited a station where Holloway Bioscience has a research facility. Security was too tight at the front door... so i decided to visit the hair salon have some nice highlights added... thankfully due to the wonders of standardized station designs... the Salons toilet shares a wall with that of the research facilites... anyhoo after some minor cutting of access panels... I found this presentation on someones desk before i hightailed it out...
