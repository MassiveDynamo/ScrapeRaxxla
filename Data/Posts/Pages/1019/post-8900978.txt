Yeah, never trust Jupiter Rochester this person is slimly as they come even after the Lakon take over. And it's possible JR can be one of the club members or just a puppet. But The Club needs control over the manufacture on ships and it's easier for them keep an eye on said manufacturing under Fed oversite.
The entire Rochester family is dubious. I think Isolde is the one pulling the strings and is most likely to be a full Club member.
