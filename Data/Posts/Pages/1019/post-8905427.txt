Good question, I guess a faction could grant a permit from any distance, another guess could be from from within 20Ly.

@Filthymick420 - You might be able to extrapolate the potential minimum distance for permits using the data located in the Wiki for the Permits and the locations that are available? Doesn't mean FDev haven't made exceptions since each of these would have been 'placed' in the game.
