It's probably wrong translation. Change your language to different (there are some others, Spanish, German, I think) and check that text with Google translator. If it's not a mistake, then FD gave a little bit more of information to Russian translation team (and maybe to the other teams as well).

Somebody should raise these different meanings as a bug report and see what the FD reaction is!
