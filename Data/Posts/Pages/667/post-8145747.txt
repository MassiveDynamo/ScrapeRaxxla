I'm a part way through reading Elite:Legacy and Raxxla has been mentioned once so far but the thing that made me think of Raxxla was a comment about how hyperdrives need the gravity well of a star or massive enough planet to lock on to.

I'm guessing it's already been thought of but could Raxxla be a rogue planet without a star?

Can you even find such a planet on the galaxy map? Are rogue planets even a thing in Elite Dangerous?

IRL, PSO J318.5-22 is one such planet and is only 80LY from Sol. Could Raxxla be that close and in the bubble?

Maybe it's part of a system map but further out than Hutton Orbital?
Maybe it doesn't exist in today's version of the game but will be added when comets etc. are added?

So many questions!!
