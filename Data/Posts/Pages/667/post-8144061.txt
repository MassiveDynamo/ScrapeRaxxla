is no one going to comment on that raxxla codex screenshot? the english version doesn't seem to have that bit of text with "planet" in it. it only says "a summary of the myths surrounding the legendary raxxla"
so this is either a mistake on localization of the game in that language, or an intended (or not so intended but still true) bit of info right there. im i getting hyped for nothing here? lol
"legendary planet" Raxxla
