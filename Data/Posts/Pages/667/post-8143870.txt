Although my Cyrillic reading is rather basic, the encircled word definitely says "legendary planet".
Even though this is a translation and the original text read only 'legendary Raxxla', I would add a small +1 to Raxxla's planet status.

Other +1s include Rafe Zetter actually calling it a planet, in The Dark Wheel.
At one time a player reported as an error that he couldn't find Raxxla in the galmap. FD sent him a letter from 'Universal Cartographics' that stated that they hand no knowledge of the Planet Raxxla.
