Mary Sidney helped establish old Shakes, she was a patron of the arts, especially poets and alchemy, a very interesting lady.

Astrophil / Astrophel is a male prefix designated by Philip Sidney. I’ve long held ‘Princess Astrophel’ could be a role reversal of ‘Mary Sidney’….but this leads into many conspiracies around Rosicrucian and even Oak Island and a mountain of tin-foil crack-pottery, which I’ve touched on previously…


Oh there it is. Yet to be disappointed. ;-)
