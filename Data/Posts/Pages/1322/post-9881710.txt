Anyone read this book? Found the reference yesterday while googling around (like fooling, but less fun).
“Whispers from the Deep” by Hazel Webb published: 26 July 2013: “Somewhere beyond the veil of dreams, between the shadows painted of yesterday and what is to come, there lies a world shrouded in mysteries unknown and journeys unspoken”

Seems very apt for Raxxla!
