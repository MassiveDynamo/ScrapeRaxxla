Hey... is this normal?

I am currently scanning each planet and moon in HD 20694. I have been dropped from supercruise 3 times.Twice while headed to HP 20694 2F. It has 5 geological signals to visit. Nifty stuff at signal 4, although it's on the side of a cliff. But flying there from D (E & F share an orbit), I was dropped twice. Now I am dropped out headed out to the 3rd planet. I have checked my controller and it seems fine...

Anyway, I know I am late to the party, but better late than never.
