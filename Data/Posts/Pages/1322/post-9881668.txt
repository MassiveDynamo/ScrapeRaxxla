Hey... is this normal?

I am currently scanning each planet and moon in HD 20694. I have been dropped from supercruise 3 times.Twice while headed to HP 20694 2F. It has 5 geological signals to visit. Nifty stuff at signal 4, although it's on the side of a cliff. But flying there from D (E & F share an orbit), I was dropped twice. Now I am dropped out headed out to the 3rd planet. I have checked my controller and it seems fine...

Anyway, I know I am late to the party, but better late than never.
Mmm, my PC crashed Saturday afternoon when I was in SC. Maybe we both experienced a bit of a problem with a cloud of exotic particles...not saying it’s Raxxla...because it probably isn’t!
Welcome to the party! Always investigate strange phenomena, try to establish if it’s repeatable and in what way. Document with photos/video and tell us about it...
After 7 years hunting Raxxla we need some amusement!
