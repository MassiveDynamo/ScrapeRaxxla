Regards detection of any low power source object (Dark Wheel etc). I seem to recall, but ignored because it was Galnet, so probably fluff, an article which hinted at a top secret installation which was described as using low power, to shield itself from detection.

One thought I had, but never pursued, was could that have been a clue off FD, offering a fixed location to test methods for detection?

Eg ‘look at this, test the scanner, test something else, use your eyes’ what works, now go off and use that method?
