Did you remember to bring your own monolith?
Doh!
Packed the fish paste sandwiches, Wensleydale cheese, tomatoes and salad leaves, the lavian brandy, the cream chocolate eclairs, the black coffee & the thin chocolate mints ...
Knew there was something I’d forgotten!

But the experience did highlight the difficulty we face. I first did the search in SC at 30km/s with finger held on the discovery scanner button. Then, because the honk was cycling every 16secs I thought it possible I might have missed it between honks and decided to do it in normal space, so went 0.1 ls towards Jupiter and dropped out, turned around to face Io & restarted. Boosting twice for every honk my Phantom was averaging around 500m/sec, so around 8km between honks. That should catch it I thought, if you need to be within 10km to trigger it. Then I realised 0.1 ls=30 Mm, that requires more than 3 thousand honks to search (with 6000+ engine boosts!). Gave up after a while, fingers getting cramp!

FD could well have made this quest so difficult to complete I’m losing faith!!
Moved onto the moons.. but the same search problem exists...
