Regards detection of any low power source object (Dark Wheel etc). I seem to recall, but ignored because it was Galnet, so probably fluff, an article which hinted at a top secret installation which was described as using low power, to shield itself from detection.

One thought I had, but never pursued, was could that have been a clue off FD, offering a fixed location to test methods for detection?

Eg ‘look at this, test the scanner, test something else, use your eyes’ what works, now go off and use that method?

Yes, I wondered that, but it was on Luna so cant be investigated.

Edit: it was the start of the nuclear weapon storyline with theft of the Lucifer Device, so probably not a hint by FD. Unless you’re thinking of something else? That was the only galnet post I could find. Heinrich’s Archive is still giving gibberish when I access it, so I used https://news.galnet.fr/en/
