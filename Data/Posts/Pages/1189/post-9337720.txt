Did a bit of casual research in the past few days, didn't find anything of note except that I highly suspect the Barnard's Loop region to be somehow connected to it, not just because of the most recent event with the Azimuth. I think Black Hole systems will be related to Raxxla somehow, because thats the only kind of celestial phenomena that I could see being explained as a gateway/shortcut to another galaxy. Anyways, I ll leave with a pretty pic of my attempt at passing through dimensions:


I typed "One ticket to Raxxla, please!" into the chat, but sadly nothing happened
