I think there’s supposed to be another installment in the Azimuth Biochemicals storyline starting with Thursday’s server tick.

Tyko has reported nothing found so far in his search around Sol’s outer planets and moons. It strikes me the hexagonality of the Raxxla logo strongly suggests Saturn, which seems to be further strengthened by the Toast; I’m thinking Mother of Galaxies =Gaia and Jewel in her Crown is Sol (galnet post, Gaia faction)
Whisperer and Siren are both Venus (Marvel comic characters)
So the toast gives directions to move from Sol towards the outer planets.
Parent’s Grief & Lover’s Woe could be either Saturn (Greek Titan Cronus), Uranus (his father) or Rhea (Cronus’s sister & spouse, he swallowed her children).

But the mention of the Omphalos Rift is leaning me strongly towards Rhea since she gave the Omphalos Stone to Cronus in lieu of Zeus. Tyko’s had a look around there (among most of the other outer planet moons), but may have another look. But what is he looking for? Do we think a 2001SO monolith is likely? Should it be in orbit, since Raxxla should not require Horizons, or do we think that has been retconned?
