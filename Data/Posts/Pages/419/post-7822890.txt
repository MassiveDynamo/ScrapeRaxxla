I did a little trek along Eridanus constellation yesterday, inspired by something Jaiotu said last Thursday, while returning from my holiday at the Orion Nebula Tourist Center. (Fabulous place by the way, I have a Viper mk3 parked there and the hazardous resource extraction site is almost next to the asteroid station)

You know what else is not a place? Well, a constellation. Of course it doesn't take a genius to figure out why the river is not a direct route, but searching for correct stars and jumping around for them was entertaining experience.
Highlights from this trip would include "The Ascending Phoenix", a starport in Chi Eridani with a very grand name, not too far from Ankaa, a star ancient arabs in Sol system had named after phoenix. Then there was Theta Eridani, or Acamar, the original end of the river, except that it's not the end, because there is another. Nav beacon oddly far away from the binary. Achenar marks the end of the modern constellation, and there I would spend some time gathering engineer materials, because I have developed a fondness for fixed burst lasers, along other thermal weapons, and for this reason my third Federal Assault Ship had to be engineered again.

"Place that isn't a place"
The heart of the Empire is a confusing place. Much traffic goes there. I cannot but wonder where Alpha Eridani B has gone. As mentioned by Jorki, there should be two eyes staring in the void.
