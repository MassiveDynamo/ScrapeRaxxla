I think Fdev was a little more involved in premonition than u think.



Also the interesting bit in premonition about spokes on the dark wheel... Im sure had to be run by Fdev at the very least.

Im of the opinion that there are groups within the industrial complex who are either part of the dark wheel or working for them... I think Club could easily fit in there.
Agreed
