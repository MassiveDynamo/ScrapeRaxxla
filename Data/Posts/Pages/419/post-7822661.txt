I donâ€™t think there is any evidence linking the Club to Raxxla, but am willing to be convinced otherwise if you can quote the references. On the contrary Drew Wagar has confirmed that while The Club was his invention, FD required all the book authors to stay off the subject of Raxxla

I think Fdev was a little more involved in premonition than u think.

The Club are a representation of the Military Industrial Complex of the combined human powers in the ED universe. They were created by David, yes.

Cheers,

Drew.

Also the interesting bit in premonition about spokes on the dark wheel... Im sure had to be run by Fdev at the very least.

Im of the opinion that there are groups within the industrial complex who are either part of the dark wheel or working for them... I think Club could easily fit in there.
