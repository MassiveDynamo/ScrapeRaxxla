I think Fdev was a little more involved in premonition than u think.



Also the interesting bit in premonition about spokes on the dark wheel... Im sure had to be run by Fdev at the very least.

Im of the opinion that there are groups within the industrial complex who are either part of the dark wheel or working for them... I think Club could easily fit in there.

Good pick up, I had forgotten that. But it doesnâ€™t change my point which was that FD kept everything Raxxla-related to themselves, and there is no lore evidence linking Thargoids & Raxxla. Indeed there is no lore evidence linking Raxxla with anything after FD retconned the old lore.
Which makes me think in ED it is probably nothing like the description in And Here The Wheel
