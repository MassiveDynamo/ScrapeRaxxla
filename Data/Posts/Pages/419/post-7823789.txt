YouTuber AnwinBahl has 4 videos posted titled 'raxxla satelit' 1 - 4. It's just a bunch of pilot call signs and numbers for a series of like 7 mins or so. Being somewhat inexperienced at making these connections that some of you have been able to tie together, I figured I'd post this info here in case you guys thought we could find use in it. I only watched the first vid and it doesn't really start till after like 50 seconds.
Sorry this is not Raxxla. Its Dynasty Expedition
