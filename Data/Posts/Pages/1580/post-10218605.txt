Thereâ€™s a storyline!
The Storyline is decent but i would say Ody is better for missions, in Ody there is no set way to do a ground mission its up to you to acheive it whatever way you want.
Like Resto missions, sneak, break in, whatever you want, other games just give you text choices (Starfield/ESO) as the only options.
Ody also has way more types of missions with different difficultys that actually make you think and plan.
Starfield is ok, im just bored of it already, i think its the many years of ESO, im just done to death on the story dialog/cut scenes etc, with Elite i make the story without the fuss.
