Yeah, the cut scenes are time saving but quickly become boring. But then long flights between systems in ED are also boring...

Bethesda have obviously put a lot of effort into making the cutscenes graphically attractive, but ED is inherently beautiful (though I preferred the pre-Odyssey visuals). The ideal would be to beef up ED with decent storylines. Perhaps the devs will play Starfield and learn some lessons!?
The issue is the storys need to be done well, I loved ESO when it started, Bethesda did a great job up until Greymoor.
The plot was good,characters great but after that it descended into cheap cash grabs, Chapters with the same plots and a main quest you could finish in a night.
Maybe it was ZeniMax's influence but everything just seemed rushed, the development concentrated on overpriced items in the crown store, i can honestly see Starfield going the same way.

I will keep plodding along but its a chore rather than the experience i still have with EDO even after 6K+ hours.
