When you type in HIP 2066219â€¦ does it take you to lave in the map? Not at computer atm.
I think HanZen did some location work on Lave when he was working on his LEET line.
The HIP and HD identifiers are always seachable in the Galmap, if they are listed in the system info.
Some systems have other catalogues listed as well.

Identifiers that are not listed in the system info are not searchable.
