Liabefa - "A small but growing corporate system run by Wreaken Construction and Mining, the population has grown dramatically since 3200. Liabefa's Type M flare star is a space tourist highlight during active periods and features in the annual Astrogator sightseeing guide." An uninhabited system, which contradicts its description.
I have to check but this one may have had recurring appearances in FFE. Also, if that is a long-term variable it could have gone "hot" and rendered the system uninhabitable. You should look up Placet near the Old Worlds Coalition region. Still haven't figured out its' deal. It was featured in "Docking is Difficult" with an equally perplexing description. The name scheme of planets is also odd.
