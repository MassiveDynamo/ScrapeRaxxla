You must be talking about this:
Code:
https://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/mobile/object.html?object_name=HIP%2066219

Space characters in HTML mark-up for links is encoded with %20. That isn't actually part of the name - just how SIMBAD formats the identifier request being sent to their database.

No i was just talking about the map in elite- you can often type in the alternate HD and HIP names for stars and it will take you to it even if it is named differently.
