Jackson's Lighthouse - "A magnetar star formed from the collision and collapse of a previous dwarf binary system in 2672. Highly hazardous." Everyone's neutron star next door, surrounded by a gas giant and five brown dwarves.
This one played a major role in "Wanted". Jackson's Cave shows up in GalMap search but has never been found (in the book it gets pretty well trashed). Wanted also featured the Duval Artifact (also part of FFE missions).
