Did have another thought occur yesterday, but I’m currently having too much fun with Starfield missions (though I find its space combat atrocious after ED)
My initial thoughts (as a ED backer) about Starfield is how it’s a great example of how ‘simply’ ship boarding and on foot missions could have been applied in Odyssey, acknowledge it’s a dead horse, but a crying shame on what could have been with Odyssey. My only hope is the fiscal success inspires the accountants in FD to reconsider interiors and less about pew-pew…
