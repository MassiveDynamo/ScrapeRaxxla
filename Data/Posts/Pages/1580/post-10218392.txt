I never got into Odyssey. Bought it to pay FD for 6+ years of very happy gaming with ED at very low cost, but tried the intro and just hated the way the cutter refused to cut the panels. Starfield’s implementation is much better.

There’s plenty of pew-pew in Starfield, but the missions seem to have a lot more depth than anything in ED. There’s a storyline!
