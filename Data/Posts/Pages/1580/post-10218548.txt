I never got into Odyssey. Bought it to pay FD for 6+ years of very happy gaming with ED at very low cost, but tried the intro and just hated the way the cutter refused to cut the panels. Starfield’s implementation is much better.

There’s plenty of pew-pew in Starfield, but the missions seem to have a lot more depth than anything in ED. There’s a storyline!
The training session for Odyssey is okay. There's all sorts of cool stuff like "true form fossils" amongst other artifacts. Also, the settlements have a lot of intrigue associated with them. For one of the squadrons way out the black A.O.E. Allied Order of Exemplars has a large number of settlements in our home system. Also, planet 5 in our system is loaded with Thargoid Barnacles. You really should do missions or even just explore. They put a lot of work into Odyssey. Also, Odyssey opened up lots more than just settlements: low atmosphere worlds often with life, concourses, megaships with interiors, fleet carriers with interiors, and being able to finally meet and greet Engineers and other NPCs in-person. Elite Dangerous has plot but it is buried under layers of propaganda. There's what you have been told to believe and then there is what is actually happening.
