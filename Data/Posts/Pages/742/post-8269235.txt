Why would anyone think the contra code would work in elite. I mean they could put it in, but it's kind of obvious as a joke.

Contra code was also, "up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, Start." It was on the original Nintendo controller. Beat the game without it actually. And I think in contra it gave you more than lives I think it made you invincible or gave full weapons and stuff too.(maybe not)

I forget how and when you stuck in the code, but what if you have to put it in while the drive is booting for those 5 seconds or something. There could be a time to enter it. There are three phases to boot. 15 seconds minimum for the drive to boot. 5 seconds to enter the warp with a timer. 15 seconds to go through the tunnel to the next system. any one of those phases could be used to enter a code hypothetically.
