it's 32 for both rings if you consider those doubles.


The back of jameson is interesting. It may be a graphics thing but the line looks like it's in dashes from the angle. Are there any bases with a 6 sided shape on the back like that? I know some bases have 6 engine pods, but I don't think they have those lines. Is it possible there is something very blunt. Do we check the back of most bases?

In fact the back of those pods are six sided and look just like the raxxla symbol. Except the 3 dash lines are straight instead of curved... that is fairly similar in many ways to the Raxxla symbol. And there are six of them if you consider the middle one. Is there a geometric relation to those two shapes if you consider 3d or 4d or other logic? Would any aspect of these or the raxxla symbol convert to the other?

Found this also. Did anyone figure out the lave coordinates on this item?




Appears to say something like:

Lave
(C/O) 208(5/3) (degree 8 / %?) 77
??

Is it a planetary coordinate. Can we land on lave(maybe soon! 8p)? Is it for planet C2? Maybe the asteroid belt 2(Castellan2) or 02085?

C20 85deg 877?!

BTW, does the back of jameson memorial station change or was the previous picture doctored?

James Memorial picture I took was not edited in anyway. I will mention this was on the PS4 and not on my PC Elite Dangerous Account.
