Tin foil time… The toast of raxxla

To the jewel that burns on the mother of all galaxies!

The jewel I’m sure is life, read somewhere… According to the character Luko Prestigio Giovanni, "Shinrarta Dezhra" means Life?

To the whisperer in Witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!

I think the whisper in witch space is the frameshift drive as it whispers through, not actually goes there. As for the siren (a half woman and half bird, whose beautiful singing encouraged sailors to sail into dangerous waters where they died (eek why do we want to find the place)) could be a wake signature at Shinrarta’s deepest void.
