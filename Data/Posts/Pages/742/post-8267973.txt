Aren't there Shepherd galaxies that orbit the milky way? Much smaller than our own, could be considered dwarf galaxies possibly /suggestion


Jorki, good luck with your puppers

Yes, the Milky Way has quite a few satellites as I recall. I’m wondering if that’s what Raxxla is about, the original “gateway to other galaxies” in Holdstock’s TDW novella, though FD said categorically they’d only represented one galaxy- the Milky Way.

Thanks mate! Hopefully this will lead to a diagnosis of what’s causing his weekly fits since mid December. Which is contributing to my insomnia as they’ve all been in the small hours...
