there's a narrative that fdev started back in jacques jump days and the missing vice president days that there was singing in hyperspace and odd lights.. Like there were life forms that lived inside hyperspace trying to communicate.

That pretty much died out.

Though, it would be interesting if raxxla (like as been theorized before) existed inside hyperspace as a sort of bubble of 3d space ...a bubble universe. and that there could be some kind of permanent wake signature that leads to it that you have to find and scan from a certain system (perhaps in a roid field)...in order to reach it.
