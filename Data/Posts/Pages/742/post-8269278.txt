First id heard of it but consider me told

Only few issues with it are, 1 its a loading screen, 2 DB has said there are no other galaxies, and 3 Fdev have said no mis-jumps in game. (tbh I think hes prob a bit peed off with the question, I mean, here he is, designing a galaxy with 400bn systems and less than 1% explored and yet people keep asking about another one)

I think the clusters MB referred to just meant clusters of systems in the GalMap that were or maybe are unreachable currently (he was maybe speaking pre Engineers and certainly pre Synthesis as he refers to this as an upcoming solution) There are still Stars that are unreachable, not sure about clusters though, no reason why not a few of then together just out of reach.
