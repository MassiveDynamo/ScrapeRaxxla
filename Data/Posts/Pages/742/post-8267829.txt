Just ran into this on reddit

The "Great Raxxla Potato Hunt" has found an Unregistered Beacon not found on any list so far!

Edit: Disregard post for now apparently was found 2018 just everyone forgot about it.

Ah, doesn’t look like I included it in my LP/UCB summary -guess nobody told me about it. Will update later on today; dog to vet this morning for more blood tests; no breakfast today and he’s not at all happy! ☹

edit: LP/UCB sheet updated!
