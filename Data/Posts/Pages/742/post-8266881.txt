I was looking at some screen shots i took over the past year. after some recent discussion where someone posted the inside of a Coriolis station comparing it to the raxxla symbol, i couldnt help but start counting the lights around a 'wheel' station (toroid?). Anyways, is it just me or is there the same number of lights as the dots/dashes in the raxxla image?
