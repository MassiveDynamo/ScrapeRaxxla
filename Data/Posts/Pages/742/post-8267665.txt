Not to mention I took the picture from a longer distance so details would vanish so it would be hard to compare between the two. I'm pretty sure draw distance plays a large part in this too between console version and PC.

I'm thinking of going around and taking screen shots of stations and start comparing them. Some of them usually end up being unique like the one in system: LAWD 26 station: Stone Legacy.
Seem like a good idea. Cant hurt at least ill see if i notice anything too around where i patrol and enforce
