James Memorial picture I took was not edited in anyway. I will mention this was on the PS4 and not on my PC Elite Dangerous Account.
I believe your picture was night vision in the dark and his was night vision not quite as dark or something. also yeah I'm on PS4 that's how it looks most of the time for me and I think it's just PC graphics are better
