Just finished watching this vid & found only two interesting things (I’ve done a lot of exploration!). The first thing I was the statement that FD have plans for Gas Giants but he couldn’t talk about them, perhaps that’s one of the enhancements in the major update this year....perhaps floating lifeforms/materials that can be scooped? Or floating landable platforms?
The second thing was that nobody asked anything about Raxxla!

Oops, remembered during the early hours (insomnia, again!) that there was a third thing I found interesting about the MB exploration vid-he stated that there were dwarf clusters (galaxies? Can’t remember the exact phrasing he used & didn’t note the vid time) in-game that could not be reached yet , implying they could be at some future date. Do we know what these are and the distances involved? Is Raxxla a gateway to these??
