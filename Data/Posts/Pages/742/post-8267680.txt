Not to mention I took the picture from a longer distance so details would vanish so it would be hard to compare between the two. I'm pretty sure draw distance plays a large part in this too between console version and PC.

I'm thinking of going around and taking screen shots of stations and start comparing them. Some of them usually end up being unique like the one in system: LAWD 26 station: Stone Legacy.

Funny you should mention that, I was just trawling 'stuff' on the Winking Cat, Galnet, and other sources of information and took a screen shot of this promo piece that happens to have LAWD 26 and Stone's Legacy flagged.

Coincidence?



SPOILER: WINKINGCAT - UNIVERO?
