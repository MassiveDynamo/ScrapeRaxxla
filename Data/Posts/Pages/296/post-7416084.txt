The Jewel that burns (burning is orange usually, not blue)

The jewel lies on the brow of Cassiopeia: if you think its a clue, the system is:

HR 124



This is Cassiopeia, from Sol. the straight line above HR 124 is Caph and Schedar, the Blue star above KR 124 is Zeta Cassiopeia. Since Cassiopeia is upside down, the thing that represents her brow from most drawings is HR 124 area, not Zeta Cassiopeia.

Another interesting tidbit is in some drawings Cassiopeia has a mirror...
