The journey continues?

Probably a good idea to check on those tip off missions. There was this mission to pick up a black box somewhere in Pleiades region, 4-5 million credits reward, similar mechanism, this was a scripted mission.

I have been bothered lately by the artificial nature of our cockpit interferences creating visuals and sounds in space. Maybe those people jumping with their canopy breached, and synthesizing oxygen, really are up to something. A bit extreme perhaps. You know, there could be something strange out there you'd have to see with your own eyes.

The topic of sound in space appears every now and then, and it would seem Frontier did seriously consider how these things work in a simulation. https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=8236
