A lot of people have searched the Formidine Rift and the stars around the Zurara, although we didn't have the current exploration interface at that time, so who knows.

And back on page 320 or so, I posted that I had a theory last year that Zurara was just the half-way point, sort of like the Conflux sites for Colonia, and actually extended a coordinates line from Reorte to Riedquat to Zurara and beyond, and went exploring that edge of the galaxy. I looked around the stars at the rim in that direction, they get to 100 LY apart, but I didn't find anything. There are a lot of stars, and you can jump over significant numbers of them when you're flying 60 LY jumps in fast mode, so it's still needle in a haystack.

But, I might go back there to try again with the current exploration interface.

However, right now I have to grind combat elite. Page 1 of this thread, has the old missions that the Dark Wheel used to give out. They seem to be random gibberish, but one requires Elite explorer, one requires Elite trader, and one requires Elite combat, so even from 2-4 years ago the requirement seems clear - triple Elite.

And "Cobra" keeps popping up too. Maybe it's a coincidence that the 25-anniversary skin was a free Cobra skin, or maybe it's another hint.

Thought the same of the Zurara myself. Especially since he old lady said there were things to be seen like populated systems and ships amassing “way out where the stars thin out”
