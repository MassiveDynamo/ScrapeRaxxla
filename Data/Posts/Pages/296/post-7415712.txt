There is a proportionally heavier amount of teraformable systems at the top and bottom of the disk(the bottom at least.). Same with systems with fuel able suns. I think it's a game mechanic for maxed out anacondas though. And What I'm referencing is at the bottom below the bubble specifically. Maybe this changes as you move outwards. But, maybe in that area they are populated versions. That is the best place to find thinned out stars. You literally looking up at the disk of the entire galaxy and it's clearly far away from you. And there are very few stars. You literally need 80ly+ jump range to move around in alot of places. some places needing 166.xx ly to move on. Even more in some locations that are not reachable.
