*securely fastens tinfoil hat* so I’ve been thinking, maybe we need to get to the... crux... of the issue (see what I did there? ) Cassiopeia is in the north, and she’s holding a mirror. Crux is in the south and holds ‘The Jewel Box’ cluster. She would see that. It’s a jewel she would be seeing, and it might be a little on the nose to stuff something in the southern cross where X marks the spot. It might even be described as ‘just a little bit obvious’.

Rochester, Jorki Rasalas and Eckee
