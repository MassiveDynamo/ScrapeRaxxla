I think it was literally undetectable. They needed to know where it was or needed these access codes to locate it. I appreciate that article because itâ€™s matching with my Raxxla hypothesis. We need a module or permit of some kind to locate Raxxla. Maybe at the end of a quest line or start of it. We grab some module or engineering to our DSS and start the hunt. Or some kind of device we carry in our cargo hold like we do it with the Thargoid Link to locate new surface sites.

However one tool the FSS gives us is knowing the orbital plane of a star system.

In terms of hiding Raxxla the article seems to indicate more that the base itself was hidden, undetectable, and not the moon it was on. Also if we operate on the assumption that Raxxla is the 8th moon of a gas giant then either A) All 9 bodies have to be hidden or B) Being in the system would only show at best a gas planet with 7 moons, so this whole time people might have been seeing Raxxla and just moving on when they saw only 7 moons.
