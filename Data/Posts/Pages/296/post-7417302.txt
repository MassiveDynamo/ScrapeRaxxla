Unfortunately no, think I had it on an iPad Notes page on the FRift mystery which mysteriously disappeared after an ios software update a while ago. But there are old FRifters around with better memories than me - Han_Zen? SpocksOddSocks?

It might be on the last FRift thread, though I have a feeling it’s more recent than that. Have checked this lore thread https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/459433-Lore-questions-)/page5 but can’t find it there.

All I know is that If Drew knows something, it has nothing to do wit Raxxla.
