Not that I’m aware of. The Zurara I think is the only thing found there of note. DW was adamant that the FR mystery didn’t boil down to just a POI, but once the Zurara was found a lot of people stopped looking there assuming the whole thing was over with. I think there’s prolly something else to be found there although that’s just speculation. And if there is idk if it would be in any way related to Raxxla, or if it would be related to The Club, etc.

Took a trip to the thargoid base in Delphi. It’s definialty active, and the scavengers are cleaning corrosion damage off of an exposed area. Something I haven’t personally seen them do before. I don’t have the stuff or the setup to get inside myself to see what the coords might be that this base is sending us to. Anyone know or want to take a swing by.

DW has hinted there’s more to be found related to the FRift mystery. Whether this means there’s something in the FRift, Conflux or Gap I don’t know, but since Zurara was found in the FRift it would be logical to have two more derelict megaships in Conflux & Gap. Something had to be located to be found in the FRift, and that had to be poi (Zurara and the bases) due to the game mechanics, but it’s clear that DW’s real mystery was the Dynasty plot and the existence of The Club; finding those poi led to the disclosure of the latter. DW said he knew nothing about Raxxla so confusing the two storylines is probably counter-productive, there is no link between them.

Scavengers have been cleaning up corrosion since those thargoid sites were introduced in-game. Surprised it’s not all shiny by now. Should be clean enough to see your reflected tentacles! [big grin]
