Cheers. o7

O7 & welcome back CMDR.

Back to topic: It might be there actually is something about the Tip Off missions. A while back another CMDR posted a list of 3 system and later told us about some ingame trouble that ended after deleting said post. At that time I had one of those systems as a Tip Off mission but did not follow up on it. Now I have gotten the selfsame mission once again. Coincidence?
