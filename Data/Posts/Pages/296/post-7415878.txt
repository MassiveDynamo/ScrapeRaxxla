Took a trip to the thargoid base in Delphi. It’s definialty active, and the scavengers are cleaning corrosion damage off of an exposed area. Something I haven’t personally seen them do before. I don’t have the stuff or the setup to get inside myself to see what the coords might be that this base is sending us to. Anyone know or want to take a swing by.
