However one tool the FSS gives us is knowing the orbital plane of a star system.

In terms of hiding Raxxla the article seems to indicate more that the base itself was hidden, undetectable, and not the moon it was on. Also if we operate on the assumption that Raxxla is the 8th moon of a gas giant then either A) All 9 bodies have to be hidden or B) Being in the system would only show at best a gas planet with 7 moons, so this whole time people might have been seeing Raxxla and just moving on when they saw only 7 moons.

I was talking about the TDW station/base, not Raxxla ^^
