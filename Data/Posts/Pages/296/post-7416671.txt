DW has hinted there’s more to be found related to the FRift mystery. Whether this means there’s something in the FRift, Conflux or Gap I don’t know, but since Zurara was found in the FRift it would be logical to have two more derelict megaships in Conflux & Gap. Something had to be located to be found in the FRift, and that had to be poi (Zurara and the bases) due to the game mechanics, but it’s clear that DW’s real mystery was the Dynasty plot and the existence of The Club; finding those poi led to the disclosure of the latter. DW said he knew nothing about Raxxla so confusing the two storylines is probably counter-productive, there is no link between them.

Scavengers have been cleaning up corrosion since those thargoid sites were introduced in-game. Surprised it’s not all shiny by now. Should be clean enough to see your reflected tentacles! [big grin]

Ah, I must just not have noticed them before on my other trips to thargoid bases. You’re right tho they should be shiner than a new penny by now lol.
