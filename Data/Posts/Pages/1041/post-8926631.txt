I spent an hour in Eta Cassiopeiae performing the same search routine I did in Sol. After a while I slowed down and tried opening/closing the Orrery System Map close to a 100 (maybe 200) times. Eventually I observed the same "glow" effect from Sol, but instead of green it was black. Here's the clip:




I also noticed that much like in Sol I was being disaplaced, though at a different angle. There were no asteroid belts in this system.

If you play the video in slow motion you will notice that 'black glow' happens every time you go into system map. It is actually visible before the map comes up. I believe this to be the 'shadow' of the opening/closing map

Now we need to go back to the pre ious videos to look for the same thing
