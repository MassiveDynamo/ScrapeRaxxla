I spent an hour in Eta Cassiopeiae performing the same search routine I did in Sol. After a while I slowed down and tried opening/closing the Orrery System Map close to a 100 (maybe 200) times.

I also noticed that much like in Sol I was being disaplaced, though at a different angle. There were no asteroid belts in this system.

In IRH Discord Yuki Estelle has observed the “black glow” but can’t post a vid of it at present, but has pix.
