That’s what first piqued my interest when Koben mentioned it. There are of course the mythical “asteroid clusters”, when your position jumps 15 sectors around the belt according to the orrery view, but they only show up on the hud hologram. They aren’t in-game in practice. You can’t target them and drop out into their instance. Now why is this? I know they are, IRL, very thinly dispersed, but FD have created asteroid belts/rings in other systems and put asteroids there that you can mine/visit/crash into. So why not put some into Sol’s asteroid belt as a nod to reality? My suspicious mind said “ahah”! Probably because there’s something hidden there so they don’t want people to keep dropping in to visit. I started to circle around the belt trying to locate the presence of those mythical clusters, then I started to observe the green glows......
If they treat it as a ring around planet then the forge would make it so diffuse that it would not have any asteroids. Many planets have these huge rings that don't have anything but dust visual effects in them.
This whole thing with Sol feels broken/heavily unfinished, not on purpose tbh.
