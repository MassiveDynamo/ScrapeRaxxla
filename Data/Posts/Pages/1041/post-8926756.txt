The problem with axis and teleportation on map might be related?. Would explain it for me

Difficult to say, it might be if they both are using the same math functions.

A few days ago I found a possibly related problem when in the FSS. Sometimes it's not possible to zoom in on a star/planet while in the FSS-screen. When you zoom in, the camera immediately turns away and you can't get your cursor on the system body. It is very dependent on your orientation/position/distance to the system body in question. To me it looks like it might be a "gimbal lock"-problem, see the Wikipedia-page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock

If they (FDEV) do have a gimbal lock problem in their 3D-math then some of these problems can be explained by it.
