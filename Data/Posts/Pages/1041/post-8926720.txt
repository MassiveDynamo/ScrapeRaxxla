If they treat it as a ring around planet then the forge would make it so diffuse that it would not have any asteroids. many planets have tgese huge rings that don't have anything but dust visual effects in them.
This whole thing with Sol feels broken/heavily unfinished, not on purpose tbh.
Sadly this wouldn't be a surprise
