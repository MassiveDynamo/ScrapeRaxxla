Tried to 'fall' off the edge between the asteroid belt and deep space in the SLF; looks like that works, until I logged on again. Fighter was immediately out of range, and self destructed in 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 seconds...

Edit: Seat of the pants size estimate for the Asteroid belt at my position.
Distance from SOL: 1,569Ls
Width: 63.1Ls
Sector: 5
SPOILER: SECTOR 5
