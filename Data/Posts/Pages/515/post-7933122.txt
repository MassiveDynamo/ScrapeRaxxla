Candidate to be the Siren in deepest void...
So you keep thinking that every sentence of the TDW toast might refer to a distinct star/system. ?
A Whisperer, a Siren, a Parent and a Lover ?
Not really. I'm just open to the possibility.

They could all refer to Raxxla, to specific systems or directions or have double meanings. Those who made the toast don't know the exact location of Raxxla, so I doubt it's a step by step route.
