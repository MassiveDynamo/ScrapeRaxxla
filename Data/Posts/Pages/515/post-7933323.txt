Yeah, I know. I meant to say that I orbited and never saw anything as well, it's late and that sentence somehow just fell off. It's a really small moon, just one of my probes mapped it completely.

I suppose a station with a really huge Orbit might have been overlooked, would it not have an Orbit line either? I honestly expected a moon with rings, and an asteroid base to be the most logical location if this rumor is indeed true.

No, TDW station is an old wheeled station (Coriolis? Presumably smaller than current ones from what I remember of the Wiki); can’t be an asteroid according to the Codex entry. If it’s small then it should orbit closer to the moon than normal stations would. Must check out some orbital distances... except both Tyko & Jorki are way away from the bubble. Can someone check this out for a few cases-we need station orbit height, station type/name, & mass of planet/moon. Don‘t think we are told station mass, but a few cases should drop that out of the equation.
