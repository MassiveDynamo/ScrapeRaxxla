The station should be in orbit, not on the surface. It probably does not show up on the scanner at all.
Yeah, I know. I meant to say that I orbited and never saw anything as well, it's late and that sentence somehow just fell off. It's a really small moon, just one of my probes mapped it completely.

I suppose a station with a really huge Orbit might have been overlooked, would it not have an Orbit line either? I honestly expected a moon with rings, and an asteroid base to be the most logical location if this rumor is indeed true.
