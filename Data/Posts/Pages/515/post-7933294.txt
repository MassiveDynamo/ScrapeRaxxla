I just did. I was already FM'd and it's just a basic Ice Bidy with no locations. I cruised the surface for a bit but didn't come across any POI's... not sure if they'd hide something like that after the DSS upgrade...?
The station should be in orbit, not on the surface. It probably does not show up on the scanner at all.
I would guess that parallax and manual drop in is the only way to do it.
