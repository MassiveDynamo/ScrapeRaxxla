Elyssia can't be the original she was a clone too. That's why she was hiding in the tionisla orbital cemetery waiting for Ryder. The fact that her appearance would give away she was a clone was stated in tdw novella iirc.

My (current) thoughts:
I don’t think there’s any reason why Elyssia couldn’t be the original of this five. She was certainly the oldest. Of course they could all have been clones from a common brood mother as per the original novella. Since a clone is supposedly genetically identical to the original then I don’t think it would actually make any difference if the cells were taken from Elyssia or her brood mother-genetically they’d still be the same. Mind blowing!

TDW are supposed to be a shadowy band of adventurers and explorers, who hide because they’re persecuted (by The Club? who want to control exploration to avoid their Dynasty bases being exposed?). It’s The Club that is the shadowy organisation that murder people to keep their plans quiet, manipulate governments and markets for their own ends. Getting one of their clones (assuming Arissa is) as the Emperor would presumably significantly boost their influence in the Empire. So more likely that The Club is behind the cloning. Remember Rebecca (a clone) was one of them till she broke away.

It strikes me that TDW (Elyssia) put Salomé into CoR in an attempt to organise CoR exploration efforts (on the pretext that they were actually hunting for Raxxla) and so expose The Club’s plans, Rebecca knew there was something hidden in deep space by The Club. Presumably TDW didn’t know about the Exodus/Dynasty plot until Salomé found and exposed it; Rebecca had been hexedited to forget it, & eventually was killed for that exposé.
