Regarding the old worlds and The Dark Wheel, has anyone checked Tionisla 6g for dark stations?

That would be a fitting system for them, with the cemetery and old lore stuff.

I just did. It was already FM'd and it's just a basic Ice Body with no locations. I cruised the surface for a bit but didn't come across any POI's- not sure if they'd hide something like that after the DSS upgrade...?
