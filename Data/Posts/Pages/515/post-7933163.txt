Those who made the toast don't know the exact location of Raxxla, so I doubt it's a step by step route.
Yeah, that's what I think too. Even the on the brow - thing may just be a poetic description.
But we could admit that TDW knows something about the nature of Raxxla. Then that whisperer and siren things.
Is Raxxla's whispers and songs what we hear when in witch space, the deepest possible void ???
Is this the cause of our space madness? Is Raxxla siren driving us crazy and leading us to our fate?
We Explorers, just like Jason the Argonaut and Jason R. from TDW, are doomed !

Both Jasons' were looking for their own Golden Fleece. Should we have a look at Aries ? Or at the Colchis Regio, on.. Jupiter ?
Although Aries came to represent specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology ... (Wikipedia)
SPOILER


Any Chrysomallon, Colchis, Medea in the GalMap ? There is a Chrysos around Colonia iirc... Player named ?
What about the Odysseus' Sirens ? (Thelxinoe or Thelxiope or Thelxiepia or Thelxiepe or Thelxiepeia. Aglaophonus or Aglaope or Aglaopheme. Molpe. Aglaonoe. Parthenope .Leucosia. Ligeia. Peisinoe or Pisinoe. Himerope )
