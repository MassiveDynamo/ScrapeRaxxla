I used to have this argument with people indiscriminately throwing their credit card and bank account information into random websites and claiming they had nothing worth stealing "in there" but the thief doesn't want your money, they want your identity to heist the bank's money and make you responsible.
Long ago I knew such guy and saw him at work. Well, they paid bigger price - paranoid as hell, never gets drunk, friends dunno his true name etc.
