When I first saw "Cardboard" it seemed like a great entry level (cheap) VR alternative but thinking about it a little harder it dawned on me that having a microwave transmitter strapped to your face at some optimal distance set by a company such as Google / Alphabet could have extremely bad consequences.

Their reputation is rapidly sliding into a deep hole and Google is no longer your friend / trustworthy.

[Edit: Maybe if the phone was in "Aeroplane mode" and you could trust it NOT to transmit...]
[Edit, edit: Despite the inconvenience I flat refuse to use any hardware that's not hardwired.]
Just add a tinfoil mask to your tinfoil hat. Problem solved.
