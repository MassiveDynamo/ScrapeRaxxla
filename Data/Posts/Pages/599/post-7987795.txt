Do you guys dss atmospheric planets? I did for a while but they seem to be worthless if they've already been mapped

I’ve even dss’d a couple of planets that I’d already dss’d, out in Broken Heart Cluster.
Though that was because EDD was running slow and didn’t tell me I’d already visited the system
