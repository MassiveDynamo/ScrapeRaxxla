Haha, I can sense the impending futility of finding Raxxla especially when this post is now going on about mobile phones. I would not be surprised to log in tomorrow to see the discussion has found out the price of carrots... in Norway.

You can get 1kg of carrots for about $1.85 USD in Norway. That's pretty much the same where I'm from, I guess we can assume the carrot economy is stable.
