You don't even needs facts from "deep holes in the Internet", just common sense. If phones produced enough RF radiation to rival a microwave you would have tens (possibly hundreds) of millions of people affected. I don't see how phones can both be dangerous and the dangers of using it is also a secret that only the "woke" know of.

Maybe I'm mistaken in thinking the "tinfoil" talk was just a joke in this thread.
