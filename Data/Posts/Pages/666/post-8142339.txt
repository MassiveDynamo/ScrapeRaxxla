Just one thought. That Cora or Kora from the toast. She is not only daughter of Demeter. In ancient Greek history was some tradition making statues of young girls - Koras or korai. So that word meant any girl or maiden. But what is idea of it for our quest?.. Maybe name of Art may help us? Art of the sculpting.

And another thing in that names. Tornqvist. This very similar as Thorn Quest for my poor ear. Very very "knotty" quest with many thorns.
