It’s directly written in the codex - Raxxla is a planet. Look under the photo.

That Codex photo is more likely to be The Real Dark Wheel’s stealthy station in orbit near a planet & star, not Raxxla. The two seem to be linked by the mixing of the TRDW toast in the Raxxla codex entry, but we won’t know how they are linked until we find it. Though I’ve said before that we might find a station named “Raxxla Gateway”...
