Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Celtic, Nordic, Hindu, Aztec, Maja. They are all in the game.

I wish to formally complain that some religions are being discriminated against! Where is the Great Lord Ilkley represented in-game? This ancient religious belief is still practiced in some parts of Northern Britain, as witnessed in the religious chant “On Ilkley Moor ba’t ‘at, on Ilkley moor ba’t ‘at, on Ilkley moor baaa’t ‘t’at”. An ancient ditty that instructs faithful Ilkley worshippers to remove all headgear before approaching His Presence.
