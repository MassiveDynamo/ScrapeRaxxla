That's fairly simple:

1. We don't know really, what it is or where it is. Raxxla is 'in the Milky Way' is the most direct clue so far really.
2. We don't know really. Its a real faction, whether it is connected to the 'real' DW is debateable and not known. Farseer in DW Codex entry says the DW is real but shes never met them and that they wouldn't show themselves in public but also that any phony trading on the name would be quickly and quietly shut down, which the DW in Shinrata hasn't yet....so make your own conclusion. Theres a contradiction there whichever one is right, unless Farseer is wrong or lying.

Fliss says she knows the DW is real, and uses the fact that 'impersonators' are removed to validate them, implying DW in Shindez - now the fact the DWinSD still exist as a faction could be read from that as an assertion that they are real, but given that 3 x in a few paragraphs, their validity as the real thing is called into question steers me to the 'the guys in SD are fake' reading, as a call out from FD to point out that they retconned the E/F missions. My reading anyway - I can agree that there is room for doubt, as usual.
