Suffering from brain failure. Anyone know the mass of an Orbis station? Googled but can’t find it. Want to check the lagrange point distances on the possibility that TRDW stealth station is so positioned. You can’t get it from orbital height above a planet as its mass cancels out of the equation.
Lagrange point between a station and a planet?
