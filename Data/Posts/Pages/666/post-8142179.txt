Just to add to the Egyptian named sites, I have also found that there are more Roman Gods and deites named systems than Egyptian ones. Of course, the Egyptians shared some of these with the Romans.

Don't know if this has any bearing on things, but all are in the bubble as well. Zeus, Athena, Hera, Poseidon, Ares (Mars), Apollo, Artemis, Hephaestus (Vulcan), Hermes (Mercury), Demeter (Ceres) and others are present in the bubble.

Maybe a combination of both will provide some insight.
