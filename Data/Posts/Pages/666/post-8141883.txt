I propose to make a small summary, write on points all the tips that we consider correct. And decide on two points
1. what we are looking for in the bubble or not.
2. whether the dark wheel in the bubble is real.

That's fairly simple:

1. We don't know really, what it is or where it is. Raxxla is 'in the Milky Way' is the most direct clue so far really.
2. We don't know really. Its a real faction, whether it is connected to the 'real' DW is debateable and not known. Farseer in DW Codex entry says the DW is real but shes never met them and that they wouldn't show themselves in public but also that any phony trading on the name would be quickly and quietly shut down, which the DW in Shinrata hasn't yet....so make your own conclusion. Theres a contradiction there whichever one is right, unless Farseer is wrong or lying.
