well if anyone wants to help me, lol...

I was looking at these three systems; Maia - Polaris - Zeta Cassiopea
They make a near perfect triangle on the galmap...

Zeta Cass being the jewel from the story, Maia I cant remember of the top of my head why now lol, and Polaris being permit locked for no reason what so ever, just feels like its a beacon or somthing. Anyways... if I can narrow down some systems in the reight area, i want to give them a look...
I've pretty much come too think Raxxla is not inside the bubble, because i remember somewhere reading that the real Dark Wheel station was supposed to be in a system "far from civilization, far enough to be considered of no value", now yes that could just mean, a place like the voyager craft, out in the middle of nowhere inside a system, but i think it more likely means the system itself is far enough away 99% of people would consider it worthless to bother going there for any reason.

Why Polaris? Or Zeta Cassiopea as the jewel.
My own opinion for the "Mother of Galaxies" would be the super massive black hole that is Sag A*. Being that it's a super massive black hole and the centre of our own Galaxy, a kind of mother of sorts to our own Milky Way and practically every other galaxy has it's own super massive black hole at the centre, their own "mother" giving birth to countless stars etc.. Just my own opinion but that's how I look at it.
