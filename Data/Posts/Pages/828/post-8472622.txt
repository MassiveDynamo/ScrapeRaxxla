Hey thanks. I've just been told by a friend that the galaxy andromeda is included in the constellation. As in when we look at that constellation we see andromeda. I just never knew that. I was the same, I thought more along the lines of what created the galaxy.

I also believe Cassieopea was the mother of andromeda, thats why its the mother of galaxies, atleast, why its mostly been accepted as the mother of galaxies
