Small problem is ....EDSM is incomplete. 2 days ago I just added 5 new systems and fixed bodies in 10+. That was ...well, systems still had signals spawn - that was so close to bubble.

Thought that might be the case.

The codex also lists a bunch of wolf rayonet stars supposedly found by npcs, although it doesn't seem to be exhaustive. There are maybe 4 or 5 listed in each sector.

This would probably be a more sensible resource to use than an Edsm as the tools to find raxxla should really be available to anybody without needing to turn to external sites that players made independently of the Devs.

The dates in the codex all suggest the stars were found in the 2100's regardless of where they are, which ruins my theory about the distance from sol, but i'm wondering if there may be further hints in the names of the discoverers.

One in the errant marches was discovered by 'thedarklord', which might tie in to the below line in the codex, but it Could also just be a coincidence.

'A number of conspiracy theories assert that Raxxla has already been discovered by either a sinister cabal or a lone individual who has harnessed Raxxla's power to become the shadow ruler of all of humanity'

Not sure if there is a way to format the list into a table for anybody who has ed on pc? It would be much easier to navigate that way.
