Why Polaris? Or Zeta Cassiopea as the jewel.
My own opinion for the "Mother of Galaxies" would be the super massive black hole that is Sag A*. Being that it's a super massive black hole and the centre of our own Galaxy, a kind of mother of sorts to our own Milky Way and practically every other galaxy has it's own super massive black hole at the centre, their own "mother" giving birth to countless stars etc.. Just my own opinion but that's how I look at it.
In the relation between Sag A* and the stars of the Milkiway I cannot find an analogy to being a mother. What Sag A* does to a star coming to close is to rip it into pieces and suck it in. Not quite like giving birth...
