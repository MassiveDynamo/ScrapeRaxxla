In the relation between Sag A* and the stars of the Milkiway I cannot find an analogy to being a mother. What Sag A* does to a star coming to close is to rip it into pieces and suck it in. Not quite like giving birth...
Oh sorry, I could have worded it better. Thinking about it for a while, I should have said something like..

Sag A* being the super massive black hole at the centre of our milky way Galaxy and everything in the Milky Way orbits around it is (metaforically speaking) akin to something like a mother would do to keep to watch over her children (stars), Much like what every other Galaxy that has a super massive black hole at their centres are doing.

If anyone could word it any better then please do.
