Update there A/B/C coordinates, take from EDSM
In "main" (very bottom) update what u want to find, currently it gives center of circle inside triangle ABC. I.e. it is a point on equal range from AB-BC-CA routes.
It will print a link to query edsm, just paste in browser.

But..for example, i did'nt finish "equal remote from a-b-c" - as it will be line intersecting surface abc. Need 4th point.

AND BTW, thanks for the link, i finally got 5 min to sit down and use it, edit it with my coordinates, but THANKS, huge help, now I can triagulate from any 3 systems I want, I've got a few I wanted to try, but its been so long I gotta look em all up again, lol

But thanks, I got a different result for centroid using your code than the picture I was given, so im going to check out about 20 or so systems around each one... they are not far far from each other, but slightly off...
