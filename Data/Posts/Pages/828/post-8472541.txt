There is the sonnet sequence with 108 sonnets and 11 songs composed by Philip Sidney called "Astrophil and Stella". But I don't think it's related to raxxla case.
It could well be a cypher where we use specifc words from page number, line number, then word count to decrypt an encripted message... so, we should not dismiss it that quickly.
