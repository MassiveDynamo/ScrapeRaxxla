I just came to ETA Cassiopeia, well... reading those names in system I could Imagine 1000 tin foil theories.
What if toast is like address: city, street, building, room. Then it could be star system + orients inside it. Maybe some habitat system with weird names.

This fits then. It can be some installation ...once you scan it, it will give you some message to follow.
Also fits with obfuscation.

Also fits with the exoplanet theory (if within a system instance)
