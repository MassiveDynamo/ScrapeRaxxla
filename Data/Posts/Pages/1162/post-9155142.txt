Its a bit stretched

Thats never stopped anyone here before, stretched is all we have atm some even go so far as twisty and bendy to make something fit but we never know what will trigger someone into thinking something that may actually be useful anyway so as long as its posited as a theory or tinfoil most people wont have a problem with it. Its only the cult leaders who insist theirs is the only way that get no response....and the ones who hint that they know the answer and just give vague solutions as to what somebody else should do to 'see' the truth get the scorn coz they either deluded or hoaxers and weve had enough of them here. Thats what Reddit and Discord is for
