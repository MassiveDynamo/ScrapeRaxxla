Ok so using the Medieval Latin Notations....
R / A / X / X / L / A
becomes:
80 / 5 / 10 / 10 / 50 / 5
now we simplify by dividing everything by 5:
16 / 1 / 2 / 2 / 10 / 1
and convert into alphabet again based on a=1 b=2 etcâ€¦:
P / A / B / B / J / A

is the path we must all take...

The Wikipedia page also mentions the Renaissance practice of Chronograms , where the letters I, V, X, L, C, D, and M are extracted from a text, to form a number.
This would be a typical FD trick. There might be something hidden in the codex or The Dark Wheel?
