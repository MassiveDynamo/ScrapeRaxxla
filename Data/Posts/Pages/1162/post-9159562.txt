After more dead-ends I found what looked 99% like a bug but I'm at the stage where I have to assume it is worth investigating. This was of course observed when I didn't have any passenger cabins so I could not accept the mission.



Off I went to pick up a passenger cabin, and on my return the mission had gone (I was aware this may be the case). However, a different passenger mission from the same faction had an even more tempting 'forge your own path' option. Of course, I'm gonna need a bigger boat passenger cabin than I'd equipped so this mission is also unavailable.
