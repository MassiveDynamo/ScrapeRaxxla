They are cool coincidences, but I don't think you are supposed to add up the numbers in . I think they should form complete roman numbers.
The sequence MLXIII (1063), is the highest year I can see.
Then again, you were seemingly allowed to rearrange the letters.

Personally I think the codex is would be a little dubious for FD to encode, as it comes in different languages.

I think so too but ignoring the last bit anyway just for tinfoil and lols and coz I really enjoyed learning about the code...and after all that myth and astronomy it was something I could understand

We can break the numbers up by just stopping when it gets to the end of the 'sequence' so for example:

50 + 1000 + 50 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 100 + 100 + 1 + 500 + 5 + 1 + 500 + 10 + 10 + 50

Would become:

50 = 50
1000 + 50 + 10 + 1 +1 +1 +1 = 1064
100 +100 + 1 = 201
500 + 5 + 1 = 506
500 + 10 + 10 = 520
50 = 50

which gives us 6 numbers / coordinates (7 or more in most of them though). Which means nothing to me.

Mainly though Ill be looking for this code elsewhere from now on and running stuff through it just for fun. Although it doesnt seem like a 'typical' Frontier code.
