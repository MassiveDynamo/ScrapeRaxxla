Drat - ya good point. Oh well
The codex also hints that the children's story Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars is the place to look for concealed facts about Raxxla's whereabouts.

We of course don't have access to PAaSS, but it does hint to an external source. That cold be TDW, Astrophel and Stella or something else.
When making the Raxxla mystery in ED, FD had the advantage of no pre defined location. That means that they could have taken any text, extracted some numbers and put Raxxla there.

I'm sure it's no coincidence that Lave was placed at R: 13h 37m. When you have the freedom to move stuff where you want it, you can make things fit anything from the past.
