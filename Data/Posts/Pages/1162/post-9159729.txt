After more dead-ends I found what looked 99% like a bug but I'm at the stage where I have to assume it is worth investigating. This was of course observed when I didn't have any passenger cabins so I could not accept the mission.

Off I went to pick up a passenger cabin, and on my return the mission had gone (I was aware this may be the case). However, a different passenger mission from the same faction had an even more tempting 'forge your own path' option. Of course, I'm gonna need a bigger boat passenger cabin than I'd equipped so this mission is also unavailable.

My opinion only

First one - looks like a bug
Second one - ??????? pffff, hmmmm, well, but what? OK what did the text details say? There may be a tourist beacon called 'Choose your own adventure' maybe? Its too specific unless its a dev joke placeholder that got bugged through or something? Was there a system to go to in the text? Slightly baffled.

he codex also hints that the children's story Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars is the place to look for concealed facts about Raxxla's whereabouts.

Ive speculated that if its not just fluff it might be connected to one of the books released. Salome is the closest I know of and thats nothing to do with it though. Would more likely be MB book but havent read it.

We know Salome story was put in game, do we know if any of the other authors got stuff added apart from the Stations? Maybe something in one of them is actually in game and still not found? Its a long shot I know.

I'm sure it's no coincidence that Lave was placed at R: 13h 37m

Youre going to have to explain that one please, Im completely clueless what the connection is (may be obvious to everyone else so go easy on me )
