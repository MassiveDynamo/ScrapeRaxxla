Not sure how this fits, but....

Eyes are called:

The doorway to the soul
The key to the soul

Could simply eyes be the answer to that line of the riddle? Its definitely a little bit obvious!

Or, soul....pointing us back to the heart and soul nebula, tying in with my long held theory we "missed" raxxla during the Salome piece (although obviously not directly related)?

There has been quite an extensive search of heart and soul I personally think it would be found by now if something else was there.I have explored there for a few months myself (long ago). You would be lucky to find an unvisited system anywhere around there being a popular theory. But you should check it out for yourself it's definitely worth a visit and you could be right and it was overlooked somehow.
