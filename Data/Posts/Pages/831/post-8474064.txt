The cluster it self is not a singular place, it's many places. so I'm not completely giving up on the theory.
If Raxxla was a door that gave you access to another galaxy (or even a cluster of galaxies) that would be really cool, but.....Raxxla MUST be in the Milky Way, or we would not be able to get to it in the 1st place
