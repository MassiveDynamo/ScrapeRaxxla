Where do you get that from? Just done a search & cant find it in TDW novella.
But it was definitely in one of the early ShinDez missions that disappeared from the board.
Yea you're right, again. I just reread that part. I swore thats where i read it since i didnt have those missions.

Also i dont think the in game the dark wheel is the real group. Maybe a front or diversion. Everytime im about to have them control lft 926 some catastrophic state causes us to drop rapidly. Its repeatable.
