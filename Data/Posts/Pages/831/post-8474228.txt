There has been quite an extensive search of heart and soul I personally think it would be found by now if something else was there.I have explored there for a few months myself (long ago). You would be lucky to find an unvisited system anywhere around there being a popular theory. But you should check it out for yourself it's definitely worth a visit and you could be right and it was overlooked somehow.
Yeah. I have spent a reasonable amount of time down that way. Found loads of unexplored systems. First to discover a raft of biological sites. That was a year ago now though.
