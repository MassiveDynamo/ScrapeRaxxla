When you say "retconned", do you mean Frontier has outwardly stated that line is not canon? Or simply that the quest text mentioned no longer appears? If it's the latter, I think it's safe to assume it's still canon as long as the Dark Wheel faction is the real Dark Wheel.
The latter. Safe to assume its canon? Not so sure? Why were they removed? We dont know.

a) @Macros Black was getting to close to finding Raxxla?
b) They were removed accidentally when missions ranking got changed from enforced to suggested and they haven't put them back in?
c) They went the way of Gan Romero and got removed because they were actively sending CMDRs down a blind alley?
