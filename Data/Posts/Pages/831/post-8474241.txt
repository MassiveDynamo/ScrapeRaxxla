Yea you're right, again. I just reread that part. I swore thats where i read it since i didnt have those missions.

Also i dont think the in game the dark wheel is the real group. Maybe a front or diversion. Everytime im about to have them control lft 926 some catastrophic state causes us to drop rapidly. Its repeatable.
Is that because:
A) They are having their influence "capped" by the real dark wheel?
B) They are the real Dark Wheel and having their influence "capped" by a sinister cabal that dont want the finding R
C) They are the real Dark Wheel, but FDev aren't ready for anybody to get an invite?

I really hope it's not C. But there must be a reason as it's against game mechanics
