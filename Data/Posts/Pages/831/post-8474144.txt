Yea you're right, again. I just reread that part. I swore thats where i read it since i didnt have those missions.

Also i dont think the in game the dark wheel is the real group. Maybe a front or diversion. Everytime im about to have them control lft 926 some catastrophic state causes us to drop rapidly. Its repeatable.

Space Madness mate! The cure is a large Lavian brandy (or 3), a bar of dark chocolate, and a good film on TV.

Interesting. I did read one poster that thought the disappearance of those missions was an indication that DW in ShinDez is not the real TDW, and your bgs machinations might support that. The contrary evidence is that Felicity said in the codex that DW fakes are shut down, but they’re still there! So either she lies, or codex lies, or...
I suspect that the truth is as per Premonition- they’re “on the outer rim” of the organisation and a useful front. How they’re useful remains tbd!!
