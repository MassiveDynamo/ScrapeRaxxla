When you say "retconned", do you mean Frontier has outwardly stated that line is not canon? Or simply that the quest text mentioned no longer appears? If it's the latter, I think it's safe to assume it's still canon as long as the Dark Wheel faction is the real Dark Wheel.
I believe he means the mission no longer appears. FD never says much if anything about the subject.
