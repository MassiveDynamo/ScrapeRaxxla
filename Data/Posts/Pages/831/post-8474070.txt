Well, this quote was in game but since retconned. However as ED only has Milky Way...if Raxxla is in game, it cannot be a cluster of galaxies


When you say "retconned", do you mean Frontier has outwardly stated that line is not canon? Or simply that the quest text mentioned no longer appears? If it's the latter, I think it's safe to assume it's still canon as long as the Dark Wheel faction is the real Dark Wheel.
