Not sure how this fits, but....

Eyes are called:

The doorway to the soul
The key to the soul

Could simply eyes be the answer to that line of the riddle? Its definitely a little bit obvious!

Or, soul....pointing us back to the heart and soul nebula, tying in with my long held theory we "missed" raxxla during the Salome piece (although obviously not directly related)?
