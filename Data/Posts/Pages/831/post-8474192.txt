Space Madness mate! The cure is a large Lavian brandy (or 3), a bar of dark chocolate, and a good film on TV.

Interesting. I did read one poster that thought the disappearance of those missions was an indication that DW in ShinDez is not the real TDW, and your bgs machinations might support that. The contrary evidence is that Felicity said in the codex that DW fakes are shut down, but they’re still there! So either she lies, or codex lies, or...
I suspect that the truth is as per Premonition- they’re “on the outer rim” of the organisation and a useful front. How they’re useful remains tbd!!
Well, The Dark Wheel is also expanded into LFT 926. ... and they are currently in a state of War in that system (just started war today - they were just pending yesterday). We could try to push further expansion. Since it is now in a state of War, INF is frozen till the war ends so to help The Dark Wheel you will need to go to those CZs in LFT 926 and join the side of The Dark Wheel.
After I get off of work, I am going to head over there and do what I can. I need the Combat Bonds anyway for the Juri Ishmaak engineer unlock.
