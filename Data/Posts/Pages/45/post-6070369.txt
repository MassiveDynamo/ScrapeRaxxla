What I hope happened: Someone figured out the clues and found Raxxla.
What I think happened: Missions were a dead end, leading no where, and got cleaned out.

Can't be better said.


Edit 2 : please, who can tell me why everybody writes Cmdr in capitals ? Is it game related or is it the common way in Anglo Saxon militaries ??
