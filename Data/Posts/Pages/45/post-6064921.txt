So apparently the PF are no longer a faction, they're a super power!

I don't know how this affects the BGS in Shinrarta Dezhra, I suspect that it is locked like Sol. But does it now mean that the DW can easily become the most influential faction there?

So where else do the PF appear, now they're no longer a faction? This may give a clue to where Raxxla is.

They no longer appear in the missions pane, but I was there early Sunday & I think they were still in control of Jameson
