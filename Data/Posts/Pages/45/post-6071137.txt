Yep. That's what I was thinking to remember from ...past times.
No wonder why FDevs mix 'Clippers' and 'Cutters' so badly !
They surely are not 'ol'school'...
[haha]

Indeed!
Clipper: "fast, yacht-like vessels, with three masts and a square rig. They were generally narrow for their length, could carry limited bulk freight"

Cutter: "A cutter is typically a small, but in some cases a medium-sized, watercraft designed for speed rather than for capacity. Traditionally a cutter sailing vessel is a small single-masted boat, fore-and-aft rigged, with two or more headsails and often a bowsprit. The cutter's mast may be set farther back than on a sloop."
