I don't quite understand how this can be connected to something, or my translator made strange connections, but these two logos (TDW and Raxxla) have just the colors yellow and green and saw when one was superimposed on the other. But I've never seen these 2 logos mixed to get the orange color.
And on the other hand yellow turns green when you mix it with black.
