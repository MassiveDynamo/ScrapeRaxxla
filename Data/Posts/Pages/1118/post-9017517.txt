I have always wondered why we see Orange in this game, can it have anything to do with Raxxla?

for example, if you mix two colors that turn orange and it usually turns out like this.



Can these colors have anything to do with which suns there are in Raxxla?

I know that if there are two different sun colors in a solar system, the colors of the planets would be affected by sunlight as this case turns orange.
