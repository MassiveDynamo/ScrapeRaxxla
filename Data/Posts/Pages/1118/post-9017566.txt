I have always wondered why we see Orange in this game, can it have anything to do with Raxxla?

for example, if you mix two colors that turn orange and it usually turns out like this.



Can these colors have anything to do with which suns there are in Raxxla?

I know that if there are two different sun colors in a solar system, the colors of the planets would be affected by sunlight as this case turns orange.

Feasible, but I suspect more likely to be a stupid marketing decision by FD who probably hired at great expense a firm of marketing consultants who told them to have a standout brand they should use a memorable colour like bright orange for most of their marketing, logos, hud elements etc etc, and FD forgot to point out that many stars are bright orange, so are many planet surfaces, and pilots often canâ€™t read those hud elements. Plus, it gives me a headache!
