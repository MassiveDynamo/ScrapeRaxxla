Ah, after checking them myself, I dont see much, if any difference in them either to be honest. Would be intriguing to find out where that skybox is though...

And as a long time, long term player (played all 3 originals) I don't know if Raxxla is real, and wouldn't even begin to know where to find it, but if it's here in game, then I'm sure we'll find it eventually. Whether it would be worth it or not would be down to our interpretations of worthiness.

That said, I think its got something to do with TDW at Shinrata, but obviously with the proc gen missions being messed up, it might be that we can't find it due to them. Who knows though, Odyssey might fix them again, and the hunt can begin in earnest (but knowing FDev...)?
Whoever Raxla is, but I think you can only find her after certain conditions are met.

For example, I have a lot of things in the Codex in every region of the galaxy and almost all of them are unconfirmed.
I have to confirm it all and then I can find her.
