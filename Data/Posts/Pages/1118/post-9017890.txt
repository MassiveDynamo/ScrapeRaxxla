Long time lurker and player of the game here, (and my first post here, so please be gentle)

NO! wind your neck in noob!

Seriously, welcome to the the quest of the rest of your life. Now youve posted theres no hope of escape, youre trapped here just like all of us Always good to see fresh faces, especially 84ers, hope you can make some sense of the whole thing, meant to say hello earlier but forgot. theres no theory too far fetched here so have fun (Im biased but this is the best thread on the forums imo) Whether its science, religion, history or politics theres a theory about Raxxla in it and nobody can say youre wrong or its not connected as nobody knows and Braben aint telling. In fact he aint even saying what it is or whether its stationary in one system or not so pretty much anything goes in the quest, even if youre wrong you may trigger a thought in someone else so dont hold back.
