No offence but Im guessing you are using some sort of translator and I sometimes have a hard time understanding what you mean, so forgive me if this is way off the mark of what you meant, its down to misunderstanding purely.

Some stories had local GalNet stories that disappeared after a period of time - this is most annoying and frustrating for people like me trying to follow the trail (Canonn is a godsend sometimes with this, sometimes I just have to give up) Theres a couple where the UCB gives a key to a message in local GalNet that just isnt there anymore in-game!

Some stories had associated GalNet that werent there for some reason. @drew can correct me on this but iirc there were some GalNet stores that either got 'missed' completely by players or werent published properly during the Exodus storyline due to bugs or something (my memory is hazy and second hand, I wasnt there during the event). And iirc some others didnt appear due to the story being solved before expected timeline and story played out eg Jacques had some GalNet that never got published due to being found early.

So some have been lost to time, and some didnt get published correctly. Hopefully that isnt happening now. But some do lead to dead ends in-game or are Easter Eggs that mean nothing now coz theres no context to place it or make sense of it.

Frontier if youre listening, please leave local GalNet history intact in future, regardless of how long ago the event happened, its still new to me and other players today when I find it and its still as exciting as when the first player found it.

Havent checked Chukchan to see if that local GalNet article has stayed or gone though, hope its still there.

I agree. The local news should be archived and still accessible through the local system news outlet!
Though not in microfiche!!
