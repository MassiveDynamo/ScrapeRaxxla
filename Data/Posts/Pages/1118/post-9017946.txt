I have always wondered why we see Orange in this game, can it have anything to do with Raxxla?

for example, if you mix two colors that turn orange and it usually turns out like this.



Can these colors have anything to do with which suns there are in Raxxla?

I know that if there are two different sun colors in a solar system, the colors of the planets would be affected by sunlight as this case turns orange.

I don't quite understand how this can be connected to something, or my translator made strange connections, but these two logos (TDW and Raxxla) have just the colors yellow and green and saw when one was superimposed on the other. But I've never seen these 2 logos mixed to get the orange color.
