The Quest To Find Raxxla
Apologies if this has already been discussed, but I was just offered the following mission from Galcop Colonial Defense Mission on Dervish Platform in the Ogma system. http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z272/romilayu/IMG_4096cfaf-27bb-4ae2-9131-2d6f25912602_zpsu6tfyjt2.png...

I remembered AndyJ’s discussion on his FD questions, but I don’t think it actually resolves anything. If we knew WHY the missions had been deleted we might have a better understanding of the process we need to apply.

That last link doesn’t work for me, searched on the thread for “Dervish Platform” & “Ogma” & no results
