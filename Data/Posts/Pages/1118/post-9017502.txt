Whoever Raxla is, but I think you can only find her after certain conditions are met.

For example, I have a lot of things in the Codex in every region of the galaxy and almost all of them are unconfirmed.
I have to confirm it all and then I can find her.
Agreed with having certain conditions met. But I'm fairly certain Raxxla is or should be a place or destination, although it wouldn't surprise me if it was a 'who', unlockable like an engineer perhaps?
