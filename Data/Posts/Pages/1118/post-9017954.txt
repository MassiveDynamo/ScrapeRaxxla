I don't quite understand how this can be connected to something, or my translator made strange connections, but these two logos (TDW and Raxxla) have just the colors yellow and green and saw when one was superimposed on the other. But I've never seen these 2 logos mixed to get the orange color.
I was talking about two suns that throw orange light to planets, was just an idea that came up considering a lot of the game is after all orange, and it has been rumored that the clues are in front of our noses.

Is there anything that proves that there is only one star in the system ?
