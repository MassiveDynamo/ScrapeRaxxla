Whoever Raxla is, but I think you can only find her after certain conditions are met.

For example, I have a lot of things in the Codex in every region of the galaxy and almost all of them are unconfirmed.
I have to confirm it all and then I can find her.
So youâ€™re hypothesising that we have to get a load of entries in the Codex to find Raxxla? Probably via unlocking membership of the Real Dark Wheel? Makes sense with the current gameplay, perhaps this replaced the missing missions? nobody has mooted this hypothesis as far as I know.
