I find the garden design interesting. I do not advocate it’s the solution.

Much of my ramblings are actually after the fact, this design simply seems to slot in nicely.

I do find it improbable simply upon to reasoning its a garden. And garden architecture does not directly link to anything we know in game, it is absurd.

At most if true it might only help substantiate existing theories, it might not.

At most my Miltonian hypothesis was a projection of my own interest in GIS mapping and Milton, during a break from questing, it all just seems to correlate.

However I believe the core evidence lies within the codex - it is the key,

I do speculate however one interpretation is that it points to the Greek Underworld, and a zone below Achenar, I can entertain the other concept as I can compartmentalise my thinking, and discard it if necessary,

I find it interesting nothing more, it’s an afterthought, it might help with investigations in a certain location, but that is where I find it perplexing, because my interpretation of Codex identifies a discrepancy with the garden concept / Milton model, in that those advocate Eden is higher up; where as the Codex seems focused in the underworld…

So on its own I don’t believe the. Idea is telling us to visit the Empyrean, it’s telling us to visit the underworld, where it takes us from there is a total unknown.

But I’m open to all ideas right now. I’m currently tooling around Avalon getting allied with all the small factions, no real direction at present; except maybe a peculiar Eastern gate.
