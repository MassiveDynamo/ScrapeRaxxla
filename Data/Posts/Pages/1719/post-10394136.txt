I'm certain Paradise Lost was an inspiration for Brookes in creating the Raxxla mythology as it pertains to Elite Dangerous, I have detailed how in my own thread.

I have seen no evidence that there's anything more than a loose inspiration though (themes of temptation and ancient elder-beings warring beyond our reality), I think if this garden is relevant, it's probably just an homage reference the same as Blue Danube is the docking music.

There are other things you can put your brainpower towards that are definitely more relevant than the gardens If the garden is important, it'll still be there later and might make more sense (I've seen nothing that suggest this, but I can't rule it out).

The Raxxla Codex is "word of god", and therefore contains a lot of what we need to know. It is solvable, and it's pretty much the only thing in-game that contains direct clues in such a straightforward way.
