Whilst ive been knocking around in the Bubble doing Titan stuff i have also completely retraced everything on the old COR sheet and at Victoria's Song i realised that these survey vessels also have 'markings' in their gardens (the Grey pathways).
May be hard to see in this picture, im going to take a smaller ship back and see if i can get better shots.
