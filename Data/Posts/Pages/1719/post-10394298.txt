The landscape signal also contains mountains BTW.....
It's not impossible that the name of the Tau Ceti installation is a hint to look at the "Hidden Mountains" in the landscape signal.

The fact they resemble mountains can't have been overlooked by the person that highlighted those areas when creating the spectrogram.
