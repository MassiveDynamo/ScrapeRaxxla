I'm going to be moving into a new direction of Princess Astrophil and the Spiraling Stars. I will assume that and base on what I read about Penelope Devereux/Blount is that her life was complicated and bad. She was seen as an adutlerous and she admitted to this during her marriage with Rich, with a man name Charles Blount. Rich kicked her after her brother Essex was charged with treason based on rebellion by Queen Elizabeth I and was executed. So her connection with her brother has tainted her as well so people didn't want to associate with her

During divorce she wanted to remarry but that was ultimately refused by the courts so she couldn't officially marry Charles. So they privately married and again that caused a issue cause they broke the canon law. King James banished them.

So I am currently reading book called "Penelope Rich and her circle"
