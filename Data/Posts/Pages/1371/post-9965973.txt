I doubt there is ever an X amount Stars in one system lol If there is that would be a miracle.

Can someone Run me down on how the game address how stars and bodies are numbered? I bet it's super Rare to see X row of stars in one system.

The condition of the system name would have to be precise like EX: (PHEOA RAX) XL-A or (PHEOA RA) XX-L A-2 (what ever number)

If it's (PHEO AJB) RA-X then that is out of sight considering the chances of the system has to be very HUGE to complete the rest of the XLA figures
The few systems that actually has RAXXLA in the name, are on the format "XX-L A" in sectors that have a name that ends with "RA". There aren't a lot of systems. I did a search a few years ago: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-29#post-5868255

rOmiLaYu went and checked all these systems. They are all dull brown dwarf systems.

There might be a few more systems out there, but not many.
