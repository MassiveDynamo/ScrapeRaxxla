A VAGABOND HEART

THERE are vagabond lovers a-wander
Out there where the stars seem to ponder,
As they shine in the sky's curving dome ;
There are hearts that have strayed from their keepers,

There are watchers, and waiters, and weepers,
Who repeat in their ,"He will come!'
And there's joy,and lip-lifting,and gladness ---
O , there's ending of tearflow and sadness ---
When a Vagabond Heart cometh home !

When a heart cometh back from the far world
There's a flush and a gleam in the star world,
And the winds murmur soft in the gloam .
And the fern-fronds and trees grow them greener ---
0 , the creek babbles onward serener
When an old face returns from the foam !
There's a shining of eyes and a glisten ;
O , the flowers seem to sing if you listen
When a Vagabond Heart cometh home !
