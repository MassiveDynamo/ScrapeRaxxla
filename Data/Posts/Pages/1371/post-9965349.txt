I doubt there is ever an X amount Stars in one system lol If there is that would be a miracle.

Can someone Run me down on how the game address how stars and bodies are numbered? I bet it's super Rare to see X row of stars in one system.

The condition of the system name would have to be precise like EX: (PHEOA RAX) XL-A or (PHEOA RA) XX-L A-2 (what ever number)

If it's (PHEO AJB) RA-X then that is out of sight considering the chances of the system has to be very HUGE to complete the rest of the XLA figures
