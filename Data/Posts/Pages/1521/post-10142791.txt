System in question is "Apam Napat". Go try find a lagrange cloud around the moons... Spoiler: there's none anymore. Maybe, at the time the devs took the screenshot for the codex entry, there was in fact one. But seems to have been patched out ever since.
The pic is probably not a screenshot. Most these pics are Photoshop jobs.
The mass of a normal moon would make a lagrange cloud colapse.

Not sure what mass a ghost planet has though.
