Just some thoughts considering that plant was hopefully just a typo for planet. I do think we are looking for something at least kind of similar to how Soontill was described in the "And Here the Wheel". Also, the myth typically has the system being fairly old. This would indicate smaller main star and if Soontill was based on description of Raxxla M0V class would be a good starting point. Small M class stars can exist virtually forever. Though, I don't think with would be a standard small m-class and ice worlds. I would imagine the system forming from more than just ice and rock so there are gas giants and at least a brown dwarf, possibly similar to a system like KOI 100 being very likely. Insofar as the search, I would look for stars on lower end of asymptotic giant branch which is about 0.5 solar masses and likely a dim M-class. The asymptotic giant branch stars idea is based partly on which system types harbored Guardian and Thargoids but also where one can find life.
