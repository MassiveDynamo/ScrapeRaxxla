Would be nice with a planet in a cloud, like the codex exploration picture.

That would be cool! And finally explain that pic. IIRC in AHTW wasn't the planet (Soontill) and the awaiting CIEP fleet hidden from scanners by the cloud? If FD have the ability to make an in-game planet undetectable and hide that in a lagrange cloud then Id say that would be very cool.
