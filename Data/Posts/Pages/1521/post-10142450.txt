Mmm, not sure “constraints” is the right word there, I’d substitute “mythos”. It was a planet with an alien gateway, in ED we have Thargoid and Guardian aliens. We have some missing Guardian ark ships (according to Ram Tah’s decodes). Guardians left behind a comms network and AI, that is somewhere...Now Raxxla has been in-game since the beta/gamma, well before Horizons brought in surface landing. So I’m still speculating ED’s Raxxla is Guardian tech, hidden in orbit, and from the logo I suspect a hidden asteroid base/ship. It should have an alien news feed/logs to provide some startling new information...I’m hoping for the winning Euromillions numbers!

Where’s the best place to hide an “asteroid”? In amongst millions of others.
My epileptic copawlot has disturbed my sleep to the point where I havent played this week. Still intending to go back to Saturn and start searching the rings. Likely to be a frustratingly boring, long & lonely search.
