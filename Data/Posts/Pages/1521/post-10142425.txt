Another noteworthy development around the Horizons DLC drop was Delphi getting renamed. I don't remember if was announced in-game via comms or what. I think it was officially renamed from Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 to Delphi on December 11th, 3304.
Yes if I recall it wasn’t announced but I suspect just identified by players because that area was generally rather busy.

Question is however, was it an obvious clue to draw attention to Delphi; is it totally unrelated; or does it point elsewhere?

Accepting potential identifiers exist in the bubble (see my ramblings on an underworld / Yggdrasil) their existence naturally pre-dates the introduction of said codex…?

Chicken / egg

Assumption 1: Delphi is an obvious link to the codex via the Omphalos. Donars Oak has nothing to do with Yggdrasil, instead it’s all tied to Zeus (thunder gods). Tau Ceti etc is likewise unrelated.

Assumption 2: Delphi and Donars Oak were inserted by FD to draw our attention to the bubble.

Assumption 2 only works if we accept those systems in the bubble (Yggdrasil etc) have relevance, because they existed before FD inserted Delphi!

If they don’t have relevance it’s assumption 1 and everything revolves around Delphi.

Or Delphi is totally unrelated.
