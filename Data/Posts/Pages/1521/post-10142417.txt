Didnâ€™t these get inserted into game about the same time as the Codex
Another noteworthy development around the Horizons DLC drop was Delphi getting renamed. I don't remember if was announced in-game via comms or what. I think it was officially renamed from Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 to Delphi on December 11th, 3304.
