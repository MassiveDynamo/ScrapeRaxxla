Recently looked at the ED sound track and it mentions "thorne-zytkow objects" (giant stars with neutron stars inside.) . This seems similar to what is shown in the Raxxla symbol, ( at least the center dot and ring)

It also looks rather like one side of a coin found at Delphi...



Which I think is meant to represent the Omphalos of Delphi.

Could also be The Sun, of course... and Delphi was associated with Apollo, so that might be the correct interpretation. Who knows
