Ive been allied with them for a while and have continued to run rep missions for them for the last few weeks. I’m confident there’s no additional “hidden” level of alliance should you be wondering!
I’ve gotten only one Tip Off mission from them but it was of no real interest.

Regarding getting noticed by the Dark Wheel, while in the book Jason’s father was elite and believed to be a member, Alex was only just advanced to Deadly when Rafe suggests that he’d be welcome to the group (though we have no indication that Rafe has anything to do with them, clearly). So, I’m not convinced 3E is necessary, but I believe some specific activity may be. I’m 2E/deadly, king and admiral and allied with any faction that even sounds like it could have something to do with the Dark Wheel or Raxxla and am getting nowhere though, lol.
