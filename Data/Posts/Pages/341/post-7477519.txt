Recently looked at the ED sound track and it mentions "thorne-zytkow objects" (giant stars with neutron stars inside.) . This seems similar to what is shown in the Raxxla symbol, ( at least the center dot and ring).

It seems strange a reference to such an object that is as far as we know not yet in the game as part of the sound track. (It also might fit the definition of exotic star.)


You mean just like this one ?
