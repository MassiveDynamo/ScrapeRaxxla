Having seen a variety of hypotheses relating to The Dark Wheel and Raxxla, the ones that currently stand out to me are the similarities with the Greek Myths. For The Dark Wheel, this is the 'Hero(ine)'s Path' type of myth, with membership being granted to those who complete a set of tasks, whilst the search for Raxxla seems to me to be best matched to the Odyssey. That said, the Codex's description of The Dark Wheel makes it sound more like invitations are either given out by FDev or the result of rare procedural missions (by 'discreetly administered' I guess such missions are Tip-Offs or other mission types not given out on a mission board, such as the type you get from being in the same instance for 15 minutes or the Mission Signal Sources that have a ship asking for you to do/fetch something). I think what I have tried to do is more fun - it has not been a single rare mission (with little or no agency on the player's part) but I have had an adventure this last week, rather than just doing a mission to blow up X pirates or deliver X to Y. I am probably far too idealistic!
