We should remind us of what was written or said in:
The Children of Raxxla
by Alessia Verdi

Be aware that this fan fiction was written by Drew Wagar who doesn't know more than anybody else about TDW/Raxxla.
Now, the same text appears in Premonition , iirc, which can be considered as canon-ish...more or less.
