Well I don't know if this will help or not, but it can't hurt, right?

Definitely! I also got Allied with the Pilot's Federation, AEGIS research and got all the system permit factions to allied on the off chance that one of those might be important too.
Whenever I have a bunch of exploration data, I try to find some other faction that might have some lore or story effect and dump it on them.
I like the name of your ship too.

Lol, we should make a squadron. And create a minor faction called "The Real Dark Wheel".
