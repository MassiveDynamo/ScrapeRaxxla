All brown dwarfs. It's sort of given by the XX-L, that these are light stars.

Here is the original list I compiled: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=6758426&viewfull=1#post6758426

I think romi checked them all. There are probably a few more out there, but not many.

I didn't check I them all, but I did check the first four. All were brown dwarves with a differing number of icy bodies and nothing else.
