Re: Nysa
I managed to repeat some of the process:

In Nysa for some time - flying from C to A, found ship called "child", wing of 3 internal security "foil" & another normal npc sec. name

Followed from C-B-A-C before game announced 'mission objective found' - scan on FSS shows orange degraded emissions. Another 450,000ls hack

Uss shows black box , grain canister, water, polymers. Scoop all up. As BB scooped, new assaination mission appeared..

Went to system, found ship. Sorrensohn H. Sorrensohn in a DBX. Says ' I just want to do the right thing' & 'I'm not going to kill for them anymore' etc. He drops near a station so I follow his wake ( I have no interdictor) - appear in empty space - target hologram on console shows a Coriolis briefly before changing to a planet (odd but probably a glitch). Back to SC then find mission obj and gun him down.

Whilst on way to NYSA C again to cash in (2.5Bls so far on this !) get a further massacre mission - but need to stop playing- so that's where I'm at.

No 'Raxxla' yet, but it's odd game mechanics to me at least...

Yelboc.
