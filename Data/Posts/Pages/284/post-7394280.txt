Hm ok good to know. Could you provide any more infos about what you have done? What were youre ranks at the time? Could/did you make any connections with antimatter containment units who are also carried by the Military Courier Vessel? Also were you allied with the Dark Wheel in Shinrarta and/or Mother Gaia in Sol? Sorry for all the questions but i just want to have as precise results as possible.


The reason why im so curious about the sap 8 cores is they were part of some Dark Wheel missions back in 1.4 i think and its the only thing thats left from this time. The missions are no longer in game as far as i know. Also i havent seen them mentioned at all in the last 6 months. Do you have more infos about them by any chance?
I didnt travel to HIP 22460 or Polaris, i just tried to plote a route there so i cant help you with that sorry.

SAP 8s were in then they got removed, and then they got added back with the mil couriers. Still have not found a use for either the ACU or SAP 8s. Yes, allied with both TDW and most of the factions in sol including Mother Gaia. Ranks are Deadly, Elite, Elite. It was rumored that sap 8s were related to some sort of tech that let TDW jump huge distances. As far as the ACUs it is hinted at in Legacy
SPOILER
. They never come out and say antimatter is involved, but it is strongly hinted at. As far as a use for this stuff in game? I have yet to find one. Way back when there were missions like you mentioned for the sap 8s and trinkets of hidden fortune, but they are long gone. With MB and DW seemingly mostly out of the picture I fear that they are little more than window dressing now.
