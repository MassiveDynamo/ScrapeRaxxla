One question. Did anyone tried to look further at such thing as the strange square lights or windows on the stations? It look like the Braille code. Each "symbol" is the combination of max 4 square lights. All this lights looks like central part of Raxxla logo from the Codex.

Good spot. I did suggest the original symbology on the Guardian relics etc may be related to Braille; wouldnâ€™t surprise me if it crops up somewhere in ED.
