Any old FRifters remember hostile npcs at the abandoned bases? What faction? Where did they jump to? Was there a cause of their hostility?
The DW2 fleet is being attacked at Conflux Delta base & this rings a bell, but advanced age & memory is poor...and babysitting grandson so searching the FRift threads is not on at the moment.
When I passed by the Hawking's Gap Abandoned Settlements just over a year ago, I found a NPC Adder circling (18th Jan 3304). It was not hostile and completely ignored me. I would guess that similar behaviour might have been happening at Abandoned Settlements elsewhere. I last visited the Conflux Abandoned Settlements on 31st July 3304 and encountered a Cobra MkIV that also ignored me. I think any and all settlements and permanent POIs may be likely to generate NPCs?

A side note about Neumann Camp in Shinrarta Dezhra: there are two 'telescopes' there but, after taking screenshots roughly a day apart, enough for the background stars to have moved about six degrees (the moon has an orbital and rotational period of about 68.5 days) and thus still being recognisable in their arrangement without too much disappearing over the horizon, they do not seem to be tracking anything and were completely static. My current thinking is that getting the invite to visit The Dark Wheel station might depend upon a rare tip-off or follow-up mission (not sure if it would have to be taken from Neumann Camp or not). I'm kinda tired with mission-running after getting my final Fed promotion earlier this week and I've only ever had a couple of tip-offs, so perhaps someone who knows how to trigger them could have more luck.
