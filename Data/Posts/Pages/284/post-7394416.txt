NPC activity seems to happen at any POI these days, regardless of where they are. When I was hitting Dav's Hope a lot for mats, there was always some shady character circling around. I gather that some aspects of npc activity are now bugged, in that miners who have gone well outside the bubble for a spot of peaceful mining get harrassed by pirates wherever they are... :S

Incidentally, if anyone is following on the Demeter / Nysa track, and researching aspects of the myth online, then I would advise not searching for some of the alternative names of the goddess Persephone without a "safe search" filter in place, and certainly not from a workplace!
