One question. Did anyone tried to look further at such thing as the strange square lights or windows on the stations? It look like the Braille code. Each "symbol" is the combination of max 4 square lights. All this lights looks like central part of Raxxla logo from the Codex.

If we're talking about the similarities, it looks more like the guardian sites, similar design languages: https://i.imgur.com/EQEBfsF.jpg

But that could just be another lazy design from the FDev

This is the original Raxxla logo btw:
SPOILER

Edit: Also we need some grills on this investigation. Women are usually better at seeing the "big picture" and relations between the clues.
