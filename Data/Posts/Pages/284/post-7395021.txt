About being "summoned" by TDW (like The Witch was in past times, but for others reasons), just look at how many missions, explo, etc.. you have (had ?) to do to become Elite or King, Admiral, etc...
I myself, did dozens for TDW faction.
But I am quite sure not enough to get noticed and many less than I did to get full rep/ranked.
You want to be called up by TDW ? Work for TDW !

A star that... "sings"... a ALike the do.
Sound is (was ?) important and just great in ED.
Imho.
