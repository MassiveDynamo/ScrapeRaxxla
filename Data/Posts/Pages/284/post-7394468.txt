One question. Did anyone tried to look further at such thing as the strange square lights or windows on the stations? It look like the Braille code. Each "symbol" is the combination of max 4 square lights. All this lights looks like central part of Raxxla logo from the Codex.

Numbers take 5 pings in Morse, which would make station coding unlikely to give a location. if you want to decode it, though, or try, Wikipedia has a Morse translation sheet. It'd at least fit the "Every Commander has to..." tip

Alternatively if you message or reply to send me the pairings (as I cant load that image on my device) I'll (try to) translate and post to thread, use hyphens for short and underscore for long, using periods (to show "stops") to separate pairs. Sentence separation will likely be impossible pretranslated.

Example:

---- . -- .

This isn't what I thought I'd be using those history lessons for.
