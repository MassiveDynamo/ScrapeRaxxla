Any old FRifters remember hostile npcs at the abandoned bases? What faction? Where did they jump to? Was there a cause of their hostility?
The DW2 fleet is being attacked at Conflux Delta base & this rings a bell, but advanced age & memory is poor...and babysitting grandson so searching the FRift threads is not on at the moment.

NPC's at abandoned settlements is a relatively recent addition. I want to say it was 3.0? It feels...off....to have them circling places like the FRift. But they have never been hostile and to my knowledge they've never attacked anyone. I suspect some confusion is to blame. I'm with DW2 on two platforms and all modes and haven't witnessed any hostile NPC aggression at the site.
