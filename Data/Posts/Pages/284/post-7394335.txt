DW's hint about things related to TDW operating on multiple level, and MB tiny bit obvios hint has me thinking. What if one of the 21 stations/outposts with Holdstock in the name will harbour a clue or a starting place? Has anyone been to these stations / outposts recently? ( edsm seems to show 21 in total, mostly independent.)
