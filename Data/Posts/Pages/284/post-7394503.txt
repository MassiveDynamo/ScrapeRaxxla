About being "summoned" by TDW (like The Witch was in past times, but for others reasons), just look at how many missions, explo, etc.. you have (had ?) to do to become Elite or King, Admiral, etc...
I myself, did dozens for TDW faction.
But I am quite sure not enough to get noticed and many less than I did to get full rep/ranked.
You want to be called up by TDW ? Work for TDW !
Exclusively. Never for their "opponents".
Imho.

About the Raxxla logo. Look at it in a "perspective point of view". You are not entering a station, you are coming through The Portal and you can see a Sol-type (symbol) star in front of you, far away. G.
A star that... "sings"... a silent song. A whisper. Like the Sirens do.
Sound is (was ?) important and just great in ED.
Imho.
