Any old FRifters remember hostile npcs at the abandoned bases? What faction? Where did they jump to? Was there a cause of their hostility?
The DW2 fleet is being attacked at Conflux Delta base & this rings a bell, but advanced age & memory is poor...and babysitting grandson so searching the FRift threads is not on at the moment.

I don't remember hostile NPCs, but a year or so ago I followed a few non-hostile ones to neighbouring systems. They'd generally travel to some body or other and drop out into normal space. Once one led me to a secondary star, dropped out, then threatened to pirate me but he was all talk and no trousers.
