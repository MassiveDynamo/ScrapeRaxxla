If we're talking about the similarities, it looks more like the guardian sites, similar design languages: https://i.imgur.com/EQEBfsF.jpg

But that could just be another lazy design from the FDev

This is the original Raxxla logo btw:

Edit: Also we need some grills on this investigation. Women are usually better at seeing the "big picture" and relations between the clues.

Guardians probably found something. An old species that turned to religion when they were already very advanced, seem strange.

They spent plenty of resources on honouring their dead, so they probably had an idea of an afterlife.

Similar ideas may have been past on to ancient humans. Either from the same scource or from surviving Guardins posing as gods.

Octavia was planing to transfer her memories to her clone, Kahina.
Utopians are storing digital copies of them self.
Tech guardians merged with AI and lived partly in the network.
The instant escape pod for PF members, is also strange. Do they send our mind in an e-mail and put it in a clone?

The lines between life and death are blury, in ED. That gives plenty of room for myths.
