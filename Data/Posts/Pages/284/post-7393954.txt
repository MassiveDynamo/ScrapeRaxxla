I have already tried most of that since 3.3 with no luck (except going to triton) , but it is always good to double check. Did you happen to notice a quirk with the route plotter near HIP 22460 ? There are two systems about 21 ish LY apart on either side of hip 22460 (the course nearly intersects HIP 22460). I had the jump range to jump between them, but the route plotter insisted on two shorter jumps around HIP 22460. When I manually selected the other system I was able to make the jump.

Hm ok good to know. Could you provide any more infos about what you have done? What were youre ranks at the time? Could/did you make any connections with antimatter containment units who are also carried by the Military Courier Vessel? Also were you allied with the Dark Wheel in Shinrarta and/or Mother Gaia in Sol? Sorry for all the questions but i just want to have as precise results as possible.

The reason why im so curious about the sap 8 cores is they were part of some Dark Wheel missions back in 1.4 i think and its the only thing thats left from this time. The missions are no longer in game as far as i know. Also i havent seen them mentioned at all in the last 6 months. Do you have more infos about them by any chance?

I didnt travel to HIP 22460 or Polaris, i just tried to plote a route there so i cant help you with that sorry.
