. They never come out and say antimatter is involved, but it is strongly hinted at. As far as a use for this stuff in game? I have yet to find one. Way back when there were missions like you mentioned for the sap 8s and trinkets of hidden fortune, but they are long gone. With MB and DW seemingly mostly out of the picture I fear that they are little more than window dressing now.

The old military fuel was antimatter based. It was only produced by Sirius corporation.
Feds and Imps did not have any other source for it.

Turner/Argent from the Alliance managed to make a mining machine that could produce military fuel.
