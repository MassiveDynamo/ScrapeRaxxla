Mountains

As part of my Lost Realms mapping project a number of those systems contain references to mountains / hills.

Elysia - Kailas, the name of a Himalayan peak; the abode of Lord Shiva.
Ys - Chroin, Scottish for peak.
Avalon - Grach, Welsh for peak.

I don’t think that’s a coincidence. In Celtic / Saxxon / Norse traditions hills / mountains or burial mounds were thought of as passages to the ‘’.

This will help you. It discusses not just just the various trees - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_tree?

For the record, was shooting for making this idea intrinsically much stronger. It has really solid foundations. You need to account for Cronus/Kronos/Chronos/Saturn being a guardian with dominion over time. I provided some sources to help you build up this foundation. Delphi is hugely important.
