If we didn't have the Raxxla Codex then would Delphi being renamed be significant at all? (recall that many other systems wee renamed at the same time).
If Delphi hadn't been renamed then would there be any in-game connection with the word/idea of "Omphalos"?
I'll start by answering the questions. However, before we get into that you are at least subconsciously aware something is deeply amiss. You may not have found the core idea that I am alluding towards, yet. Suffice it say, the cognitive dissonance is actually a good sign.

Probably not as obviously but many a story arc have centered on events in the Pleiades Nebula and especially the system now known as Delphi. Though, I would argue The Oracle and Donar's Oak already made it important before the renaming.
See system Axis Mundi, and stations The Oracle and Donar's Oak. The Omphalos Stone is a religious artifact directly linked to the Temple of Delphi. It represents the "navel of the world". There are probably others I am forgetting. The Sentinel being in Delphi is also important. It represents the Guardian of the Gate. This Guardian of the Gate is Time or Cronus (occasionally spelled Kronos or Chronos). In various stories, he guarded the Omphalos Stone.
So, what are the entrance maxims to the Temple at Delphi and how are they important? Also, contrary to popular thinking, the parts of larger lore that don't make sense is going to be your savior.
