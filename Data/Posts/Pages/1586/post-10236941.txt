Possibly. Just a bit of personal opinion: the game is much better with the older lore. That said, the lore exclusively on Elite Dangerous is solidly dystopian. The old stuff makes the new lore even darker by several orders of magnitude. I need to do a dedicated thread on it on the forums. I am presuming people would appreciate lots of spoiler tagging. The crazy thing is there is a lot of lore just in Elite Dangerous. The old stuff is there if you look. The amount of lore you are dealing with factoring in the older stuff is just nuts.
