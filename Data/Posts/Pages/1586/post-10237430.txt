Today I visited Chroin in the Ys system and Grach in Avalon, which together with Kailas in Elysia make a fairly narrow triangle just off to one side and down from Achenar.
This is a heavily-populated region but there are some interesting locations within, from system names like Niflhel and Xibalba to systems with interesting planet names, including:
CD-65 76: Earth-like World (ELW) Jessica's Folly with a moon called Sheol.
Saffron: ELW Ectoplasm.
Agartha: ELW Franklin (the system description declares it is where 'Braben Woollens' are made!)
Epsilon Hydri: ELW Offield-Duan with moon Shan.
Aramzahd: ELW Guardinia with ELW moon Smade's Planet.
Meropis: ELW Anna Ceri and the next planet out is a large metal-rich world (landable but surface gravity 3.22g) called Chlos.

I think I'll stick around and look at the uninhabited, procedural systems here - there are not a huge number. A part of me feels that this region is so heavily populated that I would be surprised if Raxxla is here, yet it could be hidden in such a way that even looking for anything odd, I could easily miss it, so I'm still bumbling about in the dark, just in a smaller region... .
