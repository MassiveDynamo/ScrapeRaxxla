The primary purpose is to make you think on why the Oisir-Raxxlans were supposed to have built the pyramids downwards and not skywards.
I did think about this and as someone who has a fascination for the physics behind 'Time', an upside down pyramid is a Penrose diagram.
Many have proposed that the Penrose structure can incorporate Black Holes in order to travel to multi dimensions.
I have no idea how the physical 'upside down pyramid' would work as a dimensional gate but it was the similarity of the triangles forward projection and the way Time can be used via BH's for instant travel that got me thinking.
