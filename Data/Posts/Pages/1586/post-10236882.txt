The primary purpose is to make you think on why the Oisir-Raxxlans were supposed to have built the pyramids downwards and not skywards.

I would argue that for Holdstock his upsidedown pyramid - is a reference to Mount Meru. Which is often depicted as an upsidedown pyramid to accommodate the increasing sizes of worlds in the vedic/ hindu cosmology (there is also a possible relation to the blade that indra used to kill the snake vitra…related to the phurba and world axis… but i digress). Holdstock has has the intrepid explorer Saramandara finding the raxxlan homeworld. I think the name is possibly relating to Samsara and Mandara.. samsara which is itself the wheel of time and fate… the dark wheel… also meaning wandering… and Mandara the mountain which is used as pivot for the churning of milk creation myth… think SagA*. And of course the talmor lens being related to indras net as i mentioned earlier….

Regarding early greek thought - i would think they are using the tetracyts as the basis for their model for the cosmos and the harmony of the spheres. With everything emanating from the “one”. - the sun … it is a standard pyramid… however from the perspective of the individual achieving enlightenment - there might have been an inversion of the pyramid….

Looking forward to what people find with the landscape signal search.

Edit:
Holdstock was verymuch into the whole mythmeme idea with his mythagos and universal myths… the tree and the upsidednown pyramid are the same … when you include the underworld the pyramid turns into an hourglass much as the roots of a tree match the branches above … as in the image cmdr cormorningstarfelian linked…
