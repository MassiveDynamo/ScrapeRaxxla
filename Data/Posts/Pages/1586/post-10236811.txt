Mountains

As part of my Lost Realms mapping project a number of those systems contain references to mountains / hills.

Elysia - Kailas, the name of a Himalayan peak; the abode of Lord Shiva.
Ys - Chroin, Scottish for peak.

I don’t think that’s a coincidence. In Celtic / Saxon / Norse traditions hills / mountains or burial mounds were thought of as passages to the ‘otherworld’. Another thread which I feel substantiates my Lost Realms hypothesis. There’s more to this I’m sure…
