Both modern religions and vissions from Halsey and Romero may suggest that these creatures may have evolved beyond the need for a physical body. If Raxxla was used to house the gateway 'the goods' used to access monkey planet, it may simply have been rendered obsolete and left to drift in space.
You should go to Peregrina (independent permit system). Pretty sure that is where CMDRs developed the shapeshifting abilities through Holo-Me. Look up the mythology behind Undine and Eurynomus. The system also has Talos I and Talos II outposts. Talos was the giant robot from Greek mythology. I personally ascribe to the idea that the Mudlarks were possibly Guardian survivors. Also, Baltah'Sine appears to have a Guardian bio-weapon. Read Nemorensis. It is damn good.

While you are at it research the Mumu mythology. Connection here is Phekda and the Ancients of Mumu. Humans took some of gods with us to the stars. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummu

Who are you people, really?” Valkyrie demands.
I smirk, shrinking into my humanoid form. “Do you believe in gods?
