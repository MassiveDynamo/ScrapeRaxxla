Been thinking for some time - fernweh, could this relate to the longing to return to the Otherworld?

Holdstocks Lost Realms dwells on this concept, a return to the otherworld those ‘lost’ realms, and certainly many of the Irish / Celtic tales and Arthurian fiction extrapolated from these, is fixated upon this ‘desire’ to return to those lands, which generally we’re supposed to be beyond our sight snd difficult to get to.

I think the use of the term may actually be another hint to look at this concept of an Otherworld, and especially the work of Holdstock.
