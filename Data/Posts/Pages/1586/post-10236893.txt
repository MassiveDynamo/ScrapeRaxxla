I visited Kailas today and then wandered among some named systems with very low populations beneath the Lost Realms near to the Sol - Axis Mundi line (and a few a little off it) but I think I went too far down for a pendent world. No luck even on finding airless moons with large craters! (On a typical day of exploring, like out near Barnard's Loop last week, I would find dozens...).
When I am next on Chroin and Grach will be on my list to visit and maybe these three make an encircling range that I can use to narrow down my search. (Elysia is off to one side of the Lost Realms). If the region is large, as I suspect, I can try and break it up a bit. Uninhabited or very low population (low thousands) systems are my priority, as are named systems (as opposed to catalogue names or procedural names).
