As a retired scientist I’m concerned about approaches I’m seeing of late. Scientific method means you have to look at ALL of the evidence...so a theory must address the codex descriptions AND the toast AND the logo. Cherry picking evidence to support a theory is the path to delusion.
I agree. We are however quite far from anything that could be considered evidence at all.

We are more at the stage of the project where everyone writes what falls in to their head uncritically, on post-it notes.
