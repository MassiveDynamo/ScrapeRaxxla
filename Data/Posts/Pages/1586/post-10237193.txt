I did think about this and as someone who has a fascination for the physics behind 'Time', an upside down pyramid is a Penrose diagram.
Many have proposed that the Penrose structure can incorporate Black Holes in order to travel to multi dimensions.
I have no idea how the physical 'upside down pyramid' would work as a dimensional gate but it was the similarity of the triangles forward projection and the way Time can be used via BH's for instant travel that got me thinking.

You gotta remember to carry some meatballs and tomato sauce when entering the pyramid!
