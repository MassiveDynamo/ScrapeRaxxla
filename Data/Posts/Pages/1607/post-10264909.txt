Just breakfast coffee musings, but thinking again on the Omphalos being placed at the meeting point of two eagles sent by the god from the extremeties of the world to meet in the middle (i.e. the hub, the navel)... WHY pick the name "Omphalos"? That in itself seems like a clue...

Halfway between Earth and Jupiter would be 628,950,000 km, nothing around there from reality (Wikipedia solar system planetary distances). But from EDSM halfway between Persephone and Sol would be 242,177.5 ls, which puts it just inside the orbit of Sedna.

Somebody else can work out midway from Sag A* (centre of Milky Way) to the galactic extremity...
