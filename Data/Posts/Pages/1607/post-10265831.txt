On the question of the PF controlling independent pilots and their systems: the effect used when a thargoid shuts down your ship has always struck me as odd.

It's a cool effect, and I assumed artistic license. It really feels alien and makes you go "what!?". But it's not how an emp would affect a ship - it isn't systems shutting down - there are novel animations, sounds etc.

There's the point that if everything just cut off like electronics in real life would then the player would think something was wrong with their game - but I don't know that that would have felt worse - maybe better. Gives you a second of garden path thinking which is always satisfying to be shocked out of.

But ultimately it could just come down to a series of effects being iterated and ruled as looking the best. There are simulated sounds after all in space. Rule of cool for a video game.

But if it is meaningful - well it's guardian tech? Thargoid tech? Given the community I wouldn't be surprised if people have picked apart these animations. Do we think there could be clues between the frames?

Edit: Well I just picked through some videos frame by frame - nothing to see, though that would have been obvious.

So on Thargoids shutting down our ships, how do they do it? Are they able to do it because our systems are in fact partly based on Thargoid or Guardian tech? Maybe but then again maybe not...
