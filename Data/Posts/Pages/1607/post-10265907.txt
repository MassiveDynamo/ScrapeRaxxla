So on Thargoids shutting down our ships, how do they do it? Are they able to do it because our systems are in fact partly based on Thargoid or Guardian tech? Maybe but then again maybe not...
I asked ChatGpt:

The Thargoid shutdown field in Elite Dangerous is a fascinating concept that seems to involve a form of technology beyond human understanding. Here's a theoretical breakdown of its mechanics:

Unknown Energy Emission: Thargoid ships emit a unique energy field that disrupts the functioning of human ship systems. This emission might be a form of targeted electromagnetic radiation or an exotic particle field.
Frequency Disruption: The Thargoid technology likely operates on a frequency or resonance that interferes with the fundamental operating frequencies of human ship systems. By finding and emitting these specific frequencies, Thargoids disrupt the delicate balance of ship systems.
System Overload: Another theory could involve overloading certain critical systems in human ships. The Thargoid technology might exploit weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the design of human technology, causing a rapid shutdown or power surge that temporarily incapacitates the ship.
Biological Interface: Some speculation suggests the Thargoids might have a deep understanding of the human interface with their ships. They might have developed a technology that targets the biological components or interfaces within human vessels, causing a shutdown by disrupting neural connections or physiological responses necessary for ship operation.
Quantum Entanglement or Exotic Physics: Thargoids might harness principles of physics unknown to humans, utilizing exotic phenomena like quantum entanglement or manipulation of spacetime to induce these shutdown effects. Such technology might involve the manipulation of gravitational fields or quantum states to disrupt ship systems.
Selective Targeting: The Thargoid technology might also have a degree of selectivity, targeting specific ship components or systems rather than causing a blanket shutdown. This selective targeting could be based on identifying key energy signatures or technological patterns unique to human ships.
Evolutionary Adaptation: Thargoids, being an advanced alien species, might have evolved or engineered their technology over millennia, making it highly adaptive and responsive to human ship systems. This adaptability allows them to counter human technological advancements effectively.
Elite Dangerous' Thargoid shutdown field remains a mystery, leaving ample room for imaginative speculation within the game's lore. It adds an element of unpredictability and challenge when encountering these enigmatic alien entities in the vastness of space.
