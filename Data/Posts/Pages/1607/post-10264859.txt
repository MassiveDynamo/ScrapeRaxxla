Sadly, I still have no clue whatsoever what heck Raxxla is in end. It could be anything from how certain aliens arrived in our galaxy. It could be Frameshift/modern iteration of Faraway. Or it could be a gateway or series of gateways that connects distant parts of the galaxy or galaxies. Insofar, as what it is exactly - you got me and we're in the same confusing trip to determine that question's ultimate answer is at the end.
