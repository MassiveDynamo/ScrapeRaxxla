That then puts Jaques at 1,008 years old (very conservatively). He is probably a great deal older.

Further, this might just imply Peter Jameson is THE Construct given the whole faked death in Riedquat (Frontier and FFE manuals) but there is Peter's Wreck planet in Facece and the first Coriolis Peter's Base. Jaques is maybe Raxxla (or at the very least protects it)?

Perhaps this is why Peter Jameson has it in for the "Thargoids", because they are Guardians and he is the civilian AI trying to finish the job?

That would be one hell (ha!) of a way to bring the Jameson character back into the game
