OK, did some more googling:

Planet in witchspace (Video), the below image is the best screengrab I can make of it

Planet in witchspace report with images (no video)



The Lighting is weird in both, they definitely appear to be rocky bodies.

Comparison:
This is our original video (not the FC once since that's Odyssey and both of the above were reported 3 years ago). I tried to get a screenshot at a similar close distance to both the new examples above.


I mean...

Thoughts on this?

There's people in the comments discussing a repeatable bug, but I've jumped thousands of times from just outside mass-lock on a planet and not once seen a planet, so there must still be some set of conditions for the 'bug' to trigger.

If this is a bug, then we now have 1 confirmed case for 4 years ago, 1 confirmed case from 3 years ago + 1 Possible (pics can be faked too easily), and 1 case 6 months ago. All of them do show what seems to be a visually similar planet. We have unconfirmed reports of this happening since the start of the game too (sorry @Sunyavadin no offense meant, but without a pic or video we can't compare your planet experience )


Can anyone find more videos? The more the better! Maybe from non-english communities (I can't search for those since I'm stoopid and only speak one language)? What else might people post it as? etc. Still need an example of any other planet type or something visibly "definitely not the same planet".
