Yep, agree.

But I would think the following could help eliminate some issues.
See if we can deduct the places / locations / directions the jumps happened.
Repeat, many times.

Have Nvidia Shadowplay recoding or OBS running at any given time. And:
- Avoid Open, avoid Wings; it's may introduce extra network polling, friendlist / instancing network requests, which can cause issues on its own.

Brilliant, I like it when we have a plan.

CMDR Red Borg's FC: unknown location, jumping to Delkar (Anamundi).
Searching for Anamundi on Galmap takes you to Delkar, I assume this is a naming bug, but we should confirm that.
I don't know anything about carriers so can't tell what type etc.
Borg might be up for talking about it? we can at least get carrier model and maybe he remembers where he was jumping from? It was only 6 months ago, he might be active.

Hollow-xiii video: Burke Horizons, Arinack, Jumping to: Tascheter Sector FM-M a7-1
He's in a Fed corvette
100% hull 100% shield, pips to engines.
Crest on the front looks like he's at least Elite (can't quite tell).
Just launched from settlement and aimed directly at the target system, presumably jumps just after the mass lock.
