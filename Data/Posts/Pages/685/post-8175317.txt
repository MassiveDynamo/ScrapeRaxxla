I still want to do some more digging into the pieces that The Winking cat thief stole, as I agree there may be some clues there as well as the systems he stole them from. I am a little wary though. The winking cat thief has some striking similarities to the Cheshire cat from Alice and Wonderland, and I certainly wouldnâ€™t trust his directions.
If you're going off down that rabbit hole anyway it might be prudent to record the dates in case of a pattern.
