Im pretty sure they made a winking cat galnews report AFTER they said they were only going to post relevant news instead of galfluff. That might confirm it is relevant to something at least.

I was reading through old raxxla forum posts on reddit and steam and someone said something that i thought really meant something for the quest to find raxxla. He said, and im paraphrasing, 'im not worried about finding it first. Prove me right or prove me wrong, either way we've narrowed it down.'
