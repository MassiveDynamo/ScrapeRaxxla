This is a fine hypothesis. I think you can skip the Silver Comet. That one was a character in one of the pre release ED books. The article is almost certainly submitted by the author.
I agree that the Winking Cat has god hint potential.
Was that a typo? Simple test: Wait for the winking cat to show up again in Galnet, and attempt to catch it!
