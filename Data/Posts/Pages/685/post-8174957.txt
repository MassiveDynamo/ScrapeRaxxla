Reorte:
Populated by Black Fat Felines and "This planet is mildly fabled for its inhabitants' eccentric love for tourists but plagued by deadly earthquakes"

The Dark wheel says that the commodity "bladerlash" comes from Reorte ?

There was a few mentions in Lave Revolution...
"Reorte, corporate and competitive"
"Reorte is run by a collection of local corporations"
"Reorte to Riequat is another used trade lane..." (Formidine fun...)

There was also the now deleted Galnet post of 17APRIL3301 ... nevermind I have a short attention span....only mentions Riedquat and Quator

Thats all i got
