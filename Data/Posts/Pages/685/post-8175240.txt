This is a fine hypothesis. I think you can skip the Silver Comet. That one was a character in one of the pre release ED books. The article is almost certainly submitted by the author.
I agree that the Winking Cat has god hint potential.

The Silver Comet as an omen, not the character, is mentioned officially in Galnet so its canon. Not to be passed off easily.
