there was some kind of scripted riot in that instalation in the DW belt in LFT 926, but no one seamed to attack anyone, and you dont get the choice to decide wich to join. just a bunch of ships roaming around the instalation. it had a few things to scan, but i didnt try to hack the data points with a recon limpet. maybe that could give something more... heading there now to try.
