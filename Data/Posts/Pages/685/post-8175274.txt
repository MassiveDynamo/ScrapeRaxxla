Forgot to mention with regards to the Winking Cat. It could be a hint towards ED's own in-game winking cat, the Cat's Eye Nebula.

The Cat's Eye Nebula is an old favorite of Raxxla hunters. It sits to high above the galactic plane to reach. Almost directly above the Elephant's trunk nebula.
It's is also an excellent Omphalos point. It marks almost the exact position of earth's ecliptic (or orbital) north pole.
It sits nicely above the milky way band and Cat's Eye is even a type of jewel (Cat's-Eye Chrysoberyl).

In ED there does not seem to be a central star but there should be a WR star in there, according to RL data.
