it's quite difficult to hack anything around this instalation without getting blown up(or maybe im doing it wrong). if anyone tries to do this, good luck hacking all the hackables, there is so many security ships flying around. also bring hatch breakers, theres quite a few in there. this might aswell be the dark wheel's test of aptittude lol
