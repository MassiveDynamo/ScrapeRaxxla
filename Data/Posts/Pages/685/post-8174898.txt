it's quite difficult to hack anything around this instalation without getting blown up. if anyone tries to do this, good luck hacking all the hackables, there is so many security ships flying around. also bring hatch breakers, theres quite a few in there. this might aswell be the dark wheel's test of aptittude lol
Damn, at least you tried commander. They really donâ€™t want to give up that data easy do they?

If we want to take this further, there are three approaches I can think of;

1. A big ship, heavily engineered to take a huge amount of sustained damage long enough to hack the data points.

2. A concentrated attack by a skilled wing to take on the security services and get the data, guns blazing.

3. Stealth mission, silent running and heat sinks to possibly stay undetected long enough to get the data.

Thoughts?
