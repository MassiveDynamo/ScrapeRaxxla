The Silver Comet as an omen, not the character, is mentioned officially in Galnet so its canon. Not to be passed off easily.
It's very much canon. Shortly after release there were plenty of Galnet articles submitted from the various authors, with hint's to their books. Drew was by far the most active. All these stories are canon. I just don't think they are relevant, as non of the authors knew anything about Raxxla.
FD has not been eager to use external characters and narratives for their own stories. I guess there could be some issues if they use a figure created externally, without consulting the creator?
