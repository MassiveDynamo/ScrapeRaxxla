so after a few tries, i managed to hack and investigate most of the stuff in the instalation, but nothing interresting showed up. some normal goods came out from the cargo bays (water, liquor, etc) and that's it pretty much. i might have missed stuff though, this is the first time that i have ever done any hacking activity. hoping that other fellow commanders give it a try and see what they get.

the reason why i found that specific cluster to be interresting when i first found it is because, in every other system that i jump, the belt clusters are all owned by the controlling faction, exept in LFT 926. the system has 6 clusters. 5 of them are controlled by "green party of LFT 926", and the sixth one is controlled by the dark wheel. that's what lead me to investigate it in the first place, but that might not be such a big deal after all, if this pattern happens elsewhere too. because we know TDW minor faction has expanded to LFT from shinrarta, so they just happen to control that 1 belt cluster... because the BGS gods said so... or maybe it goes deeper than that?
No way bro, this is a big find even if its nothing more than what you've already experienced there. I worked for tdw in lft 926 for almost a year(6 mos hardcore, 6 mos part time) and i never even glanced at the asteroid belts. Didnt even cross my mind, and im the one who started saying we should look in asteroid belts. Im super geeked for you for this find. It should get a codex entry for hidden stations or something.
