What's the name of the installation? Also what's its function? Pictures? Pretty dang intriguing.
The name is, and no kidding; The Dark Wheel. There are pictures around but I donâ€™t have the link just now. I think someone mentioned it in the other thread where they are trying to find the location of the Dark Wheel station as shown in the codex.

It was also brought up in this thread we are in now, but no one has fully investigated it yet as far as I know. There is a scripted battle event, turrets, data points, and cargo hatches.
