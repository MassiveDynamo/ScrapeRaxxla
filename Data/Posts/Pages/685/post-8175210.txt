No way bro, this is a big find even if its nothing more than what you've already experienced there. I worked for tdw in lft 926 for almost a year(6 mos hardcore, 6 mos part time) and i never even glanced at the asteroid belts. Didnt even cross my mind, and im the one who started saying we should look in asteroid belts. Im super geeked for you by for this find. It should get a codex entry for hidden stations or something.
