going to bed, I was visited by a brilliant and at the same time stupid thought, recently there was a mention that we should scan it and perhaps it will open to us, sounded something like this. if this is taken as a basis, then it turns out we need a celestial body or a body in the orbit of the planet. and then I thought a battle cruiser was hanging in the Earth's orbit. Maybe he should be waiting for us to take us to the raxxla? xDDDD
