a) Not going to give Frontier another red cent.
b) Never did Engineers, hate grinding for stuff like that. Hate grinding and how it is at the center of all game play in ED.
c) Thanks for reminding me why I don't want to start it up again though, off to watch The Expanse instead. Cheers.

Mmm, you sound grumpy... seasonal Bah Humbug overload?

But yes I agree. FD seem to have a corporate misapprehension that grind in ED equates to good entertaining gameplay; I wonder if they actually play the game? Do the devs enjoy grind? Or do they have a different style of entertaining gameplay to everyone else which they have quietly kept to themselves? Iâ€™m currently testing another Raxxla hypothesis which is also total grind.
