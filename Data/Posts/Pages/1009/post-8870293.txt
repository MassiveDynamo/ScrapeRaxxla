Why not get yourself a new commander instead of killing off the old one? That way you can have two games underway at the same time, in 2 different areas-faster testing of hypotheses. Only cost you £20! It could be your very own Xmas present to yourself! Think of all the effort you invested into your current pilot’s development, all that engineering grind...you know it makes sense!

P.S. FD-am I still on for 50% introduction fee?

a) Not going to give Frontier another red cent.
b) Never did Engineers, hate grinding for stuff like that. Hate grinding and how it is at the center of all game play in ED.
c) Thanks for reminding me why I don't want to start it up again though, off to watch The Expanse instead. Cheers.
