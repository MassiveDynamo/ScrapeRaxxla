<tinfoil> There is nothing significant about the background video here, it's just something to watch whilst I narrate. </tinfoil>

Now then Mr W.

I have just got my gaming rig up and running again and I am taking my first opportunity to comment on your re-appearance, in this particular thread, after being very quiet on the old R mystery for some time.

We are expecting a major update ED: O, the Goids have been stretching their petals, and then you pop up in this particular thread, hmmmmm.

Call me a cynic but, BUT, have you been tasked by a certain developer to start up the narrative again? Perhaps to start dropping some tidbits in the not too distant future?
