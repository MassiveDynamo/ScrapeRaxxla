Just tooling around, looking for any associated links to the Raxxla codex logo, found this...

The hexagon of Saturn, was first recorded by Voyager 1981, later the data was identified by Nasa in 1988 and then Cassini-Huygens in 2006.

Dont believe its in game.

But has anyone tried listing to Saturn? The following looked somewhat familiar.

'John Stuart Reid's hypothesis explains the giant hexagonal cloud formation on Saturn as cymatic geometry created by an Extremely Low Frequency sonic source.'
