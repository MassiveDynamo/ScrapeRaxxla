you could hide so much in asteroid clusters (belts) in systems and nobody would ever find them because they're utterly useless for any practical purpose in the game.

i even dropped down to some metallic clusters i found (since finding metallic rings around planets is harder than finding a community goal in Open without anyone interdicting players). Total waste of time - and it's a significant waste of time. So I wouldn't invest in time to visit a roid cluster unless I knew for sure there was something there worth the time (so basically never again)

I'd imagine one way fdev could implement raxxla without being on the hook for insane content is to make an entire roid belt be the remnants of raxxla. It having been destroyed by the ancestors of the club at some point in the distant past (but after the mars artifact).
