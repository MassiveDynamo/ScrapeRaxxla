Probably change the background white as well if that is possible, it should help with making the dots more visible.
Yeah in a perfect set up, unfortunately that’s not possible given the simplicity of the app used. It’s a compromise, can’t invest the time in doing it justice, not without buying a dedicated app - so that app used is a free compromise, hence it has limitations. Pending finding a better (free app) that allows the same level of direct X, Y, Z interaction and ease of use (acknowledge its maybe time I look for another app).

Predominately I’m now console based, since my rig went into prolonged dry-dock since Odyssey. So anything like this I’ve been reliant on hand held devices and the PS game ( how ironic if Raxxla was only accessible via EDO / 4.0). Bitter sweet as I have all the relevant tech on my works PC, but they track every key-stroke (like all companies do ) so I’m a hair’s breadth away from a professional product, not going to buy a stand alone license, nor a new rig, not for a hypothetical tin-foil treasure map!
