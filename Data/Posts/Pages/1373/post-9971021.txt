I am of the mind these days that the Raxxla … path… is going to be played out in the storyline (atleast in part). The name Iraxon Lane is another recent narrative bit that seems to me to be indicating this. Not really sure how Or if anything fits … but i think there was probably an outline of a narrative arc drawn up (which included raxxla) early in the game ( and from the sound of it changed over time) It has always felt to me that some of the early galnet tidbits were intended to be prophetic later in the game… Still wrestling with how they are making princess astrophel fit in though …
As much as I dislike the idea, I think it is possible. Particularly if Raxxla is actually somewhere in the permit locked systems around Barnard's Loop. I only bring those up because they weren't actually permit locked when the game launched. I've been through some of Col 70 myself while I was visiting various stars in Orion. I can't remember when exactly that permit lock was added to that region, but it was early in the Horizons season.
