No real criticism, Rochester, but as a colourblind folk I personally find the .jpegs hard to process. What are you using to render them? If it's a web service do they have a permalink to the specific render? I don't want to ask you to redo colours because everyone will perceive things differently!
So sorry; your absolutely correct, it’s a very basic IPhone Mod App, no permalink option, the images are standard screen-grabs.

The choice of image creation app is simply 100% selfish. Ironically I am trained in mapping and have access to mapping tech, so I’m well aware this is a very basic design, but the app was used solely because I have very limited time outside of RL work, so this is a fast, sloppy fix that allows me to punch in X; Y; Z points, rotate and get a screen grab.

I’d love to have the time to build this correctly but alas I can’t afford the time, nor can I utilise work tech due to security issues; these sadly are only rough drafts.

*edited - images brightened, gamma shifted, hope they’re more agreeable.
