Sadly if true then this could be a herald of a Raxxla centric narrative, that’s truly saddening because that would mean that the codex is part narrative foreshadowing.

Personally I’m not so sure, it makes no real sense for FD to publish a text years in advance of a narrative subjects insertion, as it leaves it open to discovery and restricts your narrative movement. It’s also very un-imaginative.

If taken literally this means FD changed something or at most it’s not ‘currently’ accessible, but again I find that unlikely as it’s outlandish.

If we accept it’s currently ‘accessible’ that alternatively could identify that FD simply has been re-purposing historical narrative influences. This might make sense if they made some historical narrative diversion…

I am of the mind these days that the Raxxla … path… is going to be played out in the storyline (atleast in part). The name Iraxon Lane is another recent narrative bit that seems to me to be indicating this. Not really sure how Or if anything fits … but i think there was probably an outline of a narrative arc drawn up (which included raxxla) early in the game ( and from the sound of it changed over time) It has always felt to me that some of the early galnet tidbits were intended to be prophetic later in the game… Still wrestling with how they are making princess astrophel fit in though …
