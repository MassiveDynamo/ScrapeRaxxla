So do we start looking for info in game then looking for it outside?
To my mind, that's like asking 'Do I use Lord of The Rings to navigate up Scafell Pike' which would clearly end up with bruises. What's in game is real in that universe. Out of game references are only of use if they are indicated by in-game references. There is also the official lore, but this is like history books. The Bayeux tapestry doesn't help with how to wage war in the 21st c. - the lore books are historical accounts, useful for background.

Ofc it gets more grey when there are vague hints in game that look like references to out of game texts, which is why we have 1373 pages of speculation.

The final issue is that the game is riddled with human error, so some in-game data is incorrect, out of date, self contradictory, etc.

As Rochester alludes to, we are in the uncomfortable situation of solving a problem without a problem statement and with no guidance. Add that to a near infinite search space..
