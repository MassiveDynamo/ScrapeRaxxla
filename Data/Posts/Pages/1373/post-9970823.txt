Seo Jin-ae (Project Seraphs D-2).

Sep Jin-ae is a good fit. The name is of Korean origin, meaning truth, treasure and love. A Seraph is an angelic being.

Thargoids, have been described as female, potentially like bees so very likely there then ought to be a Queen, and it’s suspected they have a hive mind.

If Sep Jin-ae can control Thargoids then technically she can be called a Princess, and those goid stars, well they are spirals.
Sadly if true then this could be a herald of a Raxxla centric narrative, that’s truly saddening because that would mean that the codex is part narrative foreshadowing.

Personally I’m not so sure, it makes no real sense for FD to publish a text years in advance of a narrative subjects insertion, as it leaves it open to discovery and restricts your narrative movement. It’s also very un-imaginative.

If taken literally this means FD changed something or at most it’s not ‘currently’ accessible, but again I find that unlikely as it’s outlandish.

If we accept it’s currently ‘accessible’ that alternatively could identify that FD simply has been re-purposing historical narrative influences. This might make sense if they made some historical narrative diversion…
