It's really not a problem you need to stress over, but thanks.

On a different note, I was looking over my bookmarks for systems and found one out in the black with a note that it had a really long jump animation going into it. I've had this happen here and there with no apparent pattern but it should be something to pay attention to, right? As it indicates assets, potentially new ones, loading in.
