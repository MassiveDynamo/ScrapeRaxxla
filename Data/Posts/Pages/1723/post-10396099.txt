Mmm, started out saying trinkets (not capitalised, so generic trinkets) then spoke of them as relics...

Might be a clue, might not.
Isinor has one of shielded surface ports - Charmas Terminal. Perhaps that may be relevant?

Trinkets of Hidden Fortune

This container appears to hold an assorted collection of low-value trinkets, knick-knacks and statuettes. Such trinkets are generally used by superstitious pilots to try and win favour with Lady Fortuna. However, these particular knick-knacks have a much more valuable prize hidden within.
