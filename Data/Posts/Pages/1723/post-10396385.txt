Found a reddit post addressed to you;

Ref trinket and pirate scan.

Ah, many thanks for that. I wasn't aware FilthyMick had been banned, but I was just reading a couple of his old posts during this past week & thinking I hadn't seen him on the forum for a while.

Please give him my regards...for some reason I can't access that Reddit thread, I can briefly read it before a banner pops up and obscures the text and then whichever option I take seems to close it. Bah, Technology! Things were better when I were a lad and all we had was our fingers and toes to do our sums on! (Said in a Jorkshire accent, of course, as per Monty Python's paper bag sketch!).

Can you also tell him that is common behaviour. Many pirates will recognise that you have yourself pirated a cargo of Trinkets of Hidden Fortune and give up the intercept with that message, however others are incentivised to attack...there seems no rhyme or reason behind the difference. Also, that mission objective message popping up seems to occur if you're in a system for any length of time and I don't think it's meaningful, it might HOWEVER be a means of locating Raxxla given the context and is worth checking out though I suspect it's just normal random gameplay. IIRC mission objectives show as blue (maybe orange?) in the Full Spectrum Scanner.

Perhaps someone else has a comment to make on the "mission objective" message popping up?

Unless we can figure out a means of getting a better location within the planetary belt for Raxxla I suspect we're doomed to a dismal search (we're doomed Cmdr Mainwearing! Doomed! )
