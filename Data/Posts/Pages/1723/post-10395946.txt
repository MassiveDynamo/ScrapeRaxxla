I agree, I've not seen this tested on the forum thread(s) yet strangely, but the youtube vid I watched where someone talked about this said that they believe the sound is instanced for the individual "client side" (4:20 in the linked vid), but they were not specific about any other details and didn't sound like they'd tested it.

I've seen no actual tests for this yet.

He also says the signal doesn't appear in all stations, actually none he checked in the Empire "at all", and some elsewhere. He's not specific about how many he checked.
The client-side aspect may be a result of the game relying on Peer to Peer synchronisation. It may also indicate that it is based on your pilot status - thus, lore-related.
The video comment raises a good point:
What might be a reason that Imperial stations don't send to YOU in particular?
What's your standing with the Imperials...or their enemies?
It's a shame the creator didn't respond with his Fed and Empire ranks because it would have clarified that pretty quickly.
Regardless it would be fairly straightforward to test:
Does the signal appear in Empire stations with low rank? Does it appear with high Empire rank? Same deal for Fed stations.
Similarly for the local faction reputation. For example, one station controlled by Faction A with ally status could have the signal, but Faction B with enemy status within the same system doesn't.
