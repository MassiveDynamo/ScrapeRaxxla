Didn't realise hotspots, RES etc had been "reset" at all- do you mean they've actually moved location?
That's really hard to tell. They've certainly changed types, which would make "ah, in Paradise Lost Satan goes between a Low RES and a High RES" a bit less reliable, but I don't know if they've changed location. Possibly not (and it wouldn't be a dealbreaker if they had so long as your target's location was derived from theirs rather than the other way round)
