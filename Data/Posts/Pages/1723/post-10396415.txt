That's really hard to tell. They've certainly changed types, which would make "ah, in Paradise Lost Satan goes between a Low RES and a High RES" a bit less reliable, but I don't know if they've changed location. Possibly not (and it wouldn't be a dealbreaker if they had so long as your target's location was derived from theirs rather than the other way round)
The trouble is...we seem to have absolutely no information on the target location
Unless the logo/right hand garden panel are telling us something I don't have eyes to see nor ears to hear!!
