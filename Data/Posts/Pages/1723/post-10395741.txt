I'm doing some investigations with several aspects.

Here are the truths.

Raxxla Codex
Tourism Gardens (Milton)
Numbers stations (gathering data, need more data)
Brooks tour - "And fast by, hanging in a golden chain,
This pendant world, in bigness as a star
Of smallest magnitude, close by the moon."

I've included the raxxla icon for ease of comparison with the rear of the coriolis, the fact that the image 'fits' at about the distance you need to be to hear (see) the numbers is coincedental at this point. The design, I am waiting to see if there is a difference in tourism station 'rears', so far after 3 checks they are similar.

I do think it would be faster and more useful to check other stations for the signal first. It doesn't seem to be universal, and there's @Ian Doncaster 's point about the synchronising between players, which seems to me to be a quick and easy test and would go a long way to show whether Fdev considered the signal important enough to sync.

Then there's also the same question I ask a lot these days: Why?! Why is this a clue to Raxxla in the lore? It's a potential mystery, sure, but that doesn't mean it's anything to do with Raxxla.

What lore would need to exist to mean that signals broadcast from some station interior antenna at extremely close range contains impossible-to-break cyphers of (potentially) infinite non-repeating patterns of shapes that some people consider resembles scrawled letters and number? Would we assume that someone did this in order to... what? Leave clues to Raxxla? Why? How does any of this fit with the lore?

Genuinely interested in how this develops, but for me personally I need that lore connection to get invested.
