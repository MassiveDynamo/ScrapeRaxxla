I can save you some time there:
Jorki is triple elite, and unlocked all the engineers, bubble+Colonia+Witchhead
Been allied with TDW in SD for ages, git allied with the PF faction that gives credits for killing goids. Visited most of the known beacons in the bubble, been to Beagle Point, joined the 64,000 ly Club. Visited Sag A* & Goliaths Rest

Young clone Tyko has been to Sag A* & Goliaths Rest and sold the exploration data the other day (100+ MCr) to TDW at Neuman Camp.

Both still waiting to hear from TDW!!!

I suspect Han_Zen may be right. We may either have to find the stealthy station by eyeball, or find another station where TDW recruiters hang out. I’m now wondering if need to get allied with the factions that show the triangle motif on their flag/drapes- it’s clearly beloved of Guardians and Pilot’s Fed/Universal Cartographic. Clearly FD when designing the game expected pilots to move around the bubble through running missions....

There’s also the “Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth” mission (that may or may not have been deleted). Those elite ShinDez missions have always seemed to me to be the start of a storyline. Perhaps we need to find a “XXXX Gateway” station...

I've a sneaky feeling that to get the invitation you have to 100% everything possible in game. Like achieve top ranks for PP, grade 5 with all engineers, read all tourist beacons, triple elite etc. etc. to become truly Elite in game, a little like a hidden completion trophy.
I think that the invation to get into Shin Dez/Founders World is just a small variation of the bigger one.
