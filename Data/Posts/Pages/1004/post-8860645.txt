Ah, that would be depressing since I have no interest in PP. I only dipped my toes in briefly to get Aisling’s shields, but then never really used them! But run it past the Occam’s Razor of when things were introduced into the game. DB talked about membership of a secret society October 2014 (DB video “ED has a story that "embraces all the players"); dont think PP was in-game then. Triple elite was, engineers weren’t, some tourist beacons were (not sure about all of them, but someone on thus thread claimed recently to have visited them all), factions clearly were, UC & PF (& TDW in SD, I think) were. I dont think FD would have changed the fundamental recruitment mechanism, so I think we’re missing something. We know they assumed much more travel & trading around the bubble so...?
If you, I or anyone else was to follow this Elite recruitment idea then this would narrow it down abit (or quite a lot?). A good place to start would be to look at what was achievable at launch and take it from there.

Mmmmmmm
I never thought of this before until today. Might just have a look into this myself.
