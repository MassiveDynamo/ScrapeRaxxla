Truth Control? Nice.
One thing I have learned over the years is that humans can't handle truth very well. They are very emotionally attached to their thought-patterns and constructions of concepts, words, that are hopelessly stuck in a net of secondary meanings. They go around overlaying things with these emotions to feel some comfort in front of the horror of bare true existence.

It's very easy to test actually, just take any complex social issue and discuss it in a clarifying, emphatetic way, and you can see the inner pain arise.
