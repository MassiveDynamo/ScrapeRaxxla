I noticed you said a list of solid references and chasing dubious rumours. Yet you turn straight around and start mentioning rogue planets which no one has seen, catalogued or even gotten a quote saying they are in the current version or future game. So really none of my points are more wasteful than any ideas put before and all are possible in current known mechanics of the game. We know there are belts in the game, check. We know there are automated defences on bases known as flyers, check. And we know there are high g planets that are relatively small in the terms of planet sizes, check. Even if you call the high g asteroids a push which reading alot of the floated ideas it isn't it could be a asteroid belt encompassing a high g planet with all the mimes and auto defences i mentioned in the belt. All mechanics known to be in the game without screwing with stellar forge to map how rogues travel between systems or triggering misjumps in the current version of the game. I think by shoving someone's ideas down you could miss something that does pan out even in the slightest. Honestly very poor form from you considering all the other ideas put forward in the thousands of posts before me.
Rogue planets are in game. Try the search function at the top of this page to get the relevant info.
