So im going to through my tin foil hat out they and take some pot luck guess. Its been said that someone has been there and honked the system but left. My guesses from that is it might have been before the new dss kicked in so may not have had a scanner that could reach the item of interest. Its been said we will know it when we find it. From that, and this is wild shots it will have to stand out if your even remotely looking properly. So how to do that, could be that rather than sitting at the signals end of the dss it might be right right at the top where no one really looks. Maybe the signal might only be found after scanning an asteroid belt and I mean a decent one. The reason I say decent one is where the tin foil really earns its dollars. Its said everyone must take the journey for themselves. Being dead in the centre of a massive asteroid cluster would force players to fly normal pace to the signal. Throw in a few land mines, fatigue from flying for a long period avoiding objects, few auto defences, few natural hazards maybe extreme gravity asteroids which drag you to them and that makes for a journey everyone must take for themselves. And most likely easiest in a small ship say a cobra 3. Ideas?
