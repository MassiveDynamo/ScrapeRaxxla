Truth Control? Nice.
One thing I have learned over the years is that humans can't handle truth very well. They are very emotionally attached to their thought-patterns and constructions of concepts, words, that are hopelessly stuck in a net of secondary meanings. They go around overlaying things with these emotions to feel some comfort in front of the horror of bare true existence.

It's very easy to test actually, just take any complex social issue and discuss it in a clarifying, emphatetic way, and you can see the inner pain arise.

I used to call it “hypothesis mode locking”. We all construct mental models of how the universe works and then our thinking and behaviour is defined against those models & by how “true” those models are. Then reality breaks in, negates the model and causes a hugely painful disruption. Some people have mental breakdowns, some refuse to accept reality & continue to believe their clearly incorrect mental model because it’s less painful.... I know someone (who I would say is intelligent) who believes Covid is a huge con trick and that the vaccine contains microchips to control the recipient
