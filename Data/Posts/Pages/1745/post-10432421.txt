Part of me has a small hope that DB stepping away from the CEO role since 2022 would allow him time to reinvigorate the older mysteries still lurking in the galaxy. Especially now that devoting resources to console is no longer a major hurdle that might have made it harder to prioritise these 'dormant' secrets of the game.
Well going off topic but… who knows. wouldn’t presume to know their motives, but intuition might advocate they’re not the protagonist in this conundrum.

The Brookes Tours I believe spell out who probably is. So I hope FD leave Raxxla and the DW well alone. The worst thing they could do is mess with it, because then it becomes a narrative arc, which will mean it becomes a gated culdesac.

Through its presence, the Codex is advocating a positive affirmation, its a location already in game. Therefore not something underdevelopment, at least maybe something esoteric, but not something narrative, at least I hope not.
