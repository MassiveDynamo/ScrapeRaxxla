It could involve precise timing with the high-wake loading bar, like boosting just before or turning the ship power off...
It sounds silly, but worth trying (what isn't worth trying anyway, eh?).
Maybe the ships have hidden features.
Or... "Observers speculated that Thargoid Sensor interference could be to blame for the mis-jump." [Jacques Station]
Should we carry one ??
Thargoid Sensors? Trinkets? lots of options. I was coming out from Colonia at the time and didn't think to collect any of those first.

Is there a line from STUEMEAE GG-Y C4801 to somewhere else that takes you through the signal source?
Not of the ones I tried.

Here's the pairs I found where the midpoint of the line was a valid coordinate within 6/32 LY in each direction of the estimate, which is a fair bit larger than the zone defined. None of those jumps in either direction did anything but obviously I have no way to tell whether that's because this fundamentally doesn't work or if I wasn't triggering the misjump correctly.
SPOILER














If it just has to be on the line and not necessarily at the midpoint then that certainly provides more options even limiting to a 40 LY range, but I'd got to the "if it hasn't worked with any of these then it probably won't work with the others either" stage.
