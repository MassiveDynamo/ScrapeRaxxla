I suppose I should have put more emphasis on the part where it has to work from anywhere in the galaxy, and also on the finisher, that even if this was originally a quick-and-dirty implementation, if Frontier wanted the sound to come from one system, they had many years to correct that. But they didn't, so they likely don't.
To be clear, I certainly believe that whatever the sound is, it is coming from where Frontier intend the sound to be coming from, and if it's not coming from a (visible) system, that's because it's not supposed to.

It's the theory "it's supposed to be the sound of a particular system, but for technical reasons it comes from somewhere else entirely" I don't find plausible.

IF (big if) my theory is correct, the Galactic cords for the Landscape signal should be (25.217,âˆ’20.9077,25895)
That's quite some distance from where the sound is currently coming from - about 10 LY in X and about 5 LY in Y, going by the work done to narrow down its position so far.

Do you mean "should be" in the sense of "the sound should be coming from there but isn't"?
