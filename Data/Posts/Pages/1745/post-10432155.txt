Thanks for this, over the past few months ive gone completely back to the beginning and started again using only information that as a new player with no experience of the ED universe before can obtain.
What i noticed was that in game there is no way of telling that a faction/minor faction is Player driven or Native...
The only way in game to tell is that player factions will have a description or flavor text viewable in the galaxy map when you select their home system. This was added to the home system when the faction was placed in the game.
