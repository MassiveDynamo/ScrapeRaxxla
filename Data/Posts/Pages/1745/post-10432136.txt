Just as an afterthought (had to reply to my previous post as thread wouldn't allow me to enter text into a non-reply...weird thread behaviour since recent update!)...
If the Landscape (or any other audible) signal were to be a clue to the location of Raxxla/the Omphalos Rift gateway to it, then I'd expect it to be located (& locatable) within a system, and I'd expect that system to bear a strong resemblance to the garden design of Li Qing Jao station....
Just a thought!
IMO, if it was IN a system it would draw attention to the system not the signal itself.

The fact you cant means the signal is the important bit.
