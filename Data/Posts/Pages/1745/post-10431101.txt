It does fit in well with the lore of Mis-jumps.

Is there a line from STUEMEAE GG-Y C4801 to somewhere else that takes you through the signal source?

STUEMEAE GG-Y C4801 has a black hole, and could "in theory" create conditions that cause a mis-jump?
This has already been tried by quite a lot of people at length. There are many, many, many jump lines that cross the LS source (thousands actually). So far this hasn't proven to be the solution. There is no way to misjump in the game, categorically impossible, that possibility wasn't ever included though it was considered very early on as part of the plan (since it was in previous games). The closest you can get is a Thargoid Hyperdiction, but that's not really a misjump since you don't actually leave the system you jumped from at all.

People have also tried most of the items, like trinkets and Thargy stuff and Guardian stuff, etc. Myself included. There's no interactions that anyone has talked about.

I really, really don't think the intention (at this time) is to reach the LS source. I think it's been deliberately placed outside of any system so we can't reach it, and therefore focus entirely on the actual signal (which contains a lot of stuff people are just ignoring).
