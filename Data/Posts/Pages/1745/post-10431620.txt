Honestly, it's pretty incredible no one has found & posted about "it" yet. Except when you consider the whole community-has-only-uncovered like 1% or 2% of entire EliteD universe. -- Still though, one has to wonder: How much longer will this game last? And therefore, does the 'FDev' who designed RAXXLA want it to be discovered before this game ends in favor of another more modern/future version?

Well… it’s this type of assumption, that ‘Raxxla’ is some end-game objective, which I suspect has only been inflated through the audience, over time, and which only adds to the obfuscation.

Now FD via Arthur did confirm ‘it’s been out there a long time, and the payoff ought to huge’ but that might only prescribe some narrative culmination, but I don’t believe it’s actually of any direct importance to them.

Personally, I’m of the persuasion that Raxxla was originally not part of the main narrative, but originally was maybe nothing more than a well crafted Easter egg homage to Robert Holdstock! Maybe a narrative sub-story, along the way. But it got axed. There’s no real evidence for that, it’s just gut intuition.

I suspect that changed, and especially now it has grown into something FD has come to embrace, but it’s not something that’s keeps them up at night. I suspect if they switched the game off tomorrow they might not even give it a moments consideration.

My intuition is that it was only the personal project of MB. (RIP).

Regards why it hasn’t been found yet. Well that’s a subject of perspective.

There is the speculation around the Miltonian model and the Garden design. If that’s an example of an intended game element, it had been sat under our noses since 2017… so Raxxla equally could be so innocuous and ordinary our behaviour influences our ignorance.
