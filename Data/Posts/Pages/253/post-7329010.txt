We are all waiting for TRealDW invitation... I bet.

Anyone tried hunting "FakeDW", in an attempt to get rid of them?
Like, what if those really are an imposter faction and you need to help real DW to get rid of them to really get that invite?
Of course they can do it themself, but helping them do it might just be the way.
To become a part of DarkWheel you need to act like you are a part of DarkWheel?

For me "whisper in witchspace" and "siren of the deepest void" is just a poetic way to describe the urge to travel in a world where traveling means doing jumps through something called witchspace. And the whole toast is just a toast, not some encoded guide. At least that's my opinion.

There's also that part of the CODEX article:

That part about "Fernweh" is exactly the feeling that you are talking about.
