2). When mentioning Raxxla possibly being close to the bubble, there seem to be something that gets continually forgotten: THE QUIRIUM DRIVES EXISTED!
Had to laugh at this. I've talked about the previous drive tech so many times I've got tired of mentioning it.

these drive were said, once engineered, "to jump across the galaxy or even to other galaxies"!
That's not exactly canon. It's from Drew's old lore page, not an official source. The Galnet article makes no mention of it, and I'm pretty sure there's no other in-game references. Also, when things 'were said' you have to factor in a huge amount of consideration that lots of things that 'were said' are actually not in any way true, or are huge distortions of what actually happened. (Which doesn't rule out the possibility that there is some truth in there of course! )

Yes i'm aware that the official first mentioning of Raxxla was in 2296, and that its implied that the legend was already in circulation before. BUT! To believe that it is close to the bubble one has to assume that A.) Raxxla is stationary and not mobile. And B.) Nothing from Raxxla made travel to and from it possible BEFORE faster hyperspace travel was even available to the rest of the galaxy.
In fairness, there's a difference between believing it is close to the bubble, and believing that the only possibility is that is close to the bubble. Not everyone saying the former is also saying the latter.

The Quirium Drive fuel secret HAD to come from somewhere as well!
It doesn't really though. It could have just been discovered/invented. Everything has to be discovered or invented first by someone/something. No reason that couldn't have been done by a human / humans.
