In Drew Wagarâ€™s Oolite series of fan fiction (not canon for E D!) Raxxla was a moon of Lave 2 that had the ability to disappear into hyperspace. It disappeared! Also in E D there was a bug that prevented you from landing at one of the moons (or was it an asteroid?).

I think the codex puts Raxxla way earlier than Lave or any of the original Elite or The Dark Wheel(the book) events.
