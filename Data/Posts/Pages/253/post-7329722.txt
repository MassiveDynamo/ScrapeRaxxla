Bookmarked that one, gonna check it too after coming back from Formidine rift and Zurara.

One point, that doesn't fit into your theory from that DW toast:
Where's "Whisperer in witchspace"?

Yea, the hypothesis doesn't really cover every line of the toast. I was really just looking for something obvious, something a noob would be able to figure out. After watching videos of all the hoops the community had to jump though to figure out past mysteries, the comment about it being obvious really stood out. Like"we're not going to make you digitize audio and look for a picture pointing you in a direction this time" lol. And, those names and stories are for the most part general knowledge you learn growing up. You don't have to know any ED lore, you dont have to read the books, just read the lines and look at your map. Then it was crazy something happened to actually be there in a part of the galaxy thats pretty empty.
