Anyone tried hunting "FakeDW", in an attempt to get rid of them?
Like, what if those really are an imposter faction and you need to help real DW to get rid of them to really get that invite?
Of course they can do it themself, but helping them do it might just be the way.
To become a part of DarkWheel you need to act like you are a part of DarkWheel?

LoL, our posts with the same idea criss-crossed !
Keeps the thread alive, anyway.
Good!

So, from now on, I propose:

DW= Drew Wagar
TDW= The Dark Wheel , by R. Holdstock.
TRDW= The Real Dark Wheel organisation.
TFDW= The Fake Dark Wheel, Shirarta faction.

What a t-d-w mess ! [haha]
