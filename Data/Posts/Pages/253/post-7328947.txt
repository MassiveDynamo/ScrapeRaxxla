I think the toast contains hints to what The Dark Wheel knows. They obviously don't know everything, as they haven't found Raxxla them self.
Interpreting the toast could help us part of the way, but not all the way.

I also think the whisper in witchspace and the siren of the deepest void is the same thing. It's the hyperspace sound we hear in every jump. The Raxxla portal probably makes the same sound. We might be able to hear it, farther away than we can see it?

Personally i think it's not the hints to what DW knows about Raxxla, but hints to how find/join DW in their hunt for Raxxla.

As for the Siren part, there might be a message, coded inside that sound.
Had no luck finding it using spectrum analisys in audacity, but someone might come up with a better idea.
Or simply that message might be played on some special occasion, like, jump in a special region, or from/to special system.
That's why i'm heading to formidine rift, Zurara and probably further into the void, those formidine rift sites do indeed mention strange sounds during witchspace jumps.

Sorry, bad joke...
Seriously, everything known for sure (?) is on the thread first page, reference [8] and the Codex. [yesnod]
Any other theory is as valid as any other until proven wrong.
Since the E/F missions disappeared, this thread is more en exercice de style than anything else ...
Have fun !

Nah, that joke is great!
The only reason to play ED is having fun, so why not toss out some moe tinfoily ideas.
I'm just waiting for someone to get any positive confirmation that any of the theories being tossed out is right
