LoL, our posts with the same idea criss-crossed !
Keeps the thread alive, anyway.
Good!

So, from now on, I propose:

DW= Drew Wagar
TDW= The Dark Wheel , by R. Holdstock.
TRDW= The Real Dark Wheel organisation.
TFDW= The Fake Dark Wheel, Shirarta faction.

What a t-d-w mess ! [haha]

Funy how ideas are the same.
It's either directly attacking, or trying to get rid of them through BGS, but for the latter we would need a rather big player group, and joining DW should be a personal quest, so must be the foremost - just directly fighting with them and making them your personal enemy.
Another thing to do after getting back to the bubble it seems.
