Yeah, i know, right?
So how de we find it/him/her?
Is is the same as Siren of the Deepest void, or is it something else?

Is that toast at all a path, or just a toast that means nothing?


It's just that if we try to fir something into some theory - we can't just ignore things that don't fit.
It should have a reson why it should be avoided.

I think the toast contains hints to what The Dark Wheel knows. They obviously don't know everything, as they haven't found Raxxla them self.
Interpreting the toast could help us part of the way, but not all the way.

I also think the whisper in witchspace and the siren of the deepest void is the same thing. It's the hyperspace sound we hear in every jump. The Raxxla portal probably makes the same sound. We might be able to hear it, farther away than we can see it?
