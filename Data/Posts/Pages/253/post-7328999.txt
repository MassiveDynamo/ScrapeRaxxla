I'm just waiting for someone to get any positive confirmation that any of the theories being tossed out is right

We are all waiting for TRealDW invitation... I bet.
Which reminds me someone has stated to get hostile with SD TDW faction.
If they are charlatans , fighting them could attract TRDW's attention. Up to a point. Maybe. Who knows ? Would be a fine FDevs trick, anyway !

Btw, Chupacabras is a SD faction iirc, and also a mexican Chimera... mmmhh...
