Is the minor faction TDW confirmed fake? If not, why do we assume so?
Why would TRDW care about the fake one? It's doing great job distracting people from themselves and the fake one is pretty weak so it's not a threat. TRDW is not trying to be on the spotlight.

Oh, was just a matter of speaking and thinking to new possibilities. I for myself have done hundreds of each type of mission for SD TDW, got allied with every single faction involved with TDW in the E/F missions from Ticushpakhi to Varati, and (almost) never experimented anything special or uncommon.
Just thought I could do the opposite as a mean to come back to this game as soon as I get bored of... "the others space games".
Now, if FDevs have changed their mind and are starting to provide clues about Raxxla... Then fine, be it.
And there is no "we" here. This is not a PG thread. Just independant Chimerae Hunters throwing in their own experiences and tinfoiling.
That personal journey thing...
We are totally disorganized ! We are not CoR, despite the thread being riddled with CoR moles!
