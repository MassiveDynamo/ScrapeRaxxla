I did wonder if the whole point of the Salom√© storyline was to expose the Club (which was a DB invention). FD wanted it to be exposed to point out to the population (us) that we are being misled and manipulated. It is then up to us to choose what we support in-game.
Which would make it plausible that the entire Raxxla Codex is fake, planted by the club to throw us of the sent - especially if they are the tyrants who are already there. It would also probably make TDW codex entirely true, because I'm sure the club wou5love to flush them out an eliminate the threat?
