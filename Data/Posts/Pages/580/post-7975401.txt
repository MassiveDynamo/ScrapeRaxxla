Further than I got with this so nice one I did wonder the same, I'm British and have never heard of the John fella so was wondering if that was a clue, the other 2 are very well known as are others that could be used instead but then I read too much into anything sometimes...3 systems by definition would form a triangle with a mid-point (or maybe 4 if you read above, its over my head)

Well Iâ€™m British and read the book at school (but that was a long time ago!)
Wikipedia: Prester John is a 1910 adventure novel by the Scottish author John Buchan. It tells the story of a young Scotsman named David Crawfurd and his adventures in South Africa, where a Zulu uprising is tied to the medieval legend of Prester John.
