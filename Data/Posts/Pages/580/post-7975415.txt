One thing about all of this is simply it could be in the bubble BUT like Voyager could be really far out in a system where honking won't show it. We will have to FSS every system and map everything and then some to make sure.

Does Voyager show on the FSS? If not everyone is searching for a needle in a galaxy wide haystack.

Yes, the Voyagers (and the other probe, New Horizons?) show up on the FSS if you scan in Sol. I did it and visited them.

BUT they weren’t shielded for stealth. We don’t know the characteristics of the DW station. The codex entry on this is not clear. It may be detectable by FSS on system entry (I suspect unlikely), or perhaps only at close range, or perhaps it has to be eyeballed
