Which would make it plausible that the entire Raxxla Codex is fake, planted by the club to throw us of the sent - especially if they are the tyrants who are already there. It would also probably make TDW codex entirely true, because I'm sure the club wou5love to flush them out an eliminate the threat?

It was only in Holdstock’s TDW novella where Raxxla is already inhabited by corrupt twisted men. It’s possible that is carried through, but I suspect more likely that was also retconned with the rest of the book.
Has anyone got a list of lore & links to the source FD statements about what was retconned?
