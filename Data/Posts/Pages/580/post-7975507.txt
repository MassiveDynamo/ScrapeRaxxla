One thing about all of this is simply it could be in the bubble BUT like Voyager could be really far out in a system where honking won't show it. We will have to FSS every system and map everything and then some to make sure.

Does Voyager show on the FSS? If not everyone is searching for a needle in a galaxy wide haystack.

Yes FSS can find the voyager probes - it can detect a tin can 2.3M ls away...
