It was only in Holdstock’s TDW novella where Raxxla is already inhabited by corrupt twisted men. It’s possible that is carried through, but I suspect more likely that was also retconned with the rest of the book.
Has anyone got a list of lore & links to the source FD statements about what was retconned?
Jorki...This is ED! Do you really think we will find Raxxla and not have to fight off 200 Elite ranked ships? lol. If Raxxla is in the game, I feel sure that people are already there, personally, I kind of hope its The Club (Or Sirius?)
It also mentions that people may already be there in the Codex (a tyrant or sinister cabal) so I suspect its not retconned
