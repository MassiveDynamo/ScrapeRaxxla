Possibly we need rescan all & count carefully.
For example this: https://canonn.science/codex/gregorys-rest/
FSS shows 4 human signals, on map u can see 1 port and 1 installation on orbit. So if you pay attention u see 2 missing.
Close full scan reveals +1 settlement. And when u land close enough appears 4th - ship.
So we could pass station everyday and just don't notice it as it is paired with some other orbital working.
