Just tested FSS sensevity on https://canonn.science/codex/34-virginis-abandoned-srv/
Well, it detects "1 human signal" from huge dist. Planet scan gives targetable visually point but NOT in left list until you get close to it (appears during glide started).
So what do you think....this SRV does more emitions then whole DW station? >:
