I thought the 2nd II’s story was good.

To explain why, a basic principle first - the II isn’t telling a story. We’re not outside of things seeing/being told what’s happening, we’re inside.

So what the 2nd II has had has been:

- a major galactic power starting to act outside of their remit

- short term commercial pressures becoming their major driver instead of good long term strategy

- propaganda and the misleading of the public

- people generally following the propaganda without question

- personal commercial gain trumping considerations of consequences of actions

- player lead opposition to AEGIS in an attempt to manipulate the markets

- player lead attempts to highlight the real nature of what’s going on

- a power misleading people with a fake reward/outcome

- an unpredicted event of real consequence for players (if only temporary)

- some interesting behaviour from the Thargoids

- lots of action

- extension of activities into the interior of a permit locked region and an increase of the human presence therein

Plus consequences which will only emerge over time. (The new Thargoid ship which has just been discovered operating in the vicinity of Palin’s base is the start. Other things will come with time.)

The story will continue as consequences emerge, but the connection is swept under the carpet by the powers that be, and they instead become used as part of the propaganda machine.

Plus ongoing through all of that will be a party the nature of which is completely alien and which will be read into in human ways, with things boxed into human concepts which don’t necessarily apply, with all the misunderstanding, confusion and further consequences that will entail.

Yeah, it’s been good IMHO. I think what I’d re-emphasise is not just to look at it in terms of what happened within the official duration of the II, but what it it all means and will mean in the future.


Just on the pacifist faction thing - I know where you’re coming from and had thought about it way back at the start of the II. The issues with it is:

- it would massively (and artificially) diminish how much power the powers that be actually have

- it would remove the need for people to look at the situation for themselves and prevent any player lead opposition

In other words it’s a can’t have the cake and eat it situation. If we want things to be player influenced in terms of players actually leading and driving (in terms of opposition to the powers that be), then that means not having that lead and driven by FD (by them setting up their own official opposition). Personally I’d rather we have the opportunity to actually be that oppositon, rather than it just being a choice of which FD created party we choose to throw our support behind.

Arguably there’s not much in the way of mechanisms to actually create that opposition in game, but equally that’s arguably just actually an accurate reflection of the nature of the game universe.

Well, maybe I'm doing it a disservice, but I honestly feel it was a lot more 1 dimensional than that. I suspect player opposition was a surprise, but even if it was considered, then as you rightly say, there was no way to express that opposition in game, meaning that the outcome was still deterministic, and I simply dont see how we could have ever influenced the galaxy/game. Influencing meta, to me, is an entirely different thing, which does not fall under the remit of influencing the game/galaxy.

Of course giving us an opposition option would have been artificial, but it is a game, and how could FD code the ability for us to influence the galaxy, without giving us options? Without options, it is a traditional, linear narrative, even if it is a lot more protracted than most games.

To be fair, I did enjoy being given the ammunition to rant on the forums, in a pseudo role playing capacity about the evil of Aegis, but did that really have any impact on anybody/anything? I dont think so.

As @Jorki Rasalas pointed out before me, this story will inevitably lead to the bugs going home to get reinforcements and launching a full scale attack on humanity. It hasn't happened in the time frame I originally expected, but that's probably because they are building up hostilities slowly, ready for the 2020 FPS release. Again, the anticipation of that release, to me, means that the story is pre-determined and we cannot influence it.

So another take on your point about cake vs eating cake would be.....I personally feel that either a) players should be genuinely able to influence the narrative or b) the narrative is linear, in which case it should be stronger than what we saw with Enclave. Just my honest opinion.

Having said this, I have been pleasantly surprised that Galnet fluff going away has already lead to slightly more in game narrative/interaction in the form of a return to weekly community goals, in addition to the IIs. This gives me some hope for the "major upcoming narrative " that we were promised. I guess I just hope that this major narrative is not JUST pew pew and has some intrigue/mystery included.
