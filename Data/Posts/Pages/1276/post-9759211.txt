I'm volunteer to try this

2 questions :
Where can you find trinkets of hidden fortune?
Is there a way to increase your rank in combat quickly?

oh, be careful with the old MB videos: the conditions for discovering Raxxla may have changed over time, especially since the appearance of Raxxla in the Codex. Deleting videos can mean that they either give too much of a clue, or they have become outdated.

If you like to travel, there is a good spawn rate at 2 nav beacons (nebulas but asteroid base stations there):
Seagull Sector DL-Y d3
Thor's Helmet Sector FB-X c1-5

Yesterday i found a T7 with 59 trinkets!
I also found a strange thing there "Spartan-Chefs"
