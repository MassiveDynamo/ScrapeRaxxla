Jumpin' in to the quest.

I was very politely asked by a CMDR if he/she could join the quest. This is what I wrote:

Hi CMDR, from the first post:
"This ship log will be used to document the assumptions, facts, theories and efforts surrounding Raxxla, with the ultimate goal of locating Raxxla. All commanders willing to join are most welcome"

As said, you are most welcome, and you are free to help in any way, shape or form
