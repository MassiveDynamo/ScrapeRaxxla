@Koben , I hope that doesn’t sound like I’m saying you didn’t experience what you say you experienced. It’s just a very unique thing which is different to what was reported generally.

...
Please, allow me to further detail what I experienced...
1. I have done this Ram Tah missions at least 5 times. I had to pay very much attention and use the Canonn website because I've have never received any confirmation scan but after completeing the whole 100 of them I'd get the final message and Frontier had already fixed it;
2. Having said that, about 8 months ago I decided to visit Colonia and Sargitarius A and a week after that I went to the guardian sites again to do the Ram Tah mission again with a friend because he didn't have done it yet;
3. So, in this instance, I did received the scanned confirmation message;
4. Then I decided to do the Ram Tah mission with my 2nd account and received no message confirming the scans... did all of them and got the final message ti return to Ram Tah. I'm planning to go to Colonia with this 2nd account to make sure whats the trigger for it.

If you have a 2nd account, please, try it for yourself... for cience!
