Hi there, my fellow Raxxla nerds. I’ve been reading your new posts compulsively for a day or so, and I feel compelled to join the quest.

In that vein, I would state that I am in agreement with others that state the Dark Wheel is pivotal to finding Raxxla, and I do believe that Shinrarta Dezhra is potentially the most important single system in connection with this: and there is most likely some hidden clue there.
Welcome to the madness quest for Raxxla!
An essential requirement is a degree of scepticism! We have had lots of hypotheses over quite a few years, all have proven fruitless. We have had lots of trolls and nay-sayers; some of those have inundated us with long tracts of prose and many detailed pictures of meaningless things. So if you haven’t got one now you’ll quickly develop a strong sense of scepticism!

I would advise don’t believe everything you see or read, even in the Codex. I think a lot of the in-game Codex is obfuscation, rumour, misdirection...whether it is intentional (e.g. by The Dark Wheel or some other faction) we do not know.

Cmdr Rochester has asked some pointed questions of FD Customer Support over the last few months (search for his posts in this thread), and amongst the FD responses it seems that TDW hidden station is not actually in-game at that time. So more misdirection perhaps? If so what could it suggest-that some other object of interest is hidden in a similar manner? Not saying it’s Raxxla, but I think it’s Raxxla!!
