Anyone used/using Elite Observatory (https://edcodex.info/?m=tools&entry=483) to assist comet hunting?

Or is it possible to use EDDiscovery for the same purpose?
Not something I have ever utilised, as I have always endeavoured to play ED as intended and not become too reliant upon 3rd party tools and spreadsheets.

However as I have now hit a major burnout phase with ED (hardly in game except that is only to test out Raxxla theories and this forum) tools such as this now seem a lot more attractive, and possibly fill that gap FD failed to capitalise upon, which is to make exploration a little more interesting.

I can imagine this might breathe a little more life into things, certainly peak interest, as it can get stale jumping into what may seem a relatively dull system after dull system, tools like this may just point out certain eccentricities which normally are never noticed.
