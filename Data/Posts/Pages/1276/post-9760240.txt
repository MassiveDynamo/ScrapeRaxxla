Welcome to the madness quest for Raxxla!
An essential requirement is a degree of scepticism! We have had lots of hypotheses over quite a few years, all have proven fruitless. We have had lots of trolls and nay-sayers; some of those have inundated us with long tracts of prose and many detailed pictures of meaningless things. So if you haven’t got one now you’ll quickly develop a strong sense of scepticism!

I would advise don’t believe everything you see or read, even in the Codex. I think a lot of the in-game Codex is obfuscation, rumour, misdirection...whether it is intentional (e.g. by The Dark Wheel or some other faction) we do not know.

Cmdr Rochester has asked some pointed questions of FD Customer Support over the last few months (search for his posts in this thread), and amongst the FD responses it seems that TDW hidden station is not actually in-game. So more misdirection perhaps? If so what could it suggest-that some other object of interest is hidden in a similar manner? Not saying it’s Raxxla, but I think it’s Raxxla!!

Thank you for the warm welcome and the advice.

I won’t deny that the possibility of Shinrarta Dezhra being the home of Raxxla is rather attractive to me, but it just seems too easy, you know? Regardless, though, whether Raxxla is there or not, I think we can agree that the system has something hidden in it that we can find if we look hard enough and in the right places.
