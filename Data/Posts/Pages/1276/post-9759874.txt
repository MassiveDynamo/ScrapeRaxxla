Not something I have ever utilised, as I have always endeavoured to play ED as intended and not become too reliant upon 3rd party tools and spreadsheets.

However as I have now hit a major burnout phase with ED (hardly in game except that is only to test out Raxxla theories and this forum) tools such as this now seem a lot more attractive, and possibly fill that gap FD failed to capitalise upon, which is to make exploration a little more interesting.

I can imagine this might breathe a little more life into things, certainly peak interest, as it can get stale jumping into what may seem a relatively dull system after dull system, tools like this may just point out certain eccentricities which normally are never noticed.
I was a little uneasy about examining the logfiles to determine whether or no the system contained comets and possibly other things of potential interest, but am near the end of my questing tether...have had to resort to SC for a while; it is SO buggy! Not tried fps yet to compare with EDO...
But EDDiscovery is really useful, although I only use it (currently) to show my travel history and hold my exploration notes, and very occasionally the map, oh and converting my screenshots to jpegs and labelling them with the system & nearest body name. But I think itâ€™s much more powerful....
