Hi there, my fellow Raxxla nerds. Iâ€™ve been reading your new posts compulsively for a day or so, and I feel compelled to join the quest.

In that vein, I would state that I am in agreement with others that state the Dark Wheel is pivotal to finding Raxxla, and I do believe that Shinrarta Dezhra is potentially the most important single system in connection with this: and there is most likely some hidden clue there.
