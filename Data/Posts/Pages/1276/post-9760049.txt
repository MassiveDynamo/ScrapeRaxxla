Okay... all I did was put it under negative one time. Is that not the Omphalous rift on her chest?
No, it is not. It's more a "Important religious figure-head looking at you from a burned sandwich" kind of picture series. It's kind of a religion instead of science.

Please don't repeat the posting the previous person did, as all it did was spamming large pictures in each and all post. Quite disturbing actually.
Make a own thread if you need, then you can organize your thoughts there.

If you wish to explain what you are seeing, you need to point out relevances. The connection.
What does Omphalos look like? Art, culture pictures?
Why is Omphalos important in the first place? It's in the Codex, that doesn't mean it has significance, it can be a red herring.
How does this lead to Raxxla? (which leads to "Where is Raxxla? What is Raxxla?").
Perhaps it's connected to something else?
What is it connected to. How?

And these are the kind of questions you need to answer to win over critics.
But no more large image-spam without spoilers or explanations please.
