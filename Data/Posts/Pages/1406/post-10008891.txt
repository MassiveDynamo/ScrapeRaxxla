Quick question - touching base, been out in the void too long. It may just be my graphics card, can the hyperspace animation be affected by a starâ€™s colour?
Yes! I think also the magnitude or maybe type of star has a different overall effect on the strength of the colours. Strangely I only noticed this recently too!

Also the star in the centre of the tunnel actually gets closer, pics below are the start and end of a 130ly jump:


It's barely noticeable at normal jump ranges but on those long neutron jumps you can really see it grow from a little point!

So very cool! I really think most people underappreciate the witchspace tunnel. I did, I basically ignored it for years because I believed the common myth that it's "just" the loading graphic. I've only started really looking properly at it over the last month and it's actually really cool!
