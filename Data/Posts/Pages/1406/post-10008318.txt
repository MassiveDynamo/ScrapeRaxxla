Totally in agreement there!

Can I help? What are you looking for? How will you know when you've found it? etc.

Agreed. I think is high time we start making colective effort to test theories on identified anomalies.
Narrow our efforts to premisses we can try to narrow down the theories instead of increasing speculations.

There are those who are good with lore, others with external sources, an those with creative ideas.
But all of us have ships and the will look for Raxxla. It's time to organize the effort.
