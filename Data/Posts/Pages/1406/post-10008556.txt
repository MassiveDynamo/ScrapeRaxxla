So my thoughts are turning back to HIP 68385 and that rather strange "comms installtion" Josie Rosa for a disguised Omphalos Rift...

I posted last week in my gravitational wave hypothesis that my highest candidate for that is the Josie Rosa installation in HIP 68385. That is a very strange looking installation, and why would a comms installation be needed in an unpopulated system? Seems extremely fishy and IMHO is the best candidate for the Omphalos Rift near to Sol.
Edit: I have just noticed that the two above you say HIP 68385, and the older one below you say HIP 63835... I seriously just travelled 2500ly for a typo...

Now, if only someone young with hands that aren’t plagued by arthritic thumbs & tendonitis would attempt some combat for/against that strange “comms” installation ...or investigate a tourist mission to HIP 63835 to visit the “triple black hole” tourist beacon there...we have recently heard that a tourist mission might have a passenger with a hint to finding Raxxla.

I'm here in HD 122027 (HIP 68385) and there's literally nothing here but a single star.



The above are the stargoids, just to show that they're the only thing on FSS.
