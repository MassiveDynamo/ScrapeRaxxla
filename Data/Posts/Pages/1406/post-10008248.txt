Totally in agreement there!

Can I help? What are you looking for? How will you know when you've found it? etc.
Still working on that but there may be additional details from First Encounters. I suspect the seals that kept atmosphere in the station were destroyed in a case of Mycoid getting into plastic of a ship that docked there. Whether that was intentional or not remains to be seen. Mycoid has played a lot bigger role than many understand and it predates the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm. Also, working on a revised interpretation of the INRA sites as there is a specific order of events that can be derived from the logs.
