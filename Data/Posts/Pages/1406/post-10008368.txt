Quick question - touching base, been out in the void too long. It may just be my graphics card, can the hyperspace animation be affected by a star’s colour?

Eg a large bright white class star; but the warp tunnel into its sector, was the most radiant royal blue, and not the central focus point, but the whole tunnel - I put it down to a bug, internet drop or just poor PS4 graphics, but it was a lovely, yet slightly ominous moment… likely projection.

This game is still wonderfully beautiful.
