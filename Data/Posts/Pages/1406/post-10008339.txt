Totally in agreement there!

Can I help? What are you looking for? How will you know when you've found it? etc.
Well, this is going to end up being a hunt through the historical names of systems. I have route of the couriers that infected the station and old names of systems plus mention that the station was orbiting a moon that was ravaged by Mycoid. The Federation vs Galactic Cooperative seem to have had separate parallel naming schemes. Like I said shibboleths are everything in the search. I don't think the names unified until Universal Cartographics came into the picture (note to self: reread that Codex entry). The trick then becomes context clues to isolate where the hell it happened. This got a lot easier after realizing we are dealing with stories from specific cultural backgrounds which are then given that particular group's name for local places. This is why it was ultimately important to prove Sol was in the lore at every step of the stories.
