Then they released the binary image, with the quote "just because you can see it, doesn’t mean it isn’t there" and the Coriolis station.


This system also has a Gas Giant with 8 moons, as per the Dark wheel Codex and multiple suns, including a K Type as per the codex image. ISH…


How do you find something more than once… that Could imply it is not a physical thing (RE the idea it was made up and it relates to Friendships and that crap, the idea I hate lol) or even if you find it, it can disappear and move, does it jump round the 6 locations in the logo?

In regards to the "Just because you cant see it" reference may be referring to the Cloaked/Invisible Thargoid ships, specifically the ship in the 'Scream' video they uploaded to Twitter of which they only person who even worked it out was myself... Seeing as it came at same time as them releasing the video and my immediate release of a partial paper in some circles encouraging people to look for themselves.

Thats not a K star in the Image its a Hot T Tauri

If I asked you how many times you had found "A Star in space" you would tell me more than once, because things which have multiples or occur in different locations can ofcourse be found more than once...
