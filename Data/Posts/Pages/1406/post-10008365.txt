Anyone who knows me, knows I don't do this for anything but pushing us forward. I have taken a fair amount of criticism for my unorthodox methods. That being said, we have current system names. The couriers were flying between Atlantis and Regulus per the Universal Cartographics naming scheme. We are told to find the Dark Wheel station then Raxxla. I would advise setting GalMap to star classification mode with all classes visible and route plot via economic mode.

This information is now public via my CMDR Twitter feed. I am at work and I want someone to find this soon because I am way outside the Bubble fueling my carrier, Dharmachakra. Let's do this folks!
