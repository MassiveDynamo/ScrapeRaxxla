Yes! I think also the magnitude or maybe type of star has a different overall effect on the strength of the colours. Strangely I only noticed this recently too!

Also the star in the centre of the tunnel actually gets closer, pics below are the start and end of a 130ly jump:

It's barely noticeable at normal jump ranges but on those long neutron jumps you can really see it grow from a little point!

So very cool! I really think most people underappreciate the witchspace tunnel. I did, I basically ignored it for years because I believed the common myth that it's "just" the loading graphic. I've only started really looking properly at it over the last month and it's actually really cool!

As you approach the end of the tunnel, look at 45°-60° relative to the tunnel and you will see space fold up on itself right before you exit the Witchspace tunnel.
