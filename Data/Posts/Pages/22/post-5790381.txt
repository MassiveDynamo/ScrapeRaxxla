So it is funny that you bring up what we do know and don't know about Raxxla the day i read Chapter 15. So lets go back in time, to Salome's Trial! Warning: Premonition Spoiler

SPOILER



The woman in particular speaking for the Dark Wheel to the Children of Raxxla representative is the one in question: Spikey Hair, Small Wirey Frame, Supple Dark Eyes, Olive Skin.

We are adding her to our list of Dynasty Conspiracy suspects. Also We are falling down the rabbit hole down to saying this dynasty plan, and the "organizations" involved, are apart of the dark wheel, and these people have control of Raxxla and the technology from beyond the galaxy.
