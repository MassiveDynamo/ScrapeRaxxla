Rebecca? That or the cyborg lady that travels with her?

The answer you're looking for just might be found in Robert Holdstock's original The Dark Wheel novella which was released along with the original Elite in 1984.

It's a short read and can be found all over the internet with a quick Google.

Here's a link to one of the many pages that have the novella archived: http://www.elitehomepage.org/dkwheel.htm

This also brings to mind a theory that's been swirling around my head this week. Perhaps the journey to find Raxxla is a literary one.

A while back I had a short exchange of conversation in email with Ian Bell, co-creator of the original Elite. According to Bell, Robert Holdstock had a very specific concept behind what exactly Raxxla was intended to be and that, now that Holdstock is dead, Bell remains the only person alive who knows what Holdstock's original imagination of Raxxla is or was. According to Bell:
SPOILER







It stand partly to reason that if Ian Bell is aware of what and where Holdstock intended Raxxla to be that David Braben would likely have been aware as well. It seems odd that Holdstock would have withheld that information from one half of the orignal Elite's creative team. If so then it is possible that David Braben has placed Raxxla in the Elite: Dangerous galaxy as an homage to Robert Holdstock ... a "thank you" to his memory and all that he did to help breath life into an 8-bit vector graphics video game.

Holdstock reused "Raxxla" and "The Dark Wheel" from The Alien World in The Dark Wheel novella. Is it possible that there are other hints hidden away in some of his other literary works? Perhaps finding out what Raxxla meant to Holdstock will lead us to unlocking the mystery in the game.
