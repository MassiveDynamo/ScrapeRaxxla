Oh you can surmise her identity if you know your lore.

Loving the renewed interest in this particular mystery!

For Us the interest in finding it has always been here, but there is so little information we don't even know where to start. It's not like we can chase down rumors in the shady places of the world looking for a tiny clue of Raxxla. All we have to go on is: It's in the game. I Suppose Shinrarta is as good a place as any to start, but without even the smallest trail of bread crumbs it will most likely fizzle out fast.

We also don't know what we are looking for, though it has been described as a planet, a ghost planet, and a gateway to another galaxy. So is it a planet? Is it a POI on a planet? Did someone really beat us there? Luckily we have compiled a nice list of what we know so we need to start digging deeper!

Raxxla would be the one thing that might entice me to do a third ED book. I'd love to chronicle that mystery.

Cheers,
