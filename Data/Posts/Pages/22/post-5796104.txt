I discovered it has no way of generating a name with "RA" + "XX" + "LA" simply because the double-x variant doesn't exist in the generators strings. And it cannot use single letter-combinations in any variant from what I can see.

LIkewise "Ciraq" also cannot exist using the original game's name generation algorithm.
