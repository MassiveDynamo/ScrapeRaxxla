OK I got a problem. A couple moths ago something clicked in my head from something in game and I started looking for groups with no name. The Nameless in Colonia fit the bill so I just asked on the latest Call To Arms For A Free Colonia thread where the name came from originally, wondering if they had anything 'special' about them. @Ian Doncaster responded with the comment below which from my POV is full of nice shiny tinfoil and adds way more weight to something 'special' about them. 100% influence at start, hidden backers maybe going to the top. I was curious about the access to Fed & Imp ships, was there a relationship there for some reason? Was it a player submitted name and could be ignored or was it an fdev one and maybe significant?

Problem is I cannot remember WHY or HOW I linked a group with no name to the DW or Raxxla. I went to Formidine Rift and just getting back and have completely forgotten what the link was. Dont think it was just the 'Unnamed Gas Giant', think it was a log or a beacon, maybe even something on here, something that wasnt obvious. Can anybody make the link to a group with no name, unnamed or nameless as opposed to just being unknown?

Sounds more like The Club than TDW who are described as “ elite-ranked treasure hunters from a bygone age” (And Here The Wheel) and “a legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters“ (Codex). Unless FD are really trying to mislead us I think they’ve retconned the original TDW from Holdstock (“band of twisted evil men”) and The Club have taken over that role.
