“asphodel meadows” - Some say it’s where the Sirens lived....

The Oxford English Dictionary gives Homer as the source for the English poetic tradition of describing the meadows of the afterlife as being covered in asphodel. Homer's "asphodel meadow" (ἀσφοδελὸν λειμῶνα), "where the spirits of the dead dwell" (Od. 24.14), has throughout Western literary history been envisioned as a pleasant and even desirable place. This was the impression among many of the ancient Greek poets and Homeric commentators, who understood the adjective ἀσφοδελός to mean "flowery," "fragrant," "fertile," and “lush,” and who even referred to the asphodel meadow as a “paradise” (παράδεισος). This was all the more so among the post-Renaissance English poets, especially those of the Romantic tradition, who painted colorful pictures of “happy souls who dwell in yellow meads of asphodel.” But this is not the picture drawn in books 11 and 24 of the Odyssey, our earliest extended descriptions of Hades, and our earliest references to an “asphodel meadow.” The three Odyssean passages in which Hades features an “asphodel meadow” (11.539, 573; 24.13) portray a dark, gloomy, and mirthless place.

it’s a system...

Asphodel also next to the Axis Mundi system. A while ago, I was looking at directions from those two systems.
Asphodel in the under world should in prinsipal indicate the direction ‘down’, along the axis mundi.

Didn’t find anything particular, but I was elsewhere in the galaxy, so it was just a map search. Could be something interesting to find local.

Fowers are important in ED. Several female key characters have flower names. The asphodel has six petals in it’s flower.

The voyage to the underworld in the Odyssey is the section I have tried to figure out earlier. It is chapter XXIV.
V and A are both 5 in roman numbers.
