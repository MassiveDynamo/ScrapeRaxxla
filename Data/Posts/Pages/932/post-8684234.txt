Hey all, back again, and yet again wearing the tin hat!

There was a little bit of buzz about the strange signal from Jacques Station, link to a video by Mattius below this post.

But it got me thinking, what if Jacques isn't the only one? Elite has a lot of Greek/Roman mythos in it. What about The Oracle?

My squadron was out fighting Thargoids when I returned to the bubble from Colonia, after doing some things I went out to them. Thought to myself, why not drop by Delphi and give The Oracle a once over? I didn't expect much...

To my surprise? There's a signal here, too. It's hard to hear due to all the traffic, even in Solo it's pretty busy, but it's there. Unfortunately, I'm on Xbox, and lack any sort of recording equipment to analyze the sound. It got me thinking: Are these two signals the same? How many other stations have a signal? Do they actually mean anything?

Figured I'd share, in case anyone that does have proper equipment and software might have a go, and hopefully discover something from it.

Here's that video link: (YouTube)
