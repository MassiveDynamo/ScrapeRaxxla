Carcosa, The Nameless, even the system itself (lava world) are references to or inspired by H. P. Lovecraft. The names are from FDev and somebody put some kind of story into it. If it was just for themselves or there is a bigger story is not known yet. There was a video about that Carcosa could have one of the hidden Dark Wheel bases, but not really sure if it's true.
