The siren of the deepest void!

Odysseus must also encounter the Sirens in order to get home and is told how to avoid the fate of the Siren’s calls by Circe by using beeswax to block the ears of his sailors. She advises he can hear the song himself if he is bound to the mast and instructs his crew to ignore his commands to release him until they have passed danger of the siren’s.

“asphodel meadows” - Some say it’s where the Sirens lived....

The Oxford English Dictionary gives Homer as the source for the English poetic tradition of describing the meadows of the afterlife as being covered in asphodel. Homer's "asphodel meadow" (ἀσφοδελὸν λειμῶνα), "where the spirits of the dead dwell" (Od. 24.14), has throughout Western literary history been envisioned as a pleasant and even desirable place. This was the impression among many of the ancient Greek poets and Homeric commentators, who understood the adjective ἀσφοδελός to mean "flowery," "fragrant," "fertile," and “lush,” and who even referred to the asphodel meadow as a “paradise” (παράδεισος). This was all the more so among the post-Renaissance English poets, especially those of the Romantic tradition, who painted colorful pictures of “happy souls who dwell in yellow meads of asphodel.” But this is not the picture drawn in books 11 and 24 of the Odyssey, our earliest extended descriptions of Hades, and our earliest references to an “asphodel meadow.” The three Odyssean passages in which Hades features an “asphodel meadow” (11.539, 573; 24.13) portray a dark, gloomy, and mirthless place.

it’s a system...
