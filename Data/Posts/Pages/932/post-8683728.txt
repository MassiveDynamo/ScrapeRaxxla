A bit off topic but relevant to the subject I guess but on the galaxy map, when you remove all star types with the filter certain star leave a hue of light behind even though you remove them from sight.

what are those stars that glow?

I have seen many star types from class k to class b that do this.

“Planetary nebulae” I think

Yes, as Jorki says. They may have secondary BH as well but that just a coincidence. If youre on PC you'll get a wonderful skybox, just fly away from the Sun to get the best views. If youre on XB you may just get broken white clouds or half of the colours, you can always check on Inara and go 'Oooh, thats what I should be seeing'
