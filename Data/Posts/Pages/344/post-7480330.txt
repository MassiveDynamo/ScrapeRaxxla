All this Greek mythology people are spewing... to date has there been a puzzle of ED that was solved by knowledge of Greek mythology? Thargoid Sensor, Probe, Link, Data and Maps all unraveled with math and science, stop trying to push Greek myths.

Hi
Thank you...
Well yes... A puzzle was supposedly solved by "Greek Mythology".... in basic form in a weird sort of way...
However you are right.... only the half puzzle was solved and the rest is/was a "Bible Story" in-which leads you to a "Star Map" yes a "Map of the Star" a very special hand draw map in 1521 to 1600 in fact, i couldn't find...
however a reprint in 1624 works sort of....
Which leads to a miss-spelled "Star System".... In the right location...

Yes the spelling is differently wrong... by accident, or on purpose who knows ?

Given i only solved this last night i am about to travel there now...

Sadly... NO... 99.99% sure it has nothing to do with the "Dark Wheel" or "Raxxle"... i do mean that... Very sad indeed....

Yes i will explain all... You have had the puzzle for years... a few more days wont hurt....
Sorry dude i will need to explain why the "Greek mythology" was right & wrong... and to finish this riddle once and for all....

Even if this is nothing, which i am sure it is, sadly.... The Puzzle is pure ED at its best... The solution should open your eyes to other ideas... with "star map" yes, Which you will check my findings... Yes...
There is no copy right issue in 3305 on a map 1700 year old map i am sure...

Cheers Stu
