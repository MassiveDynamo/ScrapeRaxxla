No, I'm refering to the source of the statement from the video I watched.

I think the video which refers to the tiny little bit obvious thing is on the FP, ref [8]. It's Michael Brookes, ED's Viking nanny, not David Braben, the Saxon father, who speaks.
Is there another video speaking of tiny bit obvious things ?
Lot of confusion, here, if we don't read the brilliant Macro's FP....

EDIT: Ninjaed' by Xaintly. This.

Again, at the time of this vid, iirc, the E/F missions (related to a certain celestial body, The Myth, obfuscated in the outer rim and everybody looking for SAP 8 Containers bearing some sort of map that TDW was coveting) were running fast and strong. And as you can see in the first pages of this thread, a lot of sensible events were happening with many seasoned Cmdrs chasing the Chymera. (Now, most of them are chasing smuggled cheap Lavian Brandy and silly screenshots in rewarmed up expeditions.
IF they are still playing ED...)
Everything was taken off by FD since, and the author of this phrase left/was put aside from ED. Even the interviewer is streaming other games, most part of the time.
Mary Poppins was fired and so we had to say bye bye to the Raxxla running Quest and all fantasy in ED. Mr Banks is a brilliant technician/engineer but ...fantasy? Not sure.
So, not sure there still is anything obvious besides what comes in the GalNet and maybe, but just maybe, in the Codex.
And since any rookie Cmdr can interact with TDW... meh... TDW of yesteryear has become the TFakeDW, seems to me, untill a sensible Cmdr tracks a SD TDW ship to "the 8th moon base" therefore proving me wrong. That base, if it exists, must have some sort of traffic.
But again, with FD's current "story tellers", who knows ?
