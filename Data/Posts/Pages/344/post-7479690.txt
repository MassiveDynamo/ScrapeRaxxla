All this Greek mythology people are spewing... to date has there been a puzzle of ED that was solved by knowledge of Greek mythology? Thargoid Sensor, Probe, Link, Data and Maps all unraveled with math and science, stop trying to push Greek myths.

This is actually a good point. If you consider that video from drew wagner you might notice something. The people in the games seem to already represent the greek myths. You might not need to do it in such a raw fashion. Following the lore since the first game may already cover this and be simpler which would make sense as most players wouldn't know enough about any of these subjects(including me). However having it be the existing background of the lore would mean you could simply follow the lore and accomplish the same thing. Alex was traveling with Elyssia and doing errands that were literally transport missions. It was like the story was spelling out the same things everyone is looking for. It may be easier than we're thinking. Although I could be misunderstanding things also.

There may be a specific reason they gave everyone access to the original game for free.

The codex was only added a few months ago, it wasn't in beta. FDev has barely talked about Raxxla before, except to say they think the way to get to it is "a tiny bit obvious".

They have never said it was a tiny bit obvious. That was a conversation about which question they expected to get in live stream and was not oriented to raxxla specifically. Although they had just gotten a question about raxxla in the midst of it. They have never said it was a little bit obvious. Nor would that make any sense to finding raxxla. Anything can be stated to be a little bit obvious.
