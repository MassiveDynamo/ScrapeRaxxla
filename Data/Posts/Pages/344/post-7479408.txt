Currently about MU Cephei. I thought it might be a candidate for the jewel.

MU Chephei is also known as Garnet Star. Garnet is a jewel that is connected to the pomegranate and the story of Persephone.

Garnet is know as a stone for loved ones who travel and a crystal that can heal the broken bonds between lovers. (lover woe and yearning vagabond hearts?)

MU Cephei is the reddest star in the sky, seen from earth. A red super giant.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_Cephei

Wikipedia lists the distance as 2840 ly but in ED it's further out, at 5930 ly. This puts it just across the boarder into the Elysian fields.

The star is circumpolar and close to the circle of historic north pole stars. Not to far from Cassiopeias head either.

I haven't found anything there yet(except the black disk that covers all super giants at a certain distance) but i think it matches the first paragraph in the codex, rather well.
