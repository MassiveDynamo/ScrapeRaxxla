are you going for obscure connection of the week award, or did I miss some cultural reference? :S
The first bit was just a genuine statement - I do miss the Ricardio Bentonio Galnet stuff.

The second bit was indeeed just a bit of a joke / cultural reference - a nod to what I presume to be what some of the Ricardo Bentonio stuff in the article is a reference to.

On the actual topic of the article though, the Halsey stuff’s all pretty interesting, and worth looking into for those who haven’t. Whether it’s actually Raxxla related - can’t say. (It’s in my ‘plenty of indications that it is, but hope it isn’t’ category! )
