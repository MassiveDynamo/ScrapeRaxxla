I was really hoping Salvation might lead to a way of interacting with one or more Thargoid factions beyond pew-pew,.maybe even on foot at a station or the like. Looking less likely. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised, but I doubt it based on past performance. [Or current performance shurely? eds.]
Ah, I don't think peaceful interaction was ever on the cards. There never was an appropriate in-game mechanism, and it seems the vast majority just want to pew pew so the weight of evidence is against humanity... unless that Universal Translator finally emerges from the Holloway research lab...

So the conversation
“Do you expect us to surrender?”
“No, we expect you to die!”

Might actually turn out to be more along the lines of..
“We’re sorry most human pilots keep on murdering you and ravishing your barnacle farms. We’re not all like that, we understand hyperdiction was just a non-hostile ‘stop and search’ to check us out. Many of us would like to be friends and set up a cultural exchange programme”

“That’s OK, after many tests we’re now satisfied that humanity is a worthy sacrifice to the Far God...she’ll be here next Tuesday. Kiss your thruster pods goodbye and expect an excruciating death”
