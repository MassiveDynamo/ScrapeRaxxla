I’m of the opinion that Salvation might well be “Gail” (which can also be a male name according to Wikipedia), the anti-Thargoid AI developed by Galcop as mentioned in the GCs Sarasvati logs. It would be nice to have a follow-up to that storyline. [...]
I was really hoping Salvation might lead to a way of interacting with one or more Thargoid factions beyond pew-pew,.maybe even on foot at a station or the like. Looking less likely. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised, but I doubt it based on past performance. [Or current performance shurely? eds.]
