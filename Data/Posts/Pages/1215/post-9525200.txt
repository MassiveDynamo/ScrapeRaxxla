I've been thinking... You set out on an adventure to discover the galaxy and you stumble across Raxxla and then carelessly lose it again.

Where would be some of the first places you'd head for..... I'd probably head somewhere you'd seen planets outside our solar system...

So I've been looking at the discoveries in a timeline for exoplanets by NASA and started visiting the systems (haven't gotten very far yet!)... The nearest required a permit (Van Maanen's star and discredited discovery too but what the hell!) so that took a while and the next (Alrai) was an interesting system with a nice massive dying star and seen some nice scenery already.... But nothing of Raxxla interest so far...

However the first discovery of extra solar planets was in PSR J1300+1240... Which is 2K LY from Sol but a bit tricky to get there as it's above the galactic plane.... I was wondering if anyone else has suggested this avenue before or been to J1300+1240?


....just a thought
