I’m of the opinion that Salvation might well be “Gail” (which can also be a male name according to Wikipedia), the anti-Thargoid AI developed by Galcop as mentioned in the GCs Sarasvati logs. It would be nice to have a follow-up to that storyline. Some of us spent a while trying to find the other Thunderchild units that were hinted, and there was supposed to be a very important data library that was never found....

When (IF) today’s update ends (it’s running really slowly!!) I can see if I got the Mbooni permit....
With my RSI I won’t be doing any more goid bashing for a long time, but I might nail the new Burst Gauss Canon over the mantlepiece and impress my neighbours!

Edit: I see Saud Kruger is looking for new ELW as “tourist destinations” and luxury cabins for VIPs will be reduced in price...methinks The Club is getting ready for Exodus!

What if “Source Identified: Gail…” was Gaillard… the Gaillard is the foredeck/forecastle… a round about reference to Argo Navis? …. Would make it referring to something in the current Carina Constellation maybe?
