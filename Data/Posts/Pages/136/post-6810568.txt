Can someone link or show me where all this "reachable by Cobra MkIII" and 468ly stuff is that FDev have "said?"

Because for the life of me, the only thing I know that FDev have "said" is that there will be no clues and that it's out there and they know where it is.

I'm sensing some leakage from the Formidine Rift.
