But I think “outer rim” is particularly odd. Definition of “rim” is “the upper or outer edge of an object, typically something circular or approximately circular”, so the word “outer” here is redundant. It might be used to indicate distance, as in ‘outer edge of the galaxy’, but that is a very long way from the bubble & doesn’t seem to meet the hints from the original source; so it might be a double bluff & suggest that whatever/wherever it is also has an “inner” rim, such as an asteroid belt or planetary ring. Is there a nebula name that suggests some relevant form of geometry? E.g. Ring, Helix, Hourglass, Cone, Spirograph nebulae? MB did imply FD had made it “a little bit obvious”

Outer Rim! I'm thinking I'll make a visit next time I'm down in Orlando Florida. Looks like as good a Raxxla candidate as any: https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/contemporary-resort/outer-rim/
