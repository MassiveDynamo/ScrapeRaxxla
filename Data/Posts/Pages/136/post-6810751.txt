By that I am referring to the fact that I am told Raxxla used to orbit around Lave 2, in the bubble, has long since left(centuries ago) and while it itself may be a gateway, is not capable of faster than light travel on its own.

Put on the brakes there. Especially when using the word "fact" to discuss Raxxla orbiting Lave 2. No. Just no. That was from Drew Wagar's (very well written) fan fiction. No matter how well written, however, it still remains Fan Fiction and nothing more.

I'm sensing some leakage from the Formidine Rift.

Your penguin senses aren't failing you.

Can someone link or show me where all this "reachable by Cobra MkIII" and 468ly stuff is that FDev have "said?"

Because for the life of me, the only thing I know that FDev have "said" is that there will be no clues and that it's out there and they know where it is.

As the axe-wielding penguin said ... some of the old Rift clues seem to be bleeding over again.
