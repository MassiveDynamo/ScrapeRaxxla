Everybody knows that Raxxla is obfuscated in the outer rim.It's (was) in the game. The question is: are FDevs consistent ?

This refers to the myth. From Macros’ first post in the thread: Mission [2] mentions a rumour that talks about:"A certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth."

I am not aware of any myth along these lines other than Raxxla, so it’s a fair bet Raxxla is what this is about.

However this phrasing is interesting. Definition of “obfuscate” is “make obscure, unclear, or unintelligible”, so indicates an intentional attempt to hide something or garble the meaning. So is this actually a clue that the characters of the word Raxxla have been garbled to create its location? Systems containing the phrase (e.g. RA XX-L A??-?) have been investigated by rOmiLaYu & others are currently being checked by Friedenreiich Xante, but perhaps its a little more obscure than that...

But I think “outer rim” is particularly odd. Definition of “rim” is “the upper or outer edge of an object, typically something circular or approximately circular”, so the word “outer” here is redundant. It might be used to indicate distance, as in ‘outer edge of the galaxy’, but that is a very long way from the bubble & doesn’t seem to meet the hints from the original source; so it might be a double bluff & suggest that whatever/wherever it is also has an “inner” rim, such as an asteroid belt or planetary ring. Is there a nebula name that suggests some relevant form of geometry? E.g. Ring, Helix, Hourglass, Cone, Spirograph nebulae? MB did imply FD had made it “a little bit obvious”
