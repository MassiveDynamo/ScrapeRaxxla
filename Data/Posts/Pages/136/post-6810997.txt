Might be more obvious than that. Isn’t there an item that is supposed to be alien, stored in a containment vessel, that could be some form of unstable data store? I remember some of the DW missions were related to crystals. Since we recently have Guardian Ancient Data Terminals in-game perhaps there is a tie-in to decoding them here? Sorry I’m a bit vague, early morning wake up due to noisy dawn chorus & breakfast coffee effect has just about dissipated...zzzzzzz

You mean the Sap 8 Core Container? Worth a try. Apparently they can be bought at malsipina Gateway, though EDDB doesn't confirm.

Maybe one should simply load up on all existing exotic cargo stuff and make a round trip to the Permit locked Systems.
