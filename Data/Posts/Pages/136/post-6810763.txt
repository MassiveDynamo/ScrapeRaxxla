Has someone tried to become allied with the dark wheel (Shinrarta Dezhra), to see if it has any effect?

EDIT: or with any other faction even remotely linked to Raxxla, for what it's worth.

Yes. I've been allied with The Dark Wheel across at least two accounts. Doesn't appear to unlock anything special.
