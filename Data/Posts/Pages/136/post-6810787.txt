Yes. I've been allied with The Dark Wheel across at least two accounts. Doesn't appear to unlock anything special.

Alright, but still I suspect there must be a trick to "unlock" Raxxla, wherever it may be. This is a common ingame mechanic (p.e. Guardian Obelisks and Data Points, Thargoid Surface sites etc...). I wouldn't be surprised if you have to carry specific items in your cargo hold to be able to jump to Polaris, for instance, even if such type of Permit lock hasn't been experienced before ingame.
