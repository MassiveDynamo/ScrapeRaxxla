Alright, but still I suspect there must be a trick to "unlock" Raxxla, wherever it may be. This is a common ingame mechanic (p.e. Guardian Obelisks and Data Points, Thargoid Surface sites etc...). I wouldn't be surprised if you have to carry specific items in your cargo hold to be able to jump to Polaris, for instance, even if such type of Permit lock hasn't been experienced before ingame.

Might be more obvious than that. Isn’t there an item that is supposed to be alien, stored in a containment vessel, that could be some form of unstable data store? I remember some of the DW missions were related to crystals. Since we recently have Guardian Ancient Data Terminals in-game perhaps there is a tie-in to decoding them here? Sorry I’m a bit vague, early morning wake up due to noisy dawn chorus & breakfast coffee effect has just about dissipated...zzzzzzz
