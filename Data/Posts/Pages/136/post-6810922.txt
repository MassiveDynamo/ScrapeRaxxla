However this phrasing is interesting. Definition of “obfuscate” is “make obscure, unclear, or unintelligible”, so indicates an intentional attempt to hide something or garble the meaning. So is this actually a clue that the characters of the word Raxxla have been garbled to create its location? Systems containing the phrase (e.g. RA XX-L A??-?) have been investigated by rOmiLaYu & others are currently being checked by Friedenreiich Xante, but perhaps its a little more obscure than that...

I was also wondering if the word OISIR was to be found in a System Name. Again, not in its whole, but the Systems Wregoi SI-R do exist not far away from the bubble, and there are many more sectors ending in OI (in fact, too many to look after all of them).

Oh and since you're mentioning me, here are some more I investigated in the Little spare time I've had this week-end

Dryu Bra XX-L a76-0
Dryu Bra XX-L a118-0
Dryu Bra XX-L a117-0
Dryu Bra XX-L a62-0
Dryu Bra XX-L a49-0
Dryu Bra XX-L a36-0

All awfully boring and empty. Two of them don't even have planets (fine by me, less to scan).
