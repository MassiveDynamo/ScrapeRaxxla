That one does seem to get recycled again and again. We do tend to retread over old ground as new people join our cult quest.

Here's a new theory then - at least I think it's new. I don't recall seeing it discussed anywhere.

Personally, I don't believe that Raxxla is in the Bubble (we'd have found it long ago) or in the vicinity of it (we'd have stumbled across it by now), so that leaves a whole lot of empty space for it to be in.

But the odds against someone stumbling across a random system thousands of lightyears from Sol are astronomical, so we'd need a clue - except we've been told there aren't going to be any clues.

So how could FDev increase the chances of someone finding Raxxla out in the deep black?

Well, the COULD arrange for an apparently unrelated even to occur which moves player focus to the general vicinity, simultaneously increasing the amount of traffic and the region and giving players a local base of operations.

Something like, say, a jump-capable station getting dragged out of hyperpace...
