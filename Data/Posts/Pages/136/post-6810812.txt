Alright, but still I suspect there must be a trick to "unlock" Raxxla, wherever it may be. This is a common ingame mechanic (p.e. Guardian Obelisks and Data Points, Thargoid Surface sites etc...). I wouldn't be surprised if you have to carry specific items in your cargo hold to be able to jump to Polaris, for instance, even if such type of Permit lock hasn't been experienced before ingame.

I know that there were some experiments carrying various cargo items toward the Bovomit sector back when it was thought that the Bovomit permit lock might have bearing on the Formindine Rift. Not sure is something like that has been carried out on Polaris.
