how long does a full orbital cycle of all planets around a star take in elite? is it running in real time? or is it running in an accelerated time?

this would be important to answer because if it's running in an accelerated time (say an hour or so), it would be worth it to stay in a system and experience the entire cycle before leaving. this would explain why we haven't found raxxla yet even though we have explored pretty much the entirety of the bubble and the space around it.

our current method of exploration consists of jumping to a system, honking and scanning everything, consider the system 100% explored and leave. truth is, we only experience a tiny snapshot of the system cycle, and it's not trully 100% explored. raxxla could be hidden in such a way that, it's a phenomenon that only happens at a certain time of that orbital cycle (say after a full alignment of all planets in a system) or things of that nature. this would also explain the famous word of mouth "some cmdr has been to the system where raxxla is, honked and left".

we could be simply jumping into the right system, but not in the right time.
