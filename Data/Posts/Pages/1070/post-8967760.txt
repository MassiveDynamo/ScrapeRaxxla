You are right to be suspicious of Inara data - Inara has some data that is user editable and I have come across anomolies there before when users have modified the data, but then it hasn't been updated when things change.

EDDB and EDSM do not modify the uploaded data from journals so these can be trusted.

Some system descriptions strings may be out of date on EDSM, thats all I found to not trust, and the bottom right panel descriptions on some places are also player generated. But the map and bodies are as per the journal.

Yes, I rechecked the Inara entry that Davanix had linked & saw the Dark Wheel faction he was talking about is a player squadron set up by ScolioTheMost whoâ€™d claimed it was headquartered at HIP 22469(Overlook), so clearly a joke.

I only use Inara for checking engineer blueprints and nearest Interstellar Factors, but regularly use EDSM for system and faction checking.
