Bear in mind The Dark Wheel novella came out with the original Elite game in 1984, and I suspect is not relevant to the current game. In the original game the play area had to be split into different “galaxies” due to the 8-bit numbering scheme used. Movement between them had to be by a special jump drive. There was o Raxxla implemented in that version of the game, nor in any of the other versions of the game until now. Elite Dangerous is the first game version to have Raxxla implemented, but DB said “but you don’t know what it is”, emphasising the “what”.

For the current Elite Dangerous game FD has said there is only one galaxy implemented; I don’t honk they would lie to us so whatever Raxxla is it should not be the “gateway to another galaxy” as mentioned in the old novella!

It might, however, be a Guardian arkship which contains the access ports to the Guardian comms network populated by their AI. That might be though of as another galaxy!

You just know you're an explorer if your autocorrect has you honking more than thinking. Brilliant.
