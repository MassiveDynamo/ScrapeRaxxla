I’m a bit suspicious of this Inara information. How did it get in there & how authentic is it??

From EDSM searching on “Pilot” in Minor Factions (not player factions) I see:

1 Pilots Federation Local Branch - Democracy 0 controlled stations 0 controlled systems

2 Pilots’ Federation Administration - Corporate 5 systems 7 stations Otegine/Aldrich, Matet/Coelho, Dromi/Mawson+Dimery+Aitkins, Sharur/Archias, Orna/ Fuzong

3 Pilots’ Federation Local Branch - Democracy 0 stations 0 systems

4 PilotsFederation - no detail! -rank via rescue missions or Thargoid kills 0 stations 0 systems

5 Pilots Federation Local Branch - Democracy 0 stations 0 systems Shinrarta Dezhra

I’m Allied with #4 from Goid bashing and Station Rescue missions, and I think #5 from running missions for them from ShinDez. Haven’t tried #2 yet, but how can #1 & #3 be befriended?

I know one of them can't be allied with unless you are a recent player as it is the pilot fed within the newbie systems, other than that it seems their is one for the whole thargoid ordeal, one for dezhra itself, one from codex entrys/exploration data and the other by magical combat bonds in random areas (I got some from the jupiter cg fighting against jupiter)

I imagined they where just typos at one point and all under the same faction however iv gotten 4 of them at different times of my playtime of elite and only got allied status withing the see able pilot fed in dezhra last year in between these... Its weird and fdev confirmed its on purpose with no answer at all to why....

I wonder if the same system exists within the thargoid, as I noticed the scouts just attack on site while a cyclops doesnt yet iv killed heaps of them and now they act like the scouts however the rest are still passive with me (havnt killed many of the other varients) hmmmm

If the dark wheel system of who they pick is based upon allied status this would be a big one however I'm allied with most factions in the bubble (I went to war on this last year just to see green everywhere) so not sure but yet I'm not elite in combat yet just 13% off of deadly
