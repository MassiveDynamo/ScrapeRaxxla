You just know you're an explorer if your autocorrect has you honking more than thinking. Brilliant.

Ah, I wondered what you meant but now I see! Yes, the autocorrect is driving me mad with frustration. I originally thought it was my typing (it’s all this hand washing with Covid prevention, my fingers are waterlogged!). I’m beginning to wonder if a particularly inventive and mean hacker has infected my iPad with an autocorrect bug!
