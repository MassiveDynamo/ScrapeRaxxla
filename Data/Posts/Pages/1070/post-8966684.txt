I've just put Emperor's Dawn in there... doesn't mean I can get there or the other player in that squadron...

And the Pilot(s) Federations listed on their squadron page have also been entered by the person who runs the squadron....

Apologies if I am missing something, but that's all user created on Inara...?
The inara squadron part was a tid bit of the entire discussion, their are 5 Pilots Federation minor factions within the game that you can become allied with all spelled differently or with capitals or no soaces, so far I have allied with 4 of those the 5th being on the permit locked region of the bubble that only new players get access to, i think the main discussion is which one is the one who holds the permits/navigation lock, and why have they 5, 3 being hidden in background while one in dezhra and the other in the newbie regions,

The 3 hidden in the background where confirmed by fdev a while back in the issues tracker however they didn't answer why they are needed or what they are for.

Also although yes you can create squadrons with whatever name you please inara only shows the system data of ingame real ones to which is strange to have a player squadron over a non player faction although I'm unsure if inara allowed this out of hindsite it just seemed weird as our squadron couldn't do it to our local minor faction until fdev added us to it in their data first, it was merely a wierd coincidence more than a statement tbh, the Pilots Federation quarel is the main topic
