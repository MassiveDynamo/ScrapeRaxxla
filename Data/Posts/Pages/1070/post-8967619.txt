You’re operating on the assumptions that (a) Raxxla is an astronomical body and (b) is detectable by the scanner. Both of those are suspect. As DB said we “don’t know what it is”, which implies it’s something different.
It might be a planet, but it may be more likely that it’s some form of installation, ship, or station. Some installations don’t seem to show up on scanner until you’re fairly close to them. I still suspect a Guardian Ark ship that is stealthed.
I read the book Dark Wheel in translation, and I don't know how accurate it is, but it keeps mentioning that she is in another galaxy.
As far as I understand the other galaxy can be accessed through a black hole...
