I’m a bit suspicious of this Inara information. How did it get in there & how authentic is it??

From EDSM searching on “Pilot” in Minor Factions (not player factions) I see:

1 Pilots Federation Local Branch - Democracy 0 controlled stations 0 controlled systems

2 Pilots’ Federation Administration - Corporate 5 systems 7 stations Otegine/Aldrich, Matet/Coelho, Dromi/Mawson+Dimery+Aitkins, Sharur/Archias, Orna/ Fuzong

3 Pilots’ Federation Local Branch - Democracy 0 stations 0 systems

4 PilotsFederation - no detail! -rank via rescue missions or Thargoid kills 0 stations 0 systems

5 Pilots Federation Local Branch - Democracy 0 stations 0 systems Shinrarta Dezhra

I’m Allied with #4 from Goid bashing and Station Rescue missions, and I think #5 from running missions for them from ShinDez. Haven’t tried #2 yet, but how can #1 & #3 be befriended?
