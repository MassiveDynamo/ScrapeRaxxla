I’m a bit suspicious of this Inara information. How did it get in there & how authentic is it??
You are right to be suspicious of Inara data - Inara has some data that is user editable and I have come across anomolies there before when users have modified the data, but then it hasn't been updated when things change.

Here's my own scan of the Inara data for non-standard allegiances:


Notice CM Draconis 'PlayerPilots' - I believe this is related to Cannon - its not real - the real CM Draconis is allegiance 'none' and there are no planets there.

EDDB and EDSM do not modify the uploaded data from journals so these can be trusted.

Some system descriptions strings may be out of date on EDSM, thats all I found to not trust, and the bottom right panel descriptions on some places are also player generated. But the map and bodies are as per the journal.
