If this crash predates mycoid and human intervention, do we have any indication as to what caused it? Was there some sort of caustic object found near the crash site that caused ship malfunction? Have we found other thargoid crash sites with these caustic, ship degrading objects nearby them? What caused the Adamastor to suffer it’s damage? The same object that brought down the thargoid ship perhaps.

To put it bluntly, I think The probe, sensor, and link damage them as well. Why? I don’t know, but that may also explain what one of their motivations are and why they need meta alloys similarly to humans.
Thargoids can be shot down without Mycoid. They can even crash on their own. If they crash, they will leak ammonia. Mycoid or not.
