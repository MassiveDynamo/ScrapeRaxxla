Unless TDW...

Or a dozen 'reasons' they can write in if they want to, they didnt explain why the barnacles in CSN were suddenly apparent and why we'd missed the ship wrecks before...we made up our own explanations, it was never explained, neither has the source of the binary message exactly....loose ends and things that dont make sense havent stopped a great story so far. Ill be cursing every other 8th moon for ever if it does turn out to be in SD but Ill still jump on the story, won't spoil it for me, I have to give some narrative leeway or put it down to 'The truth is out there'.
