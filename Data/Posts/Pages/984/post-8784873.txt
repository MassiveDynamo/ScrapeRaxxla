Hi there, I am new to ED since August and since September I am out in the black. I was really interested to discover the lore and Drew Wagar's videos about ED and Raxxla. So, since the day I heard about that I spent my time exploring and visiting DSSA-carriers going south from the bubble to Kepler's Crest, Formidine Rift, Errant marches, and now I am in the Perseus Arm and most of the time 35kLy away from home (Ehecatl system). I would not bet my grandma on the idea that Raxxla should only be looked for in the bubble, so I kept my eyes open for Raxxla and Dark Wheel hints. But hey, I am new and it's exciting. The thing with the "8th moon" triggered me and whenever I could, I scanned that one and/or took a screenshot of the undiscovered/unmapped system's map, even if there are many systems with 8th moons AND that do not fit the famous image with the station and the sun as background. As time goes by you just do the necessary, after wasting too much time with scans lol, but I have the screenshots and I will go on with that, don't ask me why, it's a new addiction ("well, now that I am here, why not take a pic...and if it fits the clues, why not scan the surface?").

Noob Question: Does it make any sense to do that, so far out in the black? How can I contribute in another way out here? o7

P.S: And no, forgive me, I haven't read all of the 986 pages.........yet
