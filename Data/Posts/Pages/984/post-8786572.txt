First of all im new here but researching the subject for quite a while like 4 months or so i think i have found something intriguing in codex there is a part about princess astrophel and spiralling stars (in some versions of the Raxxla story, which were later shown to have a striking resemblance to the children's story "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" and consequently became discredited) so i searched for it and found astrophel and stella and i opened a book cipher. Again in codex there is a line (The earliest documented reference to Raxxla dates to 2296 and originates from an entry in the personal journal of Art Tornqvist) i looked into sonet 22 and sonet 96. sonet 96 starts with (Thought, with good cause thou lik'st so well the Night ) like night,Dark and sonet 22 starts with (In highest way of heav'n the Sun did ride ) to orbit,wheel and to cipher you need to numbers for a key i.e 22:96 2:2 and 9:6 or 9:6 2:2 i think dark wheel is the key might be onto something here or might be assumptions wish me luck commanders!
