Noob Question: Does it make any sense to do that, so far out in the black? How can I contribute in another way out here? o7

P.S: And no, forgive me, I haven't read all of the 986 pages.........yet

I'm not the most well-versed loremaster when it comes to all things Raxxla (and the many associated topics), so I can only offer this:

Scanning things out in the black is something you should do if you enjoy it. Being new to ED, I wouldn't focus solely on the whole Raxxla/Dark Wheel plotline, as there are a great many things to do (I'm soon to be trying my hand at competitive canyon racing, for example), and it would be a shame if you burn out due to being tired of exploration. It will happen eventually...I stopped playing for over a year simply because I didn't want the hassle of returning from Colonia (this was before fleet carriers, mind you).

As for reading the thread, I doubt anyone will fault you. I've been following it for two years and haven't read half of it.
