Mmmm....the idea of TDW station being low power & stealthy falls down if you drop out of SC and just look-you’d see it! Unless TDW have used meta alloys to refract light around it so it is also invisible-remember the galnet post about some MA-based sculpture refracting light in unusual ways.....

Memorial to Highliner Antares unveiled 1July 3302 https://news.galnet.fr/galactic-news-memorial-to-the-highliner-antares-unveiled/
“The memorial depicts a stylised version of the Highliner Antares, and has been constructed using light-bending meta-materials that allow light to pass through the interior of the ship as it rotates. As the sculpture moves, the intensity of the light increases, reaching a crescendo of brilliance before subsiding.”
So maybe TDw station hunters need to be on the lookout for a “variable star” near a moon/planet.....
Or maybe look for the glint of an orbiting station that is not present when you drop down.

So...how long have TDW been aware of MA? And are they in league with thargoids??? 🕷🕷🕷
