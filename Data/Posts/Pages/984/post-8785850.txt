Mmmm....the idea of TDW station being low power & stealthy falls down if you drop out of SC and just look-you’d see it! Unless TDW have used meta alloys to refract light around it so it is also invisible-remember the galnet post about some MA-based sculpture refracting light in unusual ways.....

Memorial to Highliner Antares unveiled 1July 3302 https://news.galnet.fr/galactic-news-memorial-to-the-highliner-antares-unveiled/
“The memorial depicts a stylised version of the Highliner Antares, and has been constructed using light-bending meta-materials that allow light to pass through the interior of the ship as it rotates. As the sculpture moves, the intensity of the light increases, reaching a crescendo of brilliance before subsiding.”
So maybe TDw station hunters need to be on the lookout for a “variable star” near a moon/planet.....
Or maybe look for the glint of an orbiting station that is not present when you drop down.

So...how long have TDW been aware of MA? And are they in league with thargoids??? 🕷🕷🕷

I love this! We don’t know the full extent of cooperation or discovery that occurred on Soontill before it was “destroyed”. So I believe what you hint at may be plausible.

Also just to get into the weeds a bit, consider what Antares means. Anti-Ares. The foil to the god of war. Who’s’ equivalent is Mars.

The choice to name it Antares could be absolutely nothing, but if it’s analogous for TDW and their station it becomes significantly more fitting if you believe TDW is anti-The Club. Jorki’s going space crazy reading Galnet! I love it haha!

Here’s something for you guys that I haven’t gotten to look into thoroughly. Chess piece references in Galnet. Juanita Bishop, Consuela Knight, Corsair King, Katrien Rook, Rhea archipelago (Rhea might be Queen).

Could be nothing, but I consider the choices fascinating and will read into the associated articles more when I have the time. Before you say these names mean nothing, consider the fact that the Adamastor was named after a made up deity for a Portuguese odyssey-like epic who’s likeness was also found to be on Michael Brookes back piece and the emphasis of the names meaning (dangers of the sea or untamable) in the streams.
