Noob Question: Does it make any sense to do that, so far out in the black? How can I contribute in another way out here? o7

Hello, welcome to the rest of your life, one post and youre trapped now.

Sense? Thats debateable and largely perception based

I personally map every single H moon (8th moon), every co-orbiting G or I just in case, any 8th planet of the LYT stars that appear in the middle of a 'normal' orbit as an A body and not a separate B, C etc and anything that just looks 'suss'. All of that regardless of what the main Star is or anything else, if its 8 or H its getting mapped

The 'only' clue we have is that 8th moon that 'some' think still exists. (could well be the one in SD, makes perfect sense and 'oh look, it was such low power nobody could scan it until now...', I can see that happening as well)

So the 8th moon is the only 'solid' piece of info, if its true in the first place....

So up to you, personally I have added or 'rejected' 100s of 8th moons to EDSM for future people to study or use an algorithm or whatever, a lot of science is about eliminating possibilities so any data added from my POV is essential and vital, while youre travelling and exploring.
