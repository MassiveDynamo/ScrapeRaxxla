OK, Tyko is looking for a FC lift to either Colonia or back to the bubble. I'm sure I've seen FC planned departure/routing info on the sysmap somewhere. Do I have to dock with the FC before seeing that? seems a bit of a silly way to do things if so
According to sources, you need to use 3rd party tools - I've not seen this ingame (unless you're on a carrier that has already initiated a jump).
