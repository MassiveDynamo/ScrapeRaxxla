We might be talking at slightly cross-purposes. I was just moaning that FD have published a Galnet post of part two of a reporter’s retrospective of the last year without first publishing the first part of her article. FD have done this sort of thing before. I suspect the first part was scheduled to go out over the weekend but failed to be sent for some reason...

Yes, I have noticed with interest in the past the use of the PF’s winged symbol for Colonia. I’ve wondered if it might be a hint that Jaques is TDW? I suspect it is meaningful, but can’t decide how. I’ve been allied with Jaques and a few other factions out there for a while, but not got any unusual response. I think on completion of this trip Jorki is going to stay at Colonia and leave Tyko to make any further QfR investigations....I’ve got another half dozen hypotheses to check out around the bubble, but am a bit exhausted after testing this Gravitational Wave hypothesis of the Toast. Not yet figured out what distances Ive flown in its testing, but it’s been a very long journey for both accounts! Might check it out when Jorki reaches Colonia.

No idea about the shield symbol! Report it as a bug and see if it gets any response!
