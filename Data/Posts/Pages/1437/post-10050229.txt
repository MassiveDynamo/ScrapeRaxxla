Same here - agreed O7, the Codex might be alluding to the DW source location, eg it’s still there, or maybe it was moved. Jaques origin system has a gas giant with an eighth moon!

I was thinking more along the lines that TDW is a “legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters”. Also clandestine and originating a long time ago.

Jaques was a special forces soldier, so used to a clandestine existence. He’s lived a long time, so must have made a lot of contacts. He owns and runs a Spacer’s Bar that TDW members must have frequented and discussed things in, he may well have overheard things. His intended station jump from the bubble out to Beagle Point was pretty adventurous and would certainly have attracted TDW attention if he wasn’t already a member by then. So I’m fairly confident that he is a member, if not the controlling force.

I did investigate ages ago his station jumps around the bubble prior to the Beagle Point attempt but didnt find anything. However that might be worth reinvestigating! Those jumps alone might have been a clue to something! Possibly to other factions of TDW?

Edit
However I see he had to exchange the Coriolis he had bought for a “more resilient Orbis” station, so maybe he was just testing that out before the Beagle Point attempt???
