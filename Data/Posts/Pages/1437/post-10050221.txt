We might be talking at slightly cross-purposes. I was just moaning that FD have published a Galnet post of part two of a reporter’s retrospective of the last year without first publishing the first part of her article. FD have done this sort of thing before. I suspect the first part was scheduled to go out over the weekend but failed to be sent for some reason...

Yes, I have noticed with interest in the past the use of the PF’s winged symbol for Colonia. I’ve wondered if it might be a hint that Jaques is TDW? I suspect it is meaningful, but can’t decide how. I’’Ve been allied with Jaques and a few other factions out there for a while, but not got any unusual response.

No idea about the shield symbol! Report it as a bug and see if it gets any response!

I see. They posted part1 quite early on (june) and part 2 six months later.
But they could have referenced part1 in part 2 so folks could have found it. Agree

Re PF+Colonia = Jaques. Yeah, I'm open for the possibility.

Re Buggy settlement symbol and ask support? Nah, personally I like to use the game itself to figure these things out. But I don't mind of anyone else wants to try that route.
I did spend some time there, some public beacons to scan with the SRV, fines & bounties to be had for trespassing on Foot. Nothing new discovered though.
They did have quite A LOT of turrets for protection though.
