I think TDW (if they truly exist!) came first-according to the Codex they’ve been “operating since the very earliest days of interstellar travel”. Whereas the PF officially originated later “founded in 2805” according to TB0244 in SD.

However I actually suspect the driving force behind PF is Guardian in origin, perhaps an AI...from the similarity of the obelisk symbols and the triangular motif briefly apparent in the HUD nav panel and Universal Cartographics interface.
