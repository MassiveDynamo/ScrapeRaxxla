yes, I have the FC Owners Club Discord Departures Board open at the moment. But looking at the FC in sysmap at Sag A* & I cant see any routing info for any of them...
the FC mentioned on the FCOC Departures Board aren't here yet, and I can't find their current location via the galmap search. Thought that would be accessible even if owner not logged in.
