Yes, I have noticed with interest in the past the use of the PF’s winged symbol for Colonia. I suspect it is meaningful, but can’t decide how. I’’Ve been allied with Jaques and a few other factions out there for a while, but not got any response
My current guess on that is why I have suspected Jaques is far more important to the story than merely an interesting character. When we are introduced he is in Facece where there is Peter's Wreck (planet) and Peter's Base (his old Coriolis). If Jaques is merely an pseudonym, this may explain the symbol because he might just be the founder of the Pilots' Federation. Peter Jameson was after all the first Elite CMDR. There is no way to verify he died in Riedquat as nothing is landable. This was in the letter in Frontier and First Encounters.
