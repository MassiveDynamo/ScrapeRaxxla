I see. They posted part1 quite early on (june) and part 2 six months later.

I did spend some time there, some public beacons to scan with the SRV, fines & bounties to be had for trespassing on Foot. Nothing new discovered though.
They did have quite A LOT of turrets for protection though.

Ah, I did a galnet search on the reporterâ€™s name and didnt see any mention of a part one!
