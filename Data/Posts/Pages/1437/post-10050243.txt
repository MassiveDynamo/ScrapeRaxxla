Likewise, treated myself too, Cloudpunk on PS4 sale, I’m tinkering with simple/yet pretty games presently, not wanted to get too distracted from ED which used to be my primary passion, sadly I’m playing less and less, although I likely play ‘this thread’ more

Remind us, which systems did Jaques visit prior to his disappearance, I feel like footling about with some mapping..
