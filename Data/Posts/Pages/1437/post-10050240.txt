Same here - agreed O7, the Codex might be alluding to the DW source location, eg it’s still there, or maybe… it was moved? Jaques origin system has a gas giant with an eighth moon!

Colonia 7 has the 8 moons of an "unnamed gas giant" which is technically the truth just like with Facece it is a Y-class brown dwarf. Also, wasn't Peter Jameson a Federal Navy guy? Jaques was a Federation Special Ops guy.
