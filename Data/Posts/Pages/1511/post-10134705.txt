Another possibility is Virgo which historically was representative of Demeter and her daughter Kore/Cora* (who is also known by Persephone). The Great Diamond or Diamond of Virgo asterism is in the immediate vicinity. The asterism is formed by:
Cor Caroli of Canes Ventacci
Denebola of Leo
Spica from Virgo
Arcturus in Boötes




* - Cora is the EXACT same spelling from Raxxla codex entry specifically the part about the Art Tornvquist journal from 2296.

I do love this but how can it be linked to other hypotheses extrapolating from the Codex?

Here the Diamond of Virgo is shown in context to Sol, Demeter and Persephone.

It forms a lovely trough for something to sit in, but what directs us up to it? What could be at its centre? Personally I don’t think there is enough to tie it down, not yet at least, but it would form a perfect zone within the upper celestial hemisphere, if that’s where we are being directed?

Personally I feel the codex might be talking about Demeter, Persephone, the underworld and the sunken or lost kingdoms situated there?
