Another possibility is Virgo which historically was representative of Demeter and her daughter Kore/Cora* (who is also known by Persephone). The Great Diamond or Diamond of Virgo asterism is in the immediate vicinity. The asterism is formed by:
Cor Caroli of Canes Ventacci
Denebola of Leo
Spica from Virgo
Arcturus in Bo√∂tes




* - Cora is the EXACT same spelling from Raxxla codex entry specifically the part about the Art Tornvquist journal from 2296.

Well it sure makes a lot of sense!
"The parents grief": Persephone/Cora, daughter to Zeus and Demeter, was abducted by Hades and she choosed to eat only 6 seeds of pomegranate without knowing that if you eat a fruit in the underworld you would remain there forever. Zeus intervened and she had to stay 6 months in the underworld and 6 months on earth. During the 6 months in underworld, Demeter's grief caused autumn and winter, while her joy summer and spring.
"The lovers' woe": it could relate to the unreturned love by Hades for Persephone OR it could be about Adonis, Afrodite's loved one, who became persephone's lover after she saved him. He had to stay sometime with afrodite and sometime with Persephone after a bunch of events... If you are interested: Adonis.
Anyway I did some research and Adonis and is an asteroid I don't know if this could be found in the game...
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2101_Adonis.

About the jewel and the brow of the mother galaxy that could be infact the Great Diamond or maybe the pole star and maybe the toast is not hinting that it is actually there but it is something that could help us navigate to it.
This seems a pretty strong "way" to follow if you ask me!
If all these conjectures are already been said let me know, as I said I'm just a curious newcomer
