For me the most plausible thing is the theory involving Cassiopea... and the parent's grief, the lover woe I think may be something related to the distance between certain systems...
Another possibility is Virgo which historically was representative of Demeter and her daughter Kore/Cora* (who is also known by Persephone). The Great Diamond or Diamond of Virgo asterism is in the immediate vicinity. The asterism is formed by:
Cor Caroli of Canes Ventacci
Denebola of Leo
Spica from Virgo
Arcturus in Bo√∂tes

* - Cora is the EXACT same spelling from Raxxla codex entry specifically the part about the Art Tornvquist journal from 2296.

Cora comes home soused and raving with wild stories, a new one every night. She claims she's found a map to some pirate stash, and all I have to do is loan her my ship so we can go dig it up. Maybe we should go find Raxxla while we're at it!
