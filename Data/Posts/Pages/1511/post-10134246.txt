Come to think of it...why didnt we discuss that comment? Ive searched this thread, and the ED forum, but cant find any mention.

This is driving me mad!!!!
I need to find that video!
It was along the lines of Educating Ed, but where Ed was not available, so an associate stepped in, but it wasnâ€™t called Educating Ed. Your not imagining it
