Reposting this old 2020 interview @ 2:24:15, where we have some very positive affirmations about something bring out there.
Interesting, haven’t seen that before. Theres no real information given so I won’t add it to my FDev quotes thread, but he did carry on to discuss his thoughts on the idea of Raxxla as a gameplay mystery whereas he said he’d cut off a previous interview when asked about specific Raxxla content. I suspect this implies that the knowledge of Raxxla is wider within the company than was originally thought. IMHO it implies the community managers do know some more, if perhaps not all, of the implementation detail.
