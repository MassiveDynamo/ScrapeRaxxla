I vaguely remember a livestream where asteroids were discussed, possibly in the context of a question about Raxxla, and the devs involved seemed to look at each other & someone commented something like “you’re in the right ballpark”....

Anyone remember this and can point me to the livestream vid?
Come to think of it...why didnt we discuss that comment? Ive searched this thread, and the ED forum, but cant find any mention.

This is driving me mad!!!!
I need to find that video!
