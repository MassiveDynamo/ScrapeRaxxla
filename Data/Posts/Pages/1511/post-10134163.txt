I recall it, but the context was different.

It was a live stream, possibly involving mining, FD did these ‘Ed learns’ type vids were a Com Manager tags along and tries different things etc usually with a player group ( if my memory is correct?).

In this instance in was subterfuge (in my opinion) and at some point they basically said - ha got you now where’s Raxxla, to which the FD employee essentially (in my opinion) brushed it off very well and politely counteracted it with charm and or sarcasm.

He was (in my opinion) being flippant.

Yes, I didnt believe it was a hard clue, otherwise we’d have discussed it extensively at the time & I would have noted the reference on my iPad (I suspect I produced the FDev quotes thread later on). I just want to see that vid again.
Was it the Discovery Scanner vid With Chris Gregory, or was it an Educating Ed Galactic Intern vid?

Edit
Was it in fact one of the Educating Ed livestreams or something else? Was it about deep core mining when that was released? (And when was that?)
