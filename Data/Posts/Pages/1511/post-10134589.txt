O7 and thank you!
My point is:
isn't it strange that they said that there would be no hints although they gave us a lot to talk about?
I mean there are clearly some "hints" which points in the direction of telling us it is out there. Maybe the "no hint" thing it's a hint itself!
Maybe we should focus only on what we have in the game!
And probably this has already been said but I would like to confront my thoughts just to be sure!
Another thing I'm trying to analyze is the toast :
"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies.



This is a pretty big hint if you ask me!
I've already read all sorts of hypotesis about this but maybe we didn't look hard enough.
For me the most plausible thing is the theory involving Cassiopea... and the parent's grief, the lover woe I think may be something related to the distance between certain systems... what is the parent's grief? being far away from his son/s or daughter/s and what is the lovers' woe? being far away from each other... I don't really know!
As I said, I think we should go maybe a little back (not meaning that noone should not pursue their own theory of course) because for me the "no hint" thing it just does not make sense.

My first thought after reading this was that the toast was romantisizing the quest for Raxxla. A mystery one can not let go. To the grief of the parents whos child journeys far from home. The woe of a lover whos partner is giving all their love to the quest.

Maybe the toast is meant to be taken at face value
