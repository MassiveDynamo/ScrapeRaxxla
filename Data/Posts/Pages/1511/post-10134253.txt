It was along the lines of Educating Ed, but where Ed was not available, so an associate stepped in, but it wasn’t called Educating Ed. Your not imagining it
No, I remember watching a livestream, one of the few I did watch, and remember the dev comment...but I cant remember which video and that’s what’s driving me mad. I want to check the context, what was actually said, and add it into my FDev quotes thread.

It’s no fun getting old!

(Edit @Han_Zen : your memory is better than mine mate. Do you remember which video this was?)



I remember Ed disappeared for a while. I think around the Beyond season. Deep core mining came in with Beyond Ch4 (v3.3). Just watched Beyond - Chapter Four - Mining and Squadrons Reveal- but it wasn’t that video.....
Edit
Someone had posted a comment about Ed’s return in that Reveal vid, so it must be one of the Ch4 vids that I’m thinking of. Shame I cant search comments within YT vids...someone must have posted a Raxxla comment...perhaps it was one of the exploration vids about the FSS?
But the ch4 release vid is 5 hours long!
