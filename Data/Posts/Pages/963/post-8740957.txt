Perhaps if we continue the new thread along the same lines as this one then DB will take pity on us and provide a meaningful clue?

I have given up on the Argonautica, and other mythology; solution should be science-based &/or in-game. Have tried the third line (siren) as suggesting nearby pulsars, tried nearest 3 giving three centroids & have tried 3 or 4 systems at each, surprisingly with no success!! Darnit!

So I’m thinking:
Galactic Jewel= Sol (galnet 14jun3301, “you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious”)
Witchspace Whisperer=Sirius (as in Horse Whisperer, but with FSDs instead of hooves)
Deep Void Siren = Siren (there’s only one, there are many pulsars, “you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious”)

So, any thoughts on the rest of the toast? (Tried searching around Sol/Sirius/Siren centroid, assuming rest of toast gives in-system directions, but with success!)
Parent’s Grief=?
Lover’s Woe=?
Vagabond Yearning= Home?/Raxxla?/TDW station?

Try taking a step back. Clues in the game, I have found, point me towards an area I have not seen discussed in this thread, albeit I have only read some 500 pages.
