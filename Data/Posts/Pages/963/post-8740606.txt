I may be acting like a pessimist right now but, after 5 years and nearly 1000 pages, does anyone else feel like we've exhausted most of our possibilities for another lead? Don't get me wrong it probably has something to with greek mythology but it seems the same few passages get repeated and someone says "we're onto something" and nothing happens. It may be the nostalgia blinding me to what happened in the past but it seems this has become far more frequent.
