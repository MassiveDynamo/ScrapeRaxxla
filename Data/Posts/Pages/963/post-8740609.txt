I think this is the 2nd thread so nearly 2000 pages

A lot of things happen in religion after 2000 years, until it happens and they dont, maybe we founded a religion and can all get taxes back.

But yes, its just fun, a lot of new players come across it for the first time and make the same links, but its still fun and who knows? Maybe they will see something nobody else did? But yeah, a break now and again is only healthy.
