Took some advice onboard...How's this, then?

Yeah, that's looking cool!

If you're going to add the astrological symbols, the ones up the right side should really continue to go anti-clockwise, from Libra to Pisces and personally I'd spread them equidistantly and layer them under the text in a slightly more visible combination of greens, like the (albeit putrid) FDev paintjob selection.

To be really pedantic* I'd rotate the whole ring so ~2 degrees Aquarius is on the Ascendant in 2296 AD.

[*For a sample of what I mean by pedantic there's a handful of work in progress images at six6vi.org]
