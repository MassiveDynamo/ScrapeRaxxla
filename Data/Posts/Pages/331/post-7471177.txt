OMG! When you said One-Way you meant One-way! I didn't realize it was that bad! Thanks for checking Commander! Your sacrifice has eliminated an interesting system.

So the only way we have any exploration data on it at all is because you used to be able to double-neutron jump out?

EDSM doesn't care what happens to your ship after you've scanned a system and the data have been sent to EDSM. If you however want your tag on it, you need to get back and sell it. And that was only possible using the now removed double-boost.
