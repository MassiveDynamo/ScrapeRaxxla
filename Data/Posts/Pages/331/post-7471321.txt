‘With eyes to see’ is Sir Philip Sidney’s sonnet-sequence in Astrophil and Stella an allegory of Homeric Odysseus?

"Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich": Sir Philip Sidney's "Astrophil and Stella" as a Prototype for the Rewriting of the Odysseus Myth in "Ulysses"

Stephen Dedalus compares, “Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich” drawing a correspondance between “poor” Penelope, of the Homeric Odysseus (“ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP”—U 7.1034), and Penelope Rich, the Elizabethan gentlewoman who inspired Sir Philip Sidney’s sonnet-sequence Astrophil and Stella.

The thirty-seventh sonnet of this collection repetitively foregrounds the word “rich” in describing the unattainable Stella, who is adored by Sidney’s persona Astrophil.

In an analogy to the Homeric myth, the 108 sonnets of the collection correspond to the number of Penelope’s suitors, which means that every single sonnet may be considered as a failed assault on her constancy. Whereas the historical Penelope Rich yielded to extramarital love, Stella resists Sidney’s lyrical “I,” Astrophil, who repeats his call for adultery 108 times, and remains faithful to her “Odyssean” spouse Robert Rich.

Sidney’s collection of 108 sonnets contributes to the intertextual framework of Ulysses.

There are 108 suitors: 52 from Dulichium, 24 from Same, 20 Achaeans from Zacynthus, and 12 from Ithaca.



This is how far I’ve reached with this particular train of thought, I have tried every suitors name in the ED gal map and nothing interesting seems to spring forth...

I dig it.
I also drew a connection from the sonnets to Penelope and Odysseus.
Odysseus found the famed Atlantis, the island of Ogygia, with the Siren Calypso, daughter of Atlas.
The island he landed on after escaping Ogygia was Scheria and the Queen of that island was Arete.
Arete, is the Queen of Virtue. Queen Virtue is featured in the opening line of Sonnet 9.
"Queen Vertues court, some call Stellas face,"

Arete is also the name of King Alcinous' wife

"In the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, Alcinous is represented as living with his wife Arete in Drepane."
