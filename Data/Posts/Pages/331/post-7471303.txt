‘With eyes to see’ is Sir Philip Sidney’s sonnet-sequence in Astrophil and Stella an allegory of Homeric Odysseus?

I'd always wondered if 'maybe' Cmdrs were reading too much into Philip Sydney's text, looking for a literal road map from the romantic imagery. So I started looking for a literary analysis of the poem - connected to Greek myth.

"Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich":
Sir Philip Sidney's "Astrophil and Stella" as a Prototype for the Rewriting of the Odysseus Myth in "Ulysses" - Dieter Fuchs, James Joyce Quarterly Vol. 48, No. 2 (Winter 2011), pp. 350-356

'Stephen Dedalus compares, “Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich” drawing a correspondance between “poor” Penelope, of the Homeric Odysseus (“ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP”—U 7.1034), and Penelope Rich, the Elizabethan gentlewoman who inspired Sir Philip Sidney’s sonnet-sequence Astrophil and Stella.'

'The thirty-seventh sonnet of this collection repetitively foregrounds the word “rich” in describing the unattainable Stella, who is adored by Sidney’s persona Astrophil.'

'In an analogy to the Homeric myth, the 108 sonnets of the collection correspond to the number of Penelope’s suitors, which means that every single sonnet may be considered as a failed assault on her constancy. Whereas the historical Penelope Rich yielded to extramarital love, Stella resists Sidney’s lyrical “I,” Astrophil, who repeats his call for adultery 108 times, and remains faithful to her “Odyssean” spouse Robert Rich.'

'Sidney’s collection of 108 sonnets contributes to the intertextual framework of Ulysses.'

'There are 108 suitors: 52 from Dulichium, 24 from Same, 20 Achaeans from Zacynthus, and 12 from Ithaca.'

'Interestingly, the 11 songs in the sonnet sequence and the stanzas of these songs total one hundred and eight, the number of Penelope's suitors in Homer's epic The Odyssey.'

This is how far I’ve reached with this particular train of thought, I have tried every suitors name in the ED gal map and nothing interesting seems to spring forth...

I don't believe we ought to dive too much down the rabbit hole but I've always had some suspicions the Odyssey is in some form connected.

The Odyssey also acts as an historical record of astronomy from the 8th century and a large number of authors have drawn different astronomical aspects from the Iliad and the Odyssey:

Tis only a hunch...
