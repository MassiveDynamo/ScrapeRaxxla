Probably just tinfoilery: From a hermetic perspective the personal journey one can only undertake alone would be travelling into the microcosm or rather ones self. The Alchemists shortcut for producing the philosophers stone was VITRIOL (at least that's something I've read ages ago). Meaning: Venere Interiorae Terrae Rechtificando Inertiae Occultum Lapidem. I don't know if that produces any sense but perhaps some kind of "inward" travel is necessary.

Um. Any hollowearthers here? [big grin]
