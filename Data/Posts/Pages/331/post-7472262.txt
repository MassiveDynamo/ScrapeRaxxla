Go read the first page where all the facts are clearly stated - then welcome to the hunt

Apologies - I assumed the OP was as old as the date (2015), glad to see that it is being kept current!

One reason for my recent interest is because I've been thoroughly exploring a very "intriguing" region of space for many months now, and I sometimes wonder if there is a "wonder" to be found here. You'll forgive me if I keep my location secret for now, but if I ever do find Raaxla, I'll happily share its location!

BTW, the planet will be actually called Raxxla, right?
