So whether or not you go with Cora or not, so to speak.. the mars relic is definitely in there among the 'gosh-that's odd' list of ED mysteries. And humankind's space exploration and terraforming abilities suddenly take off after its found.

There is a large paragraph in a small codex entry dedicated to Cora and Art, so there has to be more to it than the date 2296...

I'd be up for a rummage, though I'm far away at the moment. One thing , though , it goes against the 'R was in from the beginning' statement as it would need Horizons.

Great work connecting those two! Let the sub-quest begin o7
