my thoughts on the Oddyssey and it's fits to the toast:

Whisperer in witch-space: The witch Circe? <tenuous>
Sirens of the deepest void: Sirens, and trip to hades.
Parents Grief: Odysseus mother, Anticlea, dies of grief
Lovers Woe: Penelope and the suitors
Yearning of our vagabond hearts: Odysseus disguised as a beggar

Non-fits:

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies.

Odyssey Places:

Place In game? Comments
Ithaca Y
Troy N
Ogygia (calypso) N calypso is a moon of saturn
Pylos N home of the Phaeceans - Facece?
Sparta N faction "spartan order",Luvalla
Mt Olympus N olympus trading corp, BD-05 2778 player faction
* Mars home of the federation, of cours
Scheria N
Ismarus (Cicones) N
(Lotus Eaters) N (no name of place given by Homer?)
(Cyclops) N "
Aeolus Y
Laestrygonia N
Aeaea(Circe) N Circe is in game
Hades N not directly but there are similar place names
(Sirens) N (no name of place given by Homer?)
Scylla & Charybdis N Charybdis is the name of a ship dock in system 'Carthage'
Thrinacia N

So few of the places named in Homers odyssey are in game systems that reproducing Odysseus' path would be hard, which is a shame as it seemed a good match to much of the Toast, and fits the 'personal journey' comment.
