Raaxla noob here, questions follow:

1) Raaxla is in the game, yes?
2) Assuming #1, have developers indicated that Raaxla is actually in a location than can be deduced via detective work and not just located in some RNG system out in the galaxy?
3) Related to #2, how were sites like the ghost ship in Formidine Rift first found - were there "clues" that led to their discovery?

This thread intrigues me, but I don't want to get too invested if it's all just for naught.
