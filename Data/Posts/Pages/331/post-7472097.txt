Just to rule this out, I flew an Eagle from ShinDez to Delphi and docked at The Oracle.
Nothing happened.
2A fuel scoop sucks.

In the original 'Dark Wheel' story, selling a specific good at a station was what attracted attention.

Can't hurt to bring some random stuff and sell it at The Oracle.
Maybe waters of Shintara, Lavian brandy, grain, other goods.


I'm pretty sure The Oracle is a station that was added since 2004, so it can't have been part of the original Raxxla plan.
I'm wondering if the Dark Wheel station was recently added to the galaxy along with a quest line.
Nobody has mentioned them having a station before now, right?

The original story had Alex Ryder selling "Shanaskilk fur" (doesn't exist in ED) from the planet Xezoar (also doesn't exist in ED).
The only planet in ED that exists with the same name in the story is Lave.
