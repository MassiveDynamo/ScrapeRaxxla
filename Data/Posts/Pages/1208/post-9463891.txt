Havnt found one of these in a long time, two systems beside eachother, same name, same catalog name for both HD and HIP, Same main star except one has two other companions HD 127733
A common problem. Creation data for them fed into stellar forge sourced from different star catalogues with slightly different positions. FD seem to have been a little lapse in their data quality control.
