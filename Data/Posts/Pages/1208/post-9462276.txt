Jepp, it was a small station. Two actually. One in Polaris and one in Miackce. They were persistent objects, in the two systems. That could be lacy programing and that they were actually were ment to be one carrier ship, that jumped between systems?
Yeah true my belief was they where meant to be one station, or adleast some form of shuttle went from one to the other, they have changed and rewrote so much who knows anyways lol
