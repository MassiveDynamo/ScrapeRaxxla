Technically the Romans are still around, they live in Rome to this day obviously meant the Roman Empire which morphed into the Holy Roman Empire and then the Catholic Church so they are kind of still around and still kind of run a lot of Europe but nowhere near as powerful as they used to be.....but yes I was a bit confused by that guys cat (2 failed attempts at spelling given up) reference too.
