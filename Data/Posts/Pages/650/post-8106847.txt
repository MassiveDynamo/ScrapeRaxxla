Of course the Club and AEGIS is behind the blight. They are just testing new anti-thargoid agents and antidotes.

It's for our own good. Go back to sleep.

Unless it annoys the Caretakers. They might think that we never will be able to transcend our violent nature.

Putting Guardian objects in the Thargoid device is fun.

Looking at guardian history i think they were 5th column introduced to the transformative tech which eventually led to the divisions and downfall of the civilization... i see similar tech and a division in thargoids... did the same thing happen to them? I suspect we are also being introduced to these technologies by humans who have been co-opted into this techno-dream. What if raxxla is some external bio-technolgical entity that when it encounters another civilization it slowly changes it and destroys it leaving only the parts that will fit into its galactic machinations... muhahahhaah
