Notice how the shadow looks compared to the image I compared it to?

It may make YOU think you look smart when you correct everyone on what they say, everyone else's opinion may vary. Or at least attempt to not be so condescending. That's why your reaction score is so low compared to your posts.

I can't tell if you are being funny, also, I stated things plainly, not sure what's condescending about that, also also, that proyection is not the one presented (it has 8 vertices), also also also, that the tesseract has 8 vertices or otherwise is not an opinion.
