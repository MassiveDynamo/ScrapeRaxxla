A tesseract has 16 vertices, the image of the catoptric pistula has 7 visible ones (the 8th one is overlaping).
I was being funny. Thanks for spoiling it. BTW if you Google a tesseract

It may make YOU think you look smart when you correct everyone on what they say, everyone else's opinion may vary. Or at least attempt to not be so condescending. That's why your reaction score is so low compared to your posts.
