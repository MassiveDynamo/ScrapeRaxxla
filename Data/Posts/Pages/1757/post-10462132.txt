Checking the system I'm currently in for near-star A-belts, there's:
- one with six clusters and 0.0 moons
- one with three clusters and 0.9 moons
So 1.8 moons might be on the heavier side but probably not unusually so.

I assume a lot of the asteroid belt mass is in non-cluster rocks which are just floating individually in space and can't be dropped in on.

Actually since we don't have any real data to go on for asteroid belts yet, according to our single example, the sol systems, 1.8 moons is pretty big, our asteroid belt is only a few percent of moon mass, most of it in just a few largish rocks.
