Polaris has always been a logical candidate but FD has confirmed its locked and there is no in-game permit for it active, if it’s related then this advocates that its narratively gated.

If linked to the Raxxla quest, it logically means there’s no quest at all, and is at the decision of FD to action!

If it’s just below it or close by, that does give a window of optimism, but I would speculate it is still too far removed from any other discoveries to indicate it’s unreliable, if not it could indicate we’re simply missing something and cannot draw a correlation.

One such possibility might be some theory linked to Dante’s Comedy. Personally I think if it were linked, it’s too close to the narrative gate concept, to be ruled out. If it’s narrative then there’s no point to any of this.
