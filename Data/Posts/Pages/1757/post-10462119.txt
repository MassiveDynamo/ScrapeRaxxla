All good questions.

If you could fly fast enough in normal space, you could get to the belt. Tried it in one other belt cluster after dropping to normal space just before the drop point.
It occurred to me that I've flown with orbit lines off, so I'm not sure that belt clusters are shown with orbit lines.
Not sure how one could map the orbit of a belt cluster, other than 3-4 very patient CMDR's strategically placed, measuring distances or the full orbit.
I checked my orbit lines were on... didn't see any...

I've tried flying closer to objects when hitting the exclusions zones before and you just buffet against it... same experience boosting towards the cluster.... speed goes up and time goes down slightly... speed drops and you are back to the same time.... it looks like your still travelling towards it but you aren't....

and belts don't appear on the orrery view from what I can see...
