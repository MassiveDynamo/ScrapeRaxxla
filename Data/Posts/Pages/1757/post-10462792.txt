I think its that too . Its why ive been calling these things palimpsests ( when i can remember to spell the word correctly)…. The idea being that there are several paths to reach the same goal. The thought is that there is an overlaying of several mythologies which end up pointing to a common construct(s?)… i dont believe there is “one path” - but there do appear to be groupings of themes.
