All good questions.

If you could fly fast enough in normal space, you could get to the belt. Tried it in one other belt cluster after dropping to normal space just before the drop point.
It occurred to me that I've flown with orbit lines off, so I'm not sure that belt clusters are shown with orbit lines.
Not sure how one could map the orbit of a belt cluster, other than 3-4 very patient CMDR's strategically placed, measuring distances of the full orbit.
