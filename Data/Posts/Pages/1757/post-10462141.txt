Actually since we don't have any real data to go on for asteroid belts yet, according to our single example, the sol systems, 1.8 moons is pretty big, our asteroid belt is only a few percent of moon mass, most of it in just a few largish rocks.
Yes. A belt created by some early-system collision between two proto-planets could potentially be a lot heavier, though.
(Obviously not what made an inner cluster around a white dwarf, but those have been observed to have accumulated ring systems, which could be heavy)
