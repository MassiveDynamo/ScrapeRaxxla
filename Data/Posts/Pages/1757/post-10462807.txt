Where does the game end and the quest begin?

Is Raxxla the game for us, and the game simply itâ€™s housing?

I honestly hardly play ED anymore. But I do play Raxxla, more or less all the time.

I know the feeling! I still play the game on weekends (or maybe a late night after work) for a bit to test out theories - but ya its an addictive puzzle and has definitely made changes in my reading habits that I wouldn't have expected. Got me reading some things that were on the "to do someday list" and others i knew nothing about.
