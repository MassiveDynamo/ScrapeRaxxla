Polaris has always been a logical candidate but FD has confirmed it locked and there is no in game permit for it active, if it’s related then this advocates that its narratively gated.

If linked to the Raxxla quest, it logically means there’s no quest at all, and is at the decision of FD to action!

If it’s just below it or close by, that I could buy, but it is so far removed from any other discoveries to indicate it’s an unreliable candidate m, whoever it equally could indicate we’re simply missing something and cannot draw a correlation.

One such possibility would be some theory linked to Dante’s Comedy. Personally I think if it were linked, it’s too close to the narrative gate concept, to be ruled out. If it’s narrative then there’s no point to any of this.

I suspect Polaris is locked because it was so important to previous versions of Elite. To reinforce that ED is different and previous lore may not apply.

I understand the general interest in mythologies in this thread; MB ceetainly put a lot into the game design. However I'm suspicious over the assumption that the puzzle is fundamentally based on it. There's a danger that we get lost in the myth. I suspect the Road to Raxxla may be more like an old Bob Hope film...that it's a joke, an Easter egg, and that we're drastically overcomplicating it. WHY did an FD spokesperson say they were surprised we hadnt found it yet? (source required!!). That statement implies the solution should fairly obvious, and/or we have sufficient clues to find it. The mythology may be just for obfuscation, for a source of system naming ideas to bring the game to life, to embody concepts that MB personally liked.
