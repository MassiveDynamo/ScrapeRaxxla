Well I approached it with the star was behind it and the exclusion zone is .24Ls from the cluster and once you drop in to normal space you ain't getting any closer because of the exclusion zone by any means I know...

Is there anything that shows the orbit for clusters to see if it will ever get far enough away?

And I love the activities... how are they doing that?

Is 1,8 Moons a normal Mass for a cluster? it seems a bit heavy to me. I have no idea in what range Clusters normaly are but for 3-5 rocks 1,8 moons seems really heavy.
