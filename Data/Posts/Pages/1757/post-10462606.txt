Was MB a Freemason??

I don't think its about whether anyone is a freemason or not - honestly if you want some “ancient secret society” that has lasted down the years that has fairly well known rites and beliefs… who else would there be? it does help to explain the actions of Sirius Corp though … and maybe the “club”.
