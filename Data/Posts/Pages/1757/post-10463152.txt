Where does the game end and the quest begin?

Is Raxxla the game for us, and the game simply itâ€™s housing?

I honestly hardly play ED anymore. But I do play Raxxla, more or less all the time.
Same for me... it's a couple of months since I played ED, and then the only thing that interests me is Raxxla. Once you've got your first billion trading, elite rank killing NPC (mainly thargoids), and reached Beagle's Point and returned then what...The Thargoid war doesn't interest me intellectually & my arthritic/tendonitic hands wont allow much game combat, but Raxxla is a good puzzle (actually a bit too good!!).

I may return shortly after the new update. I have some TOHF to test and a new hypothesis or two to explore. Might get a Mandalay and do some long range trip... I've enjoyed the diversion into Starfield for the detailed missions and dialogue, but repeating it with a second character and getting the same dialogue is a bit boring....the kitchen refurb is almost finished, but my hands are giving me gyp so taking a few days off.

Is there a way to get the download benefit of my 1Gbps internet speed? The last update just trickled in at around 10 Mbps for over an hour. I gather Steam can support fast download, but my ED is from FD.
