I just realized that I haven't played Raxxla for quite some time.
As the search must go on, I would share an idea for people who play Raxxla:

The jewel might be the tiny blue dot that you can see when you're high "on the brow" above the bubble.
You can see it when you're in Shinrarta Dezhra and target Polaris, the blue dot is right next to Polaris then.
"To the jewel" might indicate a jump or even journey in that direction.
Vector measured to approx. Sol -> PLAA EURK UR-B C1-0 (-1576.65625 +734.5625 -1017.25)
A good match for the vector would be a jump from BD-10 4011 to Eulexia.
