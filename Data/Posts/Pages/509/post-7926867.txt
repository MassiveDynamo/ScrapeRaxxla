Mmmmhh.. That proper team thing may be important, yes. I admitt. I just didn't re-read the "proper" text. Thx @Thatchinho for clarifying it.
I mean, it's not exactly like saying " he was setting up a long range ship" like in Romero's affair.
Now, be it one way or the other, did FD take account of that particular sentence in RH's novel and work it in game ? Imho, we shouldn't give it too much of importance.
Now.. a proper team of.. whatever is a seducing possible clue. I just like it ! I hope FD liked it too. A player's Wing/Squadron/Carrier assaulting/digging out the Portal on Raxxla..Wow !
Anyway, as nobody here knows what he is doing, the (by any mean new nor mine) theory of the Dark Worlds is as valid as any other. Imho.

Deep space could be ANYTHING. Any area of space that ios not close to an object and not in a shipping lane in deep space.
Yes, of course. Strictly speaking. But in ED, people are used, I think, to use that term when describing space "out of The Bubble". It's at least the interpretation I did since I use the Forum. But you are right, the only point is what's RH and FD interpretation is.
I may have been wrong all te time.
