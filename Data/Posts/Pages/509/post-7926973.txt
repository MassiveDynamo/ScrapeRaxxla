Mmmmhh.. That proper team thing may be important, yes. I admitt. I just didn't re-read the "proper" text. Thx @Thatchinho for clarifying it.
I mean, it's not exactly like saying " he was setting up a long range ship" like in Romero's affair.

Maybe. I've always used "out in the black". But I play in solo with no wing, squadron, etc, so meh, what would I know?
