That permit lock mechanics is quite unclear in the hypothetic case of TDW...
Permits supposedly are granted/managed by the PF. What would that mean in the case of the station/moon being permit locked ? PF = TDW ?
This would imply a huge revelation and rearrangement of the current lore. But why not ?
