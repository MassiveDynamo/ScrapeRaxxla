I would say you would hide things you want to be found in Nebulaes. Something that you dont want to be found, on the other hand....
Pretty sure Lord Braben mentioned nebulae might be good places to find things but that was ages ago, maybe even in the dev diaries, and long before the goids were found in the Pleiades, bark mounds pumpkins in the California nebula, or Guardian sites. It may have been pre-Horizons it was that long ago.
