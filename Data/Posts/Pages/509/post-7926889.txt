I don't mean to be awkward, but I don't quite understand what part of what @Scytale said, we cant quite say? Could you clarify?
Non-scoopables aren't explored as thoroughly as other systems - I feel thats a fairly safe assumption. They are normally populated with a few boring ice worlds.
Long trek through non-scoopables would be good obfuscation - I don't see how you could disagree with that?
Jason returned to prepare for an expedition to Raxxla. That is the same thing, in different words, as "to get a proper team together" isnt it?
No awkwardness at all, I assure you!

It was all about the Jason stuff. The point was that Jason returning to prepare an expedition isn’t strictly what the TDW novella says he was doing.

It says he had found evidence for the real existence of Raxxla. That’s not the same as finding the location. It also says he had returned to put a proper team together. That’s not the same as an expedition.

Point being that while what @Scytale said is a valid interpretation of what’s said in TDW, there are also many other valid interpretations.

What I don’t think we can say is that because an interpretation is valid, that it is the interpretation.

That all make sense of what I meant?

(There was a load of what I had thought to be deleted stuff which posted at the start of the post to Scytale by accident and I didn’t realise was there until a little after. I’ve removed all that, so hopefully the previous reply is clearer now.)
