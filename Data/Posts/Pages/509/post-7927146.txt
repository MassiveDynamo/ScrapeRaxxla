I wonder what evidence Jason could have found, if it wasn't Raxxla itself?
A map?
Intercepted a transmission from somebody? This seems quite plausible, if they worked out who had intercepted a transmission and sent an assassin to silence them?
A picture?
A tip off, from "a friend" or "mysterious stranger"? Would this warrant going to put a team together though?
Something else?
This is an important question. Maybe the evidence still exists.
It’s a good question and an interesting topic.

It also links back to something I think (but am not 100% sure) I’ve mentioned before - there’s a bit of a general assumption that goes round that the 2296 Raxxla reference puts an upper limit on the date of the discovery of Raxxla, but that’s not necessarily the case.

Someone might have merely discovered something which suggested to them the existence of a world with an alien artefact.

In fact it might not even have been something tangible, they might have had a vision a la Halsey and Gan Romero.

Both of those ‘origins’ would be completely consistent with, and actually fully explanatory of, the tone with which Art Tonqvist talks about Raxxla.

Anyway, back to the point in hand, Jason had returned from deep space, so we can probably rule a few things out on that basis. As a general starting point, I think we can identify a few high level categories for what form the evidence must have been. It has to have been:

A. Something human in origin

B. Something alien in origin

C. Something stellar/astronomical which isn’t a natural occurrence and is well beyond known human and alien technological capabilities. (When I say stellar/astronomical, it don’t mean that in completely strict sense, it could be planetary or planet based too.)

There could also be combinations of the above.

Anything else at high level that anyone can think of that isn’t covered by those 3 categories?
