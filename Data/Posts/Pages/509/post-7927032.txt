I have fallen back to my belief that Frontier Development and The 'real' Dark wheel would not leave the station discoverable by accident.
Not by accident. But FD gives a huge clue by telling us that " 8th moon thing". Does their many times proven lack of sensibility allow them to get hundreds of players surveying 8th moons for.. nothing ? Hard to believe, but possible, yes.
That's why I think that station is very hard to find. But findable. Which doesn't mean you'll be therefore automatically invited to have a drink with the station master and promoted to be "one of ours". As I already said, instantaneous vaporization must be the gracious reward... Then, a new chapter in the story line could unfold with the station being replaced elsewhere. For example.
Incidentally, being invited by TDW shouldn't automatically grant the player with access to that station. That would mean to grant acces to the entire community. At its vicinity, at least.
