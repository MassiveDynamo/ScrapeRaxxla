I have fallen back to my belief that Frontier Development and The 'real' Dark wheel would not leave the station discoverable by accident. The statement that 'one does not contact the Dark Wheel ' for me holds true. These guys have a finger in a lot of pies and a lot to lose if they were left open to discovery 'willy nilly' by some muppet flying 'Crazy Craft' high on Onionhead.
So, for now, I am back working. For the corporations, I feel are integral and part of the bigger picture. Started at Sol and now at Soch working for the wonderful chaps in Aegis.
I am also interested to find out that to rep with these corporations one cannot just waltz in with a shedload of discovery data as some branches such as Aegis Core got ousted from their HQ's. Some of this made news. I am sure FD doesn't want the 'Dark Wheel Permit' earned so easily.
Also, I am loving the History and backstory in all this. It is really fleshing out the elite Universe better than before and I am more than certain there is a lot of hidden stuff if you know what to read and where to stuff your nose.
