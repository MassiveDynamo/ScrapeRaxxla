I don't mean to be awkward, but I don't quite understand what part of what @Scytale said, we cant quite say? Could you clarify?
Non-scoopables aren't explored as thoroughly as other systems - I feel thats a fairly safe assumption. They are normally populated with a few boring ice worlds.
Long trek through non-scoopables would be good obfuscation - I don't see how you could disagree with that?
Jason returned to prepare for an expedition to Raxxla. That is the same thing, in different words, as "to get a proper team together" isnt it?
Some of us have a 'touch it once' OCD that dictates the entire system MUST be scanned before leaving, which is why it took me so long to get down to the Witch Head despite having mapped most of the journey. It's a bit quicker if all objects show 'mapped by' someone but if any aren't, I'll still do the entire system.

This is why I use the high security filter inside the bubble. Saves so much time...
