I wonder what evidence Jason could have found, if it wasn't Raxxla itself?
A map?
Intercepted a transmission from somebody? This seems quite plausible, if they worked out who had intercepted a transmission and sent an assassin to silence them?
A picture?
A tip off, from "a friend" or "mysterious stranger"? Would this warrant going to put a team together though?
Something else?
This is an important question. Maybe the evidence still exists.
