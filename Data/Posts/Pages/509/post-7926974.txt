No awkwardness at all, I assure you!

It was all about the Jason stuff. The point was that Jason returning to prepare an expedition isn’t strictly what the TDW novella says he was doing.

It says he had found evidence for the real existence of Raxxla. That’s not the same as finding the location. It also says he had returned to put a proper team together. That’s not the same as an expedition.

Point being that while what @Scytale said is a valid interpretation of what’s said in TDW, there are also manny other valid interpretations.

What I don’t think we can say is that because an interpretation is valid, that it is interpretation.

That all make sense of what I meant?

(There was a load of what I had thought to be deleted stuff which posted at the start of the post to Scytale by accident and I didn’t realise was there until a little after. I’ve removed all that, so hopefully the previous reply is clearer now.)

Thanks for clarifying. I 100% agree its not the only interpretation.
