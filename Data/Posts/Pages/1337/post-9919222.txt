Yep those psr j0024 are in a cluster, unfortunately on playstation the curser jumps and you cant select them as it passes.
while you are on it may ask to get a Tp to WREDGUIA WT-I D9-11 and make sure to rec.
WREGOE YK-P E5-83 would also be worth a shot. what does it say for Playstation Players (PC its BINARYLIGHTTEST B did not found A yet )
