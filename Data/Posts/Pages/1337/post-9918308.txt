I'm going to have to go through the logs again and probably will be following 'Rebecca's' journey to personally grab those logs.

I'm beginning to feel that it's part of the 'quest chain' and needs to be completed to get the next part to spawn.

I'm just not sure what the actual 'hook' to this was.
