I'm going to have to go through the logs again and probably will be following 'Rebecca's' journey to personally grab those logs.

I'm beginning to feel that it's part of the 'quest chain' and needs to be completed to get the next part to spawn.

I'm just not sure what the actual 'hook' to this was.
Yes, do read Drew Wagars two Elite books then do your research. But be aware Drew said several times that he knew nothing about Raxxla and that was a matter reserved by FD for themselves. The writers were told to stay off that topic. The only thing he knew about it was what DB said to him and he reported- “that it is in game” . You might want to check out my FD quotes thread-see my signature.

Also be aware that there are some minor discrepancies between those two books and the game. From my notes:
