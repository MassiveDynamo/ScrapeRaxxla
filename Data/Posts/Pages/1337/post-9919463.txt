I'm wondering if the Dark Wheel is the term they use as a Fortune of a different aspect so I'm looking into the reasoning of this. If maybe their is a purpose as everything involves a Wheel of sorts of all each term of a Wheel is connected with each other.

The reason I ran into this whole thing is due to the commodity description of Trinkets of Hidden Fortune.

This container appears to hold an assorted collection of low-value trinkets, knick-knacks and statuettes. Such trinkets are generally used by superstitious pilots to try and win favour with the lady Fortuna. However, these particular knick-knacks have a much more valuable prize hidden within.

This is how I ran into the reasoning of Fortuna.
