That makes more sense in terms of factions
In regards to anarchy systems, as you’ve correctly identified ‘Factions’ are actually what I was considering, as you’ve correctly identified these states have eroded over time, but the factions are still there, this erosion is not intentional from FDs perspective IMOP, as the BGS was never really intended for player manipulation, so it’s possible the player base has themselves obfuscated a key clue, that is if the Codex is alluding to anarchy systems = pirates stash.

Still no nearer allotting time to plot these, will get around to it eventually, RL getting in the way.
