"They emerged from hyperspace into the gloom. Normally dark systems held failed stars, or were sad collections of celestial leftovers, comets, asteroids, planetoids, a useful waypoint between systems and nothing more. But this dark system was different. It wasn’t dark. A brown dwarf glowed two astronomical units away, a pale purple blob so faint Robert didn’t see it at first. There were rocks of all shapes and sizes in the intervening space, but it wasn’t an asteroid belt. It was as if a giant hand had shaken out a fist full of space rock and left them where they lay. No pattern to their movement, an obstacle course of junk. Then there was the fog. Robert didn’t know how else to describe it. He’d never heard of space fog, but there it was, an elongated cloud, like a giant comet’s tail, deep inside the maze of rock. The fog was barely transparent. He could make out the shadow of a shape within, perhaps a planet, but he couldn’t be sure."

Fog... Soontill is a Stargoid
