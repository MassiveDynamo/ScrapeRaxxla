Just that with larger M-class, any F-class, any G-class, or any K-class stars the planets have to be much further from the star to reach the ideal temperature. Elite Dangerous actually does a fairly solid job on modeling temperatures vs distance to the stars (or brown dwarfs) in the system. Basically, if the chemical your species depends on for bio-chemistry is only stable at cold temps you would need a planet very far from hotter stars. All of those with the exception of some M-class get hotter (and sometimes much hotter) than Sol's surface temperature.

According to this thread though, it's Class F stars that you want to be looking for if you're trying to find ammonia worlds, and all three stars in Polaris (Aa, Ab, and B) are Class F. Granted, it being a multiple system makes the habitable zone a bit complicated, but based on that thread it certainly doesn't seem like Polaris would be ruled out per se.

I'm also a little lost on what it is you're ruling out by pointing out the temperature. If Polaris is somehow unfriendly to ammonia worlds, then yes, maybe that does rule out the possibility of Polaris being the Thargoid homeworld (or what-have-you). But isn't that only one of the theories of what Raxxla is? And one of the theoretical locations of what Raxxla is? Trying to get up to speed with Raxxla theory crafting is quite difficult - most of what I've been able to dredge up online is 3+ years old! - so you may be working with some obvious facts or assumptions here that I'm just not up to speed on.
