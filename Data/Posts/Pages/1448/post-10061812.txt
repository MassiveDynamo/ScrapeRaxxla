Soontill:
-Not landable (9,081,479.88 Atmospheres and 8,256 K surface temperature).
-System contains Technetium which is only produced by S-process nucleofusion (asymptote giant branch stars) linked to Guardians.
-System is entirely too hot for Thargoids (must be between -107.9째F/-77.73째C/195.42 K to -28.01째F/-33.34째C/239.81 K) - this is between the freezing and boiling points of ammonia.

Hasn't there been questions over the years about whether Soontil in game is the real one? Doesn't the system bear no resemblance to the original description?

I do have the feeling it was confirmed by FD it was the right one though...
