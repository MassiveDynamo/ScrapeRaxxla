That said, Thargoids seem to have natural ability to manipulate access to Witchspace/hyperspace and so wouldn't really need special technology. As the lore stands at present, it looks like Raxxlans were the Guardians or something else entirely. I say this as Polaris and Soontill systems would be far too warm for Thargoids as ammonia boils at -28.01°F/-33.34°C.

I still feel that the Stargoids represent a bit of a propulsion oddity, though. While sure, our ships can travel faster than light as well, the Stargoids were able to cross vast interstellar distances in a matter of weeks, far beyond what our FSD technology is capable of. That is unusual, because as you point out, we know the Thargoids normally rely on Witchspace for their interstellar travel, just like we do. It could be that for some as yet unknown reason, FSD style propulsion just doesn't work for the kind of vessel/object that's at the center of those maelstroms, but it still represents something that's outside the scope of the tech that we have, and that we understand the Thargoids to have. That's what I was latching onto - the fact that FTL is specifically called out as a subject of interest/focus for the Oisir-Raxxlans, and the Stargoids seem to represent something new/special in that regard.

I'm afraid you've lost me bringing up the boiling point of ammonia, though. Is there something algorithmically in the way Elite Dangerous generates planets that would prevent an ammonium world from forming around a star like Polaris? Admittedly it's been over a decade since university so my astrophysics is a little rusty, but around a hotter star an ammonium world would just need to be further away, no?
