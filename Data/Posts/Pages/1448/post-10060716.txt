I'll do a better explanation when I have some time. Some of this is less Raxxla theorycrafting and more looking at what we have been told vs what seems to be the case. Also, I am a bit of an odd one in Raxxla realm as I tend to deal lots with odd parts of the lore so keep that in mind because I can use small details to get fairly robust conclusions. Just know, what I may say may not be the larger consensus.
