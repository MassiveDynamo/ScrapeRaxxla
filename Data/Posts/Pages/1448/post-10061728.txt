For the record: this is just an idea based on science and history (and is certainly not guaranteed to be correct). There is no wrong way until someone finds Raxxla or TDW or both. It very well could be based on misinterpretations of data (there is certainly enough weird leads for that to be the case). This doesn't really narrow down location though I can think of a number of places which are candidates. As always, everything is subject to revision with new data. We just need to keep hacking away at this thing from as many perspectives as possible until someone strikes something useful. I am well outside the Bubble at the moment and am doing bio-research to understand the known intelligent species better as well as scientific expedition to better understand key system types. Also, for the record, I didn't go into this with the intention of oveturning everything. That happened only because I had no idea where this would lead.

I do not want this to make people stop trying through whatever methods they choose. If you need help getting a more robust idea, ask. We all win if we work together irregardless of the differences in methods. Again, no one has any claim to rightness of an idea until they are holding some form of proof.
