Ok, so how do you get a warning? Bad language? Naming & shaming? Playing iCutter dodgems with Cmdr Braben’s Cobra?
(I assume file dipping warrants (at the very least) hanging, drawing & quartering!)

Clearly I’m just too much of a goody two shoes, as I’ve never had one.

P.S. another two void opal runs should get Tyko to Trade Elite; hopefully that will be tomorrow.
Pretty much anything if someone is reports it. And it isn't the opinion of A) the person reporting it, and B) the mod responding to the report.
