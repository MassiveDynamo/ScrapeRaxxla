Err.. They are the same. Pure evil, both !
Cmdr Scytale Tleilaxu killed uncountable poor refugee families fleeing in their T9s just to pillage their mats, vaporized thousands of NPC Cmdrs in CZs, who were fighting for their freedom, a better life for their families or simply to put some bread on the table, just to get ranked up. Filthy rich Cmdr Scytale Tleilaxu, aboard his unbeatable iCutter, burnt to ashes so many sympathetic Pirates flying small ships who were just asking for a ridiculously small share of his obscene wealth. He even interdicted the noble Salomé when she was going to reveal an evil conspiration to the World... (but she actually used one of her witch-tricks and fortunately managed to escape ! )
Scytale ?

Same thing, told ya !

Ok, so how do you get a warning? Bad language? Naming & shaming? Playing iCutter dodgems with Cmdr Braben’s Cobra?
(I assume file dipping warrants (at the very least) hanging, drawing & quartering!)

Clearly I’m just too much of a goody two shoes, as I’ve never had one.

P.S. another two void opal runs should get Tyko to Trade Elite; hopefully that will be tomorrow.
