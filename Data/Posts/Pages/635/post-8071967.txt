So is Neptune if I am not mistaken, but it could also be a "Lateral Ascention" from the right angle.

Let me adjust my tinfoil hat to the left and down abit.
Could be. I donâ€™t really think Left Ascension is a thing at all.
My explanation with the reverse rotation is absolutely not science. Just a tinfoil idea, to explain a funn word.
