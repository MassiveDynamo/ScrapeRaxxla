Pops open a browser to grab a screen shot of frontierstore.net

Well that's handy, nowhere to browse cosmetics outside the game...
There is an ingame screenshot button. I think it's F10 or something. Plus you could hit PrtScrn button. It may pop up a screen shot app. Not sure if windows has one or not.
