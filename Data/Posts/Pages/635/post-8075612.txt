OK for me this evening in the UK

Anyone got the 'practical' name plate pack? I notice there is a barcode on one of them along with a few symbols - can someone take a pic of the barcode plz?

Wot? Insufficient ARX to buy a set?
Will have a look later if I can get into game - patch #3 out today & servers down from 07:00 UTC.

Edit: patch seems to have cured my network problems, once I’d selected “ethernet3” as the vpn option.
Cant check name plate yet, not git that one fitted & currently out deep core mining.
