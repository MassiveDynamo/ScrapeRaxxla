I'm still pretty sure "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" is an allusion to The Dark Wheel novella.

There are several significant similarities, virtually word-for-word between the descriptions of Raxxla in TDW novella and the Raxxla Codex.

Specifically this section:
"Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed.
and this section:
"...then on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life..."
And we're told:
"...These details however, were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to the children's story Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars, and soon lost credibility. Undaunted, some Raxxla seekers insisted that the story's author had cunningly concealed facts about the mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to see."

This thread is evidence that Raxxla seekers insist that Robert Holdstock has cunningly concealed facts about Raxxla in his book(s) as hints for those with eyes to see.

The name of the book itself may be a clue, but I suspect Astrophel is an allusion to the Edmund Spencer poem, which is a tribute to Philip Sidney. Much as Raxxla in Elite is a tribute to Robert Holdstock.
