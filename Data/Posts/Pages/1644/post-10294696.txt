"On Good Friday ‘s eve I am assailed by three beasts in a wood black with sin, ahead I see a mountain, haloed with promised salvation. Through inferno’s circles Virgil’s wisdom leads me through punishments artfully poetic.

Up the mountain created by Satan’s fall we climb. On this holy day of Christ’s resurrection we pass through the terraces, one for each of the sins most deadly.

Finally into paradise I rise and greeted by Beatrice, my guide through the spheres of the cosmos. In the final sphere I understand God’s love, a love so complete that it moves the stars."

Drabble Classics - The Divine Comedy

Note this Drabble is based upon The Divine Comedy by Danta Alighieri.The mountain has seven terraces all ascribed to the Sins.

This model although highly detailed is not the same as the Miltonian model, they share many aspects but John Milton constructed his own version, and expanded it outwards; as to if Brookes saw such a division is an unknown.

But for him to draw attention to it is interesting and ought not be disregarded.
