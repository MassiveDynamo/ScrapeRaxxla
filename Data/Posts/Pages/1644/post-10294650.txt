That's fascinating! Exciting times

Any idea on how to get more of the signal? Or do you think this is all there is and the rest of the locational clues are elsewhere?
That's the big question. Assuming this is the clue we are supposed to find, I wonder if there is a similar signal but only detectable in closer proximity to the source.

The toast being related to Homer's Odyssey was already hypothesized here a while ago, but linking the Landscape Signal to Argo Navis makes it even more intriguing!
(and I say that as the one who threw water at the flames of the expedition on Canonn's Discord...)

One interesting property of those three constellations is that their stars' Bayer designations (i.e. their Greek letter prefixes) were retained even after the breakup; thus only Carina has Alpha and Beta, Vela has Gamma and so on.

Right off the bat I see an issue with the jewels on the brow, however: Gamma Velorum sits as the center of its namesake Regor Sector, from which the Guardian cone/arrow of influence extends, and has always been permit-locked.

Good point, I keep forgetting which ones are locked. I also forgot to include Upsilon Carinae, which is a known binary of two A I supergiants and it looks like it sits further out from Regor and deep into the Guardian bubble.

Perhaps im seeing things however doesnt this look like its pointing to Guardian on the sites left and Thargoid on the right with the permit zone center....I know your choice of colour is coincidental also
As you can see above the Argo Navis does cover across both significant alien regions, so I wonder if that is also part of it.
Edit: also keep in mind the pieces are not fixed, I can easily do this to find another combination over the ship itself. In this case it fits a little better with the sail and hull, so probably more correct to the theory
