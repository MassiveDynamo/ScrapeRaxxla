If what we are supposed to be looking for is actually something we ought to be ‘listening’ for. Then I still propose my work with the Lost Realms and Milton/Holdstock model might have relevance.

If the landscape signal is part of this, then I strongly believe the Codex is telling us to look at the Lost Realms area, maybe there’s locations there with a unique ‘audio’ signal?

Do Trinkets sing at certain locations? Do certain bodies emit unique audio with hidden data?

There are various locations in game which seem to have some relevance.

The Lost Realms zone - Holdstock Easter Egg

The Brookes Tour - the first leg points to the Lost Realm, and in particular a weird system of triad goddesses and a system named after Michael. Then it’s last (and first) points to Artemis.

The Brookes Drabbles - a select number (not all) are in game and some are in an odd triangular pattern which might align with the Norns and Fates!

The Dedicant and Adamastor - both are located on one particular side of the bubble… I think intentionally!

The Shamash system - again this system is very close to the Norns and Fates.

Siren and Tiamat - very suspicious and I feel the system Siren has some part to play as it does align with the Norns and Fates…

So far these are spacial patterns I’ve been able to identify, but their relationships are also contextual as well, linking into the wider aspects of the Epic of Gilgamesh and the wider works of Holdstock and Milton and my conception of system bodies named after mountains.

Ive never been able to establish a Lovecraft connection, but I’ve long suspected the stories about the Missing and the Thargod are essentially those, and acting as locals they may help fill in the gaps?
