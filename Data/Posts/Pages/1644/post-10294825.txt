Another 'Princess Astrophel' curiosity:
Going with my earlier connections with Henrietta Leavitt, she also discovered T Pyxidis, a recurrent nova in the constellation Pyxis, located above the stern of Argo Navis.
The problem is, even its alternate names in simbad don't show up in maps. Does it go by a unique name? or does it not exist as a system
