I'm still pretty sure "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" is an allusion to The Dark Wheel novella.

There are several significant similarities, virtually word-for-word between the descriptions of Raxxla in TDW novella and the Raxxla Codex.

Specifically this section:

and this section:

And we're told:


This thread is evidence that Raxxla seekers insist that Robert Holdstock has cunningly concealed facts about Raxxla in his book(s) as hints for those with eyes to see.

The name of the book itself be a clue, but I suspect is an allusion to the Edmund Spencer poem, which is a tribute to Philip Sidney. Much as Raxxla in Elite is a tribute to Robert Holdstock.

Edmund Spencer work was about Philip Sidney.

There is no feminine prefix for Astrophel (or Astrophil), it was invented by Sidney as an alias for himself in his own text.

It’s the one aspect I can’t get over in the Codex, it’s such a literal literary reference, I can’t understand it unless it’s either a play on word ‘female astrophil’ aka his Sister (Mary) or something else, or some reference to ‘female star lovers’.

Again, the references to a children’s story, ultimately makes me think of the Official ED novel ‘Legacy’ set in Artemis which does reflect upon someone who had a children’s story book and wanted to find Raxxla.

Artemis - location in book and game
Demeter - ship in the book
Selene - character in book aunt of Julia the character with a childhood story book.

Maybe it’s just reflecting upon the tried?
