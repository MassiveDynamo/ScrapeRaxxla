The toast being related to Homer's Odyssey was already hypothesized here a while ago, but linking the Landscape Signal to Argo Navis makes it even more intriguing!
(and I say that as the one who threw water at the flames of the expedition on Canonn's Discord...)

One interesting property of those three constellations is that their stars' Bayer designations (i.e. their Greek letter prefixes) were retained even after the breakup; thus only Carina has Alpha and Beta, Vela has Gamma and so on.

Right off the bat I see an issue with the jewels on the brow, however: Gamma Velorum sits as the center of its namesake Regor Sector, from which the Guardian cone/arrow of influence extends, and has always been permit-locked.

Looking at it further, the joint US/UK Nautical Almanac highlights 57 navigational stars: https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/Nav_Star_Chart
Four of them belong to the Argo Navis complex.
Canopus (Alpha Carinae) - A frequent destination for Federal rank grinding, as it gives plenty of courier missions to and from neighbouring Exphiay; many Corvettes got new homes thanks to it, including mine. One of the few systems permanently displayed in GalMap when close enough, and forms a remote Federal exclave with four other systems in the Synuefe region. Only two planets, to the disappointment of people looking for Arrakis (which should be the third one).
Miaplacidus (Beta Carinae) - Actually inside the bubble but devoid of planets, having only three stars.
Avior (Epsilon Carinae) - Two stars and two gas giants; either part of the Guardian area of influence or right next to it.
Alsuhail (Lambda Velorum) - Two stars and four planets (all landable); on the other end of the IC 2391 Sector relative to Avior.
