How apt… just arrived when I got back into dock…

The layout of various chapters, I have to say looks very much like another familiar text…

I really suspect this had an influence as source material for the constitution the codex…

‘Much like the ancient myths of Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John’…

The pencilwork around the cover of that book, surrounding the central illustration, reminds me of Michael Brookes' tattoo.

A separate note - there might be another clue in the tourist beacons: their naming. Indicative perhaps of stages of a journey we need to make?

I also find it noteworthy that the final tourist beacon points us back to the Artemis system, with its mention that that is where the first beacon is located.

The connection to the axis mundi, if that is how the golden chain is to be interpreted, Delphi again? If so, then I feel like there is a clue there that we have overlooked.

If anyone finds any Trinkets of Hidden Fortune, I would suggest selling them at Freeholm.
