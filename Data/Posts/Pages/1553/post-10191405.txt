I do believe that Julia Cavus family were DW, the Legacy text reads very similarly to that of the DW codex.

As could Lina Mater (Tender Mother)…

As her farther was not overly keen on her pursuing that path… it sounds very similar to the DW codex, about parents keeping their offspring out of the DW.. then there is her name - who’s origin means daughter of Jove…making her sound very important?

Her wider family names also have relevance too me thinks… Rex = King; Seline = Selene.

One of the ships was called the Demeter, in the Artemis system…

Artemis, Demeter, Selene…

Regards Brookes post above about Alliance space I agree that is highly likely wha he was hinting at.

FD support in the past alluded that the trinkets were linked to the DW missions… that it was a paused ‘story’ which might get turned on in the future?

In Legacy a character dies but they cannot bury a body, so they enact a tradition of filling a cargo pod with various keepsakes and niknaks. That sounds to me very much like the description of Trinkets of Hidden fortune.

I’m now pretty confident Brookes book Legacy is the book referenced in the Codex. I would go so far as to presume Brookes also wrote both Codex’s and used them to drop hints towards his book Legacy and in game locations.
What about Darik’s brother Mervan? Sounds an odd name but tried googling and only got Mervyn
