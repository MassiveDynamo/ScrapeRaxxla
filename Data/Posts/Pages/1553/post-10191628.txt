Hi, I don't typically dabble in Raxxla discussion but I made note of this in the Cannon discord.

The lines from Paradise Lost:

"And fast by, hanging in a golden chain,
This pendent world, in bigness as a star
Of smallest magnitude, close by the moon."

refer to the Earth. In the passage (paraphrasing a bit here), Satan is able to see Earth through a gold chain hanging from heaven. Looking through the chain, he sees Earth hanging at the bottom of the chain. The star referenced is the Sun, and the moon is...well...our moon. It could absolutely be interpreted to be some hint to its location elsewhere, but it could also be taken at face value. No doubt you guys have searched Sol thoroughly, but maybe there is something hidden there? Or perhaps I am too literal...
