Slightly off topic but does anybody here know if anyone's transcribed the text from the five Brookes Tour beacons anywhere yet? I've currently done 4 of the 5 and would absolutely advocate having the respect to do the whole tour in-game rather than simply reading it on the forum but I know someone who's no longer able to play the game who would love to know what was written. Perhaps pm me if you have it, or at the very least please put it in a big spoiler.
