Slightly off topic but does anybody here know if anyone's transcribed the text from the five Brookes Tour beacons anywhere yet? I've currently done 4 of the 5 and would absolutely advocate having the respect to do the whole tour in-game rather than simply reading it on the forum but I know someone who's no longer able to play the game who would love to know what was written. Perhaps pm me if you have it, or at the very least please put it in a big spoiler.
Yes second that - we on console can’t see this content either (my PC in dry dock foreseeable future). But yes spoilers please / with context

Generally Raxxla aside I think it’s a touching epitaph, sad we all can’t visit them, almost enough to encourage me to buy a new rig… we’ll almost.
