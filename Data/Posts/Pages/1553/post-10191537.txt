Twin vipers (caduceus) … and two eagles… the System of Artemis is connected to the axis. Possibly Freeholm. Also the indication that mementos (trinkets?… possibly of hidden fortune) are left in the cargo pod coffin of Hammer… with a memorial plaque.

I think we need to search the asteroid field for a cargo pod with a plaque….
