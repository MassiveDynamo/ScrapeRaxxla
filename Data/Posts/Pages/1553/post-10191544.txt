Twin vipers (caduceus) … and two eagles… the System of Artemis is connected to the axis. Possibly Freeholm. Also the indication that mementos (trinkets?… possibly of hidden fortune) are left in the cargo pod coffin of Hammer… with a memorial plaque.

I think we need to search the asteroid field for a cargo pod with a plaque….
That would be so fitting. I like that

Again this ties us back to Elite Legacy. FD are dropping some heavy hints… In that book the character Hammer is obviously a self portrait of Brookes, and just as FD has alluded put to rest in a cargo pod, only filled with trinkets…. ejected into space in Artemis.

Cargo pod in game would pop up in a POI, or it might be too small to detect, but then this would go against what Brrookes supposedly said himself - ‘anyone can find it and more than once’ unless it’s a crashed pod or a pod you can’t scoop, but I like that idea it’s rather fitting.

Or maybe trinkets of hidden fortune now work in Odyssey?
