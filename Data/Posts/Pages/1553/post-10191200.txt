Well the Milton quote at least gives som useful info on possible locations:

Of living sapphire, once his native seat;

"And fast by hanging in a golden chain
This pendent world, in bigness as a star

Of smallest magnitude close by the moon."

Big as a star and close to the moon.

Close to the moon should mean that it's close to the moons orbital plane. The moons orbit is 5.14Â° of the ecliptic plane. That's quite close, but we have the moons orbit lines in the game, so we don't really have to settle for second best.

Faint but visible.

Smallest magnitude visible to the human eye is 6. Magnitude 6 could mean a bright far away star og a close dim star. Sapphire comes in many colours (mostly blue), so that does not help much.

In orbit.

hanging in a golden chain
This pendent world

This could mean a secondary star, but it could also mean in orbit around Sol. The second option is perhaps most fitting to the text?
