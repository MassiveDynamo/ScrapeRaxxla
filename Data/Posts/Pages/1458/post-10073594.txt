Thetis Creatrix

Introduction paragraph:
An intriguing cosmogony survived in a papyrus scrap about the early Spartan poet Alkman. He is commenting on a lost poem, and most of his commentary is lost as well. What remains is a creation story: the goddess Thetis emerges from primordial unformed matter and shapes it as a craftsman gives form to metal. She brings into being two principles, Poros (variously translated as Path, Resource, Possibility) and Tekmor (Limit, Binding Definition). In this way begin light and darkness, day and night. [Knox, 179]

The funny thing is I never knew this existed untill Elite Dangerous. It was the jewel on the brow of the mother of galaxies that led me down this path. It was Alphecca/Alphekka (spelling in game) or Gemma, crown jewel of Corona Borealis. This little constellation has ties to Thetis and some stories end happily ever after some not so much.

This would help establish why in game the Gen ship Thetis is in the Nefertem system.

Nefertem was the Egyptian god of each morning's creation of day, associated with the lotus flower.
