Suppose Raxxla was 'findable' pre-Horizons, could it then be located on a planet?
I would say yes. As long as no one has found Raxxla, FD can change aspects of it.
If these changes does not create continuity problems for the ingame reality, thy could do it.

The Zurara was changed from an Anaconda to a megaship. The active component of Raxxla (Omphalos rift / Alien construct) could be moved from a hidden low orbit USS, to a surface site.
This would only conflict with our meta understanding of the mystery and I doubt FD cares about that.
