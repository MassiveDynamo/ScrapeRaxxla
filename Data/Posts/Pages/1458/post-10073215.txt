However we have the issue that the codex preceded the Stargoids by some considerable time, so if only a narrative foreshadowing device, it would mean it was either injected far too early, or the Stargoids were around much earlier (but either invisible or bugged) or FD set up this foreshadowing to both retcon previous lore and effectively bait us.. . a concept which I find particularly distasteful..

I’m not satisfied with this logic, which is flawed, as it makes the existence of the Codex redundant, unless our impression of FD and their opinion of us is greatly exaggerated…
Don't forget in the real world FD put all resources in to on foot stuff in 2018? and the subsequent disaster launch (and necessitated fixes) and not forgetting consoles held back the story line for ages to until they finally gave up and allowed people to move just before starting the fun again with the goids...

Which has had me thinking could they turn Elite/founders missions again?
