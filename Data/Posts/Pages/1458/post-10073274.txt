The very short explanation is that regardless of culture you are interpreting the Alleged Toast of The Dark Wheel through it should end up approximately at the Northern Celestial sphere as viewed from Earth. Interpretation varies but my personal favorite each step is part of the Thetis / Achilles myth. In this one, Achilles shield serves as the map which essentially centers on Polaris. Achilles is important because in Elite Dangerous they produce robots. It is our mortal flaw insofar as the story, and explains much of the real history of INRA and Mycoid. Honestly, given the fact there is no body at the Jameson crash and Alioth was a robotics hub tied to Achilles Corporation I wouldn't strictly rule out that the logs were done by a robot. Stack is one moon away from the crash and could have arranged for the ship's crash.

Honestly, the ideas have grown to be a great deal more complicated than this document suggests insofar as how one finds Raxxla. Presently, I am not sold on the idea that is primary site but it is HUGELY IMPORTANT. I have several other versions that deal with Holdstock. At some point, I suppose a new write up would be good. The problem is the sheer scale of it all and how many plot lines were involved. Each piece tells a separate part of how humans were impacted and the efforts to keep it quiet.
