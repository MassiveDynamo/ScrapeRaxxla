Don't forget in the real world FD put all resources in to on foot stuff in 2018? and the subsequent disaster launch (and necessitated fixes) and not forgetting consoles held back the story line for ages to until they finally gave up and allowed people to move just before starting the fun again with the goids...

Which has had me thinking could they turn Elite/founders missions again?
How true.

They well might and I suspect they will…

The Codex was introduced circa 2018, Project Watson leak stated legs were slated for 2020. So it’s feasible?

Also when I questioned Support, they inclined (via a Dev) that the removed DW missions were a ‘story arc’ if those were ever to be switched back on, they replied as an unknown!

I hope it’s not a narrative element, my gut tells me it likely is, I think a lot of what has been heard from the horses mouths was either out of context or poorly phrased.

My heart would beg to differ, the best thing FD could do is have Raxxla as a never ending story.
