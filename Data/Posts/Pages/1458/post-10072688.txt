Suppose Raxxla was 'findable' pre-Horizons, could it then be located on a planet?
No, good point. So unlikely to be a surface site, which Ive said before...old age catching up. No, itâ€™s more likely to be a beacon or similar, or a way to access a beacon. Anyone checked beacons for hexagonal symmetry? Its a long time since I visited one.
