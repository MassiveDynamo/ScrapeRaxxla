The best you can realistically get from the Alleged Toast of The Dark Wheel is a rough region - though that region happens to essentially revolve around Polaris. The same can gotten from Voyager 2 probe in-game in Sol. Meanwhile, Voyager 1 and New Horizons point in-game pretty much directly at Polaris. Does that mean Raxxla is a lore-lock? Maybe so, but maybe not. Polaris is at a really weird location almost 433 LY from Sol and nearly 200 LY above the galactic plane. Sure anything is possible, but I am still suspect Raxxla (or its' active focal point) is a globular cluster near the core of the galaxy. There is enough to possibly suppose that Raxxla might be based Holdstock's writings that came out several years before the first game + TDW novella. All I can say is it is important and was in prior games lore. But, it's equally possible we never were intended to get specifics out of the Alleged Toast, too. Hopium is very potent motivator and I had to pull really obscure references to get to fit Achilles/Thetis.
