Since the topic of The Dark Wheel was brought up might as well mention something. These folks (if they exist), apparently are quite devious when it comes to naming schemes. The Dark Wheel according to legend is based out of a disused toroidal station and thus the organization's name. Well, a ring is form of torus so I decided to check public scan records for known stations involving Ring in the name. Is it a consistent name for a specific type of station? Oh, hell no. That would be far too easy. It includes outposts, coriolis stations, orbis stations, and ocellus stations. So apparently finding the station the proves they exist may be much more complicated than first thought. The list with increasing distance from Sol is here:
