It has just struck me, regarding the previous discussion on the hypothesis, that Raxxla might be a Guardian site, is that Guardians themselves might be described as vagabonds. At least those that departed in the ark ships sent to colonise alien worlds, since their homes were later destroyed by both Thargoids and the AI constructs.
Adding to this: being fond of conditions in asymptotic giant branch stars would necessitate frequent moves as when the star switches phases or goes into the more active variable phase it might just render planets uninhabitable (it is a rather unique stellar evolution sequence that can go main sequence several times). On the AI front, if there are Guardians who survived an attempted annihilation moving and staying low-key may be a key to survival. It is one of reasons I am concerned about Guardian and Humans AIs. We have been sending signal flares advertising our location. If we are deemed to be Guardians because we used their weapons, we might be next.
