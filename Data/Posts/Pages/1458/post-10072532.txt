It has just struck me, regarding the previous discussion on the hypothesis, that Raxxla might be a Guardian site, is that Guardians themselves might be described as vagabonds. At least those that departed in the ark ships sent to colonise alien worlds, since their homes were later destroyed by both Thargoids and the AI constructs.

So does the Toast have any different meaning if it said from the Guardians’ viewpoint? (i’m still of the mind that the PF is run by a Guardian AI).
Would the toast describe any of the Guardian systems in a certain order for example?
