Just a quick image before I go out mandatory post-Christmas family stuff:

As before. The red dot is the signal origin according to Canonn. The black shape and yellow stars is the volume where the signal should originate from according to IRH.


Although Canonn's is outside the IRH's suspected volume - it's extremely close to the outer edge. From what LCU explained it seems like Canonn's method and IRH's method is different, but as you can see the results are very compatible assuming a small margin of error in either or both sets of results.
