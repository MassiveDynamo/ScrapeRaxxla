The door is the key… My thoughts exactly.

The number seven is also utilised in the codex, ungrammatically!

There is also the textual obfuscation of the secret in Ragthorn, by surrounding it with the written rune for Thorn!

Þurisaz or Purisaz, is in game!

There’s also the reference to John Milton in the Ragthorn, one cannot deny a certain someone not getting excited about that association!

A place that is not a place; the Otherworld, a realm which exists outside our reality, in some cultures over sea or under or through a mountain, or a doorway made by Hawthorn…

Collectively I can see the re-use of contextual influences Holdstock utilised in his writings; remembering that ‘he’ created the myth of Raxxla not Bell nor Braben.

At a minimum it’s evidence that Brookes had skilfully and artfully replicated a Holdstockian Easter Egg in game of an immense scale.
