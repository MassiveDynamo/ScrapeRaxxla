Today I got The Ragthorn by Robert Holdstock - and have finished reading it already!
It has changed the way I think about what we have in game.
We have a representation of many myths, not only the works of Robert Holdstock, with an Yggdrasil resting upon Axis Mundi and an Otherworld or Underworld in its roots, with triad goddesses and many other things but, having now read this story, I do not think the tree is Yggdrasil (or not only Yggdrasil): it is the Ragthorn tree!
To not spoil the plot I'll use spoilers as I set down my thoughts.
I think we are looking for something buried (perhaps literally) amongst the roots of the tree, where the pointers in the Codex have been directing us, since

Early on in the story there is an ancient ruin discovered in a crater:

There is also mention in the book about a doorway

This makes me think that, if Raxxla is a Robert Holdstock Easter Egg, then we are looking for a tomb of some kind, very possibly in a crater. Whether this is a gateway to somewhere or holds the key to immortality, or both, I have no idea.

The Ragthorn tree is described as having seven branches and seven roots, each with seven times seven thorns. The number 7 is a repeating factor in the unfolding mystery. It is also described as a 'dream tree', from the word , a 'wonderful tree' () and a tree of victory () and as symbolic of Christ's cross, the . It is also referred to as a bloodthorn. Perhaps there is one in the tomb?

Speaking of Artemis: the Brookes Galactic Tour, when reached the last place in Orion Nebulae finish by something like "you can find the start of the text in Artemis system".
In the past, did we have a serie of beacons where the last one point to the first beacon?
Maybe at the end of this "journey", we need to find/do something in Artemis
