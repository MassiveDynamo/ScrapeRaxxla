If Purisaz is not arbitrary and is an international reference to Ragthorn my initial interpretation was to suspect Is it a literary clue, to look out for a pattern replicating what was in the book.

My initial thought was to look for systems, bodies or ports named after species of thorn treesâ€¦ in Ragthorn the rune of thorn surrounds the centre word, to both highlight it, but also protect it.

My thoughts on Ragthorn immediately made me think of the Raxxla logo, are there certain systems that surround Raxxla that have a shared naming convention about thorns, find these and maybe it identifies a common centre?

Is it limited just to the thorn?

In Celtic mythology there existed the mystic triad of trees; the Oak, Ash and Thorn.

And in relation to Purisaz could such systems likewise be intentionally misspelt? It could be thought that Purisaz is a Shibboleth?

I agree about the interpretation of the Raxxla logo here, though being a 3D symbol showing a cube with something at the centre, so perhaps surrounded on six sides.

There is an Ansuz system in game, which could represent the rune for oak or ash (or heathen god). There is also Berkanan (birch) and Ehwaz, which might be a Shibboleth for Eiwaz (yew).

It is not only trees that have runes in-game but perhaps the others are obfuscation? (So I won't list the ones I'm aware of here to focus on the trees for the moment).
