I agree.

As per my post recently. In the DJ interview that everyone cites for the "it's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you were at this stage, it's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." quote, a few minutes later Brookes says "You still have to do the journey though" when talking about travelling to Sagittarius A*.

Therefore it's very likely Brookes meant a physical journey - since he used the same word a few mins later relating to travelling 22kly.
I also agree, and he said it in the context of the journey to SagA being challenging with the risk of a mistake costing you a big chunk of time such as running out of fuel etc. He also made reference to certain ships being better suited to that journey to Sag A* saying "anything else would be madness unless you've got a fully kitted Anaconda or something".

As for the Raxxla hint, I can only assume what he meant by "everyone...themselves" is that the community as a whole has to figure it out. The only other viable option would be that it is a bespoke procedurally generated sequence unique to each player. If that were the case, it would still need a common starting point - either physical location, or a performance benchmark we reach to activate it.
