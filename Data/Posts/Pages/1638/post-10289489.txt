Thank you for this! Yes currently I am only using the flac audio file from Canonn's page. If you can share some small 1-2 minute clips of those variants that would be great I plan to get back into the game at some stage to explore more of these interesting clues. First I need to get my theory structured to make any sense.
I can see differences in the low frequency imaging (the red/white band) as well, indicating that it likely also forms part of the Signal.

To clarify the 'heartbeat' is only in the low frequency range. There are many layered aspects to this audio (likely deliberate to obfuscate something) - so hopefully this might help others dissect the different features for their own independent analysis. In this diagram pay close attention to the Hz ranges.

I have attached the sub-200Hz audio that I separated out from the Canonn audio file and applied noise filtering to.
This audio is sped up by 3.5x (which increases the freq to around 600Hz).

The real test will be to see if this is unique to the LS or if it is just a repeating sample used by the audio designer. I'm leaning towards unlikely to be a repeating sample, because all the other aspects of the audio are unique and well blended across the entire audio clip.

Here you go. This link is my latest recordings. It's quite big, almost 4gb. There's a text file in there to explain what each track on the audacity file is and where it was recorded.

From what I've seen so far it's pretty typical of the general span of recordings, I'm still trying to get a 'top quality' recording, but maybe that's not possible, who knows.

Have fun
