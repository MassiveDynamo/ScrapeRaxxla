If we weren't able to land on things earlier in ED then I suspect it won't be tied to a surface location.

HOWEVER, that idea brings up an old memory I had of the classic space MMO Jumpgate. In it there were plenty of asteroids to mine from etc, and you traversed through different sectors via jumpgate portals. So the devs decided to have a laugh at the player's expense and stick a very dark asteroid right in front of the line-of-sight path to one of these gates. So if you weren't paying attention at this one particular sector, you would end up as a scorch mark on the side of 'Emma' the asteroid. She was a pain in the butt, just like 'emorrhoids

So one alternate option to the space structure idea could be that it is a uniquely dark asteroid - possibly larger than normal? - which may have something placed on it by the devs. Quite a tiny needle in a galactic haystack, but something to keep in mind.
