Hi guys i found a few bugs on this system... someting dosent seem right to me:
1-bug: was it only me that notice that all the passanger mission givers only offer around 300k credit to go to colonia? (to me this feels like a bug) ....but i see other options as well:

1.1- Ither NLTT 46621 was ment to be in Colonia reagion. and the system is buged due to that.

1.2- the nav system "thinks" colonia is nearby becasue there is a way to strait to there in this system (some portal or some way of fast travel)


2-when acepting pass mission, after selecting the cabin.. missions dont register on the nav menu, and if you go out of the station they disapear all together.

does this bug with the pass missions happens to you too?
