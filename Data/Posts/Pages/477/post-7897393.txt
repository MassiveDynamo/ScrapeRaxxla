No one covered this yet? <Looks>... Nope.

The Witchhead isnâ€™t locked. Never has been AFAIK.
Correct me if i'm wrong, but i'm pretty sure there is indeed a large permit locked section that includes at least part of the witch head nebula. AFAIK, the actual nebula isnt locked, but there is a permit locked area that is often referred to by it's proximity.

Edit: apparently, the locked sector is just "above" the nebula. Can't play today to verify, but i'm sure others will confirm
