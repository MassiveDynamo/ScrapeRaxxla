This comment totally flew under the radar in its original thread. But here’s the full post from a commander:

“I just got back from Orion and cashed in for this CG/II, Im ranked top 50 and i have a massive 600k coming my way for 2 days of exploring and data collecting.

But i did find a clue to RAXXLA.”

When you find something like this can you please provide the url to that post.
