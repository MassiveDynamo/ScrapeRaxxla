If you want I can ask if there is a place left for you, here where I dropped my ships.. until late 2020, at least.

Thanks Scytale
I may be retired, but I’m not ready for a retirement home yet,
Unless they have hot & cold night nurses and lavian brandy on tap
And coffee with cake for breakfast
Oh, hang on, isn’t that France?
Cancel Brexit immediately!!!
