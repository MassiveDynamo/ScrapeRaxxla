That sounds like a good end game story. Be a way to end and jump start the next ED title, lol

It’s been on the cards for a while, the two FD-sponsored novels I mentioned plus the Salomé storyline all carry this message. And I seem to remember about 3 years ago a report from a livestreamer visit to FD where the long term 10-year plot basis was laid out; aliens take over the bubble & humanity has to fight a guerrilla war to reclaim. I suspect that was the real reason that Jacques Station ended up where it is to form the second bubble from which to fight.

Edit: but will the bugs take over Shinrarta? My two accounts are both based there. Must move Jorki’s annie out to Colonia and Tyko’s new explora Phantom (still aim to Quest for Raxxla, despite recent disappointment!) to ......where?
