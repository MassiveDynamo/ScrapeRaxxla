I think Mr. Winking Cat needs to be taken much more seriously...

I missed this the first time around.

He placed a painting into the Garden City Gallery on Alioth. Here is a diagram of a Garden City.



6 nodes with a center point and a railroad in the inner ring. It’s supposed to be greener but I think I found an older, yellowed, diagram.

Sound familiar? I suck at linking stuff and making stuff pretty (and I’m on mobile if anyone else cares to make a side by side comparison of the Raxxla logo and a garden city diagram).

I did try to jump into Azaleach earlier but only at 12:00am game time. I work every night for the next two weeks so I can never try 3am like Halseys jump.

Anyways I think based on the hint. That we’re looking for something that is mimicking something in the skybox or should not belong in one of 6 systems. “A painting was found on a wall in a previously empty room”. Timing may also be a factor. Movement every 3 days or so to a new node and it may only be visible at certain times.



If I’m not mistaken he’s stolen from Garden City twice, once recently and once well before we got the Codex Raxxla logo.

Random question, the music that plays for some systems when you complete a hyperspace jump into them, what determines that? I notice some systems it happens and others it doesn’t.

We need to find out the scale of the logo compared to the regions of space. Are the 6 nodes identifiable through the riddle? Galnet will probably hold the answers but it’s a lot to go through.

Thoughts?

Now that they have stance on galnet, predict the next theft and you got something.
