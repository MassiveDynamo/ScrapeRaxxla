I don’t know why but I get the feeling that the returning of the painting is symbolic for the discovery of the Golconda.

Like Raxxla or whatever, disappeared so many people and then returned them. Feds and Imps just want to cover it up and keep the people separate. Thats probably why after the fertilizer mess, the club clearly stated in Galnet a distress signal from Upaniklis. The club made all those voice logs and then sent us over to “discover” it.

I’m about to get my Commander Assassinated aren’t I? Welp.
