there are certain facts that have been given by fdev over the years since ed was released.

1. it's in the milky way.
2. it's in the game
3. it's not permit blocked or require any special ranking to find it
4. it's accessible to players (it's not at non-achievable jump ranges)
5. It's not connected to any current or past narrative plots
6. Fdev knows exactly where it is.
7. it's been in the game since the beginning.

The above is not in question unless you don't believe fdev ...in which case anything can be believable to you and there's no point in making any discussion regarding it.

There's been hints that's it's in or immediately around the bubble from one panel interview.

I agree with Thatchinho above. Everything we know about Raxxla is stated by Macros in the original post of this thread. Your points 3, 4 and 5 have not been said by FD; if you have verifiable FD source statements then provide them and Macros will update that OP, otherwise stop spreading misinformation.
