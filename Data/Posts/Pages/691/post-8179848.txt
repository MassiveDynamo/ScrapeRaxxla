Speaking of that. Isn't it weird that everything is named after Earth animals and junk when there has been a thousand years or so of off Earth civilization and life.

Where are the now transplanted or alien species? Why would all space ship manufactures use Earth names when the vast majority of humans have never been to earth for many generations?
