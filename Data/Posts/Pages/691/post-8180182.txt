Colour coded:
Verified with evidence in game
Strong evidence - balance of probability
Hints or inference - not verified
Untrue


1. it's in the milky way. - We have from interview with Michael Brookes
2. it's in the game - We have 2nd hand from Drew's report of the conversation with David Braben
3. it's not permit blocked or require any special ranking to find it - We don't know this to be true - it could be in a permit locked system, but we don't know yet how to get the permit.
4. it's accessible to players (it's not at non-achievable jump ranges) - We only have inference and weak inference at that - it could be anywhere - we "don't know what it is" yet.
5. It's not connected to any current or past narrative plots - We don't know this at all - it could easily be the end game of the 10yr story arc - we have no way of knowing whats connected
6. Fdev knows exactly where it is. As per (1) if its in the milky way then FD will know where it is
7. it's been in the game since the beginning. Again, we only have 2nd hand from Drew's report of the conversation with DB

Oh dear - only one green light. The OP is reliable if you are rigorous about your standards of proof. By the standards of a civil court, there is still something to chase, but we really dont have much evidence.

As far as :
There's been hints that's it's in or immediately around the bubble from one panel interview.
Please provide evidence. There is much speculation about jump range of old ships, but this argument doesn't hold water - if you take what was available and allow decades for travel, then getting 10kly from the bubble is no problem. And as we 'don't know what it is' yet, then it could still be anywhere - knowledge of it and being at it could be different things.
