Tinfoil ramblings

Couple of things I wanted to note down.

Firstly, looking through my decals today and all the PF rank decals are listed with the Role then Rank (eg. Trade Elite) except for Exploration. That is just labelled as the rank (eg. Elite). Probably just an oversight but it was something that stood out as different.

Also looking at the message for reaching an Elite Rank, where the Pilots federation logo appears there are what look like stars.
SPOILER: ELITE MESSAGE





Which gave me thoughts of the following images I have recently be studying

SPOILER: OLD WORLDS & RAXXLA SYMBOL


Now all this made me think of another item that came in the original Elite box besides The Dark Wheel novella: The Keyboard overlay.
SPOILER: KEYBOARD OVERLAY
Does anyone think there could be a way to overlay the images above (or any other images) to reveal anything of interest?
Disclaimer: It is possible some of that Apa Veitii I was hauling last night may have leaked into my water supply.
