Lol I don't think you guys have thought this through enough. Reasonable inferences are fine because you have to think from MB's position.

Just to pick on point 3. Those of you who really believe in ranks or there being a trigger should really start working on your CQC Elite and put your money where your mouth is. Less than 20 quad Elites? which really means it'd never be found.
