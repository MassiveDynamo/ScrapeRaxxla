Did anyone see that Etienne Dorn now does life support lightweight. Some things say tier 5 and some tier 4. This means lori jameson is no longer the only means to max exploration. That means combat rank is now not required to explore at max. I thought this meant the idea that having no combat rank couldn't stop you from finding Raxxla. In fact it made me think it was required. This changes that potentially. Combat rank is now optional for max exploration again potentially.

BTW, when did this happen and does he have tier 5 lightweight or only tier 4? He's in colonia.
He's done Life Support (at G1) since he appeared in the 3.2 release. G4 was reached at the end of January, and G5 in mid-March. Most 3rd-party sites are out of date (or sometimes just wrong) on Colonia engineer capability - of the non-Colonia specialist sites, Inara seems to do the best job of keeping up to date, though it might be a couple of weeks behind on the latest upgrades.

Even in a Beluga with 8D life support, the difference between G3 (Turner) and G5 (Dorn) is only 0.57 LY, though - it's basically irrelevant even for exploring hard to reach systems in most cases. In the Anaconda you'd actually be using for max range, you gain just 0.24 LY going from G3 to G5 lightweight life support. (or 0.12 LY for G4->G5)
