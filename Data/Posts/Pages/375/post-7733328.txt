Edelgard & I experimented with mis-jumps using Thargoid probes in Delphi. Sadly no mis-jump joy and I lost Bob, my long term friend, the Thargoid Probe. Fortunately I found Yvonne in his place. The Interceptor was not pleased though.

Thanks for the assistance! o7
The jumps were made from Delphi to Merope, having the FSD fully charged and engaging boost at the last second whilst aligned for the jump. The Thargoid Probe shutdown pulse hits 10 seconds after the discovery scanner honk but the HUD shuts down earlier - but even with the HUD shut down you can boost and then jump after 9 seconds.
.
We also checked Thargoid Wakes but it is not possible to follow their trajectory, which looks suspiciously like they jump to Col 70 Sector, maybe even Col 70 Sector FY-N c21-3, although I would need to do further checks to verify that.


while you are experimenting with Thargoids there. Can I ask you to try an experiment â€” to break 3 or more mother ships in one day? (using Guardian technology). Objective: to understand whether the changes occurring affect the cycle of the appearance of aliens in human space (through the Eagle Eye).
There is a suspicion. 6 active mother ships = 6 targets in each cycle
