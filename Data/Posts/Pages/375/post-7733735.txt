Suddenly the stargate from stargate is coming to mind. Maybe it's in Antarctica. When atmospheric landings happen we need to check all the spots the stargate from the show and movies were located...
Stargate franchise started in 1994, a decade after Raxxla appeared in Elite.

Not sure the two are related, what other Stargate stuff exists in current ED?
