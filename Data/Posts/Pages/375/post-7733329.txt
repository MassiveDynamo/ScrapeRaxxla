And I'm assuming lowering the fuel in your tank gives an added boost to your range? This guy was doing the equivilent of 84.1375 last year!

Maybe this doesn't open up any new systems. Unless most explorers haven't realized this yet.

Although this means we can get up to 84.28 now potentially. So, 337.12/168.56/126.42/105.35ly absolute max potentially.
