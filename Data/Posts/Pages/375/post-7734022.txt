My own tinfoil hypothesis is that there is still an old jump-gate around and that's the only way to 'misjump'. Problem is that jumpgate is most likely dark and quite probably right next to the DW dark station. So not something you can find randomly but rather part of some quest. I'm guessing that even finding the jumpgate will not let you use it unless you have some 'activation code' from TDW.

You're assuming that The Dark Wheel knows the location of Raxxla. The most recent information we have, found in John Harper's And Here The Wheel indicates that they never found it or, if they did find it (and there is no evidence of this), it wasn't until after the schism between TDW and CIEP.
