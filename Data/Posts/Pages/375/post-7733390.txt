I've actually wondered about the guardian space stations. They are weird. Have you noticed they are made up of guns from earth. Which is weird because why would guardians from 10million years ago know about the designs of a German Luger?!

Unless we find out guardian tech is actually human and we had Nazis in space! It's been 1300 years. That is a long time to get to deep space and build weird things.
