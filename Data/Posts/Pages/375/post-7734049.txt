You're assuming that The Dark Wheel knows the location of Raxxla. The most recent information we have, found in John Harper's And Here The Wheel indicates that they never found it or, if they did find it (and there is no evidence of this), it wasn't until after the schism between TDW and CIEP.
John Harper(forum name: Thargoid) confirmed this on the forum.

The Dark Wheel never found Raxxla.
Unless they have found it in the last four years, they are still searching.
The secret of how to get there, died with Jason Ryder.

Except for the original group of wicked men(the Club?), it seem most likely that one has been there.
