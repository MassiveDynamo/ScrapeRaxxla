You're assuming that The Dark Wheel knows the location of Raxxla. The most recent information we have, found in John Harper's And Here The Wheel indicates that they never found it or, if they did find it (and there is no evidence of this), it wasn't until after the schism between TDW and CIEP.

I'm assuming that someone found it otherwise we wouldn't know about it in the first place. TDW either found and lost it... or had the info from somewhere else... or has some difficulty reproducing the 'accident' that led to the discovery... or or or.

The fact that we have TDW in the codex in relation to Raxxla means there is some real connection. Wether they hold the jumpgate but lost the key... or somebody in ages past found it and hid the info... there should be some relationship.
