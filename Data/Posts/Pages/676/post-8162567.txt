Seriously off topic. Another thing I'd wished I'd done. Eridanus constellation.
Start in its first star, Achenar, the home of the Empire, crossing Cetus, and end at Rigel. If there was ever a constellation worth exploring, this one is big.
Eridanus is one of the rivers to Hades in myth. Hades appears to be important in the riddles. Orion is near and a part of Barnard's Loop. In Hitchhiker's Guide, the mystical and illusive planet Magrathea is in Horsehead nebula, also in Barnard's Loop. Epsilon Eridani, home of WorldCraft Theme Park is one of the stars in Eridanus. I've hypothesized for a while now that this constellation may lead to something special, but now will never know. Bummer.
SPOILER: ERIDANUS CROSSES CETUS
SPOILER: ERIDANUS LEADS TO ORION

There’s still plenty of time for you to check it out! I think the Thargoids have postponed their invasion until late next year when they’ve got their legs and can trounce humanity on the surface.
