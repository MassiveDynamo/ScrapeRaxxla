For people interested in the Holdstock angle... Here are some snippets (poorly photographed from my cell phone) from the book "Tour of the Universe" co-written by Edwards and Holdstock. Specifically focusing on the Alien Ruins on Pluto and the "Dead World Scroll" - I know we've talked about the Tour before ... but I didn't remember anyone sharing or talking about the stuff from Pluto so I thought Id put them here ...

SPOILER: FROM THE OFFICIAL GUIDE TO THE RUINS OF PLUTO




I will just suggest you read the Dark Wheel Toast and then read the translation of the Dead World Scroll...

Thanks for the repost but I went to Pluto fairly recently and didn't find anything like the description.
