Well, you can’t get much more anonymous than if it’s 1.5ly out in SC! Since it takes an hour to get to Eden (0.21ly) then it would take around 7 hours of SC to get that far out. That would certainly explain why DB said FD know why it hasn’t been found! And I might postulate that in 3303 it is not called “Nemesis” but “Raxxla” and has a planet with an orbiting stealthy station!

Oh, oh oh! BlueWolve’s Sol theory!
To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! SOL
To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void! VENUS
The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. PLUTO
To Raxxla! NEMESIS/RAXXLA with orbiting stealth station?

It would certainly fit!
