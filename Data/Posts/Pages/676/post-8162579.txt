I stop travel for dinner, put on the tv, put my feet up and enjoy a brandy! Have seen a lot of youtube vids on these trips though! However it doesn’t make up for the numb posterior!

So are you going to test out Guru’s idea of Nemesis 5 hour’s SC out from Sol?
I would contemplate it if we had an idea of which direction! 5 hours out is potentially 3.145927*25 hours trip to check out the ecliptic !
And of course it’s actually a sphere not a circle!!! No guarantee Nemesis is on the ecliptic, so much more travel!!
I've gone much longer than 5 hours in the past, but I need something to aim for. Going in a straight line is easy. Doing an orbit is hard work, keeping the distance constant.

I'll stick to Alpha Centauri for now.
