May, or may not, be related. Just looking in galmap to see where Venus, Earth and Pluto are in relation to constellation Hydra and spotted that Alpha Hydri is permit-locked, but not found anything on that permit by googling. Already got the Beta Hydri permit, so puzzled. Anybody know anything about it?

edit: just wanted to highlight it as a headmark for Sol search! EDSM says it requires an unknown permit- intriguing!
