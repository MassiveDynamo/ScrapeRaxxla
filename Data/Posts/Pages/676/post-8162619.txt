I think I’ve already died of boredom and frustration on my Alpha Centauri theory! I am a brandy-fuelled space zombie who craves brains Raxxla!

But it seems that Nemesis may have been found (http://www.viewzone.com/browndwarf.html). But this source has it as a brown dwarf, not an M subdwarf which is what the codex pic suggests. That reference has it currently just beyond Pluto at 61 AU from Sol out towards Sag A*, but on an elliptical orbit with furthest point hundreds of AU. If this is Nemesis and it’s currently that close to Sol then I suspect it’s already disturbed the Oort Cloud and we should shortly expect another Heavy Bombardment of the inner solar system. It may end all life on Earth before climate change has a chance!
Good luck in your search!
I wouldn't worry to much about the star in the TDW codex pic. If there is something mysterious in AC, it's Raxxla.

The Raxxla myth is far older than TDW. Probably about 500 years. It makes sense that Raxxla is close to Sol. TDW would have the opportunity to place their station in a much more anonymous system.
