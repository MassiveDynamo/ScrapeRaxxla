I wouldn't worry to much about the star in the TDW codex pic. If there is something mysterious in AC, it's Raxxla.

The Raxxla myth is far older than TDW. Probably about 500 years. It makes sense that Raxxla is close to Sol. TDW would have the opportunity to place their station in a much more anonymous system.

Well, you can’t get much more anonymous than if it’s 1.5ly out in SC! Since it takes an hour to get to Eden (0.21ly) then it would take around 7 hours of SC to get that far out. That would certainly explain why DB said FD know why it hasn’t been found! And I might postulate that in 3303 it is not called “Nemesis” but “Raxxla” and has a planet with an orbiting stealthy station!
