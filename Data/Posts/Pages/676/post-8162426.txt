Drew Wagar takes CMDR Plater through a TDW 'initiation'. If interested you'd really need to watch.
You might pick up on clues and hints that I and others haven't, perhaps on a boring flight to Hutton?

[Edit: That link has already been cut down to the two hours with Drew out of the full 24 hour stream.

[Edit, edit: OMG, space ninja's everywhere in this thread! ]

The ninja penguin hasn’t popped up here for a while, but then you never can tell where ninjas are!
Yes, I did watch it while mooching about ACent again yesterday afternoon. Just an amusing trip through DW’s lore set against a Dark Wheel test for the charity livestream. I suspect it is probably nothing like whatever FD might have set up as an in-game DW test. But it does sort of confirm my belief that Salomé, Alessia, Rebecca et al were all part of DW’s Dark Wheel. The question might be how much does Drew know of FD’s in-game DW? Drew’s DW members are all clones, so should we be taking a close look at Teorge?

I really don’t want to do that 0.21ly trip again!! Life is too short!
