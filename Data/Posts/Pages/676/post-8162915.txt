Oh, oh oh! BlueWolveâ€™s Sol theory!
To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! SOL
To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void! VENUS
The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. PLUTO
To Raxxla! NEMESIS/RAXXLA with orbiting stealth station?

It would certainly fit!
Wait, are we talking planet X / Wormwood theory here? [Edit: ADS range is supposed to be infinite.]
