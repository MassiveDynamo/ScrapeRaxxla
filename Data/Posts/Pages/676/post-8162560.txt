0.21ly is nothing Jorki. Start before dinner and you are almost there when you get back.

I stop travel for dinner, put on the tv, put my feet up and enjoy a brandy! Have seen a lot of youtube vids on these trips though! However it doesn’t make up for the numb posterior!

So are you going to test out Guru’s idea of Nemesis 5 hour’s SC out from Sol?
I would contemplate it if we had an idea of which direction! 5 hours out is potentially 3.145927*25 hours trip to check out the ecliptic !
And of course it’s actually a sphere not a circle!!! No guarantee Nemesis is on the ecliptic, so much more travel!!
Besides, you’d be travelling so fast I suspect you’d miss any uss notification!
