Ok ok that is just a book that has raxxla some what mention but no where in that entire book does it have anything to do.with elite and the devs only have that in there for simple things to just play along with certain folk tail from the backer days. Yes there is a system in elite called raxxla and yes it has a faction called the dark wheel. But that's it. That's as far as the devs got with it really. You cant land on Pluto and that's it. And its folk tail from a book that is not meant to be in the actual game.
