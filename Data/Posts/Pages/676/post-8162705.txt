Well, you can’t get much more anonymous than if it’s 1.5ly out in SC! Since it takes an hour to get to Eden (0.21ly) then it would take around 7 hours of SC to get that far out. That would certainly explain why DB said FD know why it hasn’t been found! And I might postulate that in 3303 it is not called “Nemesis” but “Raxxla” and has a planet with an orbiting stealthy station!
That could be, but it wouldn't be the TDW station. TDW has not found Raxxla. That has been confirmed by John Harper, with reference to the writers guides.
