The last couple of pages have been entertaining (as are they all), but don’t forget this puzzle has been in-game since the beginning. I think the solution, and the way to find it, is going to be blindingly obvious once we find it.

That was the attraction of my last (failed) hypothesis-BH have been in from the outset, and it fits the omphalos, Astrophel/Stella etc hints. These have been given to us recently to help us find it; either we need to find it because we’re holding up the storyline ( probably thargoids, unfortunately) or because FD are tired of us floundering around. I’m convinced it’s going to be based on a quite simple mechanism.
