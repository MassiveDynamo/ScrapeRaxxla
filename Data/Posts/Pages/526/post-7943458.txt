Apparently the Raxxla symbol floating around with 18 dashes should be discounted as a "fake".

The one in the game referenced in the codex may be the one with 33 dashes, but given it's representation in the game codex, it is only "assumed" to have 33 dashes, as you cannot count them but there are more than 18.

So, unless someone has some official proof that the one we should consider as the true Raxxla image (in the game codex) having 33 dashes is the official one, we should assume so.

Could I ask (again) why we're considering the Raxxla image to be a clue, when the Dark Wheel and Colonia images share a common motif?
