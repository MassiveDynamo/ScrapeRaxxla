After reading the dark wheel novella I decided to try to follow Ryder's path in game as best I could. I gave up immediately because the tionisla orbital cemetery isn't in game. But there is a beacon that says some info. Apparently it lead to the formadine rift stuff. I always thought it odd that it would be tdw/raxxla based clues leading to not tdw/raxxla based results. As such, I've had difficulty dismissing it all together. We never know back what's what. Formadine rift mystery might have been the start of leading to more but Idk personally. Havent found that stuff yet and only seen it on YouTube.
