Never considered it a clue. I was replying to numbers offered by others in reference to the symbol, and playing with primes and fibonacci numbers. Others may consider it a clue, but I have not found any reference anywhere as to "why" this symbol is related to Raxxla at all. One day, it was posted, and forever more, associated with Raxxla.

So, the proper question should be: "Does anyone have any knowledge of where this symbol came from, or why it is associated with Raxxla lore at all?"

Just courious....

It came from fdev in the codex entry for raxxla. How does that not automatically associate it?
