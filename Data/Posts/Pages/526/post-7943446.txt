Camelopardalis constellation was the answer to a riddle kicked out by a cobra 3 found near the tionisla orbiting cemetery. Big reference to tdw novella. Worth a shot I would say

It wasn't the answer, it was part of the clue:

"The vain queen rides a giraffe that remembers her daughter's hero".

Cameleopardalis is the giraffe, Cassiopeia is the queen and Perseus was the hero.
The 'answer' such that anyone ever figured out, was "Over there", pointing in the direction of the Formidine Rift.

But feel free to chase down Rift clues, despite anything I say
