I'm pretty sure I didn't insist anyone follows any theory. If you read what I said it says non-objective searches there better results than seeking specific results which can always be twisted to suit your findings.what not your findings specifically, but I feel like in the scientific community that's common knowledge. if you read further I also said I wasn't trying to discredit anything. I was simply asking a question. you don't have to take offense to someone not knowing WHY you're saying what you're saying.
