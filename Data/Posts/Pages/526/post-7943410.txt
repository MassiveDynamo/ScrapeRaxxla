I'm pretty sure I didn't insist anyone follows any theory. If you read what I said it says non-objective searches there better results than seeking specific results which can always be twisted to suit your findings.what not your findings specifically, but I feel like in the scientific community that's common knowledge. if you read further I also said I wasn't trying to discredit anything. I was simply asking a question. you don't have to take offense to someone not knowing WHY you're saying what you're saying.

There are no clues, so people make up clues to keep themselves busy.

Just sit back and enjoy the show
