Depends on what type of evidence you want. This is a game, manufactured by FD. For me the word of the CEO that Raxxla has been in-game since the Gamma release, confirmed by the Game Director, is sufficient. It may not be for others.

The thing is... When they made these statements, people knew what they were doing, as some part of the Quest was a tiny little bit obvious.
It's past times. (The 'what a silly question'- thing only shows embarassment. Just look a their face !)
Who can pretend, now, that he knows what he is doing ( beside "questus interruptus" ) ?
