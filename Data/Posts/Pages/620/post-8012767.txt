That's still working for me..

Interesting. I can get one working, but when I use the second it either fails completely or pulls up the login menu then fails when I try to log in....
So, you've got two copies of the EDLaunch.exe in your games/EDLaunch folder, with different email details, and they both work? Have you duplicated any other files?
