Both are correct. Our Galaxy is called the Milky Way. It's named after the band we see in the night sky. The name is older than our understanding of the Galaxy.

The Galaxy is in fact a bit older than the name, though.

Thanks all.

this is kinda what I was thinking, that there is no 'scientific' answer, both are true so its not really a pointer at all, like everything else maybe that interview was just Fdev way of confirming it was in the game, in 'our' galaxy or game galaxy and maybe 'accessible' or discoverable rather than anything else specific.
