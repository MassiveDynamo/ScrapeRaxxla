Isn't most, if not all the Raxxla "evidence" based on hearsay, rumour and an utter lack of actual scientific reasoning with supporting evidence.

I haven't seen one piece of evidence. Conjecture yes but not evidence....

Depends on what type of evidence you want. This is a game, manufactured by FD. For me the word of the CEO that Raxxla has been in-game since the Gamma release, confirmed by the Game Director, is sufficient. It may not be for others.
