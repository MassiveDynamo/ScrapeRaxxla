Think of the mess the fleet carriers patch will make.
What was this thread about?
-scoots to top of page-
Oh yeah. Space is majestic like heaven, sounds without bodies. Blah blah
An inverted pyramid of speculation resting on a pin of fact.

Found something odd yesterday. Barnacle forest that didn’t show on any scans, but there it was. And I swear the thargoid ship was trying to suck up my SRV.
The pilots federation which provides our maps and scanners has become the single dominant force in the galaxy, denying access to systems without explanation, hiding things from us.
I don’t think we are going to find it using scanners.
I think we are going to need to physically search the surface of each and every star planet moon and asteroid.

Is the sidewinder small enough to fit inside a thargoid? If it got sucked in? If it was cold enough? I could use a SLF with a heat sink? Open the pod bay doors Hal. -this isn’t making any sense. Must try to get some sleep.
