Yes, exactly. The original edlaunch.exe and a copy of it. The first has my login details for my main account, and the second one for my secondary account. The two launchers remember their respective login details, and it all works as before. No other files duplicated. Hopefully it keeps working for me!

Thatâ€™s exactly what I had before and now no longer works. Weird!
