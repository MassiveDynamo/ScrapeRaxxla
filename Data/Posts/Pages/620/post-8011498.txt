Isn't most, if not all the Raxxla "evidence" based on hearsay, rumour and an utter lack of actual scientific reasoning with supporting evidence.

I haven't seen one piece of evidence. Conjecture yes but not evidence....

Two FD employees hav testified to the in-game existence of Raxxla. That's as close you can get, without actually finding it. It's not scientific evidence, but it would hold up in a court of law.

There in no positive evidence of anything else. The thread is full of negative evidence though. Things are checked and ideas are proved to not hold water.
Disproving our own hypothesis is decent science.
