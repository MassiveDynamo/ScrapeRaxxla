they seem to have borked the ability to have duplicated (& renamed!) EDLaunch.exe to be able to log in as either of my two commanders.
Was on my way to SD to change my mission krait for explorer phantom, but it sounds like the stored modules I wanted to install have also been borked.
ah well, time to start playing Far Cry 5 (last year's birthday present), or Star Citizen!
