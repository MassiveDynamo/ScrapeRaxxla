I would not completely discount Cassiopeia. The toast could be poorly written by drunk Dark Wheelers (FD).

I have very little faith in the Cassiopeia though. There is no Omphalos candidates in that direction. The wording would be incredibly clumsy, if it was Cass. If worded properly, it would be far to obvious (not a little bit) for a Raxla hint.

I'm not gonna spend any time on Cassiopeia, but I'm happy that others do. In case I'm wrong.


I checked it out and a lot of the neighboring systems pretty thoroughly with the FSS.
