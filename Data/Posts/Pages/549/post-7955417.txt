As far as I am aware, The Club were invented for Salome Phase III. It's possible Raxxla has been retconned to be associated with them, but that's not reflected in the Codex. I'd say TDW is still the way to go.
I don't think so. According to Drew, the Club is an FD in house concept. They are a tool for explaining strange political and technological changes (updates and new versions).
The Club is essentially FD's in-game persona.
Drew got handed the Club and merged it with the Salome story.
