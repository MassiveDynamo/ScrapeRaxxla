The Club may very well be the people currently occupying Raxxla and exploiting it for their own purposes. The ones mentioned by Rafe Zetter.

I really hope not... "The Club" makes me think of one of those silly Grisham novels with polo shirt wearing lawyers/politicians drunk on power playing golf in the ruins of Raxxla..... That would be horrible

They could atleast change their name to something like "the Xibalba Path" and i would have more respect for them.
