I think the whisper in witch space may refer to ngc 7822, you can see it really far away. When your about to jump it seems to stay an extra second on the skybox(not sure if all this kind of nebula do that) maybe described as a whisper right before 'which space". Also thought I would ask about servasti logs referring to thunder child "going dark in '69". Could that mean they went dark in col sector 69.(big sector and not going to plot though it by accident since the permit locks around it)
