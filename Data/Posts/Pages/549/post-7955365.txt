As far as I am aware, The Club were invented for Salome Phase III. It's possible Raxxla has been retconned to be associated with them, but that's not reflected in the Codex. I'd say TDW is still the way to go.
The Club may very well be the people currently occupying Raxxla and exploiting it for their own purposes. The ones mentioned by Rafe Zetter.
