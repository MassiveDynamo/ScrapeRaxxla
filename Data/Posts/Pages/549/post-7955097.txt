TDW is retired. The Club is the new "hot" secret group. The Club is DB new invention, as stated by Drew Wager. So, I am guessing if there will be any new development on a secret group - it will be DB focus, not the old retired TDW group that many have written lore about with little relevance.

As far as I am aware, The Club were invented for Salome Phase III. It's possible Raxxla has been retconned to be associated with them, but that's not reflected in the Codex. I'd say TDW is still the way to go.
