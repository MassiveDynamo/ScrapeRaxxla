If TDW don't know where Raxxla is (which old lore suggests, but isn't confirmed by the Codex) then the toast can't provide directions.
If TDW do know where Raxxla is, then they'd be bloody stupid to give directions to it in the toast and run the risk of a non-TDW commander finding it.


TDW is retired. The Club is the new "hot" secret group. The Club is DB new invention, as stated by Drew Wager. So, I am guessing if there will be any new development on a secret group - it will be DB focus, not the old retired TDW group that many have written lore about with little relevance.
