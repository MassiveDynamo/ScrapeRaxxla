Confirmation bias is real.

Edit:

Whenever someone is asked something, they can answer in a few ways

1. Positive/Affirmation
2. Negative/Refutation
3. Does not answer/No data

For some weird reason, you have a leap of logic from "Does not answer" equating to "Positive its related to Raxxla".

Its as if I ask the government "Do aliens exist?" and interpreting their silence as "aliens exist".

There can be many reasons as to why they do not engage.

I followed the clues, the best I could IN/OUT of the game.

And your point is valid in logic but not circumstance. If this was a debate, you might get a point. I'm just here to present the data I have. And I am not saying it's correct, but I can tell you why I have the data and conclusions.

We have an artist (Max Centra) who loves posting on multiple sites that are public, images of their personal work, with a lot of detail about the work. He will answer information about everything that is commercial, except the work he did while at FDEV, that has the same background as the Eisler/Hodstock image, with the same type of robot, with imagery fits the current codex image for Raxxla. Even the dice markings are the same type (dice symbols for "hard" rolls) on his image created at the time he was technical director for ELITE DANGEROUS, same as the illustrated image from Eisler about Raxxla.

Given the markings, color, symbol, background desert, and robots nature, combined with the timeframe in which he created the piece and released it without labeling what it was in are all factors. I am not asking an unknown government group about classified things. I am asking an individual, about their life's work - which they made public.
