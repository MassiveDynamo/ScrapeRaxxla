Just a minor derail; There's an annoying bug, where your position in the view is 'flipped or reversed', so when you're on one side of the system, suddenly the orrery view shows you in a totally different place. Haven't found a way to fix it, it makes it hard to discover things like this using the view.
I often wonder if FD are intentionally making things buggy to make our life difficult...
Roll on Starfield!
