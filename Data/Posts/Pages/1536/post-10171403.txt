If the permit is not advertised as unknown, but identifies as being under the control of a faction, yet your allied, report it to Support as a bug and seek confirmation as to if it’s flawed or intentional!
I gave up on FD support years ago....

Edit:
There’s no earthly (!) reason why my report of a duplicated system name should have required player base support to raise it into the queue to be corrected. It should have been a 5 minute (second?) job for someone to go into stellar forge and give one of the duplicates its procedural name! Consequently it eventually was dropped and the duplication still exists...same with the other duplicates that have been reported over the years.
