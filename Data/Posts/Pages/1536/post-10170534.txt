That’s always a possibility.

Literally all historical FD statements are affirmations pointing towards Raxxla being in game, more so the inclusion of the Codex. However, all historical statements are still open to interpretation, so at most it a definitive maybe; because ‘in game’ can equate also to narrative content.

There does exist spacial relationships of specifically named systems in game which potentially marry those metaphorical descriptions in the Codex and concentrate upon a specific focal point, but these are at best projections, other parts of the puzzle avoid defining.

One simply needs to ask ‘why’ you quest? For many it facilitates a reason to actually play the game, above the base ‘shoot stuff and grind’ mechanics.
