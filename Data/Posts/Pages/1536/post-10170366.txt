Sooo...
I was 3 years in the black until taking a break 2 years ago, having played since 2015 on the old DK1 and then CV1 and just about to jump back in. (2.5 years actually)
In that time, have there been any significant developments or leads in the quest to find Raxxla? a simple yes or no will determine if I begin to trawl this page from where i left off...
Thanks Commanders
And in what year was the Codex introduced?
