Now that is interesting.

Memory and time play odd tricks, I always recalled this video as more dismissive! Ironically after some time seeing it and revisiting this I agree that FD do ‘seem’ to confirm it?

My incredulity needs further calming so I need to re-watch this a few times to let it sink in.

Asteroids and ringed belts would be a good location, roids pre-mining updates were rather dull affairs, it would be a perfect location, and would identify the ‘we know why it’s not been found’ assumption, because pre-updates these likely didn’t get much attention.

Interesting. *edit, how much of this statement do we think is just in jest?

Sorry to say Im still sitting on the fence on this particular video, as I do feel Will isn’t confirming anything, and that actually he’s being sarcastic saying yes it’s inside a roid, is it just a joke?
