Always been my take on things to stop those data miners, i think that one of those permit locked systems or even Titan could be unlocked with a certain trigger, but hey ho, part of me hopes we never find it, the thrill of the chase and all that

I did spot yesterday that the Triton permit is held by Mother Gaia...has anyone pursued relations with them with a view to getting that permit?

I spent a while today trying to drop out at the Pluto-Charon barycentre but no luck, & boring gameplay! Checked out a human signal on Charon but just a standard installation. Then tried to check out the Delphi Control Chapter installation nearby, on the basis that it is nearby, and the Greek original Omphalos was at Delphi, but got a trespass bounty & fed up with being shot at, so jumped out to Barnards Star to pay off the bounty. That installation is owned by Sol Constitution Party-sounds like a suspicious lot to me! Anyone tried shooting the heck out of that installation? The secret is supposed to be deadly!
