I dont see how you take "interest in new colonies" to be a significant, much less majority, amount of minor factions are actually fronts for the pilots fed.

They have a vast financial empire, but they aren't swimming in god-level money. Their wealth is still small enough to be able to be kept secret and hidden from public knowledge.
To me reading that means they have investment hedge fund money. Not amazon money. Obviously larger than those things are on earth now, but relative to the analogues of such in the elite universe.

I would consider their "interests" in fronting companies to be a small undisclosed amount. And this would be a means of Fdev creating backdoors towards secret dealings with the pilots fed, since players are well aware of the pilots fed that's labeled as such in the game. Scattered factions in the various powers that fdev would have the option of sprinkling local news stories that spawn missions or mysteries at their whim or if discovered by players.

Note that the bulk of their financial empire is used to pay for piracy control (and insurance claims) - which is their core reason for existing. That leaves much less for other "investments".
