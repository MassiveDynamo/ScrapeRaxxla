Agreed. If the ‘we must have got it from somewhere else’ rationale is in place for us, then it must also be for every other civilisation, which ultimately would mean it was never invented because no one could be the first to invent it.
that's not how invention works.

You can invent something and someone else somewhere else can invent the same thing at the same time or some other time having no information or interaction with the other inventor or invention. Both count as being inventors of the invention.

I dont buy the "we must have gotten it from somewhere else" rationale. I think it is within our ability to have invented it all on our own. And the evidence of that is that 2 other space faring races invented it all on their own. They did not build off eachother ... and there is no source species noted that the tech comes from.
