Is there lore conclusively establishing that Guardians or Thargoids are humanoid or insectoid outside of The Pilot's Federation Codex? The reconciliation could be as simple as the story of one is falsified to garner human sympathy for the war efforts with the Thargoids. It would not be entirely outlandish to suggest the "Thargoids" aren't actually a separate species but are the surviving nature-loving branch of the Guardians. Meanwhile, the technology loving ones were either entirely wiped out or mostly wiped out by the Guardian AI. If we are hiding that our technology came from the Guardians or Thargoids (whatever they are actually called) it would make sense that The Pilot's Federation lied about some of this especially if Faraway is in any fashion related to Raxxla and whatever that actually is at this point.
