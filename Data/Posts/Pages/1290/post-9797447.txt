I take the pilots fed "secrecy" aspect to be the lore's point of view of the pilots fed from the perspective of the elite dangerous public.

The goings on of the pilots fed are far less of a secret to their members, who are privy to these secrets. As noted by our access of the founders world and such.

the beacons are all told from this same perspective of an outside public. Not from the perspective of the player, who is as member of the pilots fed. (yes this is odd since these beacons are inside the pilots fed system ...but this is fdev story telling - it's not always going to make sense).

The Dark Wheel by contrast, is a secret faction to all, and likely mostly not even a name spoken outside of the pilots fed. This is secret to our perspective as players.

The Club is secret though partially exposed now after the events of solome.

The oddness with the pilots fed position and power is mostly i think just weak plot writing and not intentionally meta-misleading with false lore and what not.

I dont think there is much intention to leverage the pilots fed as a 'more than meets the eye' kind of entity in the game. I think they'll levy the dark wheel and Sirius corp and random other minor factions for any existing or future mysteries. I think the pilots fed is meant to be just what it says it is and will do nothing else. any attempt to create an ulterior motive for the pilots fed would result in a total collapse of the elite universe's way of functioning as the various military powers respond and that would basically be the end of the game as we know it.
