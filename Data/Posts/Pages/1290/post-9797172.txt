It was a conclusion people jumped to, not new canon, AFAIK.

I never thought it made particular sense, given that it was around 150 years or more between the reverse engineering of the Thargoid tech and the FSD entering production.

The reverse engineering of Thargoid tech fitted more timing-wise with the type 2a hyperdrive.

Then again, there are some potential reconciliations of the dates. The first reverse engineered Thargoid drives were fatal to human pilots - basically turning them inside out - so maybe it took all that time to resolve. Or maybe Sirius etc. just kept the tech to themselves for a long time.

Wasn't that in Almeida Landing in Conn? If so it further complicates the hyperspace lore as it talks about human hyperspace like it was already called Frameshift in log 3 of 6:

REVERSE-ENGINEERED 3/6

…Secure connection established…

I’ve finally made some progress with the drive technology, which is just as well, since I was running out of options.

Thargoid drive tech differs radically from our own. Rather than shift space around the ship, it appears to create this stable wormhole for the ship to travel through. It sounds crazy, but the maths don’t lie. And if my calculations are right, I might even be able to replicate it.

I want to get a prototype up and running as soon as possible. Something tells me the bigwigs are about to step in. I’ ve seen this all before – you get hired by a big company, and once you’ve gone and done the hard work they swoop in and take all the glory. Well, I’m not going to let that happen, I want to be credited with creating the first hybrid drive.
