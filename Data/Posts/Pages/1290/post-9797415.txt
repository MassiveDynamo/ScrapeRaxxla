Pilots Federation developed and are the owners of Universal Cartographers among a lot of other onboard systems on your ships, they manage the entire galaxys crime system (Like a sort of Galcop galaxy wide policing system) by issuing bounty's through systems from information of scans etc,

This above and much more is how they exist and how they have so much foothold over everything, How they designed or made all this tech out of nowhere however is the real mystery, its doesn't mean it makes no sense it just means shadowy things have happened to drive them so high in the corporate "food chain.

A good description for them would be like a more powerful, ever growing and multi billionaire Anonymous of our current time mixed with your local driving license government body and tieing in a somewhat private "stock market" via bountys, in the background id say the bountys issued they may get some secret profit from which boosts their earnings as they issue them galaxy wide through their systems, they can get all the information, pass it to whoever they want when they want and have many systems to do so, they just choose when, how and where to do it

While a good one.. the Pilot's Federation Interests beacon is the real clincher.
