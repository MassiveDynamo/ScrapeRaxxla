Is there lore conclusively establishing that Guardians or Thargoids are humanoid or insectoid outside of The Pilot's Federation Codex? The reconciliation could be as simple as the story of one is falsified to garner human sympathy for the war efforts with the Thargoids. It would not be entirely outlandish to suggest the "Thargoids" aren't actually a separate species but are the surviving nature-loving branch of the Guardians. Meanwhile, the technology loving ones were either entirely wiped out or mostly wiped out by the Guardian AI. If we are hiding that our technology came from the Guardians or Thargoids (whatever they are actually called) it would make sense that The Pilot's Federation lied about some of this especially if Faraway is in any fashion related to Raxxla and whatever that actually is at this point.

You can believe anything you can imagine if you believe that the lore we know from the game is just as imaginary and potentially false. Assuming info given by the game is worth anything at all, we would know for sure that thargoids are a separate species that went to war with guardians and is entirely separate from their civil war.
Especially considering that the civil war happened after. not before. You're flipping cause and effect. The cause of techno guardians vs amish guardians was the thargoid war and development of AI to defend against them. The effect was the development of two sects of guardians that embraced the new tech or rejected it.
