I would think this refers to just the factions that exist in Shinrarta - which is plausible. This statement wouldn't make sense for the human bubble in general. Factions stem from corporations and governments and are financed thru those endeavors. The pilots fed's purview is independent pilots. Not independent in the political sense, but in the sense of not employed by someone else. Only a fraction of human activity both on surfaces and in space are not working for someone else. Most pilots would probably be considered non-independent and most factions would likely have little to nothing directly involved with the pilots fed, independent or otherwise.

The pilots fed is like uber and we're all contractors and the bulk of ships out and about are regular taxi's - owned by factions and corporations and not members of the pilots fed.

They have a great deal of money from galnet and all that, but i dont think their influence and use of that money really extends into factions because of their desire to remain neutral and outside of the control of any larger faction.

and this description of them and how they came about and work is really at odds for how they are left to control things like galnet and permits. It's like for some odd reason the major powers and everyone agrees that they should control these things ....and that kind of unanimous agreement seems incredibly unbelievable in this universe.

You need to go read the Codex entry for Hengist Duval then go to Shinrarta Dezra and read every beacon in the system. This is not coming for a place of conspiracy nut tinfoil-hattery. I have seen the underbelly of human society in Elite Dangerous and it is deeply and profoundly messed up. Also, never take Vega Slimweed if you value your existence.
