as for the discovery (first hyperspace) coming so early... We were already creating generation ships and sending them off. Money and brain power was focused on space exploration. It didn't come about in a vacuum out of no where. It seems the barrier to hyperspace is not an energy one, but in some breakthru in understanding of quantum mechanics that allows us to leverage a certain kind of matter to traverse into hyperspace. This means it's less about a gradual incremental period of advancement and more something that could happen instantly at any point the requisite technology was otherwise available.

Edit: much like how the atomic bomb didn't require high technology to develop, it just required a better understanding of physics to know that we could do something with our current technology to exploit it. And like that device, it required the right kind of matter to do the job....not just any radioactive material would do.

I think this mirrors how hyperspace was intended to have come about in the elite universe.
