You need to go read the Codex entry for Hengist Duval then go to Shinrarta Dezra and read every beacon in the system. This is not coming for a place of conspiracy nut tinfoil-hattery. I have seen the underbelly of human society in Elite Dangerous and it is deeply and profoundly messed up. Also, never take Vega Slimweed if you value your existence.

I dont see anything that would indicate that the pilots fed bankrolls and spawned minor factions from any beacon text from Shinra. Have there been new ones added since 2018? Though, personally i haven't been to shinra since probably 2016, but i see no online snippets of anything that suggests what you are saying. Can you provide a reference?

I see only that they are holders of trade and galaxy navigation data and the embedded permit system. And by being outside of the jurisdiction of any powers and factions and only members know and can visit certain places under it's control, it's seen as a secret society. But only because 99% of the population is not in the pilots fed and never will be and has nothing to do with them. We're special as players. These "secrets" are not secret to us. It's not a secret to us - in fact we'd be seen as part of this secret group by everyone else in the galaxy.
