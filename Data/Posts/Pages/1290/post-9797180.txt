Considering that there is no evidence of human discovery of alien tech prior to the mars relic in lore, i would think we have to assume we discovered hyperspace travel similar to how guardians did, and similar to how thargoids did. They did not discover this tech from eachother. And the lore doesn't posit some progenitor race that everyone is stealing from.
Agreed. If the ‘we must have got it from somewhere else’ rationale is in place for us, then it must also be for every other civilisation, which ultimately would mean it was never invented because no one could be the first to invent it.
