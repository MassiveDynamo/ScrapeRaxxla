Out of interest what tool was utilised here, looks interesting.
Im using Sketchup - importing data from eddb or in the case of the codex maps im just using the ingame grid map to get locations then putting them in a table (csv) and importing into Sketchup - then once ive got the points placed i take it into Photoshop to pretty things up.
