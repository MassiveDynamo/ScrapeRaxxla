From the story of @earth-traveller I'm beginning to think that Raxxla might be really close to a star.
If he saw it in the nav panel, a planet/object named Raxxla would only appear if you're close to it.

He also stated that the system name was not much longer than the word Raxxla. That would leave mainly HIP/HR systems, not a Col 70 Sector BQ-D C23-2.
Grains of salt, etc.
