Im using Sketchup - importing data from eddb or in the case of the codex maps im just using the ingame grid map to get locations then putting them in a table (csv) and importing into Sketchup - then once ive got the points placed i take it into Photoshop to pretty things up.
My corrent views on this topic, after some investigation... I do belive this system is ither located on the right side of the bobble, or bewond and below (guadian space perhaps, coulsack, or more to the right?).
Note:;
-It seems to me that Fdevs intencionaly inverted the img so it would be harder to ID the system. (original is upside down)
-Notice the "dust shaped bird" that represent the stars gap (on the full galaxy map at the left.img) almost as no light on the left wing in the station view?
(this seems like a tangend view, as if you are looking at it from the right and not directly in front)

(keep in mind im no expert in trignometry.. i did all this only by looking at prespectives, and view points from galmap and alot of imgs trying to find the correct view point using the external camera)

(Please fell free to "math" the hell out of this, or use other tools to find it... i dont know how to use those ): :;
