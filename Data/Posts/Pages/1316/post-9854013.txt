Mission update: Operation Bubble To Barnard's Loop

Mission is still a go; I've created a Google sheet with system names 'near' the two systems: Synuefe GY-O C7-0 & Flame Sector DB-X c1-0 where you can assign yourself to a system. Please note that some systems are permit locked; mark them as such and skip to your next system.

PM me your Google account email and I'll add you to the list of editors.
For those who might want it.
