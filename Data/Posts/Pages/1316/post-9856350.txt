The following represents 3 groups of stars in correlation together. Orientation is galactic north/south, the XYZ coordinates are accurate however the star size is not to scale. All data is via EDDB, only star name shown here, any system names are not being considered.

White - all stars discovered up to to date 2296 (Sol is at the centre). Sol; Tau Ceti; Delta Pavonis; Altair; Beta Hydri; Eotienses and Achenar.

Red - Pandemonium (John Milton).

Yellow - Yggdrasil (Norse myth). Uroarbrunnr (heaven); Skuld; Veroandi; Jotunheim; Muspelheim; Midgard; Alfheim; Helheim; Hagalaz; Urd (Well of Urd (deepest void).



The following includes a hemisphere drawn from Sol (centre) to Achenar (furthest discovered). All stars bar 1 fall within this sphere of influence (not scale is not accurate so this star could easily be within the zone.



The following is the same set of stars but aligned along an axis between Uroarbrunnr and Urd to identify Yggdrasil (central axis line shown as dashed line).



This is a work in progress (legend notes will be added at a later date) it’s taken only a few mins to put together but I spent a few months locating a decent ‘free’ mobile app, as PC is in dry-dock.

Assumptions aside, my primary purpose behind this was to draw out Yggdrasil so as to visualise the work done by M Brookes, and to find some link to John Milton.

At present the only findings are that Achenar, Pandemonium and Urd are all within relative proximity to each other at the base, and that all stars (except two stars) all fall within the sphere of influence set by the 2296 date from the Codex. What it means is presently unknown.

Nice! Ya there do seem to be various themed clusters of stars … even some interestingly linked ( names) of planets within star systems. Looking forward to Yggdrasil !
