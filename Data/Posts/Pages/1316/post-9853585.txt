And yet some stars like Beta Hydrae and Beta Hydri are the same but in the game twice with different spectral classification (a G star and a B star). There's another one (something with 3 on the end) which is in twice and both are inhabited systems with different stats. Can't remember the name but might've been an engineer or material trader in one of them...
Lax quality control by FD when creating the Milky Way!
Couple of years ago I reported a duplicate system name but with totally different bodies out in IC1805 Sector; the issue report timed out and was dropped because nobody had supported it....I assume the duplicates are still out there.
