To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of all galaxies, to the whisperer of witch space the siren of the deepest void.

Could this indicate that the Jewel can be seen on the brow of the galaxy, from the siren?

The whisperer in Witch space could just be a nod to Dame Susan Jocelyn Bell Burnell. and the siren of the deepest void could well be the Crab Pulsar as its located out in the Eridanus Super void

Eridanus Supervoid Diameter 150 Mpc

So perhaps that system we are looking for between B/loop and California can be seen?
