I asked Will. I think its a fair question, TBH. I'm not asking for clues.
Don't hold your breath. It gets asked multiple times on just about every livestream. It has also been asked directly here on the forums several times as well. The response is always the same; a cheeky "We know what you're talking about but aren't going to say anything about it other than to make light of it."
