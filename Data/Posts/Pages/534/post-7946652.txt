Come on, that's not fair. It's pretty obvious they can't really answer that kind of question (IMHO).

If we're going down the customer-supplier view on this, then to flip it round, why would a supplier provide an answer to a customer that could potentially cause problems, mislead people, and possibly spoil things for other customers.

Edit - talking about the Raxxla side of things here. Also largely applies for TDW. Not so much for Gan Romero.

Edit 2 - just to be clear, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with asking!

Maybe I'm being inexplicably naive, but I cant see how it could spoil things for other players. I'm not asking WHERE it is.
Maybe its because I'm coming from a place of absolute certainty that R and TDW ARE discoverable. Gan Romero, just a place of hope in fact, the Gan confirmation I asked for was that it was fluff, as opposed to it was in-game
