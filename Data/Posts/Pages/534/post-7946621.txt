Thats a bit crazy. You would think that a customer could ask a supplier if their product implements a specific feature and get a yes/no answer.
Come on, that's not fair. It's pretty obvious they can't really answer that kind of question (IMHO).

If we're going down the customer-supplier view on this, then to flip it round, why would a supplier provide an answer to a customer that could potentially cause problems, mislead people, and possibly spoil things for other customers.

Edit - talking about the Raxxla side of things here. Also largely applies for TDW. Not so much for Gan Romero.

Edit 2 - just to be clear, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with asking!
