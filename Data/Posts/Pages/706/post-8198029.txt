So a pilot achieves an Elite ranking (which is supposed to be top tier and super difficult in the ED lore), be given access to Shinrarta Dezhra by the PF where The Dark Wheel faction grants him the ability to buy everything at a discount at a station they control and yet somehow he should doubt that an organization with this level of influence and power in the entire Galaxy is not the real TDW?

Mmm ok...

Elite Premonition by Drew Wagar was, I think, commissioned by FD, certainly they must have had a say in what it went into it:
“Shinrarta Dezhra?’ The woman laughed, her scorn plain to hear. ‘You think the Dark Wheel advertises on a station board in plain sight? That we need rookie pilots to drag a couple of tonnes of thrumpberry flavouring across to Hutton Orbital? A trivial ploy to keep the Founders off our backs.’
‘I’m gratified to hear it,’ Thorn replied. ‘You had me worried for a moment.’
‘It was a little too obvious,’ Lestenio agreed.
‘It keeps the treasure seekers and wishful thinkers occupied,’ the woman said. ‘They believe they are onto something. They have their uses for occasional menial activities. The truth is far more subtle than they will ever suspect. Shinrarta is merely a front.’
‘So …?’
‘You should not consider the Dark Wheel a single organisation, gentlemen. How could it survive for so long if it were? The Wheel has many levels, many hubs, cogs, gears and spokes.
“It is more akin to an affiliation of organisations that share certain common goals. Interlocking in purpose. Consider yourselves now spinning on the outermost rim.”

So TRDW maintain Shinrarta DW as a front, the outermost rim....
