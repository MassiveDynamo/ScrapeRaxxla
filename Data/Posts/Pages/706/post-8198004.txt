has anyone tried doing the opposite of what's obvious, and gain negative reputation instead with the suspicious factions? like the supposed "fake dark wheel" faction? maybe that could be a way to prove aptittude to the real dark wheel and be messaged by them. i always had this thought but never actually tried it myself. im far away from the bubble now, to try any of this sadly.

So a pilot achieves an Elite ranking (which is supposed to be top tier and super difficult in the ED lore), be given access to Shinrarta Dezhra by the PF where The Dark Wheel faction grants him the ability to buy everything at a discount at a station they control and yet somehow he should doubt that an organization with this level of influence and power in the entire Galaxy is not the real TDW?

Mmm ok...
