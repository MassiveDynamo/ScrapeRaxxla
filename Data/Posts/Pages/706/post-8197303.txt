Coma Berenices is the galactic north pole, as viewed from earth. It's 'UP' in the galactic plane, like Polaris is 'UP' in the celestial sphere.
The 'other' North is flat in the galactic plane. It's a top down view of a 2D galaxy.

It's a bit confusing with three norths.

l: 0 b:0 is sometimes north (Sag A)
l: 90 b: 0 is sometimes north (in Cygnus)
l: 0 b: 90 is sometimes north (in Coma Berenices)

Thanks. Well that's confusing.
