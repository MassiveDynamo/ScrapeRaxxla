So, any outcome from the livestream? Anybody submit the Quest questions? Do we have any clarification??
Watched the livestream but they werenâ€™t answering questions, just a look back over the years. I enjoyed it as it brought back a lot of great memories and reminded me how great of a community we have.

My tinfoil senses were tingling when Paige showed her favourite edition of Sag Eye magazine that had the Winking Cat on the cover though!
