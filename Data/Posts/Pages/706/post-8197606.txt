Sure I heard somewhere the dust from core roid mining will last for a few days, dunno if it its separate to the roid respawning or not, sure that takes longer so rings can become depleted.

Ill go and have a look anyway coz the installation may be unusual and I want to check the mechanics out, will report back with no findings and conclusions later Im sure.

Im not joining YT or Twitch or any of em to be able to chat just to enter the comps but if someone could ask em to turn up the volume it would be handy please.
