That's odd. I've only ever heard of the galactic coordinate system with Sag A as galactic center and galactic north at Coma Berenices.
Ya I have directional issues... i am a believer that much like our planetary north pole the galactic north should be on an arbitrary spot somewhat close to the axis of rotation.
