So, any outcome from the livestream? Anybody submit the Quest questions? Do we have any clarification??

afaik nobody asked anything or they didnt answer any Qs i dont think, had it on in background so didnt see most chat. Missed first 20 mins and sound was rubbish as usual...1 Star

Edit: almost as good a certain British critics review 'Worst show I have ever seen' (he gave the tickets to a friend and didnt go to the show at all, got sacked for it)
