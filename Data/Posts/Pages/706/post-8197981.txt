has anyone tried doing the opposite of what would seam obvious, and gain negative reputation instead with the suspicious factions? like the supposed "fake dark wheel" faction? maybe that could be a way to prove aptittude to the real dark wheel and be messaged by them. after all, like how the codex sugests, if you are a hidden member of TDW, trained from childhood but forgot about it years later, thinking and acting like how a real member would, could be seen as a proof that you have regained your memory about being already member of the DW, and your acting on it by silencing any fake impersonators that usurp their name. i always had this thought but never actually tried it myself. im far away from the bubble now, to try any of this sadly.
