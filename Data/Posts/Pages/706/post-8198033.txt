So a pilot achieves an Elite ranking (which is supposed to be top tier and super difficult in the ED lore), be given access to Shinrarta Dezhra by the PF where The Dark Wheel faction grants him the ability to buy everything at a discount at a station they control and yet somehow he should doubt that an organization with this level of influence and power in the entire Galaxy is not the real TDW?

Mmm ok...

we know that the dark wheel likes secrecy, like top tier secrecy. and for them to have a base in that one most famous, and first system you get access to as you achieve elite status, doesn't sound like how the real DW does things around. it's way too easy and in the open. besides, nothing much seems to come from that faction other than some normal missions. people have tried everything by now, and surely something would have come up if they were legit.

but who knows...
edit: also what Jorki Rasalas said above.
