Again, what is the total number? The probability of these being generated from an automated naming catalogue seed is more likely the higher that number isâ€¦
Is there a way to find informations about the number of how many of that stations there are?

And on EDSM there ain't any informations about them.
Will ED Discovery give me informations about that?
