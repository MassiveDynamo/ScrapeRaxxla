I agree. But that does not mean that an article about Raxxla should contain clues for finding it.
It is my understanding from a lore perspective, that Codex is maintained by The Pilots' Federation and maintained through them. Canonically, Elite Pilots' Federation is part of the upper echelons of that organization. Codex serves as a public and not so public (your CMDR Archive is based solely on your actions) record of major events in the galaxy.
