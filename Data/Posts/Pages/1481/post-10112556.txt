I came across these again, when searching Arcadia on Inara.
Good find O7

Again, what is the total number? The probability of these being generated from an automated naming catalogue seed is more likely the higher that number is…

If that number is finite - let’s say within a hundred or less I might be more inclined to suspect they were manually inserted, but I’m presuming they’re not?

I’ve noticed FD utilise finite naming lists to construct small areas with a defined shape, eg Yggdrasil, John Milton, Celtic underworld, sunken lands or lost kingdom’s…

In those examples those areas seem to have defined borders, but they also are not expansive, they haven’t used ‘every’ name, choosing to omit certain names over others, some are rather obscure. I’m presuming this is intentional…

Again this could be an illusion - the human mind misinterpreting data into patterns or filtering it with bias.

A good example is: System LTT 606, Marianne's Journey to Arcadia.

The phrase ’Mariannes journey to Arcadia’ is from the novella ‘Elysian Dawn’ (Marianne is another name for Mary), however the dates of publication don’t marry that of those of Backer pledges regarding name insertion etc, also when I spoke to the Author they had no knowledge of ED…

But…

If you plot LTT 606 in relation to Persephone and Demeter / Tau Ceti etc and discovered systems up to 2296… one might think it correlates?



It might, it might not… let’s see what else is out there which might link to Arcadia or Mary Sidney?
