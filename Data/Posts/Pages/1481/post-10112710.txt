I don't get it. Is it the developers or the players?
The CMDRs. Even amongst staff and writers that worked for Frontier Developments, most have been actual CMDRs. Most contributions to the Raxxla mythos were CMDRs themselves (Robert Holdstock, Drew Wager, and others). Frontier merely made the fan-lore canonical. In fact, a very sizable portion of the rumors about Raxxla predate the first game IRL.
