Currently there are inter-modal comms in game via your friends list and the chat window in the main game. I can't see why squadrons would be any different. Instancing filters shouldn't affect comms, I wouldn't think.
Well, I've set up a squadron in the Beta, 'The Rifters Lounge' if anyone wants to join and test out the functionality.
