Well, I've set up a squadron in the Beta, 'The Rifters Lounge' if anyone wants to join and test out the functionality.

Lavian brandy at member’s rate? Cheese straws? Petit Fours?
tempting, but I don’t beta test
Set aside a bottle for me & I may catch up after the release.

How’s the Phantom shaping up?
