Lavian brandy at member’s rate? Cheese straws? Petit Fours?

Set aside a bottle for me & I may catch up after the release.
Don't know if I'll set it up in live, but if I do, I will!

How’s the Phantom shaping up?
No idea, I'm afraid, I'm still mainly doing exploration testing in my DBX! Also, a wrist injury's written me off from combat or any other non-sedate flying for a little while, so I'm not going to be able to take anything out for a proper spin!
