It's invisible to sensor, and you have to fly there from the nearest system, in supercruise. Should only take you two weeks... assuming you know where you're going.

Come to think of it, a system that our sensor can't pick up and that doesn't show on the galaxy map would count as "a place that isn't a place"...
