Now this is technically the 3rd instance the word Raxxla is officially used in game… (ED) first being Brooke’s book ‘elite legacy’; 2nd instance was the Codex…
It (as in "Raxxla") is also periodically mentioned in NPC chats at station concourses, bar, and fleet carrier bars. Listen to NPCs. Sometimes they have hints in the random conversations.
