Now this is technically the 3rd instance the word Raxxla is officially utilised in game… (ED) - first time being Brooke’s book ‘elite legacy’; 2nd instance was the Codex…

“As a girl she’d even dreamed of being the first pilot to discover Raxxla. Her father disapproved of such tales when she’d been a child. Even so, the desire to head into deep space called to her.”

Now the fact that FD apply this actually into the Artemis system, the same system used in Brookes book, I find as astonishing.

To some this might look innocent, but from a data collection perspective this is big, thanks for posting. There is more here and goes towards establishing relationship links against other intelligence gathered!

If we’re looking for clues, this is it.
