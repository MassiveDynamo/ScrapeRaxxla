That’s brilliant - do we know if this is being merged with Legacy, I’d love to check these out, I REALLY think this system holds some secrets
Not a scooby on Legacy as i haven't played it since Ody released.
Soon as the servers are up tonight i will move my carrier back to the bubble from the Proteus site to see what this new station holds.
Really busy atm with RL and will be full on stupid hours at the Bloodstock festival from Monday so short on exploration time except when the stages go down

Not getting hopes up but maybe just maybe this could be the start of a drip feed by Fdev towards more.
