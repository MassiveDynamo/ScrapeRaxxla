It (as in "Raxxla") is also periodically mentioned in NPC chats at station concourses, bar, and fleet carrier bars. Listen to NPCs. Sometimes they have hints in the random conversations.
As someone who is not in Odyssey and Legacy only, if there is NPC chat in game, directly concerning Raxxla, that is new information.

FD has hinted at ‘environmental storytelling’ as being potentially involved (indirectly).

If such a thing is an actuality this also needs to be recorded, and the context established.

ANY in game information which is ‘current’ naming Raxxla directly IS relevant. Please share!
