As someone who is not in Odyssey and Legacy only, if there is NPC chat in game, directly concerning Raxxla, that is new information.

FD has hinted at ‘environmental storytelling’ as being potentially involved (indirectly).

If such a thing is an actuality this also needs to be recorded, and the context established.

ANY in game information which is ‘current’ naming Raxxla directly IS relevant. Please share!

I will try to get a recording but it comes up randomly when in the Odyssey station concourses. It is therefore quite hard to capture on a spur of the moment sort of thing.
