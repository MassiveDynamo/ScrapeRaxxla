I will try to get a recording but it comes up randomly when in the Odyssey station concourses. It is therefore quite hard to capture on a spur of the moment sort of thing.
Don't know how to do it but if you can find out how to just capture audio, you could always be recording a small audio sample each time you go to areas like concourses. Shouldn't take up too much space and if at the end of a session you've not heard anything just delete the files.

Then you can use something like audacity to snip out the section of interest to record it.

If you can capture the steps as a set of instructions, all Raxxla hunters can also engage
