Also described as a golden chain in the Illiad:

"Hang me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it all of you, gods and goddesses together - tug as you will, you will not drag Zeus the supreme counselor from heaven to earth; but were I to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth and sea into the bargain, then would I bind the chain about some pinnacle of Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid firmament. So far am I above all others either of gods or men."

The golden chain being the axis mundi...


Nice to see what they did for MB and also curious if these new Brookes Tours take us somewhere interesting....
