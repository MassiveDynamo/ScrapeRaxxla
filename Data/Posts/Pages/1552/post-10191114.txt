I will try to get a recording but it comes up randomly when in the Odyssey station concourses. It is therefore quite hard to capture on a spur of the moment sort of thing.
O7 By definition it won’t be random, it’s a game, there will be a loop or algorithm to establish when such utterances occur. If one cannot record audio - as this is a tall order for some, jotting down ‘the jist’ is enough to get the ball rolling, to give others an ear-worm to keep an ear out for, the rule of the many-working together would make short of establishing the accurate transcription - as some of us have access to certain tech / skills / experience over others.
