Let's bet. I say the full equipped CarrierX will cost... 10 billions.
10 very boring 650 void opal loads or less with a cutter or type 9!

I think I need to find a better mining place though. Mine are too small.

You know, it may only cost around 500m. It's potentially a lot of empty space with all those docks and whatnot. 8p

Hopefully the core is cheap and we can use it to gather funds to improve it.
