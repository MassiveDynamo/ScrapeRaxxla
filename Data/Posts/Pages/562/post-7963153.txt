It might be if raxxla is hidden in a place we can only reach with the new ship. We could get as complete a list as possible and go visit it all. 8)

How many new stars would that open up? Any particular high interest targets?

I sadly won't get the money in time to get first visits more than likely. I only have 250 mill. And probably 1-2 bill in assets in ships.
