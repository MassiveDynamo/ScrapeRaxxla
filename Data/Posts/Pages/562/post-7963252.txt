Let's bet. I say the full equipped CarrierX will cost... 10 billions.

10-15 is the speculation on FB. I'm fully willing to start mining soon. If I can afford one in Dec I'll tell. Anyone on PS4 who wants to get a licence to land on it. Feel free to tell. I'll grant one.

Concerning Helix: I have visited several systems. All mapped, nothing remarkable. Currently on my way back to the bubble. Will visit Leesti and afterwards start mining in the hoped to survive this incredibly boring business.
