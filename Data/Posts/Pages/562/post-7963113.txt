Cool !
What about The Cone ? (Cone Sector FN-J B9-0 ) ? Will it be reachable ? Still unlocked ? (Currently at work... can't check it.)
Mmmh.. The Gnosis, 551 Ly of jump range... I bet our Carriers will be too short ranged
All of the Cone systems got locked (at the same time).

There’s an odd version of events that went round which focused on the system you mention, but there wasn’t anything special or unique about it, it was just one of many. The only thing to distinguish it was that it was the system picked to be visited by the Gnosis, and hence was the one that got talked about.
