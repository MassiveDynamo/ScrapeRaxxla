Heard about a ring with 4 overlapping VO hotspots in a High tech system with a station < 10ls from the arriving star within 3 jumps from SD. Never found it though.
However:
SPOILER: HOTSPOTS





























Which one has the biggest VO hotspot? I'm only worried about size as I don't mind flying to stations to sell since I want max price.

I'm assuming this is not a secret. But hermitage has 4 hotspots on one ring(not overlapping) of not so large size. Unless VO hotspots are always smaller. Still not big enough to fill 650t cargo though. Not efficiently.

I bet once these ships are out VO spots will be more public. There will be a lot more that are much easier to reach and probably be like other information. I bet spots in the 10's of k will be common to mine if these can jump conveniently.

20 jumps is easy. Even if it takes time per jump it will be nicer if I don't have to keep pushing buttons every 30 seconds... Jumping is annoying over large distances if you are trying to get places quickly.
