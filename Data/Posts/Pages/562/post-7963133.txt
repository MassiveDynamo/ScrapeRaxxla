Semotus Beacon will no longer be the furthest place we've been.
I can finally visit my favorite places I could never reach. I have lots of stuff on my bookmark lists I have meant to reach!! 8D

One place in particular it would interesting if we can reach. A weirdly unfinished place. I bet it's more than 500ly though.

I don't know how I saw 500ly and didn't think exploration limits being increased. I'm visiting everwhere now that I don't have to jump only 80 ly. It will make exploration absolutely worth it.
