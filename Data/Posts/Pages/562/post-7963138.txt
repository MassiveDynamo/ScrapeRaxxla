I can finally visit my favorite places I could never reach. I have lots of stuff on my bookmark lists I have meant to reach!! 8D

One place in particular it would interesting if we can reach. A weirdly unfinished place. I bet it's more than 500ly though.
This and this alone is the reason why fleet carriers hold any interest for me.

But I have quiet fears that a) I'll never have the CR to afford one and b) the new material that fuels them and the requisite amounts of it will be simultaneously thin and unpalatable to the point that I will never have one.

But this thread isn't about that...back to topic.
