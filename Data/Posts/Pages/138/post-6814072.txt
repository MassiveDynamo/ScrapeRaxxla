What's even more cryptic is MB's Phrase "It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." Does that mean that there is a Special way to find it, and everyone who wants to find it has to follow a specific procedure, otherwise it won't unlock? This would sustain the theory that it's in a Permit locked sector, and some requirements have to be met to unlock it, and "everyone has to travel for themselves" because once it has been found by one, the others following will have to meet those requirement.

Well ... lets dissect Michael's statement: It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves.

What if he was being overly literal? Is there some journey in the game that simply can't be bypassed? It can't be LHS 3447 ... I know I didn't start there in my original account so there was nothing to force me to journey there. It can't be Shinrarta Dehzra because not everyone becomes Elite and becoming Elite doesn't force you to go there.

The only journey that I can think of that you absolutely HAVE to take is the one into witchspace (unless you never leave your starter system which would be kind of pointless).

Of course ... this is just assuming that MB's statement should be interpreted literally.
