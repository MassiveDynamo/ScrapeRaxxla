Well ... lets dissect Michael's statement: It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves.

What if he was being overly literal? Is there some journey in the game that simply can't be bypassed? It can't be LHS 3447 ... I know I didn't start there in my original account so there was nothing to force me to journey there. It can't be Shinrarta Dehzra because not everyone becomes Elite and becoming Elite doesn't force you to go there.

The only journey that I can think of that you absolutely HAVE to take is the one into witchspace (unless you never leave your starter system which would be kind of pointless).

Of course ... this is just assuming that MB's statement should be interpreted literally.

If I was going to take anything literally from that comment, it would be that the criteria for finding Raxxla are different for every Cmdr - "for themselves"

Or, alternatively, it's just a parental way of saying "I'm not going to tell you".
