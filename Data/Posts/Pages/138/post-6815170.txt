The Dark Wheel faction is in SD. (Same name as the title of the book 'The Dark Wheel', by RH, featuring a certain mythical celestial body called Raxxla...you know that sooo well, Doc. )

I treat the 'Dark Wheel' faction the way I do the 'Children of Raxxla' - they're just a bunch of people who chose a 'cool' name and don't have any more knowledge than the rest of us.

Also, to Cmdr Jaiotu's point, you don't have to be Elite to go to Shin - KS backers get access.
