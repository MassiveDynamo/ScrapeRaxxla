TDW faction is FDev made, afaik. Which makes quite a pretty difference imho. Or should we then treat Sirius Corp your same way too?

*(Why have I the strange feeling that some of our excellent and veteran fellow threaders suddenly may want us away of SD and TDW ??? Is there anything they are...obfuscating ??? )*

Sirius Corp isn't a shadowy, secret organization, unlike the REAL Dark Wheel.

If I wanted to run a secret organization, I'd definitely set up a public one with the same name. Perfect obfuscation.

IIRC the devs have told that the system has been visited. Don't remember if it was even honked, but Raxxla itself wasn't scanned anyway.

There's no known source for that rumor, so take it with a pinch of salt.
