Not sure if this has been stated before, but here is the supposed origin of the raxxla idea(according to the internet searching I just did.). Did anyone use this info to try to find it?

"The Eye Of The Beholder. A Raxxlan projection which appeared above the primitive world Winter D, populated by sentient, but unadvanced insectoids. The Eye became an overwhelming symbol of the evil that stared from the heavens, so disorienting the creatures that the Oisir-Raxxla were able to build their structure and depart without life being lost."
Painting by F. Jurgen Rogner.

Any equivalence to this in the game?

I also found this image. I can't read it completely and I don't know what it is from.(Apparently clicking on it helps!)

This is also interesting but I'm assuming it is related to the formadine rift. Unless they are related.

Out of curiosity, if you follow the nose of the Zurara where is it pointed? Can't get in the game still because I'm on linux.
