If Raxxla cant be stumbled upon, then it must be in a permit locked area. The only other option is some wacky procedure that could not be guessed. wait for x and y to align, pass through the rings of z and follow the north star till morning. I dont think thats the case because it would not be possible to figure out without clues.
"A journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." Makes me think of some unspoken requirement. Perhaps there is a fourth Elite status that is tracked but not shown, or some other way to obtain a permit.
I accept the "little bit obvious" to be more obvious than not. If its as menial as a small site on a planet will let you know, it would be possible to know the planet, look for hours and still not find it. I believe Raxxla will be identifiable from orbit at least.
