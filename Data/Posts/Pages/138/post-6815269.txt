I treat the 'Dark Wheel' faction the way I do the 'Children of Raxxla' - they're just a bunch of people who chose a 'cool' name and don't have any more knowledge than the rest of us.

TDW faction is FDev made, afaik. Which makes quite a pretty difference imho. Or should we then treat Sirius Corp your same way too?

*(Why have I the strange feeling that some of our excellent and veteran fellow threaders suddenly may want us away of SD and TDW ??? Is there anything they are...obfuscating ??? )*
