Not sure if this has been stated before, but here is the supposed origin of the raxxla idea(according to the internet searching I just did.). Did anyone use this info to try to find it?

Any equivalence to this in the game?

I also found this image. I can't read it completely and I don't know what it is from.(Apparently clicking on it helps!)






This is also interesting but I'm assuming it is related to the formadine rift. Unless they are related.



PLAA AEC IZ-N C20-1, PRU AESCS DL-W C15-37, EAFOTS EU-R C4-1

Not sure what this is but it looks cool. Tower of Isokix.





Out of curiosity, if you follow the nose of the Zurara where is it pointed? Can't get in the game still because I'm on linux.

Tbh I like the idea of photos or images as reference to Raxxla.

Take a look at this: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?...0200703120236208.1073741825.1107456896&type=3

Basically itâ€™s Michael Brookes back. But the Lovecraft reference always makes me think...

I tried to get some of the Raxxla references together with the Cthulhu Myth but... well... naaaaah...

Perhaps you have some better ideas.

Good luck commander
