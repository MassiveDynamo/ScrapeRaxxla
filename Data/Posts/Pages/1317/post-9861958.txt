if you are half way, anychange you are near sagitarios A?
I would like to discart this idea, if you have the time.
SAP 8 containers = Sag A Planet 8 C ? or Star A planet 8 c ?
We are nowhere near SagA*, CMDR. Sorry.

To your idea, SAP 8 containers aren't in the game anymore that I've been able to detect. And there isn't a planet 8 at SagA*. Only a supermassive black hole and white giant. No planetary bodies.

@Macros Black , will log back in over the next week. On my own little RL expedition at the moment. o7
