We are nowhere near SagA*, CMDR. Sorry.

To your idea, SAP 8 containers aren't in the game anymore that I've been able to detect. And there isn't a planet 8 at SagA*. Only a supermassive black hole and white giant. No planetary bodies.

@Macros Black , will log back in over the next week. On my own little RL expedition at the moment. o7
I think SAP 8 are still in-game in the usual place in the military convoys in systems in War.

I also think SAP 8 containers have been in dumped the BH in Sgr A* with no effect.
