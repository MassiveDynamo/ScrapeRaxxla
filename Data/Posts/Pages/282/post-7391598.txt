Hm. Might the Siren be the Morrigam/ Banshee? Not too profound myself in ancient irish mysticism.

I wouldn't pretend to be even slightly certain, but there is a significant difference between a Siren and a Banshee, in that a Siren sang beautiful songs in order to lure people to their deaths, and a Banshee's keening was a terrible thing to hear that portended a death rather than actively trying to cause it.

Incidentally, and probably not relevant to here, but Banshee do not scream - the Banshee was a small female fairy (Ban sidhe) that would cry / keen in a particular place when there was going to be a death in the family with which the Banshee was associated. That was why hearing a Banshee caused such fear; not because the wailing itself was scary, but the consequences of it were.
