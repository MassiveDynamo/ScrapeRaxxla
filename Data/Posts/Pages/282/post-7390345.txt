I do not see him hinting about writing numbers down. Can you find your source?

Thats the wrong one. this interview:

“I think the last game I completed was perhaps Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture. It’s quite a strange, very relaxed game, but by the end I was desperate to know what was going on. I’d gotten a bit hung up on the strange number sequences you get during the game and avidly wrote them all down, but even after the credits I was none the wiser…

On that note, though, we have numbered stations in Elite: Dangerous! You might want to write those numbers down.”
