Commander PublicStaticVoid's independent investigation into the mystery of Raxxla


Preface:
To the commanders who have been to Raxxla already, what you seek to keep secret I seek to unearth... To all the explorers out there searching, we aren't done yet... To the troll master and his group of petty assassins who will undoubtedly attempt to disrupt peaceful scientific research and exploration into Raxxla "Press [X] to doubt" and move along.

"As for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts"

Well it was on my doorstep...

Currently tailing an Anaconda by the name of 'Child' at Nysa. There are some other interestingly monikered NPCs here too including an apt named agricultural installation called 'Slow Bull Produce'.
