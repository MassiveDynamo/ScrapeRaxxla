*tinfoil* if CMDR Staticwhatsoever did actually find something Jambe might be the next system of interest. She was the person who made Demeter laugh again. Though I think correct spelling would be „Iambe“. *tinfoil off*
.

Note that Iambe is associated in that story with the goddess of mirth, "Baubo". If memory serves, she is where the term "bawdy" comes from, as she was associated with "dirty jokes" which were usually sexual in nature. Depictions of Baubo were sometimes of a woman holding her legs apart; this is recognisable as a form which appears in many Irish churches, and is known as a Sheelagh-na-Gig.

There is a system called Sheelagh-na-gig.

I need some more tinfoil and some sleep to develop that idea further
