So I posted some very odd chance encounter after following a lead, with a picture. Next time I logged in, no matter if Iwas in open or public I couldn’t see other npcs or players anywhere. Multiple systems had no npcs and the stations rejected my docking. Closed elite reopened same behavior. When I deleted my post and joined solo again then npcs loaded and stations let me dock. I support globally distributed server infrastructure for a living and this gave me chills, it seemed either an immaculately timed coincidence or a warning.

Frontier has a responsibility to expose certain gameplay behavior to its player base so we don’t see conspiracy around every corner. FDev needs to be much more open about their processes when we are dealing with their mysteries in game.
