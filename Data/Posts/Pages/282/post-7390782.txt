SPOILER























As I've exhausted all possible channels through which I can contact you, I hope you read and think about this, CMDR Guru951.

First, foremost and above all, the 46&2 still miss their friend and brother, their leader. We still worry about your health, and hope that you are safe.

Second, this is a game. If you have found hidden content and are not bound in any way to secrecy, then the decision should fall upon each individual Commander, if they want to have this content spoiled for them. Perhaps there is a way we can help you with this burden. Either way, you're not - and don't have to do this - alone.

We're still waiting. Always. You know where to find us.


Take care,
- CMDR Puffler
