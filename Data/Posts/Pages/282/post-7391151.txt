Commander PublicStaticVoid's independent investigation into the mystery of Raxxla


Preface:
To the commanders who have been to Raxxla already, what you seek to keep secret I seek to unearth... To all the explorers out there searching, we aren't done yet... To the troll master and his group of petty assassins who will undoubtedly attempt to disrupt peaceful scientific research and exploration into Raxxla "Press [X] to doubt" and move along.

Had an encounter with the same NPC "Child" flying a viper mk3 in the Persephone system, he appeared whilst passing the planet Kore, unfortunatley after following the NPC around the system for around 10 minutes he eventually crashed into the star and vanished, got a fealing the NPC names are just random, one thing I noticed was alot of private couriers flying around the system. maybe worth checking out what cargo they are carrying, unfortunatley this is my second account so flying an un-enginereed Cobra 3, probably not upto pirating in it atm
