I need something more powerful than a tinfoil on this, but here I go:

Has anyone thought Raxxla could be a planet made of Dark Matter? Well the story is older than the discovery of dark matter and dark energy, however it's stated before, stories evolve as the game develops.

Today, we know galaxies couldn't have existed without dark matter, there wouldn't be enough mass for the gravity needed. This, amongst the other evidences, did lead us to think there must be something we can't see with some mass to create gravity to hold the stars in the galaxies together. Scientist called it dark matter, because we can't see and/or interract with it, because of its unknown nature. - not to be confused with anti-matter -

Then there's string theory, though it's completely a different and much deeper concept, says that all things are made of little strings that vibrates and give them their characteristics depending on the vibrations' power, wave lenght etc. It also says there could be another parallel universes take up the same space as our universe but vibrates in different channels so we can't see and interract with them.

Could there be a device we can grab in TDW's station that we can install in our ship, allows us to interract with the dark matter which would lead us to some riches and Raxxla? Maybe Thargoid technology will reveal something, we don't understand how they manipulate witchspace and travel through space-time.

Mother of Galaxies, deepest void, we don't know what it is

Oofâ„¢ tinfoil wasn't enough
