*tinfoil* if CMDR Staticwhatsoever did actually find something Jambe might be the next system of interest. She was the person who made Demeter laugh again. Though I think correct spelling would be „Iambe“. *tinfoil off*

One thing I‘d like to add on all the Eleusis stuff: Though I have read a lot of stuff about what happened outside Eleusis I never found much about what actually happened there.

One thing else: During AFAM initiation there is a partt where the candidate is warned to be aware of a rift/abyss. Though nothing with Omphalos.
