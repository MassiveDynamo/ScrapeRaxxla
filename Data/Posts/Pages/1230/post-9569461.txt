Yep, I reported that asteroid belt at centre of Sol bug back circa 2016!
And no Pulse Wave Analyser until quite late in the game. I think Raxxla is difficult to find but has always been findable.

My latest hypothesis has been in Sirius:
permit locked!

Jewel on brow->Sirius (brightest star in the night sky & high overhead in UK!),

whisperer in witch-space (Sirius Corp FSD expertise, planet Lucifer, Lucifer whispered to Eve, Lucifer & witchcraft)

siren of deepest void (the abyss is an unfathomably deep or boundless place, the underworld, Hell, & Satan whispered temptation to Eve. “In Paradise Lost, Satan falls from the heavenly spheres, plunging through nightmarish limbo for nine days, and landing in the depths of Hell”)

Lucifer (the morning star, the planet Venus (associated with Hesperus (!), Ishtar, Inanna’s descent into Underworld (MB tattoo?)), “light-bringing”, son of Aurora “the Dawn”)

And the codex logo could represent Lucifer covered by cables to gather energy from the NS, while the hexagonal dotted line and centre circle could represent Marco Gwent’s engineer base. Looked closely at Gwent’s base. Looked in the large craters on Lucifer, scanned Lucifer and Waypoint. Searched around the centre (omphalos=hub) of rotation of Sirius.

Edit: oh, and Sirius A & B have rotation period of 50 years! (That’s why I changed my forum avatar to the Hubble telescope pic of Sirius A & B )
And some strange in-game discrepancies:
Sirius A age 400 million years, IRL 242 MYr
Sirius B age 11,140 million years (why so much older than A?), IRL 228 MYr

Lucifer 0.05 Earth mass, radius 2,403 km, gravity 0.35G (was pondering if it’s hollow, bit didnt compare with any similar planet (too much brandy!)

edit2: checked it against other HMC of similar radius and gravity-mass is nothing out of ordinary so not hollow!


But sadly nothing to report!
