Agree.

When presented with competing hypothesis about the same prediction, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions.

It would seem to be the most obvious of solutions obtained from the Codex. I myself have done similar search patterns but found nothing, it doesn’t mean there’s nothing there. Raxxla likely has to be found within close proximity, or it doesn’t appear on scans, or needs a visual identification (scanner mk i).

The ‘great potato hunt’ still could resolve a result, but again it’s dependant potentially upon Raxxla being directly interacted with or the viewer knowing they may have to scour every inch of said system.

If we conclude the Codex is a genuine clue indicating Raxxla is within a 10,000 system bubble, it’s possible the codex gives additional hints to further drill down the location.

Our assumptions about various clues may be better attributed to this selected area.
