From lore do we know the range of the early interstellar unmanned probes? I suspect Raxxla may have been found by one of these. According to the ED Timeline “hundreds of automated probes were sent to all nearby systems”, which suggests hundreds of systems were explored remotely. However the Timeline and date of Raxxla first rumour also suggests Raxxla should be within a bubble encompassing Sol (permit), and the first colonies of Tau Ceti, Delta Pavonis, Altair (aka Alpha Aquilae), Beta Hydri (permit), Eotienses, Achenar (permit), & maybe Arcturus.

I suspect that Raxxla is hidden & difficult to find, but that is based on searching Sol (previously reported reasons, based on flimsy evidence and I freely acknowledge that reasoning may be flawed). It is also possible that Raxxla is hidden elsewhere in this bubble but is not so difficult to detect.

Alpha Aquilae is a possibility from the Greek legend of the Omphalos (codex reference) and Zeus’ two eagles.
Achenar is 139.5 ly from Sol; Spansh system search suggests 10,000 systems in that radius!
