Jokers Deck, Supratech, Xiona, Winking Cat, and a “derelict warehouse” that is actually a luxurious palace on the inside, all mentioned in one chain of articles!? My goodness! My tinfoil is piqued again after a year or so away.

Has anyone been able to decipher this treasure trove of metaphors? My cursory glance is that Jokers Deck is either The Club or The Wheel, the derelict warehouse might be the derelict Wheel station thats out there somewhere. The article also mentions that the event takes place in different locations so there’s a hint at relocation.

Winking Cat is involved too!? Not sure what to make of it yet but Winking Cat is a favorite of Fdev for a reason right.

One things for sure, whatever they want us to find probably looks mundane from the exterior.
