The planet Jupiter has a system of faint planetary rings. The Jovian rings were the third ring system to be discovered in the Solar System, after those of Saturn and Uranus.
The rings of Uranus are intermediate in complexity between the more extensive set around Saturn and the simpler systems around Jupiter and Neptune.
The rings of Neptune consist primarily of five principal rings and were first discovered (as "arcs") on 22 July 1984
