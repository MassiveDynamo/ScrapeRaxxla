I believe it's Chambers who wrote the King in Yellow in which Carcosa is featured. H.P Lovecraft was inspired by the King in Yellow in some of his stories. I read alot of Lovecraft and I don't think Carcosa was ever in any of his stories, unless I missed something.

I find The Doom that came to Sarnath to be one of my favorite stories he wrote
