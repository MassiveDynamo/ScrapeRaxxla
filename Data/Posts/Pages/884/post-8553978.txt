Hey guys, first off I'm not the most up-tp-date with the progression to find Raxxla, but I know people try to find ways to get contacted by the Dark Wheel currently.
I just listened to the Codex entry of the Dark Wheel and one of the first thing being mentioned is that the woman speaking claims she knows that they exist because all attempts of people that claim to be from the Dark Wheel are being silenced.

Has someone tried to Roleplay or act openly like they belong to the Dark Wheel even if they don't? Maybe that would trigger something.
Sorry if that has been suggested before but that topic really interests me lately!
