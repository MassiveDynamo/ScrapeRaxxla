Hi Folks.

Back on April 18, I posted on this thread that I was thinking about attacking Club-related minor factions as a way to knock something loose with respect to The Dark Wheel/Raxxla.

I've been tugging on that thread ever since, trying to make it easier for commanders & squadrons to find ways to damage the Club in the course of their normal gameplay. What started as a text list became a spreadsheet and is now a fully functional web app with a lot of bells and whistles.

If that sounds interesting to you, please do check it out. I'll keep this post brief, but here are the relevant links:
