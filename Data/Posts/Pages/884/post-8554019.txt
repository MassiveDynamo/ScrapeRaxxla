Hey guys, first off I'm not the most up-tp-date with the progression to find Raxxla, but I know people try to find ways to get contacted by the Dark Wheel currently.

If they are "fake" then the "real" Dark Wheel should step in and shut it down.
The project is called "Turning the Wheel" and has been mentioned on several popular podcasts and even the Cannon Research site. If you haven't checked it out...
