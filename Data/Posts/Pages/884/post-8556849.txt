Sorry to go a bit off topic, but I was rather shocked when I pulled into Begal Point this evening to find that the 2x tourist beacons are now accompanied by 2 x fleet carriers, 4 NPC cruise whales and an NPC pirate! I'm 65k ly from the bubble getting scan by a pirate and then slaged off for not having anything worth stealing!!!!

I was even more shocked when I had almost finished dumping 1/2 billion of UC data when I noticed the (after 25% carrier fee) at the bottom of the congratulations on being first to discover screen.
Ye...if you want 1st discoveries, I was on "3 Geminorum", coming back. That is line 14000ly, however, to go straight u need 80ly jumper with jumponium or carrier. Any way, both sides before and after "voids" have never visited fields of stars. Thouthands . Best was 5 stars = 20mil + 35% fees for carrier and npc pilot.
