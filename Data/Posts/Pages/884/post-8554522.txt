Well that's useless, you can't SC to other systems. "The system map and galaxy map don't take account of you having moved to the location of the next star system." Because you need to switch to their instances server-wise by jumping. And the system marker is updated real time, it always shows the relative location of the targeted system but the skybox is fixed.

Yup... this trip was only to rule out anything different to other systems... nothing surprising from my point of view and this is not the journey everyone has to make for themselves! ;-)

We move on to the next rabbit hole! ;-)
