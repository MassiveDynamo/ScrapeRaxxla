I believe it's Chambers who wrote the King in Yellow in which Carcosa is featured. H.P Lovecraft was inspired by the King in Yellow in some of his stories. I read alot of Lovecraft and I don't think Carcosa was ever in any of his stories, unless I missed something.

I find The Doom that came to Sarnath to be one of my favorite stories he wrote
Using this site we find this,
"The Whisperer in Darkness. It mentions the Lake of Hali, the Yellow Sign, and Hastur.
I found myself faced by names and terms that I had heard elsewhere in the most hideous of connexions—Yuggoth, Great Cthulhu, Tsathoggua, Yog-Sothoth, R’lyeh, Nyarlathotep, Azathoth, Hastur, Yian, Leng, the Lake of Hali, Bethmoora, the Yellow Sign, L’mur-Kathulos, Bran, and the Magnum Innominandum—and was drawn back through nameless aeons and inconceivable dimensions to worlds of elder, outer entity at which the crazed author of the Necronomicon had only guessed in the vaguest way. I was told of the pits of primal life, and of the streams that had trickled down therefrom; and finally, of the tiny rivulet from one of those streams which had become entangled with the destinies of our own earth."
