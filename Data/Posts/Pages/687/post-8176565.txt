if it means anything, granted it’s not just some random person deciding to post it and they actually know something, there is a jewel mentioned here, a Ruby. Could be reference to the toast or perhaps to the really red star in the Codex entry. Either way virtue could be Virgo, and comely shape, Coma Berenices. They’re quite close together (from our vantage). Vindemoatrix of Virgo (probably called by a catalogue name in game) and Diadem of Coma Berenices being the closest two points between them. I do know that irl anyway there is a large red giant star in that area of the sky.
