Thereâ€™s a hidden rep bar for the PF? Interesting. How did you learn of it and how did you go about checking your progress?
some players who did rescue missions/ killed thargoids have received messages saying that their reputation has been raised to cordial with the pilotsFederation. just like the ones you get when you work on a random minor faction in a system. but that specific "PilotsFederation" faction is no where to be seen, doesn't show up in any system unlike the other pilots federation off brand ones that exist in some systems here and there. (like the local branch in shinrarta) thats how they first knew about it. you cant check on it's rep progression, you only get a message, when you progress to the next rep rank cordial/allied etc... it's certainly interresting.
