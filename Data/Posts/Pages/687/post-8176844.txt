Went to check out LFT 926. There is an installation in belt 1 but it’s not called the dark wheel nor is it under their control. It’s just called “civilian installation”. Seems a bit of creative editing on our friends part perhaps.

Ok so the installation itself is not called The Dark Wheel, that is my fault for misreading the original post.

The controlling faction of the Asteroid belt cluster is The Dark Wheel. I can also confirm this personally. It is unusual because the other belt clusters in the system are owned by the systems controlling faction.

On inspecting it myself, the Civilian Installation does seem to have a name;
Jailhouse Rock & Blues Bar. This is under TDW control. The installation only shows as Civilian Installation in the contacts list, but if you use your Navigation panel you can see the actual name.

The main thing that should be taken away is there appears to be a kind of hidden installation. This may set a precedent for other hidden assets in asteroid belts. Although it could just be a bug due to the proximity of the belt cluster to the installation.

Regardless if it is a bug or a feature, who knows what else could be hiding in these commonly overlooked areas of space?
