Both of you are mixed up.

There is an installation in LFT 926 B A Belt Cluster 1 aside from the Jailhouse Rock & Blues Bar which is unnamed and under the description says The Dark Wheel. I've been there before. The screenshot is in this thread from FullM3talX .
I was literally just there. Dropping into the Asteroid Belt cluster puts you about 20 clicks from the Civilian installation as labelled in the contact tab. If you look in your Navigation Tab and lock to Jailhouse Rock & Blues Bar, it takes you to the exact same installation. I will go and have another look to take screenshots if that helps explain.




In regards to CD-43 11917 (CQC Permit) the system is pretty bare. No landable planets, one ELW named Ares which is where Attilus orbital is located.

Attilus Orbital is an Orbis station (My favourite) and has the luxurious interior with palm trees and gardens. My dirty old Asp looks way outta place there haha

Controlling faction is CQC Holdings. No interesting news articles or missions available.

There is a Megaship currently in system, DJA-009 Freedom Class Surveyor. There is also an installation named White Cattle Harvests.
