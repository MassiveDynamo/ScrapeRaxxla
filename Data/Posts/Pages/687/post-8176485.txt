May be of no consequence whatsoever but I was searching several social media sites for fellow people interested in Raxxla etc and I came across an account this is named simply The Dark Wheel, Location of posting Sol joined very recently. Anywho they have no posts on their feed but their profile description is simply a code in octal. Decoded it reads “Well in the ring there is the Ruby sett,” which is from astrophel and stellas first edition print which one the title page reads “Well in the ring there is the Ruby sett, where comely shape, & virtue both are mett.”
