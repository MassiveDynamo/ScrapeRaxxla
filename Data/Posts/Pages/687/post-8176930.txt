i scaned it the normal way by targeting it and looking towards it's general direction. it ocasionally gave some data stuff used for engineers. i didn't notice we can recon limpet on it aswell or maybe i missed it. can we? i'll check once im back as im doing some guardian ruins at the moment.

@Noobilite
that amplifier looks hella suspicious! haha. those drawings on it... i wander if we could extract anything from it.
Oh I’m not sure if it can be hacked via recon limpet. Thinking about it probably not as nothing indicated sub targets like other data points do. Just curious if you could scan it as normal data link scanner wouldn’t work for me.

There’s a hidden rep bar for the PF? Interesting. How did you learn of it and how did you go about checking your progress?

Others have known about it for a while, but I personally only learned of it recently when turning in combat bonds from destroying Thargoids. Upon turning in the bonds I got a message saying my reputation had increased to cordial with Pilots Federation. I don’t think there is any way to check your progress besides the messages upon reaching the next rank.
