That could literally be the location of Raxxla. It is also a type of amplifier for guitars What if it's refering to an amp inside the rock and blues bar. What if the dark wheel and other explorers were just music junkies.

Gaining rank with all of the pilots federations was one of my goals. Still haven't got it yet. There are a bunch of different pilots federations also.
Haha I would not rule it out completely! I know I personally enjoy listening to Rock music whilst I am out in the void. The image on that amp looks suspicious as well...

Forgot to mention in my previous post about Jailhouse Rock & Blues Bar that there is a Satellite attached to the installation, which you can lock onto from the belt cluster. I couldn’t scan it though, I didn’t have recon limpets with me at the time. Do you remember scanning that Satellite?
