I was literally just there. Dropping into the Asteroid Belt cluster puts you about 20 clicks from the Civilian installation as labelled in the contact tab. If you look in your Navigation Tab and lock to Jailhouse Rock & Blues Bar, it takes you to the exact same installation. I will go and have another look to take screenshots if that helps explain.




In regards to CD-43 11917 (CQC Permit) the system is pretty bare. No landable planets, one ELW named Ares which is where Attilus orbital is located.

There is a Megaship currently in system, DJA-009 Freedom Class Surveyor. There is also an installation named White Cattle Harvests.

Right my bad. I am there now. But I swear the Jailhouse Rock & Blues Bar was way off from the civilian installation last time I was here.

When you first drop into the cluster, it shows The Dark Wheel under description. When you target the civilian installation, it just says installation.
