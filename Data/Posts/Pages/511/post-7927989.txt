Could somebody point me to the source of this quote? I thought it was from Robert Holdstock's The Dark Wheel, but I just checked that out and didn't find it.
It does credit Holdstock in The Holdstock Report, but it doesn't indicate where it came from.

SPOILER


I'm thinking this is from the dark wheel novella. So far it's the only one that I've actually finished reading I'm on and here the wheel right now but I haven't finished it and I know I've read that text somewhere before. so with Robert holdstock as the author of the dark wheel novella and him being credited for the quotes I'm certain it's from the dark wheel.
