The galaxy map is a very entertaining tool in this game. Last night I had a two hour window marked for Elite, and instead of doing my usual job of jumping and probing I spent those hours exploring the map. There are a LOT of strange whispers, chimes, dings, and other audio distortions depending on how much you're zoomed in, where your cursor is placed, what star you've clicked onto, etc. I even tried zooming in to Sag. A* and holding the rotation hotkey down to make my own "spiraling stars". I started to see some craaaaaaazy images doing this. An optical illusion I'm sure... but boy, what a fun evening!
