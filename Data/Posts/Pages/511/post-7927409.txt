What are your sources of info about the club (in this depth). Sorry for noob-ish question but I started playing just after the rift mystery and never fully caught up
Primarily ED: Premonition. I recently got around to finally buying and reading it, and it is a mind blowing treasure trove of info about the Club. I used to believe that our knowledge of TC was nebulous at best, but i didnt realize this book contains entire chapters detailing Club meetings and such.

Edit: i've talked a lot of smack about Drew Wagar in the past. Really, this vitriol was fueled by the ways FD handled his narrative. I realize now i was at fault and cannot endorse his book more. Excellently informational and entertaining read.
