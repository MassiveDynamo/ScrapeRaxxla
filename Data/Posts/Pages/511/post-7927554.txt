...nothing even remotely out of the ordinary.
Such a secretive (The real Dark Wheel) organisation wouldn't show itself doing anything out of the ordiinary, logically. That's the reason and meaning of having SD TDW so visible. The apparent top of the iceberg.
The more I think to it, the more I am afraid we can't have any kind of interaction with TDW until we are tested and invited... if there is such a thing implemented in ED !
I would love to be proven wrong, though.
