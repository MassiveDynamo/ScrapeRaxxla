I would assume it would not be access to the station but the system. This goes against the Codex entry but that entry is just mere speculation in itself being the word of a journalist. If the station is indeed 'dark' then it HAS to cloak itself due to regular traffic jumping to and from the system. I would not place it in a heavily populated system either. The station might be able to mask its signature but the ships won't.
And jumpable stations. Well, that's been proven to exist and I would not put that technology past this group.
You wouldn't necessarily see the traffic going TO that system if they always jumped in via a third, non-populated / anarchy star first and coming back the other way there's no way to track an origin.
