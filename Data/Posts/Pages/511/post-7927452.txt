I did encounter a Dark Wheel npc at one of the SD moons, can’t remember which. It showed interest in any cargo I might be carrying (wasn’t), then it just bumbled around as they usually do until I lost interest and waked away.

SD is the obvious place for TDW station (need to be elite to get the permit, though the npcs often aren’t-odd!), but it might need a bit of searching; I’ve not seen any signs of it. Beginning to think it might not be orbiting an 8th moon! Started to look at other moons also when out exploring. If the Horizons start screen is a clue, then it’s by two close icy moons.

Over the course of several days I followed every TDW ship I cam across in SD until they were no longer trackable. Nothing panned out, nothing even remotely out of the ordinary.
