TDW are part of the PF.
I dont think there is any evidence that TDW are evil. It was a member of TDW that was assassinated for gaining evidence of Raxxla.
Government evil...almost certainly...but the corporations worse. Sirus, Aegis,etc

I truly hope we are not TDW. That would be such a cop out. It would ruin the game for me
High end covert operations typically recruit from within existing ranks based on whether or not one can be trusted to keep their mouth shut or some kind of leverage / blackmail device / evidence is in place...
