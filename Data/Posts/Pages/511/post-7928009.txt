Could somebody point me to the source of this quote? I thought it was from Robert Holdstock's The Dark Wheel, but I just checked that out and didn't find it.
It does credit Holdstock in The Holdstock Report, but it doesn't indicate where it came from.

SPOILER


This came from an earlier Holdstock book in 1980 under a different pen name: Steven Eisler.
