If ( and I am agreeing with Noobilite post here ) there is an explorer spirit here then I think we to look into the history of Elite and maybe study the Codex a little more. How did a bunch of people find Raxxla? Why and how was the Dark Wheel formed? These guys did not have the technology of what we have today. So tracing back history and lore might be a key.
We might think ourselves mighty explorers but back then the Jump Drive was a difficult thing. I have noticed that using max jump range I am visiting the same systems I went to before. Ie, I retraced my steps ( in a longer range ) ship back to the NGC nebulae and I was back in systems I had previously explored, now in a ship with a 30+ extra ly jump range. Almost like the planning uses waypoints. Back in the day the most powerful of ships ( with a drive ) had a maximum of 7ly. Perhaps that is the key. Perhaps if we go old school and plot the progression of colonization and exploration history-wise in something the original pioneers did then that will set us on course.
Replying in an RP style to try and take into consideration some of the concerns expressed recently about the 'been there done that' crowd...

It's always good to look into history cmdr. I can't promise you'll find anything which will lead to that which you seek, but you might find other things, and who knows what they might reveal.

Some final advice,
Even before the B of the Bang you have begun.
Beware the assumptions of others.
