That's the other problem with the DW missions; we don't know how accurate those quotes are. 1) they're in-universe rumors, so even if we aren't being lied to, they could still be wrong 2) there's the possibility that they're not referring to Raxxla at all, but to Soontill. We could be looking in entirely the wrong places. And 3) the missions were taken down, so we can't be sure if they still even count.
