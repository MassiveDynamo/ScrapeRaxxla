Some Guardian dropped a note at my desk. I don't get that triangle stuff. What does it say?

Looks like a Hexagram 62:

"Thunder high on the Mountain, active passivity:
The Superior Person is unsurpassed in his ability to remain small.
In a time for humility, he is supremely modest.
In a time of mourning, he uplifts with somber reverence.
In a time of want, he is resourcefully frugal."
