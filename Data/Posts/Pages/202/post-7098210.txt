The Rift story line insofar is it was packaged as a set of clues leading to the remnants of the Dynasty Expedition ended with the death of Salom√© but that's not a very satisfactory conclusion to the wider mystery of the region. As Rebecca put it (perhaps channeling Roy Batty), "Let's just say there was some serious sh:t out there, stuff you wouldn't believe."

There are two permit locks way out on the rim on the other side of the Rift for a start.

Edit: I don't think there is currently, pre 3.3, anything more to find there but I would be surprised if the region isn't revisited.
