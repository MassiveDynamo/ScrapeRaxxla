The FRift storyline was a subset of the Raxxla arch.

I don't think so. Drew Wagar repeatedly said that he had not received any inside info on Raxxla, from FD. I believe this was the case for all the writers.

The FRift story has never excised as a stand alone thing. It's just a location in Salom√®'s story. Only the Zurara sets it apart from Hawkin(g)'s gap and the Conflux, in the main story.

In essence, it's all Thargoids.
