1) group of elites (must be elite to unlock permit if not backer)

2) everything is there (ships, modules, etc.)

3) place that isn't a place
- not entirely sure how this one fits in unless you count the fact that the system has two stars that "orbit each other"...making the center of the system technically nothing

4) door that is also a key (only way to get there is to UNLOCK the permit)

5) seat of the single most powerful and influential group in the galaxy - The Pilot's Federation

6) The Dark Wheel is there

7) "Everyone must make their own journey" (long way from nobody to elite)

8) "...tiny little bit obvious"

Maybe I'm crazy. I see everyone chasing bugs and the formidine rift, the dark wheel, guardians, etc...and the more I read the more I see those are all connected, but not in the OMG conspiracy kind of way.

Yep, you’ve got space madness. The FRifters know the formidine rift storyline died last year with Salomé.
