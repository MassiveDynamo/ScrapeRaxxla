For once in the history of Elite, we might actually get proper lore on Raxxla. I'm rather happy! We'll finally be able to put a face to the enigma one of these days... All of us actually finding Raxxla, imagine that.

I just hope my previous ramblings about it being Founders World aren't right... I was on some pretty powerful stuff back then.
