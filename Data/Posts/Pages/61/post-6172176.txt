Or...it's a bug. Like Mitterand Hollow. That has already been reported.

I've put 44kly's on the clock looking for Raxxla. I'd love to find it as much as any of us, but let's not turn nothing into something.

This is the problem with looking for anomalies - when you find one, there's no way to tell if it's deliberate or a bug.
