Something is definitely hauling the Castellan Belt Cluster 2 along at 1.36Mm/s. The belt cannot be locked and jumped into like other locations from the Nav Tab. I managed to get within 1Mm range and then emergency drop, but without a Safe disengage ready message. Whatever object is driving the belt is also ghost-like, i.e. no face planting emergencies happened.

I discovered this Cluster as well before beginning my Expedition for Raxxla out in the black. I witnessed a CMDR by the name of Nobleman Zero make it into the cluster. He messaged me this, when i asked how he made it in and what was in there;
"I eyeballed the orbit, got a little bit ahead of it, made many runs, then managed to "disengage". It was clutch. Nothing of interest in there: same as the rest."
So, i guess its just a glitch, or something unfinished?
