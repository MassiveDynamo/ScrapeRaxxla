I discovered this Cluster as well before beginning my Expedition for Raxxla out in the black. I witnessed a CMDR by the name of Nobleman Zero make it into the cluster. He messaged me this, when i asked how he made it in and what was in there;
"I eyeballed the orbit, got a little bit ahead of it, made many runs, then managed to "disengage". It was clutch. Nothing of interest in there: same as the rest."
So, i guess its just a glitch, or something unfinished?

Maybe it's not the asteroid field that's of interest here; the asteroid field is moving, and it can't be doing that by itself, if we can find what's pulling it along, we might find either Raxxla, or part of the puzzle. I would try myself, but I'm 10Kly from the bubble, and not returning anytime soon...
