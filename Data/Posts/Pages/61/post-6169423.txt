Are you seeing the same behavior as that shown by Mitterand Hollow?

It orbits so fast that you can't actually keep up with it since your frame of reference in the central body - have to get in front and wait for it to arrive.

difficult to tell, as not enough reference points. I experimented for over 30 mins trying to get close. You get within about 15Mm then stick there. increasing throttle gets you closer but then you stick again, repeat until about 6.6Mm away then can't get any nearer. My ship will not allow me to increase throttle any more once at minimum distance.
