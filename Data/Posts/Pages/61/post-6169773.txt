Something is definitely hauling the Castellan Belt Cluster 2 along at 1.36Mm/s. The belt cannot be locked and jumped into like other locations from the Nav Tab. I managed to get within 1Mm range and then emergency drop, but without a Safe disengage ready message. Whatever object is driving the belt is also ghost-like, i.e. no face planting emergencies happened.

Would it maybe be possible to try and approach it from the other direction? If you were to turn around, last minute, you would probably have a few seconds to safe drop inside it (though you would have to turn around, accelerate, and wait for it to pass you - either that or get 'too close' and emergency drop)

However, IF something is pulling the asteroid field around, I though we may find clues inside the field, it would be more helpful if someone found exactly what is pulling it - and where to find it. Just because it isn't near the field, doesn't mean it isn't there - this is something of a 'gravitational anomaly' - something that shouldn't be there, which possibly points to Raxxla. If we consider that maybe it's only travelled to Lave recently, maybe that's why nobody's noticed this before? Either way, good luck everyone!
