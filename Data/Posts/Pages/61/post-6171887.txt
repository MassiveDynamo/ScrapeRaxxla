Sounds like a fast orbit. I'm also miles away so can't check, but it'd be worth seeing if there's anything there that does not have a concentric orbit with Lave - perhaps whose orbit is being stretched by another body hitherto unfound.

Or...it's a bug. Like Mitterand Hollow. That has already been reported.

I've put 44kly's on the clock looking for Raxxla. I'd love to find it as much as any of us, but let's not turn nothing into something.







Also, I prefer my crow medium rare, with a side of mushy peas...should the need arise.
