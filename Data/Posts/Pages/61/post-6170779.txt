Maybe it's not the asteroid field that's of interest here; the asteroid field is moving, and it can't be doing that by itself, if we can find what's pulling it along, we might find either Raxxla...

Sounds like a fast orbit. I'm also miles away so can't check, but it'd be worth seeing if there's anything there that does not have a concentric orbit with Lave - perhaps whose orbit is being stretched by another body hitherto unfound.
