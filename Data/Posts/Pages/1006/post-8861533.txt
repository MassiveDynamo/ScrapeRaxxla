No, if you watch the DB video he specifically talks about recruitment into a secret society within game. Fairly confident he was referring to TDW.
Yes maybe, you could be correct, but DB has said things in press releases that were a little off narrative e.g. 'numbered stations' instead of 'number installations'... he's the CEO and its a press junket, liable to be a bit 'poetic' with the truth, embellish and trying to sell the game.

No I politely disagree. From my perspective he was iterating permit locked systems. Not some secret society. In game permit locked systems are secret. He was just embellishing.

Its been a long time time since launch, if it were important they would have given us more clues (other than Codex). Im simply following a line of simple logic; the practical solution would be to hide the resl DW in a permit, Raxxla also, the more I see the more I'm inclined to believe its all locked behind a narrative as well.

We haven't found it because either A: its ridiculously simple and we're over thinking it. B: no one has found the permit. C: the permit is locked behind a 10 year narrative. D: its not much big a deal to FD. E: its some hand waving maguffin thats totally different to everything else and therefore impossible to find eitherwith a clue or some mysterious one of a kind invitation.
