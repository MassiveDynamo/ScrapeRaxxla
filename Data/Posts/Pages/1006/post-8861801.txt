Yes maybe, you could be correct, but DB has said things in press releases that were a little off narrative e.g. 'numbered stations' instead of 'number installations'... he's the CEO and its a press junket, liable to be a bit 'poetic' with the truth, embellish and trying to sell the game.

No I politely disagree. From my perspective he was iterating permit locked systems. Not some secret society. In game permit locked systems are secret. He was just embellishing.

Its been a long time time since launch, if it were important they would have given us more clues (other than Codex). Im simply following a line of simple logic; the practical solution would be to hide the resl DW in a permit, Raxxla also, the more I see the more I'm inclined to believe its all locked behind a narrative as well.

We haven't found it because either A: its ridiculously simple and we're over thinking it. B: no one has found the permit. C: the permit is locked behind a 10 year narrative. D: its not much big a deal to FD. E: its some hand waving maguffin thats totally different to everything else and therefore impossible to find eitherwith a clue or some mysterious one of a kind invitation.

Just to point out, the first example wasn’t actually off at all, people just jumped to the wrong conclusions / got the wrong end of the stick.

What DB said: ‘we have number stations in the game’. Some people took it as ‘numbered stations’. That’s not what he said or meant.

He meant what he said. We do have number station-esque things in the game. He was talking about the Unregistered Comms Beacons.
