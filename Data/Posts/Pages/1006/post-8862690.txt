Mmm, just read the galnet post about engineers boosting upgrades for a short period and not sure how to interpret it. Can we now engineer a level 5 fsd for even longer range (& how much improvement?)? Or weapons for even more destructive power/lighter weight/greater efficiency?
G5 needs 5 rolls instead 7 to complete (and all below are lower too).
