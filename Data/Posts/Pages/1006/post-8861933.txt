Good Job Cmdr Macros. i am sure this will lead to something. Dark wheel made some intresting reading last night and certainly fits with the mission descriptions.
Which leads to the legend the myth of Raxxala. Somehow all the pieces of a bigger puzzle will fit together when we work it out i think, the Sap 8 containers, the location of the door to a place thats not a place. possibly the UA may be needed there. The trinkets of fortune i am unfamiliar with.
Raxxala was a planet not the system i gather from the fiction.finding it wont be easy ( hardly likely to still be called raxxala ) and only the Elite would find it. If you havnt read the dark wheel , certainly worth a look.

some other supporting evidence i found Raxxala is real.

I'm going through all 1000 pages here and this is for me interesting:
"Michael's comment about the sequel to dark wheel. We did look at a story involving Raxxla, but felt that was a story that should be played out in game rather than as a novel."
