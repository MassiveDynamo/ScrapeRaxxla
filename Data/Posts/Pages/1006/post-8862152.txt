Just to point out, the first example wasn’t actually off at all, people just jumped to the wrong conclusions / got the wrong end of the stick.

What DB said: ‘we have number stations in the game’. Some people took it as ‘numbered stations’. That’s not what he said or meant.

He meant what he said. We do have number station-esque things in the game. He was talking about the Unregistered Comms Beacons.

True. But he it was quoted in press:

Found it: https://blog.eu.playstation.com/201...id-braben-on-his-favourite-titles/#sf79162914

DB: "On that note, though, we have numbered stations in Elite: Dangerous! You might want to write those numbers down.”

A simple miscommunication by DB. FD later responded to this incident confirming DB meant to say 'number' not 'numbered'.

My point is we cant base an assumption of either a misheard statement nor a miscommunication.

He may have alluded to 'secret societies' but what does that mean. Not a great deal, I was simply proposing its as likely he was gilding the lilly a little regards to 'permits'.

Side note:

Always thought it amusing that on the original BBC interview, RE the Raspberry Pie DB used the word "obfusticated".
