Thank you for the correction.
As a matter of interest, do the six permit locked systems in the bubble have a central point, a hub or nexus of some sort?
As I understand it, and again I open myself to correction, according to Holdstock's work as Steven Eisler, Raxxla (at least I think its Raxxla) is alleged to be anchored at the focal point of five pyramidal lenses. Is there a map of these six permit locked systems? Might these six systems be five Talmor lenses and Raxxla?
I'm sure this has already been debunked, just wondering what the outcome was before trawling through ten thousand pages of speculation...

All I could find was this text:

You’re very welcome. I do try to be helpful, as are most people in this thread, but sometimes I might come across as a bit short-tempered, don’t mean to be! Depends on coffee/brandy/sleep/arthritis levels!

I listed the bubble locked systems somewhere earlier in this megathread (search in-thread for Witch’s Reach), but there’s a separate thread on permit locked systems which is worth keeping an eye on https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/updated-permit-list.122593/.

Not seen a map of them but easy enough to set markers on them in galmap. Remember doing this a while ago while trying to follow NPCs jumping into them (they can, we can’t) & didn’t spot any particular pattern, but admittedly I wasn’t thinking of one. I gave away my copy of that Eisler book, it’s not my sort of scifi, but nice hypothesis re the Talmor Lens locations! Check it out in galmap & let us know!
