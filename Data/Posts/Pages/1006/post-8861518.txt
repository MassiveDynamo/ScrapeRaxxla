door that is also the key

Whenever I see this quote it reminds me of a reddit comment from 2 years ago. Golden gate station in Alioth, which on the system map looks like a part of the key.
EDIT: Speaking of subtile clues. Golden gate also coincidently is orbiting Bifrost gas giant, commenter mentioned it being a bridge in norse mythology, that connects gods world with humanities world.

SPOILER: CLICK
