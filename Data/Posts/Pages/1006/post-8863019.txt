Whenever I see this quote it reminds me of a reddit comment from 2 years ago. Golden gate station in Alioth, which on the system map looks like a part of the key.
EDIT: Speaking of subtile clues. Golden gate also coincidently is orbiting Bifrost gas giant, commenter mentioned it being a bridge in norse mythology, that connects gods world with humanities world.

SPOILER: CLICK
I like this idea a lot. Not sure as to how it should be approached or what we’d look for there but great thinking nonetheless. This would also seemingly tie into the right side of MBs back tattoo, the portion that appears to be the pearly gates being a hint to Golden Gate. I still find it very curious that an image of Adamastor was discovered on the left side of tattoo and we just so happened to receive an in game ship named Adamastor mentioned in the super cruise news skit that mentioned a Raxxla discovery around the corner. That’s a mouthful.

I’ll admit I was discouraged when I found out New California was renamed to Argents Claim but this idea could still explain the magazines on the desks of the presenters. The magazines were two regarding Alioth and one about Winking Cat, which also took place first in Alioth.

Thinking out loud again.
