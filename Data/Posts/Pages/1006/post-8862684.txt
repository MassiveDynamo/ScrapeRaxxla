Yea, it’s intriguing isn‘t it! There really should be a strong storyline associated with TDW, but then it’s strange that the only real lead on it was the original Elite missions (see first page) from Shinrarta Dezhra which seemed to disappear a while ago; though some devs have suggested they’re still in-game (but nobody has reported seeing them!).
It’s a tricky one. The issue with that strong storyline is it needs squaring off against the fundamentals of the game:

- game progresses in real time, (current date, time GMT +1,286 years**)

- no do-overs or replays of major events / narrative

- we’re not the heroes, we’re all just the same rank and file members of the PF as everyone else by default.*

*I know there’s the letter in the manual, but that needs some squaring off itself - unless basically every single PF member got the same letter.

**I know you know this already, I’m just including it as it’s useful to have the number to hand for reference sometimes!
