Mmm, just read the galnet post about engineers boosting upgrades for a short period and not sure how to interpret it. Can we now engineer a level 5 fsd for even longer range (& how much improvement?)? Or weapons for even more destructive power/lighter weight/greater efficiency?
I think it something to do with using less materials for the same effects. Like using 4 Imperial shielding instead of 6 to reach same grade.
