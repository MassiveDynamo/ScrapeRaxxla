I'm going through all 1000 pages here and this is for me interesting:
"Michael's comment about the sequel to dark wheel. We did look at a story involving Raxxla, but felt that was a story that should be played out in game rather than as a novel."

Yea, it’s intriguing isn‘t it! There really should be a strong storyline associated with TDW, but then it’s strange that the only real lead on it was the original Elite missions (see first page) from Shinrarta Dezhra which seemed to disappear a while ago; though some devs have suggested they’re still in-game (but nobody has reported seeing them!).
