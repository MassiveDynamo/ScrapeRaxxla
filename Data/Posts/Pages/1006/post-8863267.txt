I'm still interested to see how they'll deal with players just squashing commanders with space ships (which i will 100% do whenever possible). you can't exactly explain away being ground into the dirt with magic escape pods anymore. And i presume your walking around body is an actual body and not a cyborg avatar-style clone we just happen to have on our ships.

Its just part of the circle of life ...errr Sphere of Combat.
