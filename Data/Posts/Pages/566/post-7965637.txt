That second coordinate("Col 285 Sector CB-V b3-3") is next to 65 Andromedae and HD 17092 and HIP 14264.

In fact a triangle of andromedae. 63, 64, and 65. A triangle oddly similar in shape the one we're using now. But facing in the opposite direction somewhat and flipped over I think. Technically, I think it would have been rotated to face the other way 180 degrees.
