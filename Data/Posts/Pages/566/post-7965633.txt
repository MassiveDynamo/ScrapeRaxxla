Has anyone fully explored the, "Stock 2 Sector," It's right in the middle of the wredguia sector and is fairly small. I'm assuming it has some special star in it like a supernova. I can't find what it revolves around though. And the name is odd.

It's right next to the coordinates were looking into.

I just posted this in the wrong thread. ><

The sector is a little bigger than I thought, but that still may mean it has a weird center piece to it. I'd never even heard of it until just now. I saw it and wondered if an update messed up another sectors name. There is a stock 1 sector also, but not stock 3... Stock one is basically like stock2 but at the positive version of the third coordinate like where the previous incorrect calcs were coming up. Kind of interesting. They seem a bit artificial with those names. I wonder if they are hiding something.
