I read something here about 60 pages ago. That some dev on twitter said - it was visited by CMDR already, but he just recharged.

As said here, and on OP's currently updated page 1 post(as of last Thursday)

: Confirmed Information

■ Raxxla does exist:
Source: https://youtu.be/-f7Zx7WUwF0?t=13m43s

David Braben: "What a silly question, of course!"
He didn't say "You don't know what it is" as an answer to the question, he said it to the guy sitting next to him. However, we don't know what it is since we haven't found it yet.
■ Raxxla is in the Milky Way: https://player.twitch.tv/?volume=0.8&video=v66487974&time=1h40m30s
Michael Brookes: "It's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where at this stage. It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves."
There will be no clues, "but I think you'd have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious so people know what they're doing."
■ FDev doesn't share information on Raxxla with writers, including Drew Wagar:

The subject of alien races came up and, as a writer, he reminded me of an 'Alien background doc' given to the writers as research material. I do have this, but I'm not allowed (due to NDA) to publish it. Raxxla is part of that. None of the writers were allowed to explore Raxxla, it was very much reserved for 'in-house' development (not surprisingly!).

Then DB came out with his statement. I was a little surprise at what he said, but it was in a public space and others overheard it too.

Raxxla definitely exists in ED.

■ Currently the only reliable source for clues is the in-game Codex. Previous games and novels are mostly not canon and/or don't have information on Raxxla. They might or might not be used as resource and/or inspiration.
Codex entries are below:
The Dark Wheel: http://bit.ly/TDW-codex
Raxxla: http://bit.ly/Raxxla-codex
Codex playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDwoKO1L_wOXx7A5sNwrQdagB_4dPi1Jc

■ However "The Codex is a joint initiative from the Pilots Federation and Universal Cartographic": https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/5c0fadbfa9a9182e01271bb2

- Do not rely on all of the information posted there but it has extensive researches in it, including information regarding the Dark Wheel missions that were removed.

Misinformation

These are unconfirmed statements, we will assume they are false until we get sources for them.

X Someone honked the system but didn't scan it. This rumor states a source as Elitecon (oldest citation) and a Dj Truthsayer video (with no link provided)

X Decyphering the word “RAXXLA” using “HEXEDI” as a key results “KWATIS”. Nothing has been found there and it’s assumed just a coincidence at this stage.

X CMDR FLAVIUS AQUILI stated he had found Raxxla and gave some coordinates, @[PC] 100.RUB (AXI) surveyed around said coordinates and in the system thoroughly and found nothing of interest. It’s now marked as deliberate disinformation.

X CMDR Ticondrius on the Mobius discord server came across an Anarchy system within 1,000ly of Azrael with a blue-white star, with 2 elw and 3 ww and Raxxla. The proof image was fake
