Have you noticed how Sagittarius A* isn’t at the centre.

Also .. The 3 star clusters I have found all point to the bubble, The Orion cluster is all M class. Then if you follow the Fibonacci curve out you reach the next cluster of just O class (I forget the name. I found it while searching the Cassiopeia area). Follow out the curve again and you reach the Eagle nebula “the pillars of creation” where the star cluster is made of F type
stars. That’s MOF (metallic organic framework? Interesting tech) if you continue out further you reach a nebula with guardian planets. I’m going there next. Don’t care if it’s locked, I’m gonna find a way in. There has to be a way.

Also hen 2-333 is locked as it’s giving off massive amounts of energy. The locked area is 150 ly across. If I can find a neutron nearby I’m gonna plot a jump through the quarantine sector just to see if it throws me off course... for science. The pilots federation has no right to keep us locked out. Why do they get choose our boundaries, keep us caged up. You can not contain the spirit of mankind. It’s time for a revolution. It’s time to rise up and throw off the yoke. I will bring terror to the pilots federation and collapse their house of cards around them ... only joking.... just space crazy... that’s all. .... ha. ...
