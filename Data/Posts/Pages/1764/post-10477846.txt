Have you heard of this concept? Its been mooted in the past in this thread.

Nice, I can look into it. It says "The only way to unambiguously determine whether or not a star is a TŻO is a multi-messenger detection of both the gravitational waves of the inner neutron star and an optical spectrum of the metals atypical of a normal red supergiant." that may provide an hint on how to recognise it.

An area at the center of a planet may also explain the hint "A place that is not a place", as the definition of "place" in the Oxford Dictionary is both "a particular position, point, or area in space" and "a portion of space available for being used". So a particular area in ED space that is not accessible and available, like the center of a planet, would be "A place (in the first definition) that is not a place (in the second definition)"

UPDATE:
We have three logged hints about an unexpected gravitational event that also somehow caused the confused victim to travel to new worlds, these are:
Communication Array Delta 69 in Col 285 Sector BG-O d6-93 at coords 45.78125 / -83.84375 / 161.90625
Leucos Crashed Ship in Leucos at coords 98.65625 / -3.375 / -5.65625
Transmitter VJS-81 in HR 6890 at coords -91.3125 / 13.625 / 179.625
These three points can be used to form a 3d triangle (or a circle) that may be considered the most probable area of random impact of Raxxla.

The TZO hybrid star conjecture article linked above seems to imply that a TZO star can only be inside a Red Giant or Red Supergiant.
Of all the known Red Giants and Red Supergiants only three of them are situated inside that 3d triangle, these are:
A Red Supergiant in the RS Persei system
A Red Giant in the HIP 87273 system
A Red Giant in the HR 1685 system
So yeah, I am traveling there to check if there is any way to identify an unexpected object inside those giants from their "gravitational waves and atypical metals".
