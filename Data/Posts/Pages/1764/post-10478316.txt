Hey guys. I've also been trying to find Raxxla from time to time and have been thinking about where it could be based on the information we have.
So, here’s my idea:

Basically, this guy is right:
Link to 3 years old post.

Raxxla should be in the Alpha Hydri system. Why?
I think the first people who found it were pirates hiding in systems but didn’t know how to use it (2200-2296).
Think about it: if such a powerful weapon or device existed near the Solar System and had been discovered long ago, would it really have been abandoned with its maps simply erased? Of course not. It’s most likely protected by military bases, and the system is hidden from prying eyes.

I look at this amazing Elite community, capable of solving incredibly difficult riddles that I could never crack, and yet they still haven’t found this planet? No way. It would have been discovered over five years ago.

So, instead of searching for the system, I think we need to focus on figuring out how to gain access through .
If there’s a way in the game, it must exist. Maybe it involves reaching a certain rank with various organizations in surrounding systems, plus maxing out ranks with both the Empire and Federation, along with something else.
