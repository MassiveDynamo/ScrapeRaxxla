ohhh like a star within the triangle of three stars. Yea maybe!

You should check out my post on looking at the raxxla codex image from a different perspective, which I think is a bit of a breakthrough, and need people smarter than me to see the 3d cube shape!

I believe that everything match simpler than we think. I believe that you could get access to Raxxla as ultimate goal after you get all ranks, all accesses and Elite ranks for 3 main playstyles. I believe that only after that you could be able to trigger new mission or something which will lead you to Raxxla.
