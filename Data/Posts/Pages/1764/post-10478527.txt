Well, to complete my latest failed hypothesis (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10473715) I've just arrived at 40 Phi-2 Orionis...since I failed to find anything of note at the three Orion's Belt stars, I looked again at the Griffin/Horus image on the start screen & wondered if the horns/ears might be a pointer. They seem to point to the Lambda Orionis Cluster. Of that cluster two stars (39 Lambda Orionis/Meissa-derived from Al-Maisan which means 'The Shining One' (jewel??) and 37 Phi-1 Orionis are both permit-locked (pity because 37 Phi-1 Orionis has a Neutron Star -another possibility for Omphalos Rift?). The third is 40 Phi-2 Orionis and nothing here but about 45 Degraded Emission signals. Back to the drawing board/lavian brandy!

I believe that everything match simpler than we think. I believe that you could get access to Raxxla as ultimate goal after you get all ranks, all accesses and Elite ranks for 3 main playstyles. I believe that only after that you could be able to trigger new mission or something which will lead you to Raxxla.
Some of us made a point of obtaining all known permits and gaining the three Elite ranks (before Odyssey expanded the rank system) to gain TDW attention. Nothing has ever come of it.
