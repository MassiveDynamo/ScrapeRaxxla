It either means Sol, since that is the astrological symbol for our sun, not a star.

My other idea is that it means the Main star is a White-Yellow (which comes off as green), and there is a star Lkke a brown dwarf, thats acting like a planet (aka Delphi, a few other systems), so its saying the "orbit" body that appears 3 times, is around the secondary star, with the main star aligned directly behind it
