I think you should try different star alignments in the system to see if anything gets revealed.

I explain why here; https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/my-raxxla-notes.629859/
I had toyed in the past with the idea that Raxxla is an optical illusion,however that doesnt fit the codex theme of "mysterious place, the location of which is a deadly secret...Raxxla is a definite place and it holds a mystical secret. " ...there would be no reason to keep it secret. But it may indeed be hidden and visually locateable in some sort of way.

I initially thought the same, however on further consideration there is no reason to justify Raxxla being located near to Sol from date of the first documented rumour. Even with an old-style (7ly per week's travel? 52 weeks per year, 10 year expedition) jump range some intrepid explorers and treasure hunters could have gone a long way from Sol by 2296, and how about if it wasnt discovered by someone physically stumbling upon it? What about automated probes (which were sent out before manned expeditions)? What about some information gleaned from the Martian Alien Artefact?. What about detection by radio or visual astronomy?
