I dont think they created any Unregistered comms beacons around raxxla.

I think its an alignment game, and thats why its never been "found"

if you align certain planets behind stars, they create images similar to the raxxla codex image.

this is Neptune. Sol, in the middle, and a ring, just like the image.Neptune also oddly has a "void" hotspot. I don't think this is some far reached hunt, its a hunt inside a system that is or very close to Sol.

Raxxla was legend by 2296. Tau ceti was the first colony, and before that, according to lore, we basically only explored Sol, and Alpha Centauri. We tried to start a thing on eden in the 2100s and failed. So raxxla was found between 2010, and 2200. Which limits it to Sol, Alpha Centauri, Eta Cassiopeia, etc. All of those stars have entries explaining when they were explored, settled, etc. The codex entry about Tau ceti is simply guiding us on the lore timeline. if you click on them in the galmap those entries show up.
