I believe that everything match simpler than we think. I believe that you could get access to Raxxla as ultimate goal after you get all ranks, all accesses and Elite ranks for 3 main playstyles. I believe that only after that you could be able to trigger new mission or something which will lead you to Raxxla.
Much simpler than that. There are no requirements to locate the Omphalos Rift other than using tools already used to solve previous puzzles.

The difficulty comes purely from the fact that there was nothing to go on for many years, so Raxxla could have been anything, anywhere, or nothing - until the Codex added a lot more information and made it possible to at least make progress, if not solve it fully to the limits of what's there (unclear).

The Omphalos Rift is most likely* located near Stuemeae JM-W C1-5825, it appears currently unreachable. The signal that comes from it needs further 'translating', or 'decoding', or something. More info here.


*If it's not the Omphalos Rift, then there's another unsolved mystery that fits all the clues and information we have and has been in-game since launch.
