Some of us made a point of obtaining all known permits and gaining the three Elite ranks (before Odyssey expanded the rank system) to gain TDW attention. Nothing has ever come of it.
It's because its hidden. But if you take devs word from one of old Live-streams where they said "Its closer then you think" i believe it's connected with ranks and reputation.

Nobody ever drop such a dangerous tech if it's been found. You should get access to it.

So, I'll concentrate on that direction I think.
