Omphalos was a term also given to mean a raised mound; hub of a wheel etc.
I was pondering this yesterday. Yes, omphalos means navel or hub, and there was an ancient Greek omphalos stone which was conical with a central hole.
So is the omphalos actually the hole itself??

Edit
That might emphasise a Black Hole implementation
