Do we need to find a crossing of paths? to a place atop a sunken (far below?) mountain? the head of Atlas? with a jewelled cairn marking its peak? Is this where we encounter TDW's test?

Yes. You’re getting it! That’s the spirit!

I’m loving this conceptual idea of ‘falling Stars’ as Milton’s falling archangels.

‘Fiery the Angels fell’ - ‘If Only You Could See What I´ve Seen With Your Eyes’ is this another reference by M Brookes to Blade Runner!

Note the quote is not linked to Milton, but is a misquote of Blake's poem, however the parallels are not lost, Brookes loved this film (as do I) and one can certainly draw comparisons with Battys journey to ‘heaven’ to meet his maker, of his depiction as the protagonist, as was Satan. The film certainly has wider Germanic concepts linking it to the Otherworld as well.

There is evidence of a cosmological construct in game, centred on a sphere of storm gods (Milton’s Chaos). Atop of this is an Empyrean, a zone of higher gods, below it, the underworld.

By my observations it’s balanced, through its centre is the world tree Yggdrasil, a series of Norse named systems. Interspersed with various references to The Tuatha Dé Danann and of Gilgamesh.

Below is the Greek underworld, a classical concept of the older European ‘Otherworld’, this is conflated by other examples of ‘lost realms’ other Edens….and in my opinion the journey of Satan out of Hell, to the ‘Bridge’ and to Empyrean.

This whole concept is encircled by a course of ‘mountains’. The Lost Realms seems to exist on one of its borders. Close to the area of Yggdrasil linked to the Norse concept of the edge of the world. Likewise the borders of Heaven seem to sit upon its upper peaks.

A border?

The Brookes Tours intercept this zone.

This I believe is a construct, to represent the old architecture for M Brookes book ‘the Space In between’ and heavily references the works of Robert Holdstock.

It’s a cosmological model universe built off the bones of the first gods, and of the gods man later killed. It’s also identifying that Eden exists/existed, as a proto Otherworld, as is in my opinion Raxxla, and like that Miltonian example ought to be hanging from the Empyrean, in game a peculiar zone close to the borders of heaven (Fall).

Is Raxxla above, or is it below.

I do believe the Thargoids and Far God and everything is linked. And are collectively pointing us towards its location, is it some Celtic border or liminal zone, a crossing through or under a Mountain. Has Brookes melded Miltonian concepts with Celtic references?

This is a glorious construct to behold.
