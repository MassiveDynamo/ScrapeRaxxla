@selbie fairly sure the Soontill in-game is the "real" one; seem to remember the author confirming that & FD just didn't match the book's description very well -possibly due to lack of effort/interest, or just possibly because the hiding of Soontill in a "cosmic mist" as per the book is too close to something else (Raxxla???)- the codex pic is tantalising!

@simulacrae @Han_Zen Doesn't have to be Norwegian here - " Fell" is a good Northern English (admittedly derived from Old Norse- those pesky vikings!) word for a mountain/hill; it can also mean evil (as used by Boromir in Lord of the Rings "“Let those call it the wind who will; there are fell voices on the air")
fell
1. past simple of fall 2. to cut down a tree: 3. to knock someone down…

Did add "meteor" to my anagram search. Nothing!
