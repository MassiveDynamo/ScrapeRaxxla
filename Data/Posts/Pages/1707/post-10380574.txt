There, above the peaks of the wild Apennines,
Between the steep cliffs a cave appears;
The sirens keep watch over that lighthouse,
The songs tremble and make one delirious.

Translated from the Italian poem Sibilla [it] by Giulio Aristide Sartorio

Okay, I know the Aeneid came up here. Wasn't there something near Rome that parallels the Oracle of Greece. Given the importance of Rome in Elite (the Empire is modelled after Rome) would it not be wise to check the Sibyline Oracle. There were more than just the Pythian Oracle.

The Roman Oracle is settled first by the Greeks.

Folks, we had the wrong Oracle.
