@selbie fairly sure the Soontill in-game is the "real" one; seem to remember the author confirming that & FD just didn't match the book's description very well -possibly due to lack of effort/interest, or just possibly because the hiding of Soontill in a "cosmic mist" as per the book is too close to something else (Raxxla???)- the codex pic is tantalising!

@simulacrae @Han_Zen Doesn't have to be Norwegian here - " Fell" is a good Northern English (admittedly derived from Old Norse- those pesky vikings!) word for a mountain/hill; it can also mean evil (as used by Boromir in Lord of the Rings "“Let those call it the wind who will; there are fell voices on the air")
fell
1. past simple of fall 2. to cut down a tree: 3. to knock someone down…

Did add "meteor" to my anagram search. Nothing!

It's not. Robert Garry also has a bit of lying problem as he is from Beta Hydri (this system was settled by very rich Scottish families). The Soontill Relics are from Earth and known as Dropa Stones or Bi (jade) discs. This is why Beta Hydri has Jordan's Legacy as a planet.

I also challenge anyone to get Starburst to work on a planet that makes Venus look like heaven and has atmosphere primarily made of silicates and iron (hint: it is basically a natural mirror).

Robert Garry's tall tale was so outrageous Elvira Martuuk and GalNet took time to dismiss it entirely.

Let's not forget there is no brown dwarf. A brown dwarf generally needs to 8 - 15 Jupiter masses to qualify. Soontill 3 is a Sudarsky Class III which whilst 8.1 Jupiters it is still visibly blue and not reddish-purple.

Sorry, but everything is wrong about Soontill but the presence of Technetium. Propaganda has to partly true to be believable. That's the sole kernel of truth.
