Astrophel sounds like "astro fell" ("for those with eyes to see" is stated in the codex. BUT the original (biblical IIRC) saying is "for those with eyes to see and ears to hear"), which implies "fallen star". "Princess Astrophell" could therefore mean a female fallen star- Astarte and Isis were the only named female prime followers of Satan in PL, however since Satan ruled in Hell then his daughter Sin could be viewed as a Princess...

Falling stars are usually meteors. Rocks from the asteroid field that falls into the atmosphere. This might be an indication to look for something really small. Caretakers are tiny yet gargantuan. They might not need a huge body to have a portal.
