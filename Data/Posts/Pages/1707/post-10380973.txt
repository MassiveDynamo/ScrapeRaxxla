Mmm, but all light emanated from god, who's throne IIRC was on a mountain at the centre of the Empyrean. So, I suspect not the Far God in ED terms (Thargoids!).

Another point-if Satan is the fallen star then the spiralling stars could be his followers calling from the Empyrean into hell.

Ya but if we are on an axis there is likely both heaven and hell... the dark wheel at one end and raxxla on the other?

Fell and fjell are not the same.

Fjell = mountain
Fell = a piece of animal skin with the fur still.

In some dialects 'fell' has the exact same meaning as in English. To fall, in past tense.

Dont make me get my OED out im at work so will have to wait till i get home… Well here wikipedia has it - but ya “fell” in english and scottish does have an old association with land forms - and it apparently does go back to the old scandinavian norse mountains - high places … but ya i agree modern usage is more likely associated with past tense of fall.

Edit- looking back on my original post, i realize i didnt properly indicate which languages i was referencing very well. Sorry!
