Ah, I lean towards the view that the game is the only thing that counts, and that all the novels are just padding- interesting reads and related to game lore but no interdependency in either direction. IIRC Allen Stroud might have said something to this effect.

The only novel I think might be relevant re lore and Raxxla is MB's own Elite Legacy.

Edit
But that codex Image of a planet hidden by galactic mist is intriguing!
Darn auto correct just changed "mist" to "Muppet" and "codex" to "cider"!!!
Does it know something I don't?
