I like that assumption. I am very adamant that ‘mountains’ are very relevant.

There is the reference in Celtic and Norse myth that one could journey to the ‘Otherworld’ via a mountain.

In Paradise Lost, and Dante’s Inferno Eden was on a mountain.

Dante’s identifies Mount Purgatory was upon the cosmological navel, that of mount Ida in Crete, and in his source Dante places the source of Lethe in the Earthly Paradise atop Mount Purgatory.

Crete was by recollection also the home of the ‘old man of the mountain’, whose tears Dante ascribes were the source of the river Lethe.

Now what interested me initially was that Crete has also been called the ‘l’ and as well as that, was home to the goddess of mountains and hunting, , she who is also sometimes conflated with

The Otherworld in the Epic of Gilgamesh was also via a , and M Brookes mentioned ‘mountains’ a few times himself, especially in his book Legacy in regards to the mysteriously named ‘beautiful mountain’ - . Could Michael have been telling us to look or journey to a specific mountain or mountains?

And of course we do have a series of systems encircling the Lost Realms and Miltonian model all named or referencing‘ Mountains’.

On thing also is how the word Astrophel is pronounced in the Codex audio. It’s not ‘Astro-phell’ but more like ‘Astroful’?

So we could be looking for something to Philip Sidney?

The Delphic temple was on Mount Parnassus, Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem was originally built on Mount Moriah (later expanded by King Herod into a much larger plateau), Rome claimed the Palatine Hill as its origin point... every purported omphalos has one of these.
