@selbie fairly sure the Soontill in-game is the "real" one; seem to remember the author confirming that & FD just didn't match the book's description very well -possibly due to lack of effort/interest, or just possibly because the hiding of Soontill in a "cosmic mist" as per the book is too close to something else (Raxxla???)- the codex pic is tantalising!

I have to admit - that is probably what happened…. However with the current state of ingame information and if we accept the book as lore - we are left with very conflicting stories. And because it is set up as a hidden system - it is fun to believe the “real” soontill is still out there…
