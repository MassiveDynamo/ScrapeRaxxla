What if Astrophel … is Astro Fell - as in starry mountain…. Fell like norse Fjäll…

Psalms 24: 3-5

Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? Who may stand in His holy place?

The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not set his mind on what is false, and who has not sworn deceitfully.

He will receive blessing from the Lord,
and righteousness from the God of his salvation.

On his high mountain among the stars, the Far God sits….. waiting

Fell and fjell are not the same.

Fjell = mountain
Fell = a piece of animal skin with the fur still.

In some dialects 'fell' has the exact same meaning as in English. To fall, in past tense.
