What if Astrophel … is Astro Fell - as in starry mountain…. Fell like norse Fjäll…

Psalms 24: 3-5

Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? Who may stand in His holy place?

The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not set his mind on what is false, and who has not sworn deceitfully.

He will receive blessing from the Lord,
and righteousness from the God of his salvation.

On his high mountain among the stars, the Far God sits….. waiting

Mmm, but all light emanated from god, who's throne IIRC was on a mountain at the centre of the Empyrean. So, I suspect not the Far God in ED terms (Thargoids!).

Another point-if Satan is the fallen star then the spiralling stars could be his followers falling from the Empyrean into hell.
