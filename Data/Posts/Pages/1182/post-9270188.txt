Good, so it's not a hallucination. Unless it's a collective one.
I don't think it's Morse either. But it looks somewhat familiar.
Can only confirm that it's in the orange background, it doesn't rotate with the ship.
Ya reminds me of the dots and dashes we see floating around planets. Like Jorki said - might be good to get snapshots from different commanders and with different ship backgrounds to see if the message changes.
