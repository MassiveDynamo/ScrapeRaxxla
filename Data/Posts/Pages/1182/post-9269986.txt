Of course that might have been retconned! It was the opinion of just one character iirc.

Anyone else having problems with galmap in Horizons since last thursday's update? It's driving me mad and most frustrating! Cant select a star to set it as destination. I've spent 15 mins trying to select route from Muang to Wyrd, mouse click on Wyrd to select/plot route/open sysmap to select engineers base and the cursor just moves keeps moving back to Muang every time.

What a game!!! Beginning to think management has upset one or more coders!
Edit: no, my finger trouble! Had accidentally bound mouse1 to “select current system” ! Doh
