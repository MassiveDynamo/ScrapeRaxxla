Thought on first sight it’s Morse Code, but the dashes have several lengths so not pukka Morse. Also looks like it’s only part of a message with the blank area from the top symbol to the rest at the bottom. Might be worth observing for
(a) several different ships by one owner
(b) one ship type by several different owners
(c) several different ship types by several owners
And...
i’ve lost the thread, bad night,, awake at 02:00, dog wanted me up at 05:30
Need more coffee!!!

Edit: is this “message” embossed on the ship’s surface & therefore rotates with it? Is it a static message or does it change with time?

Good, so it's not a hallucination. Unless it's a collective one.
I don't think it's Morse either. But it looks somewhat familiar.
Can only confirm that it's in the orange background, it doesn't rotate with the ship.
