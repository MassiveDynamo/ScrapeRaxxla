But still it’s a valid idea, it could be this obvious, with those with eyes to see?

Puzzles within ED have only become absurd over following years due to the player base responding to FD puzzles with dismay, at how easy they used to be. Raxxla technically pre-dates much of these, and surprisingly doesn’t enter much of the communities consciousness, as it’s probably seen as impossible or just not in game. So there is nothing to say the solution isn’t starring us in the face.

Dose not mean that there isn’t a very obvious clue in game, which everyone simply walks around.

Complacency is a hallmark of human behaviour. I would never disown any idea out of hand, as our own bias is likely to be our Achilles heel, in being able to observe Raxxla.

*edited:

Again many site MB - there will be no clues; so they don’t scrutinise, but it’s equally applicable MB said that just in context to the interview at that time; or it’s an admission it’s all ‘narrative’ driven?

In that respect one can’t really apply it to the game, not without accepting our interpretations are biased.

Your idea is as valid as any, we just need to compare / contrast.
