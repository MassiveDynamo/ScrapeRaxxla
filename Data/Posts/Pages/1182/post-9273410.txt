I was looking in the galmap and couldn't help but notice the constellation for Corona Borealis constellation isn't shown with the rest on the map.

Never really looked myself, tried it once on day one but was unimpressed by how it all looked, as I noticed it doesn’t show everything either. So much like everything in ED put it down as either a bug or just poorly implemented.

How many of the constellations are shown in Gal map? I’m suspecting from memory it’s only the 12 astrological ones? But that’s just my vague recollection. From memory there ought to be 88 in total, not including any historical ones which were mothballed due to fashion.

Again a good identification of a potential key identifier, hidden in plain sight - what is in gal map, and what isn’t, what are the correlating factors, is it arbitrary, are they astronomical, astrological, or something else.
