But still it’s a valid idea, it could be this obvious, with those with eyes to see?

Puzzles within ED have only become absurd over following years due to the player base responding to FD puzzles with dismay, at how easy they used to be. Raxxla technically pre-dates much of these, and surprisingly doesn’t enter much of the communities consciousness, as it’s probably seen as impossible or just not in game. So there is nothing to say the solution isn’t starring us in the face.

Dose not mean that there isn’t a very obvious clue in game, which everyone simply walks around.

Complacency is a hallmark of human behaviour. I would never disown any idea out of hand, as our own bias is likely to be our own biggest weakness in being able to observe Raxxla.

So, perhaps 'eyes to see' this constellation myself without galmap help .


On a related note. Could someone tell me how I would use the FSS to listen to background noise in the skybox? How can you tell if you're hearing something worth investigating and then how would you go about figuring out where it originated?
