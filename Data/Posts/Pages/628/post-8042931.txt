Far-fetched, Pa and min Herre.
Alex already was an accomplished pilot having spent hours in station bars all over the Bubble when Zetter enlightened him. And Codex is not the novel, that is my point.
Not much of a myth if a myth of Sol region... only. And only in the childish Star Wars can a young jerk appear as an ace pilot without having left his crappy desert planet ever.
No, Raxxla wasn't a myth. It was a secret... in the novel.
Myth to some, secret to those in the know. In the 2100's we get FTL. By 2296 Raxxla becomes myth.

What events transpired between first FTL and 2296? Therein lies our answers.

Try to track down tourist beacons with relevant information if possible, it seems the best way to validate pre-modern info (Holdstock, etc.).

Edit: If Alex didn't know about Raxxla until Zetter told him, then it appears that the stories hadn't really travelled too far from the first few colonies. I'd start there.
