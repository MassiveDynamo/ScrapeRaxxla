Myth to some, secret to those in the know. In the 2100's we get FTL. By 2296 Raxxla becomes myth.

What events transpired between first FTL and 2296? Therein lies our answers.

Try to track down tourist beacons with relevant information if possible, it seems the best way to validate pre-modern info (Holdstock, etc.).

Edit: If Alex didn't know about Raxxla until Zetter told him, then it appears that the stories hadn't really travelled too far from the first few colonies. I'd start there.
196 years is plenty of time for new rumors to spread and become a new myth, thats true, but a new secret hasn't had time by then to be completely obscured by those, if any, who would try to obscure it. The evidence would still be fresh, and harder to obscure. Thats why im of the opinion the "dreams" of Halsey and Gan are more like messages/signals. THEY were the original clues to Raxxla. They may have been happening for Eons. Raxxla may not be anywhere near the Bubble (personal guess is CD-37 10033).
There could be some shred of evidence still out there that points the way. Canonn was on to something by following those listening post after the Codex was released. We just need to uncover the next clue of the thread (likely in Maia)! Being invited to the Dark Wheel, and/or discovering their base will be the next major step after.
