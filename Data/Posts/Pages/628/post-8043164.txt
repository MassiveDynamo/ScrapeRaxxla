196 years is plenty of time for new rumors to spread and become a new myth, thats true, but a new secret hasn't had time by then to be completely obscured by those, if any, who would try to obscure it. The evidence would still be fresh, and harder to obscure. Thats why im of the opinion the "dreams" of Halsey and Gan are more like messages/signals. THEY were the original clues to Raxxla. They may have been happening for Eons. Raxxla may not be anywhere near the Bubble (personal guess is CD-37 10033).
There could be some shred of evidence still out there that points the way. Canonn was on to something by following those listening post after the Codex was released. We just need to uncover the next clue of the thread (likely in Maia)! Being invited to the Dark Wheel, and/or discovering their base will be the next major step after.
In 40 years the horrors of WWII became myth to an entire country.

In 196 years anything can be turned to myth. Especially so, if only a few ever really knew the whole truth. That's how most myths start, with someone who knows of a secrets existence, but not what is secret.

To track a myth you need the source. The trail for Raxxla starts for us in Tau Ceti in 2296. Tau Ceti leads us to the early days of FTL between 2100 and 2296. If Raxxla exists, it all started between those dates.
