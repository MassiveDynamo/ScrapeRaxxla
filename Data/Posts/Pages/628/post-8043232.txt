In 40 years the horrors of WWII became myth to an entire country.

In 196 years anything can be turned to myth. Especially so, if only a few ever really knew the whole truth. That's how most myths start, with someone who knows of a secrets existence, but not what is secret.

To track a myth you need the source. The trail for Raxxla starts for us in Tau Ceti in 2296. Tau Ceti leads us to the early days of FTL between 2100 and 2296. If Raxxla exists, it all started between those dates.
Well ...RAXXLA is not created by humans it seems, it is discovered.Also we know that initial FTL could drop u in wrong time/space (for example back by 300 000 000 years to dynos). So ....you could find raxxla anywhere by bad drop out.
