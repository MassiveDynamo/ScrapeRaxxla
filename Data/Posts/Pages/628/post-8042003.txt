Yeah, this. "According to the Codex". Because according to The Dark Wheel novel, that "myth" was unknown to Alex Ryder... therefore, it would be logical to assume, unknown to most of the people.

Anyway, from Wiki:
This timeline covers events from the first three games of the Elite series as well as novels. There are some discrepancies* between events listed and their representation in the fourth and current game, Elite Dangerous.

*I bet there are.

“ Most of the people”? Not necessarily. Don’t think you can safely draw that conclusion. I think it might have been bar chat amongst pilots & flight engineers/mechanics, but we know from the codex some members of TDW kept their children in the dark about the group & that might also apply to Raxxla.
