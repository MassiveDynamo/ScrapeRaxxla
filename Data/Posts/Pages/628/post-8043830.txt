FD have said mis-jumps are not in ED.
Having done two long-distance deep space runs following interpretations of the codex toast, and prior to that spent several months trying to match star patterns to the start video in the assumption that was a clue, I have recently come to the hypothesis that the codex’s 8th moon is misdirection, that Raxxla is in the bubble, probably hidden by a permit lock, there’s a test to get that permit and the toast leads to the start of that test. I think the test will involve specific missions and mission givers who will not reveal it is all part of a DW test until it’s passed. If it’s failed then presumably there will be no indication you were participating in any test....

What I’m pondering is whether alternative missions might be offered by other mission givers as distractions & if accepted that will cause failure of the test.

And here I am with my left arm in a sling and champing at the bit to get back into game. Bah humbug!
Hopefully in a few days I’ll be able to operate the hosas again (with limited dexterity)

And I’m fully expecting Raxxla to be a mildly disappointing easter egg. No omphalos rift, no portal (cos there are no other galaxies in game), no twisted evil men ..... though it might be a Guardian arkship, and help to explain the Mars Artifact.
But the search is fun!
