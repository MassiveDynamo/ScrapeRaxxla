That's exactly the point of my original post and the wiki quote, min Herre
Building a time line and drawing conclusions involving facts from the previous games and novels leads to unsolvable and misdirecting inconsistencies in ED.(except DW's, they are canon we were told, but no Raxxla in them, FD orders)
There is a pre-ED Raxxla and there is (?) an ED Raxxla. I suspect that the first will turn out to be much more appealing than the latter...
FD, what have you done with The Myth ?
Lori Jameson said:
To track a myth you need the source. The trail for Raxxla starts for us in Tau Ceti in 2296. Tau Ceti leads us to the early days of FTL between 2100 and 2296. If Raxxla exists, it all started between those dates.
This. All what we have. The Codex.
Then ED Raxxla should be (?) inside the Bubble. Besides, 2014: "..we know why Raxxla hasn't already been found. " The Very Old Guard might tell us if there were listening posts already back in the gamma. Boss ? But, anyway, the journey may have evolved since.
