Probably Raxxla is a locked system in the Bubble. And parts of that toast are keys to surrounding systems to asqire permit. Not a really surrounding but maybe with some idea.

Other thing is that part with "parent's grief" etc. It is keys also. What is our parents as a commanders? The Pilot Federation. So this step lead us to make PF grief somehow. Second thing is lover's woe. Woe of all our minor and major factions that loves us for tons of quests and things we did. So we should make them to hate us. Third piece of the puzzle is most hard to explain. We should discard our vagabond hearts.

Good theory. But I believe what in that great thread someone already try it.
