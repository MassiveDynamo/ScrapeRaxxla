That's exactly the point of my original post and the wiki quote, min Herre
Building a time line and drawing conclusions involving facts from the previous games and novels leads to unsolvable and misdirecting inconsistencies in ED.(except DW's, they are canon we were told, but no Raxxla in them, FD orders)
There is a pre-ED Raxxla and there is (?) an ED Raxxla. I suspect that the first will turn out to be much more appealing than the latter...
FD, what have you done with The Myth ?

This. All what we have. The Codex.
Then ED Raxxla should be (?) inside the Bubble. Besides, 2014: "..we know why Raxxla hasn't already be found".
Click to expand...

Pre-ED Raxxla = Planet, portal and evil men. TDW is searching, but haven't found it.
ED Raxxla = Dull moon, portal (omphalos rift) and sinister cabal or sole tyrant. TDW is searching, but haven't found it.

Not much have changed. Mainly because there isn't much to change. The entire 'old lore' consists of a few sentences in TDW. ED lore consisted of nothing except vague hints, up to the release of the codex.
