I was trying to cancel jump long ago, no success. It is game loading screen in fact. Buttons are blocked.
Most u can do close the game and then u login back to source or to destination + fuel used. So if game keep crashing on jump, you may get out of fuel.

This was a bug along time ago. Network issues etc caused game to crash “during” a jump so you relogged in to find still at jump start but the fuel had been used. FD fixed this bug! If you're experiencing it again now then do raise a bug report!
