Far-fetched, Pa and min Herre.
Alex already was an accomplished pilot having spent hours in station bars all over the Bubble when Zetter enlightened him. And Codex is not the novel, that is my point.
Not much of a myth if a myth of Sol region... only. And only in the childish Star Wars can a young jerk appear as an ace pilot without having left his crappy desert planet ever.
No, Raxxla wasn't a myth. It was a secret... in the novel.
