Yeah, this. "According to the Codex". Because according to The Dark Wheel novel, that "myth" was unknown to Alex Ryder... therefore, it would be logical to assume, unknown to most of the people.

Anyway, from Wiki:
This timeline covers events from the first three games of the Elite series as well as novels. There are some discrepancies* between events listed and their representation in the fourth and current game, Elite Dangerous.

*I bet there are.

Alex was a simple boy from the old worlds. It’s not strange that he hadn’t heard a thousand year old myth from the Sol region.
