So, if it is in a permit locked system, regardless of the type of permit needed to unlock the system, then we are all waiting for Fdev to issue these permits through some kind of mission, alliance or lore based clue?

Looking at the Thagroid star map, there does not seem to be any "reference points" which could be identified as a "confirmed location" to start a search.
The larger ‘Lights’ appear to be highlighted, if you place there location on our galaxy and rotate you can discover different points, but due to galatical rotation these points can change so I’ve spent the day working the math out and finding exact areas and came up with 33 different points, 18 of them permit locked but ironically 33 is the same number of points on the Raxxla flag and there locations create a Raxxla symbol on the star map. Coincidence? I think not! F dev don’t do coincidences and may be working on these systems for an upcoming update where mysteries of Raxxla can be uncovered
