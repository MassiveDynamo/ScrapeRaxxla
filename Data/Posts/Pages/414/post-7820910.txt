You didn’t miss anything that has solid proof but there was some interesting discoveries made by me but I need more proof to prove the systems I’ve located may be connected to Raxxla, most are permit locked though with no known means of getting to them

Do any of these systems indicate that they need a different permit to any of the myriad of other permit locked systems that we have no idea how to unlock?
