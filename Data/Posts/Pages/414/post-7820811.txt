Makes perfect sense; Thargoid strongholds are no-go zones for now. Have you been able to match the Col 70 Sector to any areas?
I suspect that the Thargoid homeworld is located there in close proximity to Barnard's Loop.
Can’t remember, I’ll have a look when I’m next online but as of now I’m experimenting with shapes to see if I can come up with anything else that could confirm my theory further, and if the Thargoids did originate from a different galaxy then those strongholds could be multiple areas they could travel from
