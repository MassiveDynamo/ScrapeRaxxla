Vega is also in the 'Weaver girl and the cow herd' stories from Asian myth. This is the Qixi (pronounced Key-She..) festival on the 7th night of the 7th month of the chinese calendar - the 7th August this year,or the 7th July in 3305.

Vega and Altair are the weaver girl and the cowherd, separated by the milky way to prevent their union (Lovers Woe, Parents Grief) and on the day of the festival, a bridge forms across the milk-way to reunite them - the bridge is represented by Deneb in some accounts, forming the 'summer triangle'.

Princess Astrophel - Astrophel means 'Star-Lover' and this is a description applied to the weaver girl in some countries. Its also a 'children's story'

No match to Burning Jewels, Vagabonds or Whisperers in the deepest void though...

Cora = Kora = Persephone, queen of the underworld, and a godess of nature - Kore means 'maiden'.

Vega and Altair have suspiciously similar in-game descriptions in the Galaxy Map. Not sure whether this denotes a stronger connection than the mythology surrounding them, or perhaps a mistake on FDev's part? I recently went to Deneb (Alpha Cygni in-game), but didn't find anything of note.
