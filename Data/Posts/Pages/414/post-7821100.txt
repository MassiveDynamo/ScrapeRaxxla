I like your supposition. Dark Matter may not be the reason for preventing the arms of our spiral galaxy from being thrown outward, as we have several massive black holes in the center preventing this from occurring and making the inner arms spin faster and keeping them from being flung outward. Gravitational waves, recently discovered, may also play a role in the way dark matter bends and moves creating the exoskeleton and the way our galaxy's arms rotate in concert with it.
Our galaxy is rotating at the speed which doesn’t cause it to fly off but the mass of the closest galaxy, andromeda has less mass and as a result less gravity. It’s inner spirals rotate around the center at the same speed as the outta ones and usefully this would cause them to fly off into space. Black holes could be the cause but it’s supermassive one is 1/10 of the mass of ours so is unlikely. Therefore a invisible force must be acting upon it, it may be dark liquid/matter or not who knows
