Just speculating....

If the Thagroid map did contain a location for Raxxla, maybe the Thagroid already wiped out Raxxla and the Dark Wheel as they posed the greatest threat to their existance. We may find a dead world and a destroyed space station, with nothing left but data ports to scan for the story of their destruction and demise.

Possibly but if the Thargoids used this as a means to get to our galaxy then they would wish to protect it, read up on type III civilisations and how Thargoids may fit into that category. If the dark wheel did find it they may have shut it down preventing Thargoids from overwhelming man kind.
Another theory is that the mycoid virus which spread alarmingly fast was such a threat the Thargoids closed off these areas stoping it from returning to their home galaxy. Now that they have ‘created a cure’ ( it’s still unknown if this is the case) they may have reopened these gateways and are using them as a means to attack us.
If Thargoids are as intelligent as we think they are then it is very VERY likely they are have found Raxxla and are actively using it and if they ain’t using it then they are probably guarding it and if these both are not the case then it’s possible Raxxla won’t exist
