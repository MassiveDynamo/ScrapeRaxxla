Makes perfect sense; Thargoid strongholds are no-go zones for now. Have you been able to match the Col 70 Sector to any areas?
I suspect that the Thargoid homeworld is located there in close proximity to Barnard's Loop.
Went and checked just now, the outta corner of one of the areas is also the same outta permit locked system of barnard’s loop and it pretty much fits within the area, but the area could be above or below this area as the way I’ve worked this out is from a birds eyes view but I suspect it is within this ‘restricted’ bubble
