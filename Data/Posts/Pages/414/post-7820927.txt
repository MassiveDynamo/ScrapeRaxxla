Do any of these systems indicate that they need a different permit to any of the myriad of other permit locked systems that we have no idea how to unlock?
No the systems just simply say “unknown system permit required” so it may be impossible for us to actually find Raxxla at this moment in time but I’m confident that this discovery of mine is no coincidence fdev wouldn’t add in something that looked like a galaxy/star map for fun, there has to be a purpose to it, could be to do with Raxxla and it could not but I have a feeling in one of the upcoming updates it’s purpose will be revealed
