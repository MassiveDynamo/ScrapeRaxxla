It’s feint but it surrounds the largest star doesn’t glow tho suggesting it’s not the star that’s red but perhaps the selection i was talking about.
It's possible that is the milky way and those are only the super bright stars that stick out on the map in one way or the other. There was a star like that I was looking for and it ended up being saturn something. If the map is upside down. Or if that is a different one at a different location. Certain activities seems to happen at the more interesting system types.

Has anyone compared it to a stripped down milky way with only the superbright fuzzy dots from the map?
