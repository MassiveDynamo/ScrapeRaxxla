I think you are correct. The Thagroid map would be a good place to hide such clues to the location of Raxxla. Somehow, the Thagroid map needs to be "super-imposed" over the MW Galaxy map and see what lines up.
Already done and found locations across the Milky Way on elite, however as I’ve said 18 of the 33 crossovers are permit locked and the closest to sol that isn’t permit locked is 54,000 ly away
