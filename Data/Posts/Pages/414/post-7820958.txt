It's possible that is the milky way and those are only the super bright stars that stick out on the map in one way or the other. There was a star like that I was looking for and it ended up being saturn something. If the map is upside down. Or if that is a different one at a different location. Certain activities seems to happen at the more interesting system types.
Yes indeed f dev do like making entire systems a bin for all there exploration fetishes but our galaxy has 4 spiral arms whilst that one in the image has only got 2, the closest Galaxy to us, andromeda, has 2 spiral arms, rotates at different speeds and has less predicted mass than our own. But going off topic here the outta spirals spin faster than the inner spirals. unlike our own galaxy where the inner spirals rotate faster. According to laws of relativity this means that the spiral arms should be thrown out into space but a high gravity/force is keeping them there, this lead to the theory and ‘discovery’ of dark matter - a highly dense and heavy liquid like substance that flows in the forum of particles in our universe, it bends and moves to create exoskeletons that galaxys spin on, our conventional matter, aka ‘light’ matter can not directly interact with it but we can feel it’s affects with the gravity it causes.
