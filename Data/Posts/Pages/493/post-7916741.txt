My take is:
Both Raxxla and TDW stations are in game.
There is no quest for either of them.
TDW station is visible in both normal space(if you drop close enough) and in SC. Only way to find it, is parallax.
There are no special game mechanics, regarding hyper jumps, black holes or similar that leads to either of them.
Raxxla does not move from system to system.

We simply has to find the two needles in the haystack, using the few hints we have.
