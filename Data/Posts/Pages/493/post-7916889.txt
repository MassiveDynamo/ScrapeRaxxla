Doesn't mean it was accessable. That was never stated once to my knowledge.

I have a vague memory that DB has said of Raxxla something along the lines of “you’ll like it”.
If that recolection is true then it implies Raxxla can be found, it’s not in a permit locked area; but don’t ask me where that recollection is from...
