I'm not saying it isn't currently inaccessible. all I'm saying is just because it was in the game when it was first released doesn't mean it was accessible at the initial release. things have changed since then. quit taking like small words that I say and putting big meaning to them.
I didn't think you were saying that at all. I was making the point that putting it into the game with the intention of only making it accessible at least 2 years later by adding new features would be a waste of time.

That said, if they HAD gone down the route of putting Raxxla in the game without a means to access it, it could STILL be inaccessible, if the intention for the discovery process required walking around on an atmospheric planet.

This is why it's far easier to assume that whatever you could do in gamma is sufficient to allow you to discovery Raxxla today.

for all we know they can completely change everything that hasn't yet been found every time they put an update in.
This is true - but unless DB is going back and coding things, it would be increasingly difficult to keep Raxxla secret if people had to update the access criteria every release.

And I'm sure it wouldn't be the only thing put in game that really isn't worth being put in game.
Don't get me started
