I would make a guess there is nothing too peculiar inside any of the unknown permit systems/sectors, we'd probably know by now if there was, anyway. It's perhaps also why they never utilized permit system for more meaningful content, because they knew their restrictions early on. Same reason they never did Icarus Cup either. However, it should be possible to hide some things in known systems, or alternatively, in any of the non permit-restricted systems in the galaxy, because there are quite many of those. It's not a too bad thing really, because the journey itself is more meaningful. It would of course had been nice, if the game had fulfilled it's original design visions, but then, there probably are very few such games in existence.
