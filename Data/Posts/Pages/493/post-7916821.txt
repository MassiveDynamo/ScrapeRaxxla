Has anyone attempted to duplicate Alec's journey as laid out in the DW? In EDH, you can hire crew. I was thinking of going to Tionisla's stations and seeing if a person by this name available for hire. If not, possibly hiring a person there and trying to duplicate some of Alec's trade routes with a Cobra 3 and a hired crewmate from Tionisla. But of course, I'm not Elite at all, so this may have to be done by someone who is.

Visiting all 33 systems is well within the realm of possibility but should be done in a cobra 3 with one crew member on board, with the pilot of elite rank.

Just some thoughts.
