EDSM reads a journal text file. You can manually edit that journal file to make EDSM think you've been anywhere at all.

There's also a case-sensitivity issue - 'e Centauri' and 'E Centauri' are two different stars. They both show in the GalMap as 'E CENTAURI', but the journal used the correct name. The original implementation of EDSM (or EDDiscovery, or both) failed to differentiate between the two stars, which causes no end of confusion.

Then there's the fact that the Cone Sector used to be unlocked, but 'unreachable' - that was the whole reason that the Gnosis was planning on jumping there in the first place - so it's possible that someone using a FSD Range hack visited.

Finally, EDSM could just be wrong.

Didn’t know the fine sector used to be unlocked, but still, something about it just doesn’t sit right to me. The gap next it also seems a bit odd. Generally I just think there are enough abnormalities to assume something of interest could be there. Would certainly be a good place to hide something you don’t want to be found accidentally.
