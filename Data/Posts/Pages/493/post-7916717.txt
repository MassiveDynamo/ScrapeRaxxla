I'm not saying it isn't currently inaccessible. all I'm saying is just because it was in the game when it was first released doesn't mean it was accessible at the initial release. things have changed since then. quit taking like small words that I say and putting big meaning to them.

for all we know they can completely change everything that hasn't yet been found every time they put an update in.

And I'm sure it wouldn't be the only thing put in game that really isn't worth being put in game.
