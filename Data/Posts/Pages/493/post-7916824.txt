I've also visited all the old worlds, but a while ago. might be worth a second look now I am better versed. Ra is in an odd position out on its own, but I didnt find anything of interest there. A couple of other are displaced as well and Lave seems to be missing a moon..

Ra is probably a coincidence - there's a bunch of ancient Egyptian systems, so it most likely comes from that naming scheme, rather than being a carryover from Elite.
