Didn’t know the fine sector used to be unlocked, but still, something about it just doesn’t sit right to me. The gap next it also seems a bit odd. Generally I just think there are enough abnormalities to assume something of interest could be there. Would certainly be a good place to hide something you don’t want to be found accidentally.

I think permit locks are the best way to hide something you don't want finding

Also, regarding the 'gap' - make sure you don't have any filters applied to the GalMap. I've got excited before now, then realized I've got M-type stars deselected
