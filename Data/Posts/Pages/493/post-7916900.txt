My take is:
Both Raxxla and TDW stations are in game.
There is no quest for either of them.
TDW station is visible in both normal space(if you drop close enough) and in SC. Only way to find it, is parallax.
There are no special game mechanics, regarding hyper jumps, black holes or similar that leads to either of them.
Raxxla does not move from system to system.
We simply has to find the two needles in the haystack, using the few hints we have.

I agree with most of these. But Scytale raised the possibility that TDW station may not detectable in SC. It may be true- normal stations are visible in SC through their reflectivity, they shine brightly. However if this is a stealth station, e.g. covered in anti-reflection material, then the only way to spot it would be either to drop out of SC in close proximity, or see it against a bright background.

I hope this is not the case. All the codex says is that it is operated at minimal power to be undetectable (by ship sensors, and presumably fss), presumably unless the detecting ship is quite close.
