So. Now for something completely different: Visited Atlantis and Omagua, found zip, nothing happened. Prester John still remains so obscure I have no idea what to hammer Galmap with.

So, let's try something new: While googling for MoG I found the following little blog which might contain some ideas as of yet untried: http://www.native-science.net/MilkyWay.MotherGoddess.htm (btw. it's amazing how much ED related stuff you get when googling for MoG). Have as of yet not read it completely but stumbled about a part saying the ancients had a mother goddess and a goddess of death. This made me think of Parvati the wife of Shiva who in her other form is known as Kali the Destroyer. So. Mother goddess and goddess of death united in one being. Kali and Parvati are both system in game. Guess I'll be visiting when I'm done doing pew pew in the Pleiades. (Great - I think we haven't treid Hinduism already, so something new).

While at Pleiades I'll pay a visit to Pleione which was named MoG in a german news article.
