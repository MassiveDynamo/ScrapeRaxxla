While at Pleiades I'll pay a visit to Pleione which was named MoG in a german news article.
MoatG, not MoG
... Mutter aller Galaxien (Codex)
... mother of all the galaxies
Might make a subtle difference, imho.

Re-reading the German version of the Codex, makes me wonder if the hypothesis of a "map to Raxxla" lying inside a crashed pirate ship has already been stated ?
Tip off ?
