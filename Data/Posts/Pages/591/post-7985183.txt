Might make a subtle difference, imho.

Re-reading the German version of the Codex, makes me wonder if the hypothesis of a "map to Raxxla" lying inside a crashed pirate ship has already been stated ?
Tip off ?

I once had the idea the remnants of Jason Ryders ship might be found and could contain some data. Was the reason for my jumping to Leesti.

Concerning Parvati/Kali - Hinduism considers her the mother of the universe which should put her on equal par with MoatG
