It needs repeating about every 235 pages.
Enough null or negative results can be considered evidence of absence. Taken to an extreme that aphorism can be a bit of a logical fallacy. i.e. We haven't found blue cheese on the Moon yet, so the absence of that evidence does not eliminate the possibility that the Moon is made of blue cheese. Maybe it's in the core. We should keep looking.
