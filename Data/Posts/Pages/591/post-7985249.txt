Please, don't ban me of the thread !
Err.. Are you asking DW too, to no longer post in this thread ?
Who
Are
You
?

Lol I am simply asking you why are you still here if the cognitive dissonance is so painful? I see you rant and tirade every other post, does it make you happy? If so, stay. If not, also stay. I am not asking you to go away, I am just interested in how you behave. Of course feel free to stay, freedom of expression is the number 1 human right

It is interesting to see that you will try to drag DW into this based on your own assumptions that I am asking you to leave. Where is the logic?
