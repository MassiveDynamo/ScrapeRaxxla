Lol I am simply asking you why are you still here if the cognitive dissonance is so painful? I see you rant and tirade every other post, does it make you happy? If so, stay. If not, also stay. I am not asking you to go away, I am just interested in how you behave. Of course feel free to stay, freedom of expression is the number 1 human right

It is interesting to see that you will try to drag DW into this based on your own assumptions that I am asking you to leave. Where is the logic?
This thread goes beyond theories. It is also a frustration volcano, which stops the mantel of long term searchers from cracking.
All regular posters on this thread are great and valuable, even at points when their faith is being tested!
It's also great fun, and as ultimately this is a game, that last point should not be undervalued!
