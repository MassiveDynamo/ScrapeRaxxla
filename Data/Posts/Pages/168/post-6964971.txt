Could be one of the most compelling arguments I've seen in a while. Who knows? Perhaps Raxxla is the Guardian's home world?

Hmm... in their latter days their homeworld became the power base for their emerging religion. It wasn't completely anti-technology, but probably sufficiently so for it very unlikely for it to be Raxxla as we know it.

Having said that, there's no reason why it may not have become Raxxla after the mainstream Guardians were wiped out - there's not telling what might of been done subsequently by their AI, or by the technophile section of their society which was exiled in their first civil war.

Also, it's always possible that the Raxxla myth is a distortion of some of their religious beliefs. We're light on details other than it was centred around biology and nature, but that would quite conceivably result in their place of origin being considered a special place.
