Wish we had some idea as to what will tell us when we've found it. Be it a "one of these things is not like the others" scenario, if the name Raxxla shows up after the planet gets scanned, or a bunch of npcs flying around in a system in the middle of all nowhere. Just something that, without telling us where to look, tells us what to look out for. Cause as far as I know, Raxxla may as well have been the frozen moon I scanned three days ago.
