People live on planets without atmospheres - they just do it inside boxes.
Raxxla probably isn't a gas giant though.

True, but then again it supposedly predates horizons. So if we exclude landable planets, where a detailed surface scan would reveal any settlements/ outposts on the surface map, I can't really think of any other way to confirm that you had found it. The system map might tell you that there's a population, but that covers the system, not the individual planets. Not to mention all the supposed secrecy would mean that the population data would be locked from the navigation computers, hence, the terraformed planet that shouldn't be there is Raxxla.
