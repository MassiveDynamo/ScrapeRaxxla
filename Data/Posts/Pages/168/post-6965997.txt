I just realized how dumb i am. Obviously if people are living on Raxxla, then it'll either be an earth-like, terraformed, or both. And if it's terraformed while still being out of inhabited space, that might be what gives it away.

People live on planets without atmospheres - they just do it inside boxes.
Raxxla probably isn't a gas giant though.
