Wow ! I am so happy to pass from being a pre-alpha-chymera chaser to an alpha-chymera chaser ! Just a couple of years more for the full release of Raxxla ! [big grin]

They'll be releasing Raxxla as a paid 'cosmetic' item in the Frontier store. No word yet on whether or not it will be free for Kickstarter backers or Lifetime Expansion Pass holders though ...
