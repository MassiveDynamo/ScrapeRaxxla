Fdev have said raxxla has been "honked" !
Also there is now a guardian ai (he insists on being called skippy the magnificent) construct with a collectable "key" hhmmmmm

This seems to be fake news. It frequently is mentioned but nobody can find the oriignal source. The only pukka references to Raxxla are mentioned by Macros on the first page of this thread. If you can find an original FD source for this Iâ€™m sure he will update fp accordingly.
