Why is there a map filter for constellations? As soon as you move away from Sol they start to deform and become unrecognisable. What is the purpose of having it in the game? Is it just something interesting to look at? It only works if you happen to be very close to Sol.
Are we supposed to use it somehow?
I think it makes some sense. Our constellations are only visible from where we're at... so as soon as you move anywhere else in the galaxy they are going to deform, as you are not drawing on paper This is how it is IRL, and I'm not sure there is any other possible way to do it in-game.....
