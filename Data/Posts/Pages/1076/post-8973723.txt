I think it makes some sense. Our constellations are only visible from where we're at... so as soon as you move anywhere else in the galaxy they are going to deform, as you are not drawing on paper This is how it is IRL, and I'm not sure there is any other possible way to do it in-game.....
Yeah, that's kinda my point. Why have it in the game if it's only visible as we know it from Sol? I'm wondering if you can use it to find Raxxla. If you take into consideration The Toast of The Dark Wheel in the codex, and the speculation that the location of Raxxla is hidden in myths and stories. If your going looking for Raxxla, maybe start looking from Sol. That's all I got tho, really. Cassiopeia? Polaris? Permit Lock? Guess I'll give the wheel a turn. o7
