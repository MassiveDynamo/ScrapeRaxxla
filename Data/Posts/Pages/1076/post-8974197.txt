I had completely forgotten about that.

So if one were to try using the constellations as a map base, they could effectively be anywhere in the galaxy targettng Sol, viewing the constellations and using those to reference their own position relative to the constellations as seen from Sol.

That could potentially be very useful if the constellation stars are important to Raxxla in any (which we still don't know )
Pretty much yeah however it gets harder to line up the further you are, from my own perspective 10k ly and below is the best it gets hairy after that
