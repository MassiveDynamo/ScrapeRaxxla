Why is there a map filter for constellations? As soon as you move away from Sol they start to deform and become unrecognisable. What is the purpose of having it in the game? Is it just something interesting to look at? It only works if you happen to be very close to Sol.
Are we supposed to use it somehow?
No, that was dev tool they checked Stellar Forge to match. Then left checkbox for funboys.
