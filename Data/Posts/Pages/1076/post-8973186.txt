Any way, having trinkets in my hold tried to pick other drops, 40 s later got attacked by 5 pirates. Those dumbs didn't even try to pick stuff around their self They demand my.
Interesting. So, to me, it kind of seems like they are weary of the trinkets themselves (as if they think they are cursed maybe?), but any other cargo and they are ready to pounce on you. Is that about right?
