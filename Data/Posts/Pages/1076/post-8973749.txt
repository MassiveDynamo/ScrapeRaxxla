Already been answered. It was a dev tool to line up the skybox or check it was lined up properly and they left it in after people asked for it to be left in.

It was nothing to do with Raxxla, whether it is a tool that can help rather depends on whether the constellations as seen from Sol have anything to do with the 'solution' or not. Its not a clue. Its a developer tool that looks nice.
