Could Raxxla, whatever it is, be something to be found like the generation ships? Like someone has to be in the right system, point at the right star and travel a certain number of Ls..

We may just need to find from where and to we need to point. And this is indeed something that could be in the game since gamma or beta.

Already done several times in several systems. The thing is, how to point with perfect accuracy to the aimed star? After a MLs the deviation may be huge...
But why not to try, again ? Starting point best bet, imho, Tau Ceti.
