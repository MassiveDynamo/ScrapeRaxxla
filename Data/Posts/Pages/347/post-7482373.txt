This sort of info should be documented so it’s a little more obvious, thanks! But the Raxxla rumour has been around since before that date so it can’t be an Orbis.

However it might be an early Ocellus. Wiki says “Modern Coriolis stations are cuboctahedrons with a 2-kilometer diameter. When it was first introduced by GalCop, the design had a much smaller diameter of 1 kilometer, but beginning in the 3200's the size was increased.” Galcop was the era of the original game, so way back; I’m sure someone else can put a date to it. “Modern Coriolis” implies there was at least one earlier version. This might fit the design shown in the Raxxla codex entry.

I think TDW hidden station is an orbis “having originated during the early years of the Federation and persisted over the centuries with minimal changes”. It is clearly a wheel shape

Oh yeah Raxxla is much older than that for sure. Jason Ryder was told of it by his dad and even then it was a fabled mystery that seemed old. So the story of it predates the formation of TDW by a bit. But, TDW was originally formed in the station, that’s no earlier than 3100. So either they moved into the station later or they formed later than the 22nd century and the historian quoted in the codex is incorrect.
