Coma bernices is in the asterism called the great diamond (aka virgos diamond) could be the jewel we seek. Inside the asterism we find bernices hair. I have travelled to rr virginis and 32 coma bernices wich i found to be high above the bubble( nothing there).
However even higher up in this region is 24 coma bernices which seems to be difficult to plot to but doesnt seem imposibble to get to .
I ran out of jumpoinium mats before i could reach it(had 50 100% boosts was not enough). Also in this region we have the lich star neutron( could be used to boost ur range a bit. Another note edsm says someone has been to coma 24 bernices but theres no data a player named jsullivan (sci fi writer?)
May be easier to get there with 80ly range i tryed in my 64ly and was just short on a few crucial jumps with the 100% boost one in particular was something like 144ly
