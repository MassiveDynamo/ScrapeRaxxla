I found Raxxla, I found Raxxla!!!!!

I know I did, I just can't remember. Last thing I remember was waking up at Baker's Prospect in a Sidewinder left to me by "someone", along with a cryptic letter. It seems obvious to me now that I did indeed find Raxxla, but they destroyed my ship and wiped my memory. I guess someone there took pity on me and loaned me a ship at least.
