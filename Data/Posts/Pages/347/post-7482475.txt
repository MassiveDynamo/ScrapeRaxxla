1. Raxxla is not a portal
2. Polaris is reserved for Thargs

In fairness here;

1. We don't know that.
2. We don't know that either, it's just the most obvious thing given FFE - the thing with that though is that it being the obvious thing also makes it a prime candidate for not actually being the obvious thing, if you see what I mean.
3. Yeah... that bit does have a certain bovine excrement whiff about it doesn't it!

Anyone ever seen a source for that alleged DB statement?
