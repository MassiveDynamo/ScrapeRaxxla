Id love it to be related to the FFE Journal entries relating to the Kidnapped Bubble Ship the Leviathan.... which incidentally was " the galaxy's first Bubble equipped with a hyperspace drive and crammed with Casimir generators " Casimir... nudge nudge

http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/first-encounters/journals/all/ (search for Kidnap.. also search Bubble for background on Bubble ships)

Could be wrong because I think the FFE is supposed to be in the 3200s which would make it the 33rd century.... but then maybe the writer of the visitor beacon was a descendant of one of the celebrators of the "New Millennium" at the end of 1999 instead of the end of 2000... when it actually started.
FFE starts in 3250. Which parts of the FFE history that has survived, is a bit hazy.
There are quite a few of the journal stories that have been confirmed by tourist beacons, in the Alioth region. The Antares story also starts in the journals.
Other parts have been completely abandoned. In FFE the federation had a huge population of sentient androids. The Empire used extensive cloning and genetic manipulation on their population.
The Thargoid part seem to be relatively intact, up to the point where the hand coded missions starts and the player makes choices that influences the overall events. The Journal extracts contains the stories for all the paths. It seems that in ED, not much happened after Mic Turner went missing. All we know is that Bill Turner has a Quest ship with Thargoid damage, in his workshop.
