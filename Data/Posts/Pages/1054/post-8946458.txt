In my mind at 3am yes, it was obvious, on paper I can list one sound that could be 'delivered' and one D-scan. Guardian stuff needs 2 objects to unlock / decipher. So 2+2=doors opening.

I had a dream once where selling pop-corn at the docks was a fantastic idea, I didnt tell anyone about that one obviously, dont want them stealing my idea.

Well, I’ve heard of popcorn shrimp
Hadn’t realised they were the purchasers of the popcorn!

The only thing I dream of at 3am is of getting back to a good night’s sleep!

Edit: Oh, and Salam Hayek! That’s, unfortunately, when I wake up
