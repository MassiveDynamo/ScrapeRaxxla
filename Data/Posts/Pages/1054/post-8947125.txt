Ok, this answers my question I had a few pages back. Seems that I'm coming to very similar conclusions/suspicions as you, independently.

Follow-up question: Did you get a mission in a Degraded Emission, where you had to scoop a black box and then got an assassination-mission (kill a religious leader)?
Interesting, that's almost the same mission string I received from TDW in SD from "Ariel".

I have the logs, the first was an Elite mission I couldn't accept. Then received a black box, and assassination (deserter though) mission.

I have a screen shot of his chat comments as I thought they were interesting.

Something like "I was once like you, but I won't kill for them any more" or.something to that effect.

I'm on my phone so will have to dredge up the screen shot for accuracy later.
