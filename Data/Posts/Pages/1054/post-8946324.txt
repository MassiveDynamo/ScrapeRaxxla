I'd spotted that too in my tinfoil googling...

Id love it to be related to the FFE Journal entries relating to the Kidnapped Bubble Ship the Leviathan.... which incidentally was " the galaxy's first Bubble equipped with a hyperspace drive and crammed with Casimir generators " Casimir... nudge nudge

http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/first-encounters/journals/all/ (search for Kidnap.. also search Bubble for background on Bubble ships)

Could be wrong because I think the FFE is supposed to be in the 3200s which would make it the 33rd century.... but then maybe the writer of the visitor beacon was a descendant of one of the celebrators of the "New Millennium" at the end of 1999 instead of the end of 2000... when it actually started.
