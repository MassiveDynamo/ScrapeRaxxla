Yes, I've thought that. I did ponder trying to search for a cargo pod adrift in the asteroid belt, but there doesn't really seem to be one...
Is there a possibility that something in Elite Legacy ties in with Milton cosmology?
One would expect so, but Ive not as of late been able to identify anything - obvious.

But again I do find it laborious and dry to read, contextually there aren’t many obvious classical references (could be well hidden) that are made overtly apparent, the emphasis apart from the protagonists is upon a certain deity, I do wonder if the system naming has relevance to a key historical incident linked by those locations, or the characters likewise.

The book doesn’t seem to have any allegorical references, but thats probably due to my scholarly bias.

Likewise from a gaming convention I too would expect a physical aspect ought to be presented in that system, I wonder if it’s hidden behind more obfuscation/faction missions?
