Everything about Sirius is suspicious. Both Waypoint and Lucifer are interesting names. Not least when analysing Paradise lost.
Though one has to be slightly careful about analysing names inherited from FE2/FFE that way - they may have been incorporated into the puzzle, and they certainly had quite a bit of choice over which FE2/FFE systems and stations to inherit, but they potentially have slightly different standing to ones that first appeared in ED.
