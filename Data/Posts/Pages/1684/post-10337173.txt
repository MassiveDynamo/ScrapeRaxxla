I don't have any observations to share on any of the recent discussion, it's mostly beyond my experience/knowledge. Sounds promising, though.

The past few days I have been retreading old ground, trying to take the Dark Wheel toast in a more literal, direct fashion. Like a series of directions/a map, even 'a door that is also a key' (in so much as the way forward is blocked by this riddle, 'unlock' it to proceed).

The Mother of Galaxies can still only be Casseiopeia for me - it's a bit prosaic, perhaps, but I recently read about he signal from a Cobra MkIII in Tionisla - the one about 'The Vain Queen rides a Giraffe that rembers her Daughters Hero'. I think that was related to the Formidine Rift business, but it's clearly describing Casseiopeia again.

"The Parents Grief, the Lovers woe"? I went over to see Marco Qwent today, Engineer up my Cobra MK IV's power plant - it really needs it with all the junk I've wedged into that ship - anyway, I saw he lives on the planet 'Lucifer'.

And then, it must be the Milton talk getting to me, I thought - couldn't Lucifer be the Parent's grief, the Lovers woe?

So I hit up the DSS, mapped the surface. 9 signals found.

8 Human.

1 Other.

I have never seen an 'other' before!

However, it only appeared when I was down on the surface - over the horizon from me, I locked it through the Nav panel - but when I took off again it vanished from HUD and Nav panel. So far re-mapping, re-logging, re-mappping haven't brought it back.

I searched online for more info, but all I could really find is that 'other' signals have turned up elsewhere (a sign I'm not on the rigt track? Probably), and that they seem to be prone to this vanishing behaviour.

So I don't think it's gonna turn out to be anything - but has anyone else ever seen an 'other' type surface signal?
