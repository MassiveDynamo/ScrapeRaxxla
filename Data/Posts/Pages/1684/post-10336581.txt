Like a broken egg…

Or the Orion Nebula complex…



Or a Thargoid Symbol….
Or a weird Symbol in a garden….
Or something kinda Miltonian…

I wondered when I recently did the Brookes Memorial Tour if the final TB Milton quote about the Pendant Sphere was actually another hint...zoom out in Galaxy mao and you see a "golden chain" leading to the Orion Nebula. That chain contains a system named " Legacy". I did search it because of the name repetition (MB's book, megaship name, etc) but found nothing....but what are we looking for?

And from what I understand of the Milton cosmology that @Rochester has proved to be embedded in the game I don't think the Orion Neb fits (though I really need to see a 3D model as I can't visualise it very well).
