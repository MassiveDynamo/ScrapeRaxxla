I'm viewing the Omphalos Rift as something like a Harry Potter portkey...it could look like any normal object in-game that actually takes you somewhere unusual when triggered. I believe the report that the system has been entered but Raxxla not discovered which tends to support that view. So, a NS (Jackson's Lighthouse?) that jumps you somewhere different? A BH that actually leads somewhere? Those would both be object types in-game from the outset, however NS boosting didn't come in until The Guardians v2.2 in 2016, and I think telling us Raxxla was in game from the outset but not implementing the Omphalos mechansim to get there until a year later would be very underhand and I dont think MB or DB would do that. An undetectable BH would be a good possibility....a grapefruit-sized BH orbiting in the Oort cloud was one candidate theory for "Sol planet X" .
On release the only viable mechanic in the game was the POI. Everything was in a POI. A planet that does not show up on scans with a POI in close orbit, would have been the easiest way to implement it. The POI wouldn't even have to contain anything. It could just jump you directly, when you drop in.
The POI has probably been moved to the surface of the planet by now and have some visual components.
