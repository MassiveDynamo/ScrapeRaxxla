Brilliant will give that a go, and compare it with my maps, it might highlight something, didn’t know it could do that.

Given the potential search area it’s highly likely a Cmdr will have mapped it already, although its possible no one has too, but that’s not to say it’s not there.

Given the description in the map - if accurate then it’s drilling down into the system arrangement and advocating we look at or scrutinise a particular celestial body.

I think this might outline that Raxxla might not appear in the scanner and we need to get up close the body it’s around/on/is?

I’m hoping the colourisation of the map and numerical markings; such as the potential presence of rings, or number of Cedars - is integral. If that’s the case the system ought to be instantly recognisable to those familiar with that image?!

I'm viewing the Omphalos Rift as something like a Harry Potter portkey...it could look like any normal object in-game that actually takes you somewhere unusual when triggered. I believe the report that the system has been entered but Raxxla not discovered which tends to support that view. So, a NS (Jackson's Lighthouse?) that jumps you somewhere different? A BH that actually leads somewhere? Those would both be object types in-game from the outset, however NS boosting didn't come in until The Guardians v2.2 in 2016, and I think telling us Raxxla was in game from the outset but not implementing the Omphalos mechansim to get there until a year later would be very underhand and I dont think MB or DB would do that. An undetectable BH would be a good possibility....a grapefruit-sized BH orbiting in the Oort cloud was one candidate theory for "Sol planet X" .
