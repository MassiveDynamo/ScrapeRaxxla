I would be wary to suspect that it denotes Earth / Sol, that’s just too easy and doesn’t justify this level of complexity. I presume the hypothetical system diagram from the garden doesn’t seem to fit?

Prior to the fall, the axis was indeed fixed, Milton cleverly utilised the tilt of the earths axis and the movement of the sun across the Earth surface to address the movement of time or more so it’s non movement, prior to the fall, reinforcing the idyllic nature of paradise.

I would be concerned if FD went into SO much detail concerning the math, but then again, this entire concept it totally breathtaking, so who knows!
Oh, I think the axis tilt & "mountain" (Mount Purgatory?) in that garden design is just another hint to Paradise Lost. As I said before I think the station gardens are a visual clue to look at Milton and decode his verse...which makes me wonder if TDW have an allegorical equivalent in Paradise Lost?? This is the in-game "Raxxla storyline" MB mentioned & I'm wondering if "TDW storyline" is part & parcel of that?
