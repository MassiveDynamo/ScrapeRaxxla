I noticed the spokes aren't equilateral. Might be interesting to measure the angular offset -might be 20°?
From a rough vector sketch, YES IT IS

Considering this is view is not perpendicular to the garden, you can see it is still close. In hindsight I should have used 23.5° but honestly I was too excited by this to care about a few degrees
