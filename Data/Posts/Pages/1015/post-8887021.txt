Been thinking about the logistics of 'scanning'. From what I've been able to gather; planets/moons will appear after a honk, listening posts will only appear within 1k ls , guardian within 2k ls (cg gift for everyone), and generation ships being the same as planets/moons. I thought some NSP were limited to 1k-2k ls but i cant confirm that.

Also in the early days a generation ship would have been found by flying to a planet/moon and pointing towards a star and traveling until you hit the ship. I've also herd that these have shifted as time has passed — so if you were to reenact the process — it wouldn't work because the orbits have changed. Probably why they just appear now.

There is also the indicator that says if your in a shipping lane or deep space, could be a way to know if you are on top of something. That small section in the fss, I've never seen a signal in it. right between belts and css.

Basically I'm trying to narrow down the available mechanics that could be used to find something. As far as i can tell , if it is in the bubble ( i totally think i is at this point ) , doing a long trek into the outer skirts of a system from some planetary vectors is about the only way i think it could be found.
