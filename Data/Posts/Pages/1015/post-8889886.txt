It became interesting to me, here Rakslu is compared with Atlantis, Eldorado. but all the words came from somewhere, was the original language. Google identified the language as Maltese, I dug deeper and found that based on the text of the Odyssey, other scholars associate the island of Ogygia with modern Malta. The words "navel of the sea" in this interpretation refer to the Mediterranean Sea, in the central part of which Malta is located, that is, the analogue of omphalus.
I hope Google translated correctly the navel of the sea.

I think I ate the Olivier salad.....

Yeah, it's probably one of the best theories, if you can dig into ancient Greek literature. I believe those discord group folks have been working on this. Might take a few years to take in that much classical culture. Book club anyone? When I search for "Rakslu" I only find information on church architecture.
