yes, i believee that was either Polaris or LFT 509? I think Polaris if my memory serves...

Both have been mapped. Both have a gas giant with 8 moons i believe.

Purchasing exploration data would net you the stations too (which is what the fleet carriers were allowing - no bug or hacked workaround, just the system working as designed without forethought), but there were only stellar bodies. It is safe to say that if either of these systems is a potential place for the dark wheel, that fdev hasn't injected the station yet. This ensures that the system also doesn't show up on galactic filters (since a station would create population and economy etc)
