Witch's Reach

Tracked a ship from Union of Ditibi Revolutionary Party departing from Serebrov Gateway to Witch's Reach. Tried to follow the wake, but no permit...

Mmm, I tried it at Lawd 26; frustrating! How can they do it without a permit? Or perhaps they do have it!?
But I think FD have said NPC donâ€™t require permits so it must be just another part of their AI RNG.
