Or it's a special type of station that doesn't appear on maps and doesn't create economy.

if fdev could create such a thing, they would have in previous situations where such a thing would have helped them. The great thing about the stellar forge and all is also what keeps fdev from doing those kinds of things. It's what keeps them doing a lot of things that would make sense in hand-created scenarios.
