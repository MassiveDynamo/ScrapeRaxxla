who interpreted the emblem as black ships at the edges, and the station was locked on target? call to attack the station?
see how black 6 gons look like ships ...




It became interesting to me, here Rakslu is compared with Atlantis, Eldorado. but all the words came from somewhere, was the original language. Google identified the language as Maltese, I dug deeper and found that based on the text of the Odyssey, other scholars associate the island of Ogygia with modern Malta. The words "navel of the sea" in this interpretation refer to the Mediterranean Sea, in the central part of which Malta is located, that is, the analogue of omphalus.
I hope Google translated correctly the navel of the sea.

I think I ate the Olivier salad.....
