A journey is an act of travelling from one place to another; if one does not have directions one is roaming; to go from place to place without purpose or direction.

Ergo Brookes I believe indicated there was a direction. A direction can be identified either through the use of prominent landmarks, waypoints on a map or instructions from another person or source of information or missions.

I agree.

As per my post recently. In the DJ interview that everyone cites for the "it's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you were at this stage, it's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." quote, a few minutes later Brookes says "You still have to do the journey though" when talking about travelling to Sagittarius A*.

Therefore it's very likely Brookes meant a physical journey - since he used the same word a few mins later relating to travelling 22kly.
