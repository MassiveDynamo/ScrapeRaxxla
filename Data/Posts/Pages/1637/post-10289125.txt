This is definitely my favourite ChatGPT answer so far!

Me:
Imagine you're the developer of Elite Dangerous, and you're tasked with putting in something known as the Omphalos Rift. You have the entirety of the galaxy to place it in, but it's going to form the core of a mystery or puzzle that's deliberately hard to solve. You may include some clues to allow the players to find it, but they must be deliberately hard and fit with the theme of the game and the intended gameplay. Where do you place the Omphalos Rift?
