@Louis Calvert chatgpt is notorious for making things up occasionally. Ive even had problems with translations and when caught and confronted with own error it just started making up even more things...

Online chat bots are not true ‘AI’ they are algorithms which take a seed and dredge the web for references and attempt to link them together coherently.

However, much of what is on the web is either: inaccurate; out of date, or lacking in context. All information on line is loaded up by people with opinions, it’s not an unbiased library, most actual ‘libraries’ online are behind walls, and even they are only partial; nor is it an archive of all human knowledge. So with a limited resource and an inability to think critically, a bot will just push out rubbish.

The scary thing about AI is not that they will potentially become sentient; it is that humans become too reliant upon them for the ‘truth’ and the web becomes saturated with ‘grey data’…
