Online chat bots are not true ‘AI’ they are algorithms which take a seed and dredge the web for references and attempt to link them together coherently.

However, much of what is on the web is either: inaccurate; out of date, or lacking in context. All information on line is loaded up by people with opinions, it’s not a library nor an archive of all human knowledge. So with a limit resource and an inability to think critically, a bit will just push out rubbish.

The scary thing about AI is not that they will potentially become sentient; it is that humans become too reliant upon them for the ‘truth’ and the web becomes saturated with ‘gray data’…
AI takes over the world?

SPOILER: NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN
