Michael's choice of words is interesting in particular "Journey". For me that adds to the potential that no-one has visited the system where Raxxla is by accident as per the persistent rumour. I definitely think you have to make some kind of journey, following a path of clues to get there rather than just accidentally stumbling on it.
