I guess one way of seeing whether this description is intentional or not is to raise a support ticket and flag it for spelling/grammar errors, if they come back and say it's by design then we might be onto something!

Looking back at the kickstarter page there were 12 backers who got the writer's pack and 6 more from the tiers beyond that would be eligible.
One of the Writer's packs was David Hughes (a.k.a. Selezen) who not only was an early syncretist but also did Elite Encounters RPG. I don't know if the folks behind Elite Dangerous RPG also had a Writer's pack. Of the two RPGs, Elite Encounters is much more lore-heavy.
