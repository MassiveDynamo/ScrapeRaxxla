I agree.

As per my post recently. In the DJ interview that everyone cites for the "it's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you were at this stage, it's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." quote, a few minutes later Brookes says "You still have to do the journey though" when talking about travelling to Sagittarius A*.

Therefore it's very likely Brookes meant a physical journey - since he used the same word a few mins later relating to travelling 22kly.
I don't know if it is true, but in the past i saw posts here and on reddit saying that when a player reach 1M ly of hyperspace travel, he receives a message from unknown person.
1M ly is a journey, not everyone did it. Do you think it can be reliable?
I'm only at 700k ly travel but if someone with 1M+ ly can tell us it will be a good checking.
