As an alternate idea - all capitalisations are technically represented by the star classes. So if all the capitals are used:
"The home of The Link. The Link is All; no above, no bellow, we are One. From the Gate, the Conduit leads One to All. They are Many, but there is One Link. Those who are Not, will Never Be. Down below, the followers of the Link care not of politics, or puny power struggle. The One explores the All from the Conduit. They will open their eyes to Others to trade. But close their fists to Who is Not"
For D I have used White Dwarf seeing as it is not present in Wolf Rayet which can take up the W and R letters.

Code:

The parallel to a blacksmiths bellows is clear enough - stars are a type of forge - a if you will.

My other interpretation is more pragmatic - the group is simply stating they have a flat organisational structure. Hence they "care not of politics or puny power struggle":
= leaderless, no ranks or tiered structure of leadership
= no angry disputes / disagreements / in-fighting (taken from the meaning to shout angrily or in pain)

The alternative to these being a route indicated by the star types (IMHO a bit far fetched if they aren't all within a short range (e.g. 7 to 20 ly) from each other, is that it's a code. We haven't had an FD code puzzle for a while......
