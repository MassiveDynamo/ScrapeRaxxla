The Landscape / Siren Signal is revealing even more secrets...

A repetitive sound akin to a heartbeat can be picked up in the low frequency range of the signal. Once you delete the audio above 200Hz and focus on the deep hum you start to hear something repetitive amongst the rumbling static. Once I filtered out this noise it showed clear as day there is a repeating sound buried in there.



My heavy bias is hearing a heartbeat pulsating sound. Naturally this can only be heard once you speed up the audio by about 2x - 3x which I want to say links it to my time dilation theory, but regardless of what is causing it, there is clear evidence now that it is something regular and cyclical. You can also see it takes around 20 seconds to build up to its full strength (around the 2nd 'A' shape).

The first time I cleared up the noise I genuinely felt a shudder of excitement hearing it. I know it was just my mind playing tricks on me, but there was also a sense that this could be more real than just a faint breath amongst the sirens and static. This thing might have a heartbeat!
