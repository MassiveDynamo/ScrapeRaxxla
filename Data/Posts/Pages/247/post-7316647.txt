Well, whilst heading to Antares from the bubble, I stumbled across a listening post that wasn't listed on Cononn website. Got rather excited, but having visited it's companions and found the site, it was probably amongst the dullest there is. It's a crashed Conda (Trading Vessel MD-02 on HR 6051 2f). Found two logs there, both about survival tips. The logs say numbers /11, but can't find a trail or signals of any other wreckage nearby. Predicting a dead end again, back to check out Antares. Even though it really does sound like a lighting related bug.


Hi Spock
can you give me the details please & Iâ€™ll add them to my LP/UCB summary.
