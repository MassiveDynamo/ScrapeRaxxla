It's a special feature they have put in. Just for you. ;-)

Edit: Have you listened to it?

Have you overlay-ed it with the galmap?

It did not happen at Alpha Cygni. That one is only 116 solar radi, though. Antares is 380 solar radi. Almost the size of Rho Cass.

I forgot to mention, I did visit Rho Cas after 3.3 dropped, didn't encounter the visual bug then.
