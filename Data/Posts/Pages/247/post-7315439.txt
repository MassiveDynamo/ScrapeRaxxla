Heres my take, from what I've gathered.

"Whisperer in witchspace, Siren of the deepest void"

The constellation Lyra: "The constellation is associated with the myth of the Greek musician and poet Orpheus. Lyra constellation lies in the northern sky. It represents the lyre, a musical instrument with strings used in antiquity and later times."

"Without Orpheus and his music, the Argonauts would not have been able to make it past the Sirens, whose song enticed sailors to come to them, which usually resulted in sailors crashing their ships into the islands on which the Sirens lived. When the Argonauts approached the islands, Orpheus drew his lyre and played music that drowned out the Sirens’ calls."

and theres the listing of the stars aswell.

Kinda makes you wonder, since they stay that Raxxla is somewhere near SOL.

Lyra is indeed an intresting idea, but which star?
Also, there were several individual names for Sirens in Greek mythology, maybe some of them will ring a bell?

Thelxinoe or Thelxiope or Thelxiepia or Thelxiepe or Thelxiepeia
Aglaophonus or Aglaope or Aglaopheme
Molpe
Aglaonoe
Parthenope
Leucosia
Ligeia
Peisinoe or Pisinoe
Himerope

My guess would be - it's the second star in the pattern we need to visit after the first one, which is "Jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies"
(but that's just my take on the path to raxxla - visiting a series of correct stars)
