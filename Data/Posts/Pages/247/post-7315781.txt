Just adding my theory: my research was focused on the "omphalos" part and the relative myth about Zeus and the two eagles.

I tried to find in the sky the two eagles without any success, at least until i discovered that the Lyra constellation in the past was represented
as a lyre in front of an eagle.

So now we have the two eagles, if we prolonge a line from the two constellations, they will intercept in two points. Maybe we are lucky and Raxxla waits there
