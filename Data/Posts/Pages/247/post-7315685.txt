OK here is all I have currently. My theory is we're not supposed to visit each star but rather trace them in the sky, locate the correct stars and...where that leads I haven't got the foggiest.

But I'm trying not to over-think this. Its possible all this is just pareidolia.

Either way its been a hoot reading these posts and going over old mythology.

"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies" Cassiopeia.

"To the whisperer of whichspace"
Pheme - the whisper (in constellation of Perseus).

The siren of the deepest void - hell/Hades, the sirens looked over Persephone before she was taken by Hades. Virgo

”parents Grief” Cepheus

“Lovers woe” Perseus

"Yearning of vagabond hearts" - Hermes protector of travellers and vagabonds. Or Odysseus who dressed as a vagabond when he returned to his wife Penelope. Who was beset by suitors who 'encircled her'...

Vulture and navel = Lyra / Cygnus link to north star by the Egyptian meridian line or naval. In mythology its thought Cygnus could be a bird of pray. There's also a tenuous link to Orion which was Osiris in Egyptian myth god of re-birth. The Orion theory places that the 3 pyramids of Giza have star chambers that point to Orions belt along the meridian line.

Tin-foil roll...depleated.
