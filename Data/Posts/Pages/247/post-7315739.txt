The problem with tinfoil is...
"With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk." -- Attributed to von Neumann

The DW quote might be directions. On the other hand it might be a toast. (although it depends on the kind of author). Imagine the toast maker turning in a circle after toasting each stellar body. In which case you might be able to figure out where the toaster is... or not as the case may be.
Astrophel could be the first thing you find on google ... or .. it could be a children's story and since its not available in game it is not a clue at all.

For the practical minded player the only tangible clue is 2296 but since there is no gameplay that supports that route, we are left again with mythological elephant fitting.
