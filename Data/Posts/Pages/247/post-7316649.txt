There is a secondary effect as well. The light that hits the ship, does not come directly from the star.
If you use the external camera to look at the shadows inside the cockpit, you see that the light is of by up to about 60Â°.
At about 38,000 ls, the shadows lign up with the star.
The offset is not linear. It will increase and decrease, from 38,000 ls and out.

Sounds like a bug rather than an intended feature. Have you raised a bug report to check the response?
