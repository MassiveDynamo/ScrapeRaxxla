well, just updated my comet search sheet with Riedquat; 14 comets, took a while! One was 30kls out. And of course the gravitational effect of the star & planets slows down the fsd when travelling between comets...think that's all the Old Worlds completed!

This system again has highlighted to me that comets seem to be integral to the gameplay. At two comets in this system (& one elsewhere) I dropped in to find a SAR ship already there; strangely one of them was carrying a load of mines!
I've also seen during this comet hunting extravaganza about a dozen or more examples of npc appearing in SC out of a comet position, and a few have dropped in after me. Including a few pirates- since I'm in an exploration ship I find the best thing is to jump out, wait till they also jump out & try to interdict me, I escape the interdiction (I do like the Phantom!) and they dont trouble me after that.
