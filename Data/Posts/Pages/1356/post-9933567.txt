Heres one for you, the new spinning wheel of death that is coming for us currently can be listened to through the FSS from anywhere within around a 2k ly radius (Not confirmed further but I can do it 2kly out) what if Raxxla could be "listened to" also as a way to locate, this was proposed in the past with the sound of Sag A and other fss noises.

Here be the wheel ;-) also what if the Dark wheel station is the old Thargoid station (its going to be like a round wheel if Thargoid designed) from the older Elite game in Polaris and they are using that to travel far distances to try find Raxxla ;-)
It has been foretold in the ancient tomes....

SPOILER: UNE PETITE TOME ;)
