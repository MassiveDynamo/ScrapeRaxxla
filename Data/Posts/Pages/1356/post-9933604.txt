Interesting to see vids of the new “spiralling star” “phenomenon” which seems to be travelling by micro-jumping within systems, rather than by our current Supercruise technology. Old drive type?
Micro jumps was the method for fast in-system travel in Elite. It was also a design concept for ED. Super cruise was chosen over micro jumps, by the Founders.
