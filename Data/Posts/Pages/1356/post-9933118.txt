Nice collection. If you want a tinfoily task, you could go out to Alpha Cygni (Deneb). I'm pretty sure it has a couple of comets. I haven't been able to verify, as I haven't gotten the hang of the method.

Would be funny if the system map ghosts matches comets.
See my previous post (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-9932029) about the method, its not difficult, just fiddly & time consuming. So I’m limiting it to places where I think there’s a chance of Raxxla-currently the Old Worlds and a couple of others a bit further out that occured to me lorewise, then I might go BH diving again. Before moving my corvette out to Colonia before the A Little Nearer Still God arrives, which I think will be in time for the next update -November?

Nah, fairly convinced the system map ghosts were a graphics bug from the Coronal Mass Ejections animation.
