Ive put a link in my signature to my comet searches. Red system names are work in progress..

Nice collection. If you want a tinfoily task, you could go out to Alpha Cygni (Deneb). I'm pretty sure it has a couple of comets. I haven't been able to verify, as I haven't gotten the hang of the method.

Would be funny if the system map ghosts matches comets.
