Nice collection. If you want a tinfoily task, you could go out to Alpha Cygni (Deneb). I'm pretty sure it has a couple of comets. I haven't been able to verify, as I haven't gotten the hang of the method.

Would be funny if the system map ghosts matches comets.
The body id game in Alpha Cygni?
Been there, done that.

Empty signals are not named as comets, just "Alpha Cygni"
