Itâ€™s interesting that the middle light in the iris reflection is slightly off rotation between the left and right eyes. The center "star" in the her left eye is deflected too far to her left as compared to the other eye (in addition to their being a faint trail of light in that eye which is not obvious in the other). The shape/orientation could certainly come from Orion or the handle of the Big Dipper, at least on initial glance though I can't reconcile the relative brightness of the three to Orion.

There look to be two other oddities to my eye in the image though:
1) her hairline (between her eyes) is not right. Seems to me like there is something there that I just can't tease out, though I suppose it may just be a dithering issue
2) there is some kind of smudge/shape next to the candle flame which is difficult for me to discern
