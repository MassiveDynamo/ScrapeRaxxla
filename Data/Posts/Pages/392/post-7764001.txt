Matlab seems well suited to these sorts of puzzles.(many useful intrinsics, and import functionality)

So far attempts to shift the cipher text into something sane have failed. (may try something like a brute force search over night)

There are 32 refs to 'remember' or some variant of such in Premonition and 65 in Reclamation. The one that stands out is in chapter 31 of Premonition:

"The truth must be known... and all this pain will end... they will ... remember." (similar to the text in the clue)

The chapter ends with the word "Martyr!"

I am going to be focusing next on trying to figure out if it is a plain text scramble of some sort, of if it is a pure cipher text.
