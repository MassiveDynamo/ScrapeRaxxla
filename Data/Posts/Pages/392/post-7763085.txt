The fixed number of characters per line and the somewhat antiquated fixed with font might suggest that the vertical alignment matters. Perhaps they are like a set of rotors that have a specific offset specified by a keyword of some sort. The problem is that some of the capitols would still not make much sense. (unless there are both row and column offsets)

Edit:
'Remember' fits an even number of times vertically and 'kahinaloren' fits horizontally. Still need to write the code to evaulate it.
