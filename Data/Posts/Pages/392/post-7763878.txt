I definitely remember Drew saying this about the Formidine Rift mystery. I definitely do not remember any comments about required permits etc. regarding Raxxla. I think there has often been an assumption that at least one Elite ranking is required to find Raxxla but there has never been any confirmation that I have heard of.

Hmm.... interesting. Maybe i got my wires crossed then.
