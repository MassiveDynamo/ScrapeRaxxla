Hi guys,

In a bit of a discussion over reddit about how i seem to recall Brookes or someone from FD saying that you didn't need any special ranks or permits to find Raxxla. As i recall it was someone asking if you could find it with any ship or you needed something like a Cutter, and FD said no ranks or permits required.

Is my mind playing tricks on me? Anyone have the relevant quote?
I definitely remember Drew saying this about the Formidine Rift mystery. I definitely do not remember any comments about required permits etc. regarding Raxxla. I think there has often been an assumption that at least one Elite ranking is required to find Raxxla but there has never been any confirmation that I have heard of.
