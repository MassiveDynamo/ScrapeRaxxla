Quick update: I’m following up on the “another clue?” From the 2nd post on page 390. One of the planets I was exploring has a very odd look to it in night vision. I dare say at times it looks more like a structure that’s been dusted over. At one point I encountered some music I hadn’t heard. It was like the guardian site music but had some drums of war type layers to it. Also came across a small military/science site looking thing that was not coming up on any scan or anything. But every time I killed the last skimmer my game crashed and it would load me away from where I was. The site seemed to disappear too even though I found it once more. Never got a chance to look/scan whatever is/might be there in my Srv. But mainly what’s been bothering me are the patterns and textures I’m seeing in night vision. Either it’s a graphics issue of some kind or there is something deeply odd and suspicious about the location I’m in. I’ll look into it further later tonight when I get back home.
