Its worth being a bit cautious with the information from Drew and in his books - There are quite a few nods to his oolite saga stories to include Raxxla as Lave2, Rebecca seemingly making an appearance as the old lady in his E : D books etc.

There were some great stories written about oolite to include Drews works, and some of Drews stories also reference these other authors works to make it even more complicated!

Drew has also said in the past that he's not party to all of the lore information so I reckon that this little mystery is more to do with his upcoming blog than the in game search for Raxxla / the dark wheel.
...however I am frequently wrong!
