Ok, Engineers, like shipyards to set up a convenient ship. Career = rank/rep/permit.
But strictly related to your being ?
Career = miner vs trader. Pirate vs bounty hunter. Career path the most personal thing. Lots of people Elite rep, but with differ quantity or ships destroyed, bounties issued, bounties claimed, systems visited, or mined, etc, etc.
This made me think a while ago that perhaps engineering COULD be linked, as to unlock all engineers, it makes you play every aspect of the game...even mining!
