Well the article says it could be anywhere, so it's not much help really! ;-) The bit about the pilots would be interesting if it's been used in ED, but it's certainly not cannon
I'd imagine it's in reference to the first or second game? I keep trying to play oolite (I understand it supposed to be a replica of the original?) but can't figure out how to do anything at all other fly around, poorly. I can't even dock at the station it starts you by. I'd really love to explore the (official) old version of the universe for potential insight or perspective but fear the same results.
