Mmhh.. So you take the wrong career path and then you'll never have any chance to find Raxxla with your current account... Not very likely, imho, but why not ?
EDIT: oh you mean some Engineer may give some clue ? Not only tech for your ship ? Could be... Ryder ?
What does she buy/sell, besides upgrades ?
Landmines! Lol. I think Ryder is too early on in the engineering. We know Bill Turner is linked to the club....
What I was really thinking was that maybe Grade 5 with EVERY engineer unlocks something?? Only a thought. I dont know how many people have grade 5 with every engineer? I suspect its significantly less than how many triple elites there are
