I'm wondering now about the criteria needed to find Raxxla. See if you agree with any of these.

1) Must be Elite, Triple Elite, or Elite in just Combat?
2) Must have a Founders Permit, or other systems permit?
3) Must play in Open?
4) Locked behind a permit we can't get? (not in the game yet)?
5) Must have an engineered Exploration or Surface scanner, to see the DW?

Just interested in anyone's opinion on the criteria needed?

My opinion:

1. Maybe - but it's only one of many criteria, given how many Elite and Triple Elite players are out there
2. Founders goes with 1.*
3. No
4. No*
5. No

* My theory is that Raxxla is permit-locked and the route to obtaining that permit is via TDW.
