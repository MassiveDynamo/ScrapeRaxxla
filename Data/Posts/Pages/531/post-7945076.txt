Mmhh.. So you take the wrong career path and then you'll never have any chance to find Raxxla with your current account... Not very likely, imho, but why not ?
EDIT: oh you mean some Engineer may give some clue ? Not only tech for your ship ? Could be... Ryder ?
What does she buy/sell, besides upgrades ?
