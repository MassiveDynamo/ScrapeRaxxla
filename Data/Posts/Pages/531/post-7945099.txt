Due to my teribble Englich, I always am fearing to misunterstand what people want to express, but that personal journey statement seems to point, imho, at some rank/rep/permit thing.
Anything else strictly personal in ED ?
Maybe long supercruise flight? Remeber Raxxla was discovered when starship drives where much simplier...
