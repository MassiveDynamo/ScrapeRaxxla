Styx would be quite close to MB’s “that’s a journey we all must make”. The journey through life to death....

But the lore says Raxxla was found much earlier, so not so sure it has to be all that close to the bubble.

Edit: sigh. Jorki’s docked in Rohini & Tyko’s mooching around near Altera’s Eye. Do I really want a second clone to investigte the bubble? With all that roads to riches & ship engineering effort
Meh!

Does Styx (or any of the other bubble systems) fit the Codex toast? Omphalos? Astrophel & Stella? As well as “journey we all must make” etc?

I think the E/F missions were “obfuscation on the outer rim”- “SD thrumpberry juice deliveries” and FD took them out because of all the salt farmed after the Salomé event; they didn’t want that level of adverse publicity over Raxxla.

Styx ist one boring hell of a system. Went there after scanning Cimmerians when I was experimenting with my own idea of travelling the underworld.

Time for a little theory of mine quietly unrolls tinfoil

Concerning the Stargate theory: Let's assume Raxxla actually is a portal to another Galaxy like Andromeda or Magellan. You find it, activate a portal and get ported over with maybe a way back or not. The problem I think everyone would encounter is a lack of bases to have your ship refilled/repaired from time to time as there shouldn't be too many human fellows over there. So it would depend rather largely on the question of which ship you actually took over wheter you're f****d up royally or just marginally.

Having seen on Remlok (http://remlok-industries.fr/8006/the-outpost-115/?lang=en) that Squadron Carriers might this time be definitely under way as well as maybe base building in some later update made me think whether we might make some progress after the next update as Squadron Carriers are at least mobile bases.
