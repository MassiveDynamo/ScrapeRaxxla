My current hypothesis: Binary/Trinary star system >20Ly from an inhabited system but closer than the nebulas.
Not sure if we're looking at a circumpolar system or something closer to the celestial equator. (If it had been me placing it, it would have been near the celestial equator and so visible to everyone on the planet)
