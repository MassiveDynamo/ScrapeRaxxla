I know Thursday morning is server update day, but I'm so tired with lack of sleep due to the UK heatwave I forgot today's Thursday. So booted up the launcher, "Server Status OK", tried to launch game - "servers cannot be contacted"

Why doesnt the server status reflect that they're offline for update? and when are they likely to be back up??

Edit: apparently some bug fixing & now back online.
