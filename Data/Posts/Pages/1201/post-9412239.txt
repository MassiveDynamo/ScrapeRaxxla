Im gonna be honest, I dont think raxxla is in the game; however, that doesnt mean I wont stop looking. Raxxla couldnt possibly live up to the hype, perhaps it's better that we dont find it.
If I ever do find it, I'll speak up. However, if it doesn't live up to the hype, I probably wont tell for the sake of the game.
