So…

it’s been a while since Raxxla was confirmed as being in the milky way etc…

What’s the worst theory you’ve heard? (Personal opinion and should not matter who said it as they are all equally valid as we don’t know what we’re looking for!)

What’s the best/most probable theory in your opinion?

and finally….

What theory have you spent the most time on and why did you abandon it? (if you have!)

looking forward to Jorki’s answers
