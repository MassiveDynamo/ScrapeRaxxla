Is this the thingy everyone is thinking of…

Spiralling star(s), maybe too obvious… although I wouldn’t put it past FD! Depends if they insert a mega ship called Mary Sidney!

The object is 1,991.83 ly from Sol, we’ll outside the potential Tau Ceti sphere of influence prescribed by FD in the codex; by their own definition it can’t be Raxxla if that assumption about the date is valid, although who is to say whatever is referred to in the Codex isn’t some form of multi-stage map leading elsewhere outside the bubble?

If FD wanted to change something (historically) and it’s apparent they did, that’s the easiest option. But I highly doubt it.

Smells of Thargoid narrative, not my cup of tea, and if so it will just be a waiting game; eventually FD will turn that page so we can read it.

agreed. targs and raxxla kind of do not seem fit.
just rerouted to it. cause it wasa great oprtunity to test my theorie about game mechanics.
boi that was a stunning suprice as i saw that Bodytype. i already checked its not in the Journal api. same as Small body.
when i am home. i check some older data i have and try to check if this body type is completly new or was in game all along. not sure how to do that but time will tell
