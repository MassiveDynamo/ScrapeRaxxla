Ive just checked. There are three comets in Tau Ceti, but no stations orbit one. Ive read somewhere that Avogadro Enterprise does, but as far as I can see that's incorrect - the galmap & orbital marker clearly show it orbiting planet 4. Tau Ceti 4, 5 & 6 due have highly inclined orbits compared to the ecliptic & are elliptical. Seem to remember circular orbit has ellipticity=0, eliptical orbits are between ) & 1, hyperbolic orbit has ellipticity =1; the latter would be a rogue & only a brief visitor to the system
Perhaps you're thinking of Pareco, where 6 stations orbit a comet, there is second comet in Pareco but a fair way out.
FD changed the Tau Ceti system. It used to have a station orbiting nothing (a comet).
Check the pic. in the wiki: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Tau_Ceti

They popped in a couple of extra planets,to fix this, in some update.
