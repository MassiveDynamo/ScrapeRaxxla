On checking these 5 Piscium systems

They are really close to several otger interesting systems plus the list is missing AB-W A2-1 this may be a lead. I decided to stop at Lazutkin vision closest to the AG-W and found a T start 341k ls away, I want to get closer but must fuel. This Wunab system also has a permit for Nastrond which may need investigation as well.

AB-W A2-0 is also quite close to Hel.
