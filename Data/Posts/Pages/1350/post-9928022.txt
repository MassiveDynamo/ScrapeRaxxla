@Pyroboros @Rochester What system and moving object are you all talking about?
Do you mean the moving object in epsilon Indi that PDJazzHands reported a few days ago & which seems to be orbiting to match Mitterand Hollow? I tried to find that but could not see it, at least not in Horizons.
Where is this goid mention coming from? Precise reports please!

Edit: just spotted Rochester had a pic if something in Oochors UF-J c11-0. Is this the object you meant? Is it on a hyperbolic trajectory? Looks like a thargoid of some form! Is this confirmed, not just another Reddit hoax? This is the first Ive heard of it

While I agree in general, there is a side issue here about the 'spehere of influence'

Whilst we have a date for the first mentione of Raxxla, we can't be sure that Raxxla was actually discovered by that time. The myth need not have grown out of actual contact with Raxxla - it could grow only out of third hand evidence of Raxxla, say from some artifact, or by some other communication from a 3rd party.

So it may not be safe to assume that 'sphere of influence'.
2280 First alien artefact found (codex has it on Mars, Allen Stroud’s PhD thesis has it as found orbiting Europa)
2296 earliest recorded mention of Raxxla

Apart from the Unknown Artefact/Thargoid Sensors discovered In 3111 by Prof Penelope Carver’s expedition (see Adamastor) that’s the only possibility. 16 years is enough time for a leak of classified information about it referring to some alien thing called Raxxla to have become urban myth space legend. We have no more information about it. “Raxxla me facit”?
