Is this the thingy everyone is thinking of…

SPOILER


Spiralling star(s), maybe too obvious… although I wouldn’t put it past FD! Depends if they insert a mega ship called Mary Sidney!

The object is 1,991.83 ly from Sol, massive and potentially moving, well outside the potential Tau Ceti sphere of influence prescribed by FD in the codex; by their own definition it can’t be Raxxla if that assumption about the date is valid, although who is to say whatever is referred to in the Codex isn’t some form of multi-stage map leading elsewhere outside the bubble?

If FD wanted to change something (historically) and it’s apparent they did, that’s the easiest option. Or the sphere of influence has a different axis and is much larger. But I highly doubt it.

Smells of Thargoid narrative, or a hoax, it is Reditt after all; not my cup of tea, and if so it will just be a waiting game; eventually FD will turn that page so we can all read it.
