Is this the thingy everyone is thinking of…

Spiralling star(s), maybe too obvious… although I wouldn’t put it past FD! Depends if they insert a mega ship called Mary Sidney!

The object is 1,991.83 ly from Sol, we’ll outside the potential Tau Ceti sphere of influence prescribed by FD in the codex; by their own definition it can’t be Raxxla if that assumption about the date is valid, although who is to say whatever is referred to in the Codex isn’t some form of multi-stage map leading elsewhere outside the bubble?

If FD wanted to change something (historically) and it’s apparent they did, that’s the easiest option. But I highly doubt it.

Smells of Thargoid narrative, not my cup of tea, and if so it will just be a waiting game; eventually FD will turn that page so we can read it.

While I agree in general, there is a side issue here about the 'spehere of influence'

Whilst we have a date for the first mentione of Raxxla, we can't be sure that Raxxla was actually discovered by that time. The myth need not have grown out of actual contact with Raxxla - it could grow only out of third hand evidence of Raxxla, say from some artifact, or by some other communication from a 3rd party.

So it may not be safe to assume that 'sphere of influence'.
