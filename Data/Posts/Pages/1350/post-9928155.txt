@Pyroboros @Rochester What system and moving object are you all talking about?
Do you mean the moving object in epsilon Indi that PDJazzHands reported a few days ago & which seems to be orbiting to match Mitterand Hollow? I tried to find that but could not see it, at least not in Horizons.
Where is this goid mention coming from? Precise reports please!

Edit: just spotted Rochester had a pic if something in Oochors UF-J c11-0. Is this the object you meant? Is it on a hyperbolic trajectory? Looks like a thargoid of some form! Is this confirmed, not just another Reddit hoax? This is the first Ive heard of it


2280 First alien artefact found (codex has it on Mars, Allen Stroud’s PhD thesis has it as found orbiting Europa)
2296 earliest recorded mention of Raxxla

Apart from the Unknown Artefact/Thargoid Sensors discovered In 3111 by Prof Penelope Carver’s expedition (see Adamastor) that’s the only possibility. 16 years is enough time for a leak of classified information about it referring to some alien thing called Raxxla to have become space legend. We have no more information about it. “”?

its a real thing right now all iver reddit youtube twitch. dont know if it know wich system this thing is. in Oochors UF-J c11-0 it was visable so tried a body search. Body 17 has excape velocity (hyperbolic orbit) But it is an empty SignalSource like comets are. hard to drop in. sadly it was 02:00 in the night and i did not think proberly so i loged out after i was outside its SOI. wich i would sill in it and see were it would have taken me till i am home.
