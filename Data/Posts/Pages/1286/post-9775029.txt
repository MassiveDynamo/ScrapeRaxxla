Exactly - this is how I envisioned it as well.

At an bubble scale, during that time the traversing between these points of interest within this sphere of influence, logically ought not to include those sectors of unexplored space ‘off the beaten track’, therefore if this logic was applied by FD then we only need search along these paths.

Given the alleged statement about a Cmdr supposedly entering the system then moving on, what behaviour was that Cmdr employing? Logically they would either have applied an economical or fastest route plan? Who knows maybe it was random and arbitrary.

But my point is if true we need only focus upon these relationship lines…unless of course FD simply placed it randomly.
