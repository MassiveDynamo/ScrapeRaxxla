BUT, wasn't the great potato hunt supposed to exhaustively survey each and every star system with 200 ly of Sol?

If they really did that conscientiously, and honked and scanned & mapped every body in those systems, including all asteroid clusters (& all the asteroids within each cluster-the Raxxla logo could indicate a hidden asteroid base!) then either:
1) Raxxla aint there, or (methinks more likely, given the first rumour clue)
2) Raxxla (or the omphalos gateway to it) is disguised as something quite ordinary, and just hasn't been recognised, or
3) Raxxla isn't detectable by normal scanners, so possibly disguised as a comet?? Since these are the only body types we currently know of that aren't detectable

Have you checked the potato hunt and conducted a quality control audit?

Edit: and while comets might not be visually implemented, Iâ€™m assuming they just might impact the spawn point of USS like planets etc do. What if the omphalos spawn is like a USS but possibly unlabelled?
