That is very much debatable... this is me dropping at its expected location (one of the ones I found):




I personally found at least 5 unique asteroid belt clusters regions...
All "empty" because I might have dropped far from it, but still inside its "region of influence".
But as there's no "target-to-drop" signal, we're unable to confirm what's inside or if there's anything at all.

Again... Sol system is a "hand-crafted" system. One which has been receiving updates on its contents...
The system from where it was found an Alien relic on Mars, reports of Raxxla existence arrived...
Therefore, I wouldn't rule anything out at this point.

Edit...
This is my personnal suspicion... that in order to find Raxxla:
1. You'd have to "know in advance" where it is located;
2. Fly there in SC and drop on its region as I did with the Asteroid belt in Sol;
3. Honk, scan and it might appear on your ship's left-side pannel.

As there is no clusters in logs i'm very surprised you dropped in it
The video cannot be debatable, i agree
I'm heading right now to Sol to see what happens exactly in logs, maybe the order of bodies is changed
