Question for consideration relating to how early ships travelled circa 2296?

Up to that point we have a number of settled systems; namely Sol; Tau Ceti; Delta Pavonis; Altair; Beta Hydri; Eotienses and Achenar.

In regards to Achenar it is said the discovery was via ‘unexplored’ space.

Q: How did early warp capable ships travel between these points?

Did they take arbitrary routes (as we might) utilising unexplored systems as waypoints and therefore expanding the sphere of influence to encapsulate all systems within this bubble, eg from Sol (the centre) out as far as Achenar?

Or did they adhere to routine routes, within direct line of sight. If so there is no sphere of influence, but a web of routes with a limited area of influence.

I think however may be wrong as the lore is kind of confusing around it, direct sight was used, however usually between more than one system for refuels so technically both using waypoints and line of sight to the destination for first time that is, afterwards beacons and refuel/repair stations where setup between the original and destination system which are now defunct
