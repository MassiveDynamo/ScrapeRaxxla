Has anyone seriously looked into why the Frontier gazette says Altair should have 20 bodies but has 5 planets in Elite Dangerous. Ackcanphi should have had earth-like but is just 2 stars. This is just sampling of the initial discovery reports being not even remotely close to what is in-game. There are also several systems such as Enaness that are straight up completely missing. These lore important systems. Shouldn't these match reasonably closely. Even factoring in 2296 - 3308 is 1,012 years and it has been 1,211 years since the first generation ship (2097 per Galnet) there should be at least reasonable consistency. I could understand if one of the systems was Jackson's Lighthouse which per the system description the binary stars formed the magnetar in 2672. I mean if key pieces are gone the immediate assumption should not be retconn but that maybe you need to look nearby or see if the system had a name change over all those centuries.
I canâ€™t place it, but essentially FD did go on record saying all the old systems from previous games which are placed in ED are not canon.
