That is a presumption yes, off the assumption that the ‘statement’ was accurate. Off the assumption that MB in a livestream showed he didn’t like how the scanner ‘showed everything’. And the presumption FD have given us these tools to use…

Yes in that respect if the above is true it could resolve within a scanner. But I also asked what is normal means?

It could be rank locked; it could be mission locked; it could be permit locked; and equally it could be silent running (most likely) and need the old mki eyeball scanner.

I totally agree. Any search of any system, would need a total overkill of every exhaustive measure to find it.

Which is why I am looking for methods to resolve what information we have and identify any potential ‘hotspots’ to focus upon.
