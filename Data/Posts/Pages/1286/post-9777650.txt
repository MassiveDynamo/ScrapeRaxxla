At an interstellar scale during that time the traversing between these points of interest within this sphere of influence, logically ought not too include those sectors of unexplored space ‘off the beaten track’, therefore if this logic was applied by FD then we only need search along these paths.
I think the problem with this in terms of logic is several-fold:
There’s nothing to say that the rumour of Raxxla resulted from the discovery of Raxxla itself (there are certainly hints in the codex that it didn’t)
Assuming that the rumour started with the discovery of something outside of Sol, there’s nothing to say it was as a result of a jump that went right.
Similar, but for the following - it being discovered on a manned journey, it being discovered on a publicly acknowledged journey, etc.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying it’s not an avenue worth considering, just that we can’t draw any definitive conclusions about the location of Raxxla based on it. It’s a good first cut of things though.

(Personally, my take on stuff like this is that the best approach to take is to look into it in its own right, with looking for Raxxla disregarded. Better to see what we can work out in general, and then see if that info tells us anything about Raxxla. Even if it doesn’t end up telling us anything about Raxxla, it might tell us about something else. And who knows, given what little we know about Raxxla, that something else might actually turn out to be connected with Raxxla.)
