Perhaps, but on the other hand perhaps we haven’t yet been invited to join TDW because we haven’t been playing the missions as FD expected us to?
By this time, I think missions have been played in every way possible. There is probably no way to get an invitation to the DW station.
There is or at least was very little player history stored on the FD servers. Basically just your current status. There is a bit now with the Codex, but not much. You store the points you get, but not how you got them.
I also doubt The Dark Wheel is interested in regular mission runners. You would probably have to do more than show loyalty and trustworthiness, to impress them.
