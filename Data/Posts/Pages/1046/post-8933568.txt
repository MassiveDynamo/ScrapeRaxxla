Sometimes you get a standard mission (bring us XX of YY) from an unknown mission giver.
Whenever I get those missions from people in disguise I always do those, but lately I don't get them anymore. I only got them when I was following the Wreaken Corp-lead (mostly in the Ega-system).

The T-9 Trades missions get given if you stay in a system for long enough ~15mins? Maybe you are hopping around more..
