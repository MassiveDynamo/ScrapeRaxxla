ED newsletter #24: “Will there be hidden societies such as secret orders to encounter in Elite: Dangerous?
Yes, there’ll be a range of characters representing a number of organisations ranging from the major power blocs, to crime syndicates and organisations with hidden agendas. Part of the appeal of the Elite: Dangerous galaxy is the breadth of human interaction that you can become involved in. The primary vehicle for this interaction will be the missions, and of course it’s something we will build on as we further expand the game, notably when you’re able to get out of the cockpit.”

TDW anyone?
