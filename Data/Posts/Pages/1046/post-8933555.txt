Odd structure in the space-port I'm in at the moment that I noticed on the way in, has anyone else noticed these on a Coriolis Starport before?

It's probably just a graphic artist being fancy, but the pattern is repeated all around the entry/exit. I'll keep an eye out when I re-visit other locations next session, but just struck me as rather Guardian like...
