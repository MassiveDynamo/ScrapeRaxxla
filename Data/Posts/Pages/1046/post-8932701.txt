Is that one of the limited edition Derthek tin foil hats ?
Indeed. I picked it up when I was helping him with his (abandoned) mapping of NGC-6357. I say picked it up, it's actually more of a cheap knock off I put together myself whist out that way. The secret is to actually make it from tin, and not aluminium .
