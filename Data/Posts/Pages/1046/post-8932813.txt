Indeed. I picked it up when I was helping him with his (abandoned) mapping of NGC-6357. I say picked it up, it's actually more of a cheap knock off I put together myself whist out that way. The secret is to actually make it from tin, and not aluminium .
Proper Tin is the way to go - ya I fell for the classic blunder of relying on aluminum foil... I wrapped the whole Asp in it... but it provided inadequate protection and wore off in no time.... I ended up succumbing to the Raxxlan psionic waves....
