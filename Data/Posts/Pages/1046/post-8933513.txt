In the IRH Discord there is some discussion over engineers. Felicity Farseer may well be a DW member (likely also the Ryder girl, whereas Premonition clearly tells us that Elvira and Bill are associates of The Club).

That's also my working theory that Farseer is DW. DW is searching for Raxxla and Farseer wants cartography to level up? Kind of makes sense, right?
On my list of stuff to try: Provide more cartography to Farseer although she's already at level 5.

I also noticed that Elvira's base has an interesting name: "Long Sight Base". I find it funny, because I read "Farseer" as "someone who sees far". So you have "Long Sight Base" against "Farseer Inc".

Also there are a few mission types, like the "Trading Beacon", then there are those tips you get from unknown people (where you have to scan a land base; according to this forum, those tips are actually a dead end). Sometimes you get a standard mission (bring us XX of YY) from an unknown mission giver.
Whenever I get those missions from people in disguise I always do those, but lately I don't get them anymore. I only got them when I was following the Wreaken Corp-lead (mostly in the Ega-system).
