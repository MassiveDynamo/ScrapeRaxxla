Perhaps, but on the other hand perhaps we haven’t yet been invited to join TDW because we haven’t been playing the missions as FD expected us to?

Perhaps a hint as to how they thought we would play it might help with that!

But I digress; obviously we need re-education into FDev's expectations and way of doing things rather than them modifying the game to match how actual players play. ;-)
