That seems like a scrapped idea once you consider the cookie cutter nature of the missions now. Maybe how TDW missions in shindez were back in the day. If this was once the case I feel like it's been retconned

Perhaps, but on the other hand perhaps we haven’t yet been invited to join TDW because we haven’t been playing the missions as FD expected us to?
