So what possible test completion criteria would we have to meet? Clearly visiting Zurara wasn’t sufficient as I’m still waiting for an invitation.

What we 'know' is that TDW only talks to Elites (unless you are Salome ). The 'Elite key' opens one door and that is Shinrarta Dezhra. Next step should logically be in there.
The only obvious unique thing we find there are the Elite / Founder missions. They don't seem to do anything yet, so we may be looking into a dead end, at the moment.

There is of course the possibility of hidden messages in the mission texts, but that hasn't really given us anything concrete so far.

I have a vague feeling that the Sap 8 Core missions were some kind of foreshadowing of the Guardian mysteries. Perhaps the guardian mission is the last box we can check for now? Perhaps the Thargoid machine is one? I'm not really sure, because both of these can be completed without the Founders permit.

Either way, I doubt all the pieces are available yet. The info on the TDW station came with the Codex and has never been confirmed to be accessible or even in the game.
