By this time, I think missions have been played in every way possible. There is probably no way to get an invitation to the DW station.
There is or at least was very little player history stored on the FD servers. Basically just your current status. There is a bit now with the Codex, but not much. You store the points you get, but not how you got them.
I also doubt The Dark Wheel is interested in regular mission runners. You would probably have to do more than show loyalty and trustworthiness, to impress them.

Thanks @Jorki Rasalas I'll check them out. I was being a bit facetious, and I do recall that video with DB discussing Arena and how they thought players would play as apposed to staying within small areas.

@Han_Zen - I concur, so I'm actually working my way through the Codex entries of all the entries within the Inner Orion Spur for all Astronomical Bodeis, Biological and Geological and Xenological to 'tick' them all off, as well as working on my Combat to gain 3x Elite - and unlock all the engineers and Grade 5 something from each (where possible).

I know others have done a lot of this before me, but can't hurt and it's fun to actually just play the game, explore and fight as I want... if an invite comes because of it, great, but if not it's still an awesome game to while away time in.
