Just saw video on utube ..
System: PSR J0024-7204O

Guy was there, but ...when I do search on map, it pops for a second and then gone ....can't target >:. Also NS router plots path there.
Any idea how to get there?

If someone got there then I'd assume they were using an FSD range hack. It's not 'legally' possible to get that far below the galactic plane.
