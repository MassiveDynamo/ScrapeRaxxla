If someone got there then I'd assume they were using an FSD range hack. It's not 'legally' possible to get that far below the galactic plane.
Actually, isnâ€™t this the guy that was sent there by FDev on a wish? They gave him a one way ticket, had to destroy at the end but was allowed to record the trip? (orhave I now had too much Lavian Brandy and all this is running together?)
