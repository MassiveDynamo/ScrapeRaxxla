Can confirm it's present in all the recordings I've checked....(approx 40 recordings of witchspace jumps around the bubble) for those with eyes to see, I suppose.

It looks to me like a three lobed shape around a circle with some inner structure.

What do you think ? It's your discovery, what now?

Yeah, I,m going to play a little more with settings and few more tries. Earlier this morning I had some slightly different setting and could swear the larger lobe area looked like a gas giant with a full ring looking maybe 20 degrees off edge and a maybe a small planetoid (dark). Agree looks like the gas giant doubles as a circle with inner structure. One look this morning made it look like the dark wheel symbol in the codex selection menu (or perhaps more like the generation ships symbol in the codex menu) but I had to go and forget the settings. Ill look more into this. Y'all have noticed the obvious similarities in those two symbols right?
