Other than being created there, I have spent very little time in the bubble. However, recently while looking at Tau Ceti on the Gal Map I notice gray jump lines. Now, I've been 60,000 LY's away from the bubble for probably over a year so they would not be my most recent jump line indicators. Anyone know why they are there? You're all probably laughing at how "out of touch" I am - LOL.
