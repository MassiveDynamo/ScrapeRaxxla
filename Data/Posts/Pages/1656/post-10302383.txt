On another note, regarding looking a audio signals in space. It would be nice to listen in on that "Whisperer in Witch-space". However witch-space is the time-space tunnel we travel through in a hyper-jump. Obviously we can't just go "visit" Witch-Space since, unlike the early travelers using a risky FOSC system, we don't get accidentally trapped in witch-space. However, we can try to record the sounds in a hyper-jump. So, I did that just now. This is just a very first raw shot at it and it's not from a camera but from the cabin. I didn't find much in the signal but I will look further and try to clean it up. I do notice what looks like a small wheel in a triangle, but it's probably nothing but random chance. The area is a bit more distinct in Audacity itself.

I made dozens of recordings for the witchspace audio survey last year so I can easily check those. What Audacity settings are you using there?
