"It is extremely difficult to find consistency among the various fragmentary rumors of Raxxla much like the ancient myths of Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John, interpretations of the story range from the skeptical to the outlandish: Raxxla has been suggested to be anything from an unremarkable moon to a state of cosmic enlightenment. The earliest documented stories tend to agree on several points, however: that Raxxla is a definite place and that it holds a mystical secret."


Ancient Myths / Places like Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John in the Gal Map, random or placed carefully?

Agartha (Agarttha or Agarthi): This concept exists in various esoteric traditions and is believed to be a hidden city or subterranean world beneath the surface of the Earth. It is associated with spiritual enlightenment and advanced civilizations.

Atlantis - Atlantis first appeared in the writings of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, circa 360 BC, in his dialogues "Timaeus" and "Critias." Plato describes it as a powerful naval empire with advanced technology and culture, predating Athens by 9,000 years. After succumbing to greed and hubris, Atlantis angered the gods who, as punishment, plunged the entire island kingdom into the depths of the Atlantic Ocean in a single day and night. While Plato presented Atlantis as factual, many scholars believe it served as a cautionary tale about societal decline and the consequences of overreach.

Avalon - Arthurian Legend: Most famously, Avalon is a mythical island featured in the Arthurian legend. It's depicted as a paradise-like place, often shrouded in mist and associated with magic and healing.

Cibola - Eighty years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, Spanish explorers visited Kansas. Seeking gold in New Mexico, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado was told of Quivira by an Indian called the Turk. Here were “trees hung with golden bells and people whose pots and pans were beaten gold.” With 30 picked horsemen and a Franciscan friar named Juan de Padilla, Coronado marched “north by the needle” from a point in Texas until he reached Kansas. Here he found no gold but a country he described as “the best I have ever seen for producing all the products of Spain.” The Turk confessed he had deceived the Spaniards and one night was strangled. For 25 days in the summer of 1541, Coronado remained among the grass-hut villages of the Quiviran Indians, then returned to New Mexico. Padilla went with him but came back to Quivira as a missionary the following year. Later he was killed by the Indians, the first Christian martyr in the present United States. Near this marker is the site of one of the largest villages of the “Kingdom of Quivira".

Gwaelod - Welsh Atlantis (Gwealod = "bottom") - Cantre'r Gwaelod, also known as the "Sunken Hundred," is a legendary Welsh myth that tells the story of a fertile land that existed off the western coast of Wales but was lost beneath the sea. According to the myth, Cantre'r Gwaelod was a low-lying, coastal plain that was protected from the sea by a series of embankments and gates.The land was said to be rich and prosperous, with numerous townships, farms, and a royal court. It was ruled by a legendary king named Gwyddno Garanhir, who was known for his wisdom and generosity. The myth often portrays Cantre'r Gwaelod as a land of abundance, with fertile fields, lush forests, and abundant wildlife. However, the myth also tells of a tragic event that led to the submergence of Cantre'r Gwaelod. The land was protected by a sluice gate system, which was operated by a trusted overseer named Seithennin. Seithennin was known for his love of wine, and one night, he became intoxicated and neglected his duties. As a result, the sea broke through the embankments, causing the land to flood.

Hyperborea - Hyperborea is a mythical land in Greek mythology, located in the far northern part of the known world. The name “Hyperborea” appears to derive from the Greek ὑπέρ Βορέᾱ, meaning “beyond Boreas” (the God of the North Wind). The Hyperboreans were believed to inhabit a sunny, temperate, and divinely-blessed land, despite their location in an otherwise frigid part of the world. In many versions of the story, they lived north of the Riphean Mountains, which shielded them from the effects of the cold North Wind 1. The oldest myths portray them as the favorites of Apollo, and some ancient Greek writers regarded the Hyperboreans as the mythical founders of Apollo’s shrines at Delos and Delphi. Later writers disagreed on the existence and location of the Hyperboreans, with some regarding them as purely mythological, and others connecting them to real-world peoples and places in northern Eurasia (e.g. Britain, Scandinavia, or Siberia).

Lyonesse - Lyonesse was a legendary kingdom said to have stretched from Land's End in southwest England to the Isles of Scilly in the Atlantic Ocean. Unlike Avalon's paradisal image, Lyonesse was more depicted as a prosperous, fertile land with magnificent cities and castles. Lyonesse embodies themes of loss, beauty, and the fleeting nature of things. Its legendary disappearance adds a layer of mystique and sadness to the Arthurian world.

Instead of wealth, he found Indigenous farmers living in an array of communities and villages in what are today Arizona and New Mexico. These were the Hopi, Zuni, Rio Grande Pueblo, Apache, and Navajo peoples.As Coronado arrived at the Rio Grande, he was disappointed by the lack of wealth among the Pueblo people, but he heard from a Plains Indian informant dubbed “The Turk” of a wealthy nation named Quivira far to the east, whose leader supposedly drank from golden cups hanging from the trees.
