Yeah I know, it’s a conscious choice, it’s comparatively central, so like Sol I’m always mindful it’s there. I try and omit body names in many assessments, just to keep the foil under control.

Note what is situated in the middle: Sol, Tau Ceti, and Sirius. It may just possibly be important especially given Tau Ceti is mentioned rather directly in the codex. Tau Ceti Bridge makes me think there is something hidden in the installations of Tau Ceti.
