WElLLLLLLLLL.... Right. On. Commander.

To the whisperer in witch-space...

Shamash to Nerertem:
Nefertem to LHS 1920:
LHS 1920 to Tiamat:
Tiamat to CD Ceti:
CD Ceti to 85 Pegasi:

.... etc....

Can confirm it's present in all the recordings I've checked....(approx 40 recordings of witchspace jumps around the bubble) for those with eyes to see, I suppose.

It looks to me like a three lobed shape around a circle with some inner structure.

What do you think @D7 ? It's your discovery, what now?
