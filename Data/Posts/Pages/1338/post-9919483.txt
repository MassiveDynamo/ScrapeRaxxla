Yeah I notice it earlier when you mention the system, It's possible their maybe something I remember something interesting on Carmina Burana The Wheel of Fortune motif which says.

Fate – monstrous
and empty,
you whirling wheel,
status is bad,
well-being is vain
always may melt away,
shadowy
and veiled
you plague me too;
now through the game
bare backedI
bear your villainy
.. . . . . . . . .
The wheel of Fortune turns;
I go down, demeaned;
another is carried to the height;
far too high up
sits the king at the summit –
let him beware ruin!
for under the axle we read:
Queen Hecuba.

So at this point anything is possible. I'm trying to open up possibilities at this point to get certain directions going hoping something leads some where.
