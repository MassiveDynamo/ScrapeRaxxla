Yep.
Also note that The Sirens originally were the playmates and nymphs associated with Persephone, who Demeter changed into half-human half-bird creatures...so why did FD call their ninth planet, wandering around the Oort Cloud, “Persephone”?

Funny that you mention that but I'm wondering if MB or DB may have added something in our system. Maybe it's related to what Vettius Valens wrote that I posted above.

here are many wheels, most moving from west to east, but some move from east to west.
Seven wheels, each hold one heavenly object, the first holds the moon...
Then the eighth wheel holds all the stars that we see...
And the ninth wheel, the wheel of fortunes, moves from east to west,
and includes each of the twelve signs of fortune, the twelve signs of the zodiac.
Each wheel is inside the other, like an onion's peel sits inside another peel, and there is no empty space between them.

Edit: Basically something in our solar system is either stationary or orbits the opposite direction.

Edit 2: Drawing it out seems like it has to have an opposite orbit it can't be stationary unless there is a blind side in our rotation that seems like the unknown planet is always coming up east to west.
