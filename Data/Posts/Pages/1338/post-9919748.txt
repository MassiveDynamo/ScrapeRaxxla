Wiki: ‘speculated that Tyche's orbit would lie at approximately 500 times Neptunes distance, some 15,000 AU (2.2×1012 km) from the Sun, a little less than one quarter of a light year.This is well within the Oort Cloud, whose boundary is estimated to be beyond 50,000 AU. It would have an orbital period of roughly 1.8 million years. A failed search of older IRAS data suggests that an object of 5 MJ would need to have a distance greater than 10,000 AU. Such a planet would orbit in a plane different from the ecliptic, and would probably have been in a wide-binary orbit at the time of its formation.’ ‘If Tyche was to be found, it was expected to be found by the end of 2013 and only be 1–2 Jupiter masses’.

In theory the scanner should still be able to pick it up, unless it’s technically another star system (in game mechanics), either way build up enough speed and begin to tool around the system some way out and anything out there (big enough) ought to be visible against the galactic background.

Maybe you need trinkets in your hold to activate it, but I seem to recall FD saying the game doesn’t recognise what’s in your hold…
