Yep.
Also note that (TDW alleged toast) The Sirens originally were the playmates and nymphs associated with Persephone, who Demeter changed into half-human half-bird creatures...so why did FD call their ninth planet, wandering around the Oort Cloud, “Persephone”?
Ive investigated the installation by Persephone, but might bear more research?
Would you be able to navigate to the direction it's proposing? based on the the links you provided? Usually I'm good at direction on flat plane but I sometimes struggle with 3d in space.

I'm going to try and see if I can run into it lol
