Yes - I believe this has always been the principle of our investigation of Sol, the Codex picture seems to point there. Raxxla or something attributed to Raxxla is in my opinion either in Sol on the outermost reaches of the system, or that Sol is the axis and Raxxla is someplace close to it.

Without any true indication of any clear definition it’s likely one or the other. I’ve spent some time floating around Sol way-out beyond Persephone, effectively looking for something like Tyche but haven’t found anything of late, but that doesn’t mean it’s not there.

I’m always reminded of MB saying how somethings can be on the perpendicular, as I do think players generally search for things either on the horizontal and vertical but not necessarily the perpendicular out of habit.

Again the hunt is on, another reason to dive back into Sol.
