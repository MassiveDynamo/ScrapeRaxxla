Wait so it's possible we have something like that in our system?
Yep.
Also note that (TDW alleged toast) The Sirens originally were the playmates and nymphs associated with Persephone, who Demeter changed into half-human half-bird creatures...so why did FD call their ninth planet, wandering around the Oort Cloud, “Persephone”?
Ive investigated the installation by Persephone, but might bear more research?
