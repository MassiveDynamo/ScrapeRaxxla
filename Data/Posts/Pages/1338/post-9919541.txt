Doing a quick search with my ‘Yggdrasil sphere’ and using Fortuna and Tyche as reference points for the exterior of a secondary sphere, the Yggdrasil systems Skuld and Veroandi are within this sphere.

These two relate to the Norse Norns or fates, whom Odin supposedly sought out to obtain the knowledge of the runes, any correlation, who knows, or it could just draw a sphere of influence for something else in this vicinity?
