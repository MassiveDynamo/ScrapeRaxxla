In the Dark Wheel Novella:
“Elyssia sniggered. 'What god or goddess do you believe in?'
'Randomius Factoria . . .' Alex muttered.
'Me too . . .'
They looked at each other.
Alex laughed and said, 'Repeat after me: Lady of Fate, we adore you . . . '
'Get us to Rafe's, we implore you . . .'”

Also the in game description of Trinkets:

“This container appears to hold an assorted collection of low-value trinkets, knick-knacks and statuettes. Such trinkets are generally used by superstitious pilots to try and win favour with the lady Fortuna. However, these particular knick-knacks have a much more valuable prize hidden within.”
