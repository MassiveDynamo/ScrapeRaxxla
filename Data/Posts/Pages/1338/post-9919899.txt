Yes - I believe this has always been the principle of our investigation of Sol, the Codex picture seems to point there. Raxxla or something attributed to Raxxla is in my opinion either in Sol on the outermost reaches of the system, or that Sol is the axis and Raxxla is someplace close to it.

Without any true indication of any clear definition it’s likely one or the other. I’ve spent some time floating around Sol way-out beyond Persephone, effectively looking for something like Tyche but haven’t found anything of late, but that doesn’t mean it’s not there.

I’m always reminded of MB saying how somethings can be on the perpendicular, as I do think players generally search for things either on the horizontal and vertical but not necessarily the perpendicular out of habit.

Again the hunt is on, another reason to dive back into Sol.

Ive always thought that MB’s hint to look off the ecliptic was for High Grade material signal sources (ah, the good old days!).
This is where the value of Pyroboros’ research comes in. I think to be in the game universe created by Stellar Firge an object has to have a bodyid. We’ve searched Sol (& a couple of other systems, I’m currently having a break from my “comet” research in other systems- hands hurting too much!) and found nothing out of the ordinary there. Ive checked Halley’s Comet both without and with Trinkets in my hold. So if something is in Sol, then it’s got to be disguised as an existing object. If that is true then my money is on the installations-they have tunnels, one of which might just turn out to be the Omphalos Rift to transition to Raxxla.
