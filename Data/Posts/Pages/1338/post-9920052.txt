I honestly believe it may be relevant if Lyta Crane never made such an interesting statement about The Dark Wheel station no matter how small description to Rota of Fortunae. I doubt FD would want to move the thing and have to rewrite everything to fit a whole new narrative around the Dark Wheel even considering how much work they put into hiding it. I just believe they took out the missions to narrow down the possibilities of finding it. Even if it means some of it still remains in the game just make it harder to find.

Wheel aspect plays a huge part as well. Again I believe Crane has the right small detail ideas but the meaning of the rest is not exact.
