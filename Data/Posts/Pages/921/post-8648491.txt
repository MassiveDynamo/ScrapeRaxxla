Has anyone brought up or suggest that the Raxxla toast maybe not the direction of Raxxla but rather the artefact Omphalos Rift?
Itâ€™s possible. Tbh tho WHAT the Toast refers to is fun tinfoil. But the Toast has to lead anywhere first before we can reliably discuss that right. The Toast is def a set of directions to something atleast.
