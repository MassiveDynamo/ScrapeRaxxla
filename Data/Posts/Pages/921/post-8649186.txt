Nvm. Just said in general about sound everybody talk. It just does not sound anyhow special for me...
Cool. I thought you were probably just saying it in general. But as it could have been a reply to mine, I thought I’d check just in case. All good!

FWIW, I think it’s good that people are looking into it again. 2 reasons:

A. It’s an interesting thing for people to look into in its own right (assuming that it’s of interest to the people doing so, of course!)

B. There’s the possibility that FD have made more of it than the explanation I’m aware of

I just hope that people looking into it will see A as a completely full and worthwhile thing on its own and they won’t feel disenfranchised if the explanation I’m aware of turns out to be correct and all there is to it.

(In the absence of any actual citation, the explanation I’m aware of could actually be completely wrong, of course!)

Edit - btw, on the topic of people looking into things being good, best of luck with your current investigation as well!
