I started to play 16 months ago about. So that sound "always was so" for me, still can't hear any mystery there. Maybe you do, just because it is "new" for you.
Was that a reply to anyone in particular?

I’m just asking as it was shortly after my post, and it uses the word ‘mystery’ which I also did in my post, but I didn’t notice being used in the preceding posts.

Anyway, if it was in reply to mine then something has been misunderstood, and I’ll explain.

If it wasn’t then all’s good, and presumably no additional explanation or clarification from me is needed!
