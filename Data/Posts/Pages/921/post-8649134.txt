Was that a reply to anyone in particular?

I’m just asking as it was shortly after my post, and it uses the word ‘mystery’ which I also did in my post, but I didn’t notice being used in the preceding posts.

Anyway, if it was in reply to mine then something has been misunderstood, and I’ll explain.

If it wasn’t then all’s good, and presumably no additional explanation or clarification from me is needed!
Nvm. Just said in general about sound everybody talk. It just does not sound anyhow special for me...
