Same comment from me as always on the signals in the skybox.

I’m sure I heard a long long time ago that they are a simulation of RL radio sources.

Again, I don’t have a source for it, and it was so long ago that, despite generally having a good memory for this stuff and being able to track things down, where I heard it eludes me. Pretty sure I heard it via other players though, not direct from FD.

The story has always checked out though, given that there are indeed RL radio sources that aren’t tied to specific objects.

Of course, (and for the avoidance of doubt) if that is all true, it doesn’t mean that FD haven’t also done something more with it.

In fact, it’s generally worth bearing in mind that any current* RL mystery or astronomical phenomena of note should (in principle) have been looked at further within the ED universe a long time ago.

On the other hand of course, FD may also have just put placeholders for things in case of something being found in the near future, and/or as nods to or Easter eggs for RL stuff...


*with ‘current’ in this context generally having an effective and specific meaning of being anything that was current at the game’s release date.
