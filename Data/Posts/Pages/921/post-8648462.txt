Has anyone brought up or suggest that the Raxxla toast maybe not the direction of Raxxla but rather the artefact Omphalos Rift?
Yes, "Omphalos" means "in the middle". So now I research that this thing is somewhere in middle of something. Couple words from toast match to words in dynasty sites logs.
