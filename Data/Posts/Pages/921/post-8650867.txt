7 and 8 are missing. I wonder if this is normal or if it is a sign of something hidden?

Tinfoil.

A COVAS purchase is available that has either Norman Lovett or a soundalike, sounds exactly like a HOLographic computer from another sci fi series, Red dwarf.

In Red Dwarf during one particularly important moment involving complex equations, during the countdown HOL skipped the number 7 and then said something like '7, Ive always had a blind spot with 7s'

Conclusion:

HOL is not just COVAS but actually running the software!

On a side note I am working on a much longer disconnected tinfoil saga involving retcons that may well be my magnum opus of tinfoilery, hows everyone else doing?
