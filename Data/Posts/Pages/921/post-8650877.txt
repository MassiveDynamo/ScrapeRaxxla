Hmm. Not sure. No unscanned rings or asteroid clusters or anything like that?

Assuming not, and no one already has a definitive answer, first thing I’d suggest is for Pareco to be visited and scanned and logs compared to see whether comets are reflected in the logs.

A comparison with Sol would be good too, due to rumours of Haley’s comet having been implemented.

Can’t do either of those myself, so it’s one for anyone who’s in the vicinity and is happy to check.

Edit - Also, nice work!

There is nothing that is unscanned in the system. I was lucky that all the sub stars have rings in their branch. If not, I wouldn't have been able to probe them.
The result comes out like this: "ScanType":"Detailed", "BodyName":"34 P Cygni 5 B Ring", "BodyID":13, "Parents":[ {"Planet":11}, {"Null":9}, {"Star":0} ], "StarSystem":"34 P Cygni"

It's a nice system for mining, if you bring an FC. Lots of expensive material hot spots. I don't even have a mining laser.
