I saw a mention in here of Astrophel and Stella and wanted to chime in:

In the fifth song:
…

I said thou wert most faire, and so indeed thou art ;
I said thou wert most sweet, sweet poison to my heart ;
I said my soule was thine, O that I then had lyed ;
I said thine eyes were starres, thy breast the milk'n way,
Thy fingers Cupid's shafts, thy voyce the angels' lay :
And all I said so well, as no man it denied.
But now that hope is lost, unkindnesse kils deliglit;
Yet thought and speech do live, though metamorphosd
quite,
For rage now rules the raines which guided were by
pleasure,
I thinke now of thy faults, who late thought of thy praise,
That speech falles now to blame, which., did-thy honour
raise,
The same key op'n can, which can locke up a treasure.
…

What, is not this enough ! nay, farre worse cometh here ;
A witch, I say, thou art, though thou so faire appeare ;
For, I protest, my sight never thy face enjoyeth,
But I in me am changed, I am alive and dead,
My feete are turn'd to rootes, my hart becommeth lead :
No witchcraft is so evill as which man's mind destroyeth.

Yet witches may repent ; thou art far worse then they :
Alas that I am forst such evill of thee to say:
I say thou art a devill, though clothd in angel's shining
For thy face tempts my soule to leave the heav'n for thee.
And thy words of refuse do powre even hell on mee :
Who tempt, and tempted plague, are devils in true
defining
You, then, ungrateful! theefe, you murdring tyran, you,
You rebell runaway, to lord and lady untrue,
You witch, you divill, alas, you still of me beloved,
You see what I can say ; mend yet your froward mind,
And such skill in my Muse, you, reconcil'd, shall find,
That all these cruell words your praises shall be proved
