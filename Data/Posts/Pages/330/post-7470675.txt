The shaman's journey through the different parts of the cosmos is symbolized by the hamingja concept of the shape-shifting soul, and gains another symbolic dimension for the Norse soul in the account of Oðin's ravens, Huginn and Muninn

Odin's ability to send his "thought" (Huginn) and "mind" (Muninn) to the trance-state journey of shamans.
