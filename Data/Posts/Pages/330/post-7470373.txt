It makes it pretty clear that you're not finding that station unless you pass the tests. Just sayin.

That’s one of my worries. That even if I spend a bunch of time looking, I could find the system and be unable to lock onto or see the station without a prior invite, making looking via brute force useless. However the other idea is that the codex says it’s impossilble to contact them *for membership* without an invite. To me that may suggest that you can find it, but like the engineers if you try to get too close without an invite the station will agro.
