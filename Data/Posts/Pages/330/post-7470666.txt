What about Odin's crows ? There is some legend which is pretty close to that of the eagles. MB is a great fan of Nords lore.

The legend is different from the greek Omphalos legend. The ravens are named Hugin and Munin. They are said to roam the world, the return to Odin to report back what they have seen.
