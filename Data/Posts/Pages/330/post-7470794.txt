Iirc Hastur is said to rest at Fomalhaut at least in the RPG sourcebook. Hm. "the place that ist no place. The myth." At least in Cthulhu RPG you are fighting the "myth" with your investigator. I have several sourcebooks at home. Perhaps I should look up some things.

Originally (The King in Yellow, by Bierce) Him Who Eats Time "resides" in the city of Carcosa, Aldebaran, Hyades star cluster.

You know Carcosa ?
