Thatchinho: Maybe you are right and I just didn't see it before. I remember only that after probes finished scanning I got "human" signals to top right info box - place where I usually have list of "geological" POIs. So I checked navigation panel and found for example that medical centre or satellite (not small satellite but some quite big orbital station).
Hmmm, well things show up via the FSS for me and I've never had anything show up via the probes that wasn't already there via the FSS. Equally though I don't think I've mapped that many bodies which I haven't already found stuff on via the FSS - it's always possible that you have been finding extra stuff via the probes. Easy way to check - if you've got an example body, then I can go to it, FSS scan and say what I find and then we can see if the probing finds anything different.
