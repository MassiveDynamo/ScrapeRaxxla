Also another suggestion, you guys might do it already but I just started, is that whatever I’m doing, searching, mining, missions or a bit of pew pew on the side, I’ve always got my route planner set to economy and filtered to unvisited stars (applied to route). That way, however low, I have a higher chance of happening upon something since every jump is to a system I’ve never been to (aside from the final target) before instead of traveling the same well worn path all the time.
