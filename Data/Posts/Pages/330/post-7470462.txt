I found a nice list of Arabic star names: http://muslimheritage.com/article/arabic-star-names-treasure-knowledge-shared-world

Lots of these are used in ED. Mostly in the latinized form.

I note that there are two eagles among them. Vega and Altair.
We also know these two from the tale of the weaver girl(stellar princess Vega) and the cowherd(Altair).
