So maybe Raxxla has been in-game since the beta?

Edit3: the patch notes are here if you want to check, though more likely to be phrased as “mysterious things” than “Raxxla”

Thanks for the extensive reply!

If it was in game from Premium Beta, and if we assume that only accessible systems would count as "in game", then I think the list of accessible systems would be something like this:

Eranin
Asellus Primus
Ibootis
LP 98-132
Dahan
Aulin
Styx
LHS 3006

If it was actually added at an earlier stage it would be in one of a subset of those systems (the last three of the systems above being the most-recently-added). I presume the Alpha had only Eranin (not sure as I didn't take part in it), but perhaps that statement negates the whole point of what I'm saying, as it would be unlikely to be located in the very first system the game ever had.

(This is making a bunch of assumptions, e.g. that Raxxla is a thing in a system, and that it can't move etc etc.)

Of course Raxxla could also have been in game, but in an inaccessible system, which having typed all this out now seems more likely! (or my preferred theory: that it is witchspace, with hyperspace being the door/key).
