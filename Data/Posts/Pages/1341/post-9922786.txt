Historians Eratosthenes and Hyginus associated the constellation Virgo with Tyche (Fortuna), ‘eyes to see’?

John Milton describes Astraea (Urania) as Virgo in Paradise Lost. Milton also invokes Urania as a muse, and he himself was a musician who was an exponent of the ‘silent song’… Urania being one of the outermost spheres of the silent song?

John Milton was blind - eyes again?

Virgo was attributed likewise to Princesse (Queen) Elizabeth I as Astraea (Urania)?

Virgo was also seen as the spring goddess Persephone. Kore, Kira or Cora as well as Demeter (drunk / pirates)?

And Virgo contains the ‘Realm of the Galaxies’ which contains several thousand galaxies!

Is Virgo the mother (Demeter) of galaxies?
