Also some of those tunnels do look like something to interact with, but no-one has reported anything meaningful.

As for Retconning of the Raxxla mechanism - its the trillion credit question - did FD completely change the method of unlocking and thus had to remove the old missions as being no longer releveant , etc. If thats true then nealy all the actual facts we have on Raxxla are null and void, and the only thing we have is the codex itself.

Or does it work the same way as it always did since Gamma/Beta/God was boy etc. in which case we can ignore all the new additions..

Who knows !
