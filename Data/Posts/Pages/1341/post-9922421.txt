Yes, looks like they were introduced in 2.2, augmented in 2.3 and extra interactions added in 3.1
So I can stop checking out space installations!
Unless FD did a Raxxla retcon!?
BUT
I really must check again this afternoon in the logfile. IFF installations exist in-game in a system but don’t have bodyid numbers assigned from Stellar forge then I’m missing a load of information on the game mechanics!
Raxxla (or the Omphalos Rift link to it) must be implemented in-game somehow.
The omphalos rift was described in the codex as perhaps a tunnel, and installations are the only thing in-game that have tunnels, afaik.

Edit: mmm, on hindsight for tunnels- black holes, witchspace, anything else?
