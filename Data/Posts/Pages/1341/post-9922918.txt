you can kill if you want to

I have seen them floating for years after kills
but, I got mine by hatchbreaking all the cargo ships right in front of the letterbox of an anarchy station in an anarchy system.
no violence required.
seems most were bringing in stolen mining things and soooo many had these, so I finally grabbed a few.
