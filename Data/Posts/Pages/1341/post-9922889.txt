Yes - I picked them up in Anarchy nav beacons just recently.
If the noises die down after a period of time or.. x jumps.. should be determined as well as if the artifact switches hands does this cause them to 'reboot'?

On another note, I'm going to head to the Zurara this weekend but would love to have a trinket prior to the trip - for science of course. So I'll look at hittimg a anarchy nav beacon. Any specific targets I should aim for or just kill everyone?
