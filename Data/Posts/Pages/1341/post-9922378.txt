Mmm, now I thought they were (but it’s odd they didn't seem to have a bodyid - I’ll check again later).

Hang on, I dont have breakfast, apart from a mug of coffee!
We need someone with a long memory...
Where’s Han_Zen?

There were lots of the little box shaped stations with external landing, at release. They were often run by pirate factions. When flying with a basic discovery scanner, they could be hard to locate, as they were often far from the star.

That was the only type of station, except for the the regular types.
