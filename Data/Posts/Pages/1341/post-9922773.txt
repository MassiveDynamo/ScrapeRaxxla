go to Orrere, you can get them 24/7 there, right in the middle of the old worlds
i have yet to figure out how long the trinket lasts for, but by that i mean how long it makes a sound, it still seems to alter some of the pilots reactions to you and have them attack on site
Are there any recordings of these sounds?
