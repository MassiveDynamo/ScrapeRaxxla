The human connection to the Raxxla myth doesn't really end the search. We may a rough ideas about what all that equipment stating, "WARNING : LIVE ROUTING" is actually doing - that is only a small part of all this. But, there is the small matter of galaxies and a whole lot of installations mentioning galaxy or galactic in the name. I do not believe the 8 galaxies from the first game was a mistake.
