Nah - Raxxlans had much better tech - I came across some secret papers a while back describing a certain talmoric technology... I think it was left on the windshield of my sidewinder...

SPOILER: NECESSITY DRIVE
Joke aside, it could very well be something canister sized which would have been transported by a TDW ship that crashed somewhere.
Maybe it is not THAT complicated to find, it is just HARD because it could be any crashed ship or rescue signal within or close to the Bubble.
When I scan planets, I hope for things that are a little bit out of the ordinary, I don't visit every POI and I guess most commanders do the same.
Maybe a log or a listening post exists somewhere that point to this particular site... We can only hope a clue exists somewhere!
