Does moving several hundred lightseconds change the alignment any? I ask merely because that looks damn close to Halsey's vision.

Previously, it had only been seen in connection with blackholes.
It’s the central yellow target I’m talking of.


It would pop up during a scan, if I came out of but then back in, the target would move to another low signal source, very odd, I’d travel to one and nothing out of the ordinary. Soon disappeared so thinking bug.

The glow is the central star Persephone. No BH in this neck of the words, just thought the target was a bizarre bug as I’ve never seen it before in 7 years of playing, no missions active, new one on me.
