Joke aside, it could very well be something canister sized which would have been transported by a TDW ship that crashed somewhere.
Maybe it is not THAT complicated to find, it is just HARD because it could be any crashed ship or rescue signal within or close to the Bubble.
When I scan planets, I hope for things that are a little bit out of the ordinary, I don't visit every POI and I guess most commanders does the same.
Maybe a log or a listening post exists somewhere that point to this particular site... We can only hope a clue exists somewhere!
Its quite possible that the TDW station logs provide some hint. That would fit with a “Raxxla storyline” and provide the link between TDW and Raxxla. But that station has to be found first.....see my post above about AHTW hypothesis and wonder if FD actually did a quality control check to confirm the assets were placed and activated properly.......

Edit
Perhaps the station provides clues as to how to activate a Trinket of Hidden Fortune?
