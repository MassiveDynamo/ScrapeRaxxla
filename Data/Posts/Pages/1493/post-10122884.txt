Okay, I'll ask here because this feels like it must be connected. Placet is an Old Worlds Coalition region system that is supposedly a Federal Refinery/Extraction system but there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in that system beyond belts with ships weirdly present, no stations, no ports, no settlements, no megaships, and weirdly misnamed planets. This is a single star system and first two are named Placet A and Placet B.




Then there is this from "Docking is Difficult"..


Part of the great Raxxla Cover-up? Most the rumors are 30+ years old.
