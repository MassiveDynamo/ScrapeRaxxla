Then where do you get Raxxla.
Maybe FD realized the discrepancies and that's why they added the codex entry, as a confirmation of it "in game" without absolute necessity to refer to the other Elite iteration. Only a hypothesis of course.
That would be bad news : we would be left with even less leads.
But that would also clear up a lot of false hopes, if confirmed.

But who could confirm anyway, eh?

I agree that on some occasion FD put in the game astounding details, such as the steel resistance level for ships printed on some panels and which happen to be a real-world reference.
So, I don't know...
