activate a Trinket of Hidden Fortune?
My take: the Trinket is a pain to transport (illegal everywhere). The challenge is to fly the galaxy with one of those at all time. It emits sounds (or so I have heard) and will modulate said sounds when closer to the "secret".
Maybe some sound analysis necessary on top of that, I don't know (needless to say!)
