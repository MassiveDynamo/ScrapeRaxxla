So, are we going to finally realize The Pilot's Federation doesn't want you to know the truth? Like I said, Talmor Lens was misbuilt at Earth. The Talmor Lens project was codenamed as Faraway (though we apparently had enough working to access Witchspace before Faraway). We aren't looking for anything alien. RAXXLA was completed by Humanity. We know where it is because it runs our access to Witchspace. It is our ships, stations, installations (orbital and surface), our fleet carriers, and a lot of Guardian technology built into everything. You only need to read the Guardian Technology logs to understand we never had to search at all. It is right under our damn noses. Guardian Technology logs are compiled at https://canonn.science/codex/guardians-data-technology/ . You might as well be describing human technology because we dutifully learned the design and fixed the misbuilt portions.
Nah - Raxxlans had much better tech - I came across some secret papers a while back describing a certain talmoric technology... I think it was left on the windshield of my sidewinder...
