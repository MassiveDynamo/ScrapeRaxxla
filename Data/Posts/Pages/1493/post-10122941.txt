For context, here's a map of the Old Worlds Coalition region from Elite Dangerous RPG. As you can see, it would be easy enough to miss (lower left corner). Also, pretty sure these are only the populated or previously populated systems in that region.



I think the forward by David Braben is telling in how he envisioned us playing: much like an old-school TTRPG (and as a child of the early 1980s I have to agree).



It truthfully, is sad that most CMDRs don't get you control your destiny. Make it worthwhile at the very least.

I'd love to think David Braben reached out to DJ Matt Darey and commissioned this little gem (Lost Tribe - Gamemaster):

Lyrics to Lost Tribe - Gamemaster:
Embracing the goddess energy within yourselves
Will bring all of you to a new understanding and value of life
A vision that inspires you to live and love on planet earth
Like a priceless jewel
Buried in dark layers of soil and stone
Earth radiates her brilliant beauty
Into the caverns of space and time
Perhaps your are aware of those who watch over your home
And experience it as a place to visit and play with reality
You are becoming aware of yourself as a game master

Imagine earth restored to her regal beauty
Stately trees seem to brush the deep blue sky
Clouds billow to form majestic peaks
The songs of birds fill the air
Creating symphony upon symphony
The goddess is calling for and honoring
Of what she allows to be created
From the core-mystery of the blood
Those who own her planet are learning about love
