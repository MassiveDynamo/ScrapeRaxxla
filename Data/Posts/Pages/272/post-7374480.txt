OK

To explain - Ive been there lots, and have scanned the system (FSS)

If I enter the system again and use the FSS (say to find signal sources) Avogardo Station is in the FSS as a blue mark with circle as if its not been scanned before - unresolved


This is most likely nothing but I don't think Ive seen it before in other systems, It may well be a "quirk" of the FSS.


edit - "quirk"= polite name for a bug.


edit 2 - bug does not mean alien
