Look up how the crashed ships were found - It involves the unregistered comms beacon in Sol the orbits our moon (check the Cannon website)



It's a good example of how complicated Frontier can make things (and I believe slightly bugged)


I've found a couple of things that fall under the "slightly weird" category. Tau Ceti has a station (Avogardo Enterprise) that is always undefined with the FSS when I enter the system. Is this relevant or a bug? It's impossible to tell.

You just have to fit that tin foil hat and try not to loose all sanity
