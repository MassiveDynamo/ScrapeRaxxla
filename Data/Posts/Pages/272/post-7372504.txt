If only we can have somebody in FDev themselves, one of the developers, to just answer yes or no to "Can Raxxla be achievable*/found as the game stands now?"

Or

"Has it ever been achievable* in the past in Elite Dangerous?"

"Is any of the previous Elite novels and games considered canon to Elite Dangerous, if not all, then what is?"



*just in case if Raxxla isn't actually a "place", but something else entirely; such as a trigger for more story content or who knows?
