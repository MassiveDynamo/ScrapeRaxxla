People get confused with Fdev quotes. The "it has been in-game and doesn't need Horizons" is in reference to the Formidine rift mystery. It has nothing to do with Raxxla. Fdev has only said in reference to Raxxla that it "is in the game and we know where it is" "it needs to be obvious" and "it is in the Milky Way." That, coupled with the in-game Codex is the only concrete information we know. They have never explicitly stated that it is accessible.
