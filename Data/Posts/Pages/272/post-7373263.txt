How did people keep finding crashed Thargoids years ago without FSS and now we have it, something that sould be near Sol is not found?

There were hints from beacons and an extreme amount of manual searching, to find the crashed Thargoids. Finding an object in open space that does not give any signals and is dark and small takes a lot of luck, if you dont know where to look.

A station sized object in orbit around a star or in a high planetary orbit, is extremely difficult to spot. If it doesn't reflect much light and you have to 'hear' it, it's close to impossible.
