Ive been interdicited many times, but never been attacked once....
What are you doing when you get interdicted? Thargoids usually just scan you and leave you alone unless you prevoke them by having thargoid tech in your cargo, or trying to scan them, or attack them, or have guardian tech I think...
I was on expedition around galaxy with all the Guardian and Thargoid items just in case. Also deploying hardpoints seem to trigger them often. There are actually many ways to provoke the Thargoid.
