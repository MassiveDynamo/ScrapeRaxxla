We “don’t know what it is”, so we can’t assume it’s a planet. In any case it was in before Horizons, so even if it is a planet it shouldn’t be landable.

Han _Zen has reminded us often that the early drives (first game? Cant remember that far back!) were capable of 7 ly per week. So round up to 10ly per week to allow at least some improvement with time. That gives around 500ly per year of travel and a deep space exploration trip such as Jason Ryder was trying to set up (Holdstock’s The Dark Wheel) could be, say 2 to 4 years each leg. That means Raxxla could be inside the bubble, or it could be up to 2000 ly out.
I thought a little differently, apparently not correctly, but is there a file with points of all the anomalies found?
