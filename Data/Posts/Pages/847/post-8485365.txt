I'm sure that Macros will take your comments on board.
I thought it was fairly obvious what are pukka facts definitely known about Raxxla (though some seem to dispute those!); there are only two:
DB:It's in the game
MB: It's in the Milky Way and it's a personal journey
Everything else is speculation, hypotheis and/or sheer conjecture
until someone finds it!
My apologies for trying to derail the thread (someone spilt Lavian brandy on my RAXXLA notes). No need to explain, I think it's my own frustrations on trying to find answers on a blank page. So please take no notice of my previous rant. It's just a little frustration on my part.
