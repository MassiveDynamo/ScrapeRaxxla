We “don’t know what it is”, so we can’t assume it’s a planet. In any case it was in before Horizons, so even if it is a planet it shouldn’t be landable.

Han _Zen has reminded us often that the early drives (first game? Cant remember that far back!) were capable of 7 ly per week. So round up to 10ly per week to allow at least some improvement with time. That gives around 500ly per year of travel and a deep space exploration trip such as Jason Ryder was trying to set up (Holdstock’s The Dark Wheel) could be, say 2 to 4 years each leg. That means Raxxla could be inside the bubble, or it could be up to 2000 ly out.
The 7 ly was just the range of the Cobra we flew in Elite. Other ships may well have had longer range.
It also had it’s nav system locked to the GalCop network. Star systems outside the network, weren’t even visible.
Federal and Imperial pilots at the same time, would have had different maps and different ranges.
