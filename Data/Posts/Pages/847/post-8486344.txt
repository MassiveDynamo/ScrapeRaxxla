Just wanted to drop a quick line;

SpaceX re-Launch is today at 3:22pm EDT.... about 4 hours from now
You should be able to find live coverage on youtube here:

SPOILER: SPACEX LAUNCH

I personally will be at the launch viewing site, on location at Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral.

I will be taking a video as best I can, as long as the weather holds out. Might try to sync it with some ED footage later depending on what I get

Please keep our Austronauts in your minds today as you fly!
One day they might join us in the hunt for Raxxla!
