If that's the case then IMO Most of the OP Needs a revision of some sorts. As I see it, there is a lot of confusion as to "what is" and "what isn't". Lots of potential clues leading peeps off in the total opposite direction of where they want to or need to go and wasting time and effort on fairy tales instead of viable clues and finding out after (in this thread) that they are just wasting their time fumbling about in the dark.

I'm sure that Macros will take your comments on board.
I thought it was fairly obvious what are pukka facts definitely known about Raxxla (though some seem to dispute those!); there are only two:
DB:It's in the game (and we don't know what it is!)
MB: It's in the Milky Way and it's a personal journey
Everything else is speculation, hypothesis and/or sheer conjecture
until someone finds it!
