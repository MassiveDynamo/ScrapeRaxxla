The 7 ly was just the range of the Cobra we flew in Elite. Other ships may well have had longer range.
It also had it’s nav system locked to the GalCop network. Star systems outside the network, weren’t even visible.
Federal and Imperial pilots at the same time, would have had different maps and different ranges.
it turns out either they flew blindly or you need to explore 6 systems
