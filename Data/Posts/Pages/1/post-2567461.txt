The Quest To Find Raxxla - Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth.
Na


This ship log will be used to document the assumptions, facts, theories and efforts surrounding Raxxla, with the ultimate goal of locating Raxxla. All commanders willing to join are most welcome. If no new entries are made by me for a period of 2 weeks, you must assume that I have been eliminated by the Dark Wheel, swallowed by the abyss, or found Raxxla and have gone there. I hope for the latter (but will probably send pretty postcards).

Raxxla
A planet in another galaxy? with an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes. The Dark Wheel found it (and lost it?), and will keep it's location secret at all costs.
Everything we know (@Jorki Rasalas)

Assumptions
Raxxla exists and can be found.
Supporting indications:
The existence of the Dark Wheel faction which is strongly connected to Raxxla.
Missions[2][3][4][6] are currentlywas being handed out and might be related to Raxxla.
Mission [2] mentions a rumour that talks about:"A certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth.". Upon delivery you receive a message mentioning a map and a context for coordinates.
Mission [6] is very vague about the "hunt for, well, you know", but could be a reference to Raxxla. However, this mission could be feeding the ships log (data crystals or spheres?) into the Mission: Obfuscated In The Outer Rim.
Strongest indication for the existence of Raxxla so far is Drew's blog entry[7] the inclusion of Raxxla in the Codex.
Theories
Members of the Dark Wheel are already making inter-galactic jumps using the spheres they have onboard, hence the "intercept Dark Wheel ships" Elite only mission.
Complete missions to see if it gives any results.
Tail all and any Dark Wheel ships using a wake scanner to see if they suddenly inexplicably disappear.
The Dark Wheel has lost[6]? the location of Raxxla and are currently trying to decrypt data crystals? to recover the location. Missions[2][3][5] indicate that the Dark Wheel is having no luck decrypting the data crystals themselves and are employing the services of others to assist in this endeavour, directly and indirectly.
Raxxla is in an another galaxy and the only way to get to it is using the key;the gateway placed in our galaxy. Where would one place an alien gateway in our galaxy?
Possible gateway incarnations:
"Gateway station" - a station acting as a gateway, upon entering you are instantly transported?, how would you select destination - one station - one destination?
Jumping into a permitted system transports you to another universe? - Witch's Reach? - or a station in the permitted system is the gateway
Entering hyperspace in a particular fashion or in a particular system will transport you?
A system with the alien construct with a letterbox orbiting a planet, just like a station?
Please note that the missions listed, are no longer offered. AndyJ gave a great account here in post #576.

Tip off missions - Will they lead us to Raxxla?
The general consensus is no. This is backed by these posts: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1329#post-9901771 and https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1329#post-9901711.
