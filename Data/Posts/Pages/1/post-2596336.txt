Just to add.

I think your Black Budget mission text is incomplete.

If you visit the mission provider without the required items you get additional information :
I don't think any such additional mission text exists for the Elite trader or exploration missions, though I may be wrong.

Thank you bitstorm, this is additional information I haven't seen about the mission regarding what the factions are looking for in the containers. I'll be sure to try the Silent Song mission without the actual spheres if possible. Not sure how to test the Outer Rim mission, as there's no cargo to non-deliver.

I have a few questions, I hope you can answer for me:
- How did you come to think about trying to see what would happen if you tried to deliver without the actual containers?
- Did you try to complete the mission and deliver a stolen container(s)?
- Your two screenshots are almost identical, was that intention?

And yes, the Dark Wheel faction does seem to be a rather complicated faction
