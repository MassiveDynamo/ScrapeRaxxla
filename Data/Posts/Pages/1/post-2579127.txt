I'm not entirely convinced these missions themselves are the keys to unlocking something. What they seem to be, however, are hints that this story is heading in that particular direction, in the guise of missions accessible only to the ELITE players - further suggested by The Dark Wheel's association with the Founders World, a system only accessible by ELITE players or certain KS backers - something else might later present itself in time.

That said, it will be interesting to see where it all goes. The roleplaying Dark Wheel representative on this forum, its involvement with Drew, and the recent Galnet news seemingly announcing the closure of the Senator Loren storyline by tying it into The Dark Wheel, might be part of this.

This is interesting. I don't think I have seen this type of mission before. Are they available only to those who reached ELITE in all disciplines?
