Week 30 year 3301 - The Quest To Find Raxxla

This week has been filled with more excitement than on any other missions prior to the quest. I've lost Ryath twice trying to coax SAP 8 Core Container from Dark Wheel ships, which btw doesn't seem to have to be Dark Wheel ships for the mission to accept the stolen SAP 8 Core Containers. The missions "The Silent Song Of The Spheres" and "Obfuscated In The Outer Rim" have not yielded additional clues, even though I have seen deliveries from and to the same system/station/faction more than once, albeit very few.

I'll continue to take the missions, even the "Discrete Redistribution Agent Desired" mission that at the moment has a very high price. Strangely, I've only seen the mission "Dark Wheel Seeks Diplomats For Discreet Delivery" once. I'll go back to Njordr to potentially find more similar missions or missions that are a result of this apparently trust building mission between the Dark Wheel and other factions.

Currently I'm focusing on the systems Naits, Mariyacoch, and Ticushpakhi to keep the system/station/factions combinations on a manageable level. The missions lures with other systems, but I fear the mission tables will grow exponentially.

Thought - What if the missions themselves are breadcrumbs eventually leading to the gateway? - a 1000 darnations!
(I wonder how many petabytes this ship log will hold, best ask quartermaster...)

And in other news, I finally got an avatar, thanks to a close family member.
