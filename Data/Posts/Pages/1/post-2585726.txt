I'm not entirely convinced these missions themselves are the keys to unlocking something. What they seem to be, however, are hints that this story is heading in that particular direction, in the guise of missions accessible only to the ELITE players - further suggested by The Dark Wheel's association with the Founders World, a system only accessible by ELITE players or certain KS backers - something else might later present itself in time.
Yep. I did one of the Answering the Call of Adventure missions yesterday that was actually given to me by the Dark Wheel minor faction at Founders World. So either that minor faction has nothing to do with the actual Dark Wheel other than the name or else these are just procedurally generated and the factions involved are random with no meaning.

But good luck, OP. Hope you do find something!
