Good luck commander.
Raxxla and Dark wheel does seem to be the first major piece of Elite Lore to be put into the game, hopefully your search will lead to somewhere.

I got a funny suspicion through we will have to wait until Frontier narrative designer to join the team before this is fully implemented into the game.

I hope I'm wrong through.
