I've done a number of the "Obfuscated" missions all over the bubble.
"East" side of Empire space.
"West" side of Federation space.
The last independent systems before heading in the direction of Polaris.
Peregrina heading towards the rim... and a bunch of others.

I don't think there is a geographic limit to where the missions appear, nor is there a common system which they point towards.
I'll be following developments here as I'm actively involved with the Unknown Artefact research over in the OMFGHOWBIG thread.

Agree on the limit, before starting this log, delivered to other systems than the ones listed. Will be interesting to see the connection between the spheres and the UA's, currently the only interaction is the sound?

And you are most welcome to follow the quest, Cmdr
