The Club members discus Patreus in third person on several occasions, with Infrastructure present. They talk about him in a negative an condescending way.

Yes, in hindsight I agree. So my revised hypothesis for the Club is:
Infrastructure, male, the 'leader', technology (Li Yong-Rui)
Finance, female (Ana Quin, Sirius' Junior Vice President of Interstellar Logistics, or Patricia Spellman VP of Sirius Finance)
Exo, male, thin & gaunt, exploration & non-core worlds (?)
Personnel, female, small & fierce (Felicia Winters, Fed Shadow President. Came to power rapidly through Halsey & Smeaton incidents)
Society, male, superficially jovial, steely glint, huge frame (not Patron Gerrun, cant find a description of Delaney).

However it doesn’t change the hypothesis that The Club are part of The real Dark Wheel which is a conglomeration of organisations not centred on SD which is “the outer rim”. The question is: how to find them and get allied? Sirius seems to be indicated but I’ve had a mooch around there this afternoon & not found much, just a mission USS to get some microcontrollers.
