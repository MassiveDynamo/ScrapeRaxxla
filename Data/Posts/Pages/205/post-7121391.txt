are you guys going to tell him or not yet?

traditionally a separate thread has been set up to discuss beta-related items to keep these investigative treads “pure”. The result was that most of us started to read them, even of we didn’t participate in the beta itself.

So my thinking is you might as well discuss things here if relevant. That said, since the beta codex will certainly not be populated by as much/any real information as the eventual release version, and the whole point of beta testing is to find the major software bugs without releasing any real information that detracts from the eventual release; hence it my contain “dummy” (i.e. misleading) information, so nothing found in beta is reliable.
