Does this mean we know where Raxxla is now? I'm still waiting on wine 3.19 to drop to play. Does the new info give it away enough that people will still be able to hunt for it?

There isn't much to spoil. Just a few clarifications of the myth and some vague leads to tinfoil. Nothing concrete of course.
