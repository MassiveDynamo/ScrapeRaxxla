Here's an analysis of jump assist capable systems near Capella given Capella to Achenar is 160.97 LY and thus even a bigger gap than Sol -> Achenar (139.45 LY). Keep in mind discovery happens sometimes between 2097 an 2296 (199 years) unless Raxxla is within Sol as humanity doesn't leave the nest until 2097 (thus Mayflower '97).

White Dwarfs near Capella:
- 11 candidates with closest at 33.70 LY.
