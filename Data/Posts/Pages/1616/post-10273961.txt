I wonder if it is a coincidence that after the procedural generation for planetary surfaces was changed with Odyssey the conical mountains at the centre of craters (very navel-like) were no longer generated. Maybe Raxxla could have been mistaken for one?

(I am not allowed to believe in coincidences).

Also, when Sol was changed to add planet 9 and several recently-discovered dwarf planets, we found ourselves with a Persephone as a planet, as well as a station and a star system.

At the end of the Brookes' Tour, the Tourist Beacon directs us back to Artemis.

(I am not allowed to believe in coincidences).

We have signposts galore - many 'empty' systems have hand-crafted names. Some planets and moons have names. I note that the places named for mountains are all airless, landable bodies - but I do not think any systems are named after mountains. Perhaps the places named after mountains are a hint that we need to look on planetary surfaces?
