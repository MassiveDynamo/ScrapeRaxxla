I don’t believe one can simply interpret the Codex, without first having the eyes to see….namely, understanding the original context…I suspect the author has utilised a number of abstract allegories.

I agree this concept of mapping can assist with interpretation as an application of critical analysis which is very helpful to stress test our understanding and identify unknowns.

I was doing it on the basis of MB of it having to be a bit obvious... So more literal for this one..

I was thinking about the realms and if they fit in in some obvious way, as well as all the Greek mythology and various other theories... But that would be whole new argument mapping exercise for me (one of a few ideas I had last night)

Are there any codex references for the Milton theory that set you on that course of investigation?
