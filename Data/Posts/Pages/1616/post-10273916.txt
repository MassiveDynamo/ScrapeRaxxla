I wonder if maybe the path to Raxxla is somehow different for each of us, like a specific set of places we have to visit that's pre-determined by a seed in our accounts at creation, or... I don't know, something. Maybe once you've solved the combination lock you get a permit that lets you jump to Raxxla, for example - land on Triton, go to Ross 54, Polaris, whatever. That would be within the game's limitations, and also be something a single person could code in that would remain future-proof.

Edit: Sorry, I meant to say also - maybe that mythological "someone's visit the system where Raxxla is" is someone who randomly and unknowingly did that path and just didn't really know what they'd done, that's maybe why Brookes allegedly said it, because he found it amusing.
I like this theory, meaning we can keep playing as we like and expect Raxxla each next star without spending time on this like maniacs.
