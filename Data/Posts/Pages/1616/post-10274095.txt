What's my point? Maybe when we speculated about paths to raxxla, we didn't take into account methods of travel? What if all the way to it was to be accomplished not by conventional FSD but by neutron jumps.
Factoring this in - we have two ultra-important systems:

- Charick Drift: Contains a white dwarf which would have been around in 2296. Yes, jumping by white dwarf is definitely for the moderately space mad or suicidal. It is only 28.60 LY from Sol. There are also LAWD 26, Sirius, and Van Maanan's Star with white dwarfs. Full list of those within 200 LY of Sol. So this is a viable way of getting far quickly (albeit dangerously) - total of 11 systems have white dwarfs within the viable range with all those less than 150 LY:

- Jackson's Lighthouse: This system is a binary that collapsed into a neutron star in 2672. It is also outside of 100 LY bubble from Sol. There are no neutron stars within 100 LY. However, starting at 139 LY there are 5 systems within 200 LY with a neutron star.
