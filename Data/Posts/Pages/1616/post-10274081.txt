Using a spacial mapping process, I took the literal mentioning of Tau Ceti, as a locational point of interest. I then extrapolated the date 2296, to denote a sphere of influence, a zone where the protagonist may have travelled.

I then looked for areas which intersected this sphere, previously I was fixated upon Yggdrasil, and noticed how it actually correlated, then obviously how Pandemonium fell upon this â€˜outer rim'.
Additions worth considering...

Arcturus - settled 2304
Exphiay - unknown but much further and contains a planet named Discovery and sounds like an ideal communist system similar to Enaness (rumored site of an ancient space-faring civilization).
Capella - Contains Duval's Grave and Lawrence's Grave. Very likely humans were here pre-2296.
Achenar - Empire founded in 2296.

These are likely the extremes of the bounds of the search area. Exphiay and Capella mean it is quite large.
