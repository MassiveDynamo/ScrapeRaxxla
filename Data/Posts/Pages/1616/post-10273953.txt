Omphalos can mean: navel, a conical stone (usually with a hollow centre) representing a navel, the hub or centre of something. I suspect the inference is that we travel through the hollow centre which will trigger the game to download the instance for Raxxla. Possibly it implies the Rift is a round hole? Possibly it's conical?
Maybe we should be looking for stations named "hub"...

Edit
Quick search on EDSM reports 2594 stations/outposts named "hub". Maybe someone with more patience than me would like to look through and see if anything looks "obvious for those with eyes to see"?

Mmm, there's also a ble Variable Sector....?? Hubble telescope might cover eyes to see?

Great point, this conical hollow opening is actually very similar to the opening upon the Crystalline Sphere within Paradise Lost, which Satan had to enter.
