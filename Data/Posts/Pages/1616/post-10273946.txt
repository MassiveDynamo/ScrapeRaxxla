I believe Trinkets have been in-game from the outset, but that is a fair point- it makes sense that Guardian artefacts were a later addition and might be excluded from the Raxxla Quest on those grounds. MB set us this puzzle & I think he played fair.

It's possible that the old, deleted, E/F missions were solely intended to highlight the Trinkets in this context; it is also possible that they were intended as obfuscation and Trinkets aren't required...I don't think there's anything in the Codex that implies their requirement & we have no indication of the mechanism that will reveal Raxxla though an "Omphalos Rift" is hinted but with no hint as to how to find or open it. IIRC the "data crystals" that were the subject of those old E/F missions were supposed to contain a map...logically we should need to obtain and decode that map...."for those with eyes to see". I only remember Trinkets as cargo containers with an ID number on the outside that was the same as the SAP8 containers, and I never got any sound from it though others claimed to have.....and I could see no way to open the container. The only possibility I can see is that they should be taken to a Thargoid "map room"-it's the only location/mechanism I can think of that pertains to maps, but I'm sure that has been tried.

Seem to remember someone posting a pic of a container containing 3 orbs...was that a Guardian object?

I do recall posting the black box flight recorder object image recently https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-2#post-2652622
Unless you mean something more guardian glowy-crystal like.
