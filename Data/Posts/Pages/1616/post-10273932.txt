I was thinking about the rift the other week myself - added it to the list of things to think about but had considered the great rift...

and why is it linked with Omphalos... so the middle rift?

or does it take you to the middle or a rift?

not thought much beyond that at the moment... too many theories/ideas! ;-)
Omphalos can mean: navel, a conical stone (usually with a hollow centre) representing a navel, the hub or centre of something. I suspect the inference is that we travel through the hollow centre which will trigger the game to download the instance for Raxxla. Possibly it implies the Rift is a round hole? Possibly it's conical?
Maybe we should be looking for stations named "hub"...

Edit
Quick search on EDSM reports 2594 stations/outposts named "hub". Maybe someone with more patience than me would like to look through and see if anything looks "obvious for those with eyes to see"?

Mmm, there's also a Hubble Variable Sector....?? Hubble telescope might cover eyes to see?
