I was doing it on the basis of MB of it having to be a bit obvious... So more literal for this one..

I was thinking about the realms and if they fit in in some obvious way, as well as all the Greek mythology and various other theories... But that would be whole new argument mapping exercise for me (one of a few ideas I had last night)

Are there any codex references for the Milton theory that set you on that course of investigation?
Michael Brooke’s was a huge Milton fan, so I’ve always been on the look-out for Miltonian references in game.

Using a spacial mapping process, I took the literal mentioning of Tau Ceti, as a locational point of interest. I then extrapolated the date 2296, to denote a sphere of influence, a zone where the protagonist may have travelled.

I then looked for areas which intersected this sphere, previously I was fixated upon Yggdrasil, and noticed how it actually correlated, then obviously how Pandemonium fell upon this ‘outer rim’.

I then began looking for other locations because Milton was very geographically accurate in Paradise Lost.

Again I don’t think the Codex is ‘literal’, but utilises a mixture of metaphor and allegory to describe certain locations, again this was a writing technique Milton applied…
