I wonder if it is a coincidence that after the procedural generation for planetary surfaces was changed with Odyssey the conical mountains at the centre of craters (very navel-like) were no longer generated. Maybe Raxxla could have been mistaken for one?

(I am not allowed to believe in coincidences).

Also, when Sol was changed to add planet 9 and several recently-discovered dwarf planets, we found ourselves with a Persephone as a planet, as well as a station and a star system.

At the end of the Brookes' Tour, the Tourist Beacon directs us back to Artemis.

We have signposts galore - many 'empty' systems have hand-crafted names. Some planets and moons have names. I note that the places named for mountains are all airless, landable bodies - but I do not think any systems are named after mountains. Perhaps the places named after mountains are a hint that we need to look on planetary surfaces?

I do believe Mountains ARE the key.

My studies into this shows that there is a zone surrounding certain systems denoting mountains.

These could be important because mountains were integral to the journey to the Otherworld. And many of the systems I’ve identified all involve some aspect of travel to an otherworld through or under a mountain. Michael Brookes also talked of mountains.

I am in the process of compiling a hypothesis based around this theory following a significant discovery (relative for myself not Raxxla), which I believe ties it together; it won’t identify Raxxla but I suspect it might give us additional context…on where possibly to look…
