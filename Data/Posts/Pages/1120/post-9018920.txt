All hail our alien Overlord, the all-seeing Raxxlan eye!
We shall shortly offer up to thee a live sacrifice of Clavain, an experienced and wise Explorer of the Galaxy and sage of ancient fora
Git your Lavian Brandies 'ere! Dibblers Soggy Mountun Doo! Git yooor Stoooormy Pitrel on a stick!
As long as it gets me First Discovered on Raxxla I'll take that sacrifice. ;-)
