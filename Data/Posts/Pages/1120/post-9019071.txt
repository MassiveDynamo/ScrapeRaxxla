I believe they became the Pilots' Federation, or the latter inherited their licensing powers at least (and possibly the logo).

Imprint is actually an interesting read, because it seems to try to bridge the gap between the Elite "galaxies" and the rest of human space.
It came with Elite pluss for PC in 1991. This was shortly before the release of FE2. Creating a form of continuity was seemingly a goal for the story.

The story it self, isn't very good.
