Is this a good time to mention that the Elite badge was referred to as a "robotic avian" in some of the old (now non-Canon presumably) lore (can't remember where now), and was supposedly the original Galcop logo from their headquarters building? <cough>Guardians</cough>

That would have taken care of those pesky felines.

Hmmm I like it ! Would be neat to track down. Ya ive been playing with the logo again too
