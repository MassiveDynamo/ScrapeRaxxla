Imprint is actually an interesting read, because it seems to try to bridge the gap between the Elite "galaxies" and the rest of human space.
It came with Elite pluss for PC in 1991. This was shortly before the release of FE2. Creating a form of continuity was seemingly a goal for the story.

The story it self, isn't very good.
First thing I thought of was you- Ahhh its that book i always forget and Han Zen usually brings up
