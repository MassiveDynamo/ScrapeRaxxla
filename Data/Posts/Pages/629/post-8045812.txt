cygnet (plural cygnets) The young of a swan. Yeah, the pronunciation of this one is a little more similar to Sydney. But still, cygne and cygnet sound quite different... today.
Back at the XVI century... who knows ? Besides, it also depends on what accent the word is spoken. In the south of France, they would sound more similar.
Daniel Spenser's poem is the original text from where you took that Snowy Swan phrase, isn't it ?
