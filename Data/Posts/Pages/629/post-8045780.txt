Pre-ED Raxxla = Planet, portal and evil men. TDW is searching, but haven't found it.
ED Raxxla = Dull moon, portal (omphalos rift) and sinister cabal or sole tyrant. TDW is searching, but haven't found it.

Not much have changed. Mainly because there isn't much to change. The entire 'old lore' consists of a few sentences in TDW. ED lore consisted of nothing except vague hints, up to the release of the codex.

Ya I re-read it recently and its funny how ideas get fixed in ones mind... I kept equating the Twisted Men with the Dark Wheel (or atleast a part of it) but its clear from the novella that they are different groups. The Dark Wheel is looking for Raxxla, and the Twisted Men are probably the ones who really know about Raxxla and possibly have "black and green flags with bright sunbursts on them and non-terrestrial ideographs on the sides"... black and green sunburst pattern:
SPOILER: RAXXLA

Anyhoo im just focusing on twisted things these days ...
