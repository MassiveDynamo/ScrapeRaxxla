(Spenser's poem ?)
They sound very different. No possible confusion. Something like 'seednay' and 'seeñ.'
Diphtongs are really funny in French. Cygne and signe (sign) have the exact same pronunciation.
Also o, ô, oh, os, -ot, -ots, -ôt, au, aux, -aud, eau, eaux, haut, hauts, -ault... all the same !

The reason I'm asking is that back in the day, the similarity was made a big deal of. Particularly in the discussion of Mary(sister) Sidney's contribution to Shakespeare's authorship: https://marysidney.weebly.com/9.html

Seems the similarity was rather superficial, but good enough for the King.

"King Charles IX made Sidney a baron of the French realm and gave him the arms of ‘the Swan’, because the French equivalent, cygnet (pronounced seen-yay), was the closest the heralds could come to the Englishman’s Frenchified name, de Sideney (pronounced de-see-de-nay)."

Edit: The Spencer poem is also interesting, as it literally puts Sidney(as a swan) in the sky as a sign. I will come back to it.
