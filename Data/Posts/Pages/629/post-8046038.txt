The Cygnus posts, part 2. Neptune.

Neptune is Poseidon. The middle (vertically) brother of the ruling Greek gods. In RL the planet Neptune is tilted perfectly as an opmhalos point.
Neptune's south pole star is Gamma Velorum (Regor) an it's north pole points to a spot midway between Gamma and Delta Cygni.

In ED Neptune has the mysteriously permit locked moon Triton. Possible location for Ophalos rift artefact?

Does Neptune point to the realms of his two brothers?
