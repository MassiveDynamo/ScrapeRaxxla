So I should forgot my stupid Imperial role-play to do something for Feds to access Sol. Damn that game! I don't like that Federation fleet titles! Petty officer!

I'm sorry for this offtop.

Petty Officer derives from the Norman/French Petit Officier meaning “little” or “lesser” & dates back to the Age of Sail. Petty officer rank lies between commissioned officers and enlisted sailors. Apparently as a form of officer they had the right to walk the ship’s quarterdeck.
