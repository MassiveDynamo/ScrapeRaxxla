That circle with a dot in it has been the 'Sun' symbol for millennia.
The Earth symbol is a circle with a plus in it like the zodiac wheel.

[Edit, edit: Read a little more of the Musica Universalis and noticed that the "six" known planets referred to here includes the Earth while the seven planets mentioned just above, as the origin of the seven day week does not include an "Earthday" but does include the two "luminaries" aka "Sunday" and "Mo(o)nday".]
