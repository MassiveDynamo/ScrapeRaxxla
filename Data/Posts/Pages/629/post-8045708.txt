How similar would you say Sidney and Cygne sound, in French?
(Spenser's poem ?)
They sound very different. No possible confusion. Something like 'seednay' and 'seeñ.'
Diphtongs are really funny in French. Cygne and signe (sign) have the exact same pronunciation.
Also o, oh, os, -ot, -ots, -ôt, au, aux, -aud, eau, eaux, haut, hauts, -ault... all the same !
