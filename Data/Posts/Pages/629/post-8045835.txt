Mmmmh... If we assume that all what the E/F missions told us hasn't been retconned, their "clues" were much more specific than the fluffy Codex.
(Celestial body, obfuscation, not a place, door/key, lost route map, SAP8, Trinkets, Songs of the Spheres, etc.. Oh happy past times, when there was Raxxla-ish stuff ingame!)



To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
SAP8 Core (foot long crystalline shard) Obfuscation in the outer rim...

To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!
The silent song of the spheres

The parent's grief, the lover's woe,
The door that is also a key

and the yearning of our vagabond hearts.
Trinkets of Hidden fortune are knicknacks and ...statuettes of lady fortune

To Raxxla!"

ok its a bit of a stretch
