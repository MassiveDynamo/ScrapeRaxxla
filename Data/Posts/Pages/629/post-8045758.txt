ED lore consisted of nothing except vague hints, up to the release of the codex.
Mmmmh... If we assume that all what the E/F missions told us hasn't been retconned, their "clues" were much more specific than the fluffy Codex.
(Celestial body, obfuscation, not a place, door/key, lost route map, SAP8, Trinkets, Songs of the Spheres, etc.. Oh happy past times, when there was Raxxla-ish stuff ingame!)
