After taking a short break from the quest I decided to go over that old video from the 3.1 launch day live stream where DB reads out that question does Raxxla exist as it irked me a little?

Well for a little context one of my RL duties is analysis of interviews. Now I’m not going to say I’m an expert as I work in a team and we aim to be objective so one has to take ones-self out of the process a little, but you pick things up here and there and knowing when someone is lying or has a tell, is one of them, another is being able to follow a conversation and transcribe it correctly.

Where DB answers “and you didn’t / don’t know what it is” in my opinion this is DB responding to Will, concerning Wills apology for not vetting the questions, because it being a live-stream. I don’t think it’s directed at the audience at all.

In regards to his “silly question” well my gut tells me that’s a deflection. It’s obvious it’s a thorny subject, probably not an important one but Will’s apology and the flippancy shows its a contentious issue; or something not very important at all to DB.

Do I think Raxxla is in game, well I wouldn’t be surprised if it wasn’t, but I will keep looking and I will applaud who ever does.... and of course they did state ‘in the past’ that it ‘was’ in game... but I’m beginning to think its not that big nor clever. I certainly think finding the Dark Wheel station will shed more light on this, possibly lead to somewhere even if that’s a dead-end?

But my point is I don’t think it’s constructive to adhere the “and you didn’t / don’t know” statement to Raxxla any longer I honestly don’t think it’s relevant and it’s just muddying the waters.

I've said the very same thing in this very same thread. Couldn't agree more.

o7, all. I'm on holiday in Colonia having fun with Phisto and crew. Do let me know if you find it.
