Sooo.. .. I actually arrived here Tuesday, and spent yesterday in
BYOI AUSCS JR-A C15-0 <- ESDM link
Jump Range isn't usually an issue really for me, my Exlor-Aconda can do 65.2ly standard jump.

Full System Scan Complete,
Detailed Surface Scan of every body,
and First Footfall Confirmed on all Landable bodies.

And so far, it's a relatively unremarkable system.
Absolutely no biological sources, even with 25 body's, which is kind of interesting in itself.
Several geological sites, mostly Fumaroles.
Some very beautiful views of some deep craters and tall rocky spires... but nothing that doesn't exist elsewhere really....

Went back to BYOI AUSCS JR-A C15-0, did not experience any issues in SC out too 2.4million LS this time. Was probably some strange behavior with my network and the server maintenance coming the other night...
Was worth double checking.

I've now left the area, headed towards Beagle Point now, about 288 jumps, with J-boost navigation enabled, away now...

Actually wondering if anyone knows of any fleet carriers in the Beagle Point area that may be heading either to the Sag A* area, or the Bubble in the next week or two? I'd be willing to return to the bubble and forego my Sag A* investigations to get me back faster XD, have some things in the bubble I'd love to do XD and I am more than willing to wait until someone is ready to go themselves, no rush to leave if it's gonna save me hours and hundreds of jumps XD
