Iâ€™ve done a lot of testing on this phenomenon. Jorki has to.
The phenomenon can be found in a lot If systems. NON of them have the size, magnitude or duration of the Deneb ghosts.

The animations are not the same as for solar flares. It is a separate design, that seem deliberate.

Alpha Cygni has two comets. I vissited them, when we could search for comets. Nothing to see at any of them.
Alpha Cygni doesn't list any comets on INARA where other comets do show?

So, if it has 2 comets... are these objects actually comets???

Have you looked since Odyssey? If not can you have a look see what you think. They look considerably more defined than the images you posted back in 2018 (post-Odyssey update)

Yep Han_Zen and I investigated them a while ago. Seems to be an Artefact of solar flare animation shifted away from the parent star.
Initially the systems they were observable in seemed to be concentrating down to a black holebeyond the StarofIndia, but then we found they were also evident much more widely. Justan Artefact of the graphics.
Sorry, but they're absolutely not this. Maybe they seemed to be that when you looked a while ago, but you can literally see them rotating as 3D objects that look exactly like asteroids...

Anyone suggest a quick and easy way to record video (never done it before), Never mind, found it I'm going to show you them rotating if you don't wanna look yourself
