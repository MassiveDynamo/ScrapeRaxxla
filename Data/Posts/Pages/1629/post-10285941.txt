The comets are like all the other comets. Nothing there. I might have them bookmarked. I’ll check on monday, when I’m back at the PC.

You are right that they aren’t offset solar flares. The graphical objects are different and they are in a ‘deeper layer’ of the system map. The don’t follow the stars / planets when you move the map, but the aren’t stationary like the backgrund stars either.
I noticed on stars I was looking at there are other anomalies with bright parts (semicircular) offset from solar flares... Some by a bit and some way off... I do think it's FD flair for not returning to fix stuff... but fun investigation while I was waiting to be dad taxi
