Alpha Cygni doesn't list any comets on INARA where other comets do show?

So, if it has 2 comets... are these objects actually comets???

Have you looked since Odyssey? If not can you have a look see what you think. They look considerably more defined than the images you posted back in 2018 (post-Odyssey update)


Sorry, but they're absolutely not this. Maybe they seemed to be that when you looked a while ago, but you can literally see them rotating as 3D objects that look exactly like asteroids...

, Never mind, found it I'm going to show you them rotating if you don't wanna look yourself

The comets are like all the other comets. Nothing there. I might have them bookmarked. I’ll check on monday, when I’m back at the PC.

You are right that they aren’t offset solar flares. The graphical objects are different and they are in a ‘deeper layer’ of the system map. The don’t follow the stars / planets when you move the map, but the aren’t stationary like the backgrund stars either.
