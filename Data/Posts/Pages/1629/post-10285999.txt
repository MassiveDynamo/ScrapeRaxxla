Ok so I figured out what the Thetis signal patterns are.
A sideband is used in AM radio broadcast with a carrier signal / pilot tone.
On that wiki page shows an example spectrogram of an AM broadcast with very similar voice patterns.

I found when you offset and mirror this overlaid on itself you start to see the kind of pattern in the signal.


Now lets try it with the original voice track itself

Without much effort I was able to replicate the shapes very easily!
So therefore we are dealing with a carrier signal that is offset by a certain amount and it is being transmitted from somewhere near the Thetis' path of travel 9 generations after launch and 15 LY prior to the first entry .
Due to the nature of some AM signals, sometimes the pilot tone is in the infrasonic range (ie. inaudible), in this case there is a constant tone at 50 hertz.
From what I found in that overlay test - the signal is mirroring the 0Hz-2000Hz range and appears to repeat in an interval of approximately 1300Hz through the entire frequency range - you can see 'shadows' of the repeating pattern between gaps in the log audio noise.

The final audio log of the screeching noise appears to be the virus signal itself - with signal period of 20 seconds matching the sine wave period, and amplitude of 2000Hz covers the main audio of the screech and 'morse code' sound.
