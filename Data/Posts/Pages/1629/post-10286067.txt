To the outer rim

An update upon my Milton/Holdstock cosmological model hypothesis.

To the jewel that burns on the brow of mother of galaxies = Eden/Paradise is the jewel, a Miltonian reference for the shining ‘pendant world’ of Paradise Lost aka Raxxla.

This jewel is upon or above the outer rim or ‘brow’ aka the horizon of a spherical zone of systems denoting the realm of Chaos.

The mother of galaxies I suspect to be the Gilgamesh system of Tiamat, the personification of chaos and the primordial waters of creation, whose body created the stars. I believe she is also the Miltonian representation of the deity Chaos, who in Paradise Lost told Satan the location of Paradise, far above her.

To the whisperer in witchspace I believe to be the Gilgamesh system of Shamash, not only because of the evidently weird story about signals, but her link to the story of Gilgamesh and his quest to obtain the ‘thorn’ of immortality, this links him as being the inspiration for Art Tornqvist (thorny branch), I identify this due to the system Gilgamesh relative placement within that of ‘Fall’ to that of the underworld and or Demeter and Persephone, aka Cora.

The siren of the deepest void I believe to be the system Siren based upon it’s relative location to an alignment of the Greek Fates and the Norse Norns in line with system Purisaz, which I suspect is a ‘Shibboleth’ for Thurisaz, the rune of thorn, a Holdstock reference to his story of Ragthorn and the story of Gilgamesh.

A line of sight can be extrapolated from these triangulated centres that points directly to the centre of systems attributed to M Brookes published Drabbles of the gods and that of a location close to Siren and an alignment of Shibboleth between the upper and lower triad goddesses, this alignment can also be established by the Drabble system Amun and Ishtar which links back to the story of Gilgamesh.

From this speculation I now asses my previous hypothesis to have a greater degree of probability, and that Raxxla to be very likely within these spheres of influence!
