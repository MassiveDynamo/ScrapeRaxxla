Well. Time for me to eat humble pie... again


What I was seeing as rotation in sequential still images was in-fact the animation of the flare playing through a loop, you guys were right. The flare objects are themselves '3D' objects, but not in the way I thought. They are indeed misplaced solar flares/solar activity.

I think I need to take a rest, there's too many windmills out here...

Apologies again!
