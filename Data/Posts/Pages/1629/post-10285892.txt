Didn’t someone assess these might be broken solar flare animations, can’t recall?
Yep Han_Zen and I investigated them a while ago. Seems to be an Artefact of solar flare animation shifted away from the parent star.
Initially the systems they were observable in seemed to be concentrating down to a black holebeyond the StarofIndia, but then we found they were also evident much more widely. Justan Artefact of the graphics. Can't remember if FD made any comment about them.



If we're allowing the Milton quote to be so "poetical" that it could be referring to a very bright, very dim OR very small (physically) star, then maybe the "golden chain" is also "poetical" in a similar fashion!!!
