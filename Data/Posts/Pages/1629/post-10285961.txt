How does one analyse audio? I'm looking at the Thetis logs and they all have a "beep" at the start of each message, but it's different each time. Then there's the audio from log 5 which is interesting, especially compared to Shamash log 8.
Analyse in what way?

FD have hidden messages in spectrograms previously... Audacity can do that for you (it's free)
