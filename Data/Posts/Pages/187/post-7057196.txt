Thanks, thought Macros was triple, but couldn’t spot in his signature. I’m double & don’t think I’ve ever been offered one of the missions.
Yes, Raxxla has been in-game from the outset, but so has SD hasn’t it? So i assume the missions may have been in from the outset too. It has always seemed a bit strange that MB said there will be no clues if the DW missions were clues, so maybe they were only window dressing; perhaps representing the DW’s attempts to relocate Raxxla, but not really relevant to our search. That could explain why they’ve been withdrawn, FD probably don’t want to repeat the salt thrown around after the Salomé event.

I think the original idea was very simple:
- Become Elite
- Go to SD(this is the only gating we have seen)
- Get the mission and learn(if you have read TDW) that Raxxla is not forgotten.
- Read the fine print and find out that someone is still looking for it and that it's(to their knowledge) an obfuscated, celestial body.

We have confirmation that TDW(the secret organisation) has never found Raxxla. They are more or less in the same situation as us.
I think FD want Raxxla to be actually found by a player. No one will lead us, because no one can.
