It was a very awesome TED Talk. I think, however, that KIC 8462852 has been explained as a natural phenomenon and not evidence of galactic neighbors.

It's worth reminding yourself, from time to time, that you are in the the Lore and Roleplay section of a forum for a video game about (not exclusively) alien encounters.
