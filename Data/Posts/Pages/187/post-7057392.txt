where is the outer rim? the edge of the galaxy or a region in the galaxy, the edge of the bubble?

obfuscated in the outer rim, seems to be the only sure clue.

obfuscated means hidden (cant see or a puzzle or a word game) but the place to look is the outer rim.

Obfuscated implies something deliberately hidden. Dyson Sphere? Or merely deliberately omitted from Universal Cartographic's records?
