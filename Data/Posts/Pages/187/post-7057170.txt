Thanks, thought Macros was triple, but couldn’t spot in his signature. I’m double & don’t think I’ve ever been offered one of the missions.
Yes, Raxxla has been in-game from the outset, but so has SD hasn’t it? So i assume the missions may have been in from the outset too. It has always seemed a bit strange that MB said there will be no clues if the DW missions were clues, so maybe they were only window dressing; perhaps representing the DW’s attempts to relocate Raxxla, but not really relevant to our search. That could explain why they’ve been withdrawn, FD probably don’t want to repeat the salt thrown around after the Salomé event.

I really, honestly, believe that when Michael said there would be "no clues" what he meant was that there would be no clues provided outside of the game. That asking him for any tidbits would be a waste of time. I don't think he meant to suggest that there aren't any clues inside the game itself. I mean, there has to be at least one clue in the game for it to be "a little bit obvious", right?
