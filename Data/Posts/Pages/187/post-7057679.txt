True but since we are looking for something in this game that was supposedly introduced during the pre-launch "Gamma" phase which was back in 2014. Nobody was talking about KIC 8462852 (AKA Tabby's Star) until 2015. I'm as prone to flights of fancy as anyone, and was quite disappointed that Tabby's Star isn't in the game, but I think it is unlikely that there is a relationship between this phenomenon and Raxxla if for no other reason than my doubts that Frontier could simulate anything similar inside the game as it now stands.

Tabby's Star has been an iconic candidate to be Raxxla for years. Much has been commented about it in this Frontier Forum.

Gosh you guys are invested! It's fantastic

I wasn't actually proposing Tabby's Star (I didn't know it was called that. Never heard of it before) as a Raxxla candidate at all. The connection I was making was much shallower than that. Jaiotu mentioned Dyson spheres and I just remembered that Youtube video that I watched literally days ago.

I'm still processing that coincidence!
