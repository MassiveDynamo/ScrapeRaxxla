Invested? I've been looking from Raxxla since 1985!

Ah, well if we’re looking back that far I got Elite in 1985, so now I’m triple!

Counting that ‘85 achievement is the only way I’ll make it nowadays; the arthritis starting in my wrists & thumbs is game-related injury going way back.
can I sue the Pilot’s Federation for compensation?
