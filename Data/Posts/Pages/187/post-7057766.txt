I really, honestly, believe that when Michael said there would be "no clues" what he meant was that there would be no clues provided outside of the game. That asking him for any tidbits would be a waste of time. I don't think he meant to suggest that there aren't any clues inside the game itself. I mean, there has to be at least one clue in the game for it to be "a little bit obvious", right?

I think the original idea was very simple:
- Become Elite
- Go to SD(this is the only gating we have seen)
- Get the mission and learn(if you have read TDW) that Raxxla is not forgotten.
- Read the fine print and find out that someone is still looking for it and that it's(to their knowledge) an obfuscated, celestial body.

We have confirmation that TDW(the secret organisation) has never found Raxxla. They are more or less in the same situation as us.
I think FD want Raxxla to be actually found by a player. No one will lead us, because no one can.

I suspect you are both correct.
The difficulty is in discovering the bit thatâ€™s a little obvious!
