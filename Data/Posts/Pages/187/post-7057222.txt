It’s Neumann Camp. I’ve not checked myself (haven’t got access) but IIRC Genar-Hofoen had said that it always pointed towards Col 70.

Checked this morning and Col 70 was on the other side of the moon. The antenna seemed to be pointing in exactly the opposite direction. I suppose it has to do something if it's looking at the wrong half of the sky.

Merely single Elite here, closing in on double (trade), but a long way off triple so I hope it doesn't matter!

Edit:

I wish I'd thought to look for stations controlled by TDW (like Neumann) when I was getting allied! Carto data would have been a lot quicker than data missions and donations from Jamesons.

Nothing special on the mission board at Neumann Camp, btw. Is that how the TDW "Raxxla" missions were offered or were they direct like the Obsidian meta-alloy ones?
