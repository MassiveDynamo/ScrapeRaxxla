It's worth reminding yourself, from time to time, that you are in the the Lore and Roleplay section of a forum for a video game about (not exclusively) alien encounters.

True but since we are looking for something in this game that was supposedly introduced during the pre-launch "Gamma" phase which was back in 2014. Nobody was talking about KIC 8462852 (AKA Tabby's Star) until 2015. I'm as prone to flights of fancy as anyone, and was quite disappointed that Tabby's Star isn't in the game, but I think it is unlikely that there is a relationship between this phenomenon and Raxxla if for no other reason than my doubts that Frontier could simulate anything similar inside the game as it now stands.
