As Mengy said on a) no one's ever been able to provide a verifiable source for it. It's basically a 'bloke down the pub reckons' story. By contrast, other things are verifiable.

For b), was that from something in particular? Would be good to have a source.

I’m hypothesising that Raxxla is hidden in a USS, & I gather with the new scanner mechanism USS should be locateable when you jump into a system, rather than having to fly to its vicinity. Hence may well be “easier to find”, once you’re in the right system!
