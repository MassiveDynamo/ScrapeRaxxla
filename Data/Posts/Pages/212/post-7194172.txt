Yep, and those posts were a big influence on my looking at the horizons one in connection with the TDW info from the Codex. I should have credited you in the post. Sorry about that old chap! Post now updated accordingly.

No problem mate, wasnâ€™t complaining! Just relates to my current hypothesis!

There's a section on TDW in the Codex. It's one of the rumours talked about in there. (Wouldn't be touching it with a barge pole if it was from file dipping )

Ah, was wondering whether it was the codex, or a reddit rumour...
