I thought the Real Dark Wheel knew where Raxxla was, but lost it. How they lost it is beyond me, but that was my impression.

According to the original Dark Wheel novella Jason Ryder either found Raxxla or certain evidence proving it's existence. He was killed before he could pass on his knowledge. I don't think there is evidence that the Dark Wheel ever found it and, based on Harper's "And Here the Wheel" I believe the evidence suggests they didn't (hence giving rise to the schism between Neptune and Oberon.
