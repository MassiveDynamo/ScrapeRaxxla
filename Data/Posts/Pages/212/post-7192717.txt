The codex says it's kind of "low emissive" station. Possibly unscannable. And not Orbis. Of a new type.

That's The Dark Wheel station. Not Raxxla.

I doubt they are in the same system.

It's fully possible that it's practically impossible to find Raxxla without hints or help from TDW, but I don't think even they have actually located it.

Been considering it since that rumour came out of the beta, and... ever noticed that there’s not much in the way of lights on the Orbis on the Horizons menu?

I’ve posted before on my suspicions about the Horizons & non-Horizons menu screens. Wouldn’t be at all suprised to find one is named Raxxla, & the other might be TDW-related; a stealth station would make sense for either (“obfuscated on the outer rim”!). I don’t beta so I don’t know about the current codex contents, but am looking forward to catching up on release. Since TRDW is a conglomerate of like-minded organisations there may be other things currently hidden that the new FSS may reveal, but suspect most of them (including Raxxla) will have been removed from the beta. Where did this tale about TRDW and a gas giant with 8 moons come from, and how reliable is it (not file dipping I hope)?

I’ve been following up a different Raxxla hypothesis over the last two weeks, will give it another day or two before reporting......

edit: in the John Harper comments that Han_Zen linked above, he also mentioned “A hidden Circle space station .. It is probably a former imperial system since the rotation generates imperial standard gravity.” Has anyone tried the FSS in Reorte (see previous post)? Or Lave?- the empire had some interest in Lave & Dr Walden from what I remember of another novel.
