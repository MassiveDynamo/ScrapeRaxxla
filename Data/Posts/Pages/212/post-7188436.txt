I think it is worth to start looking for Raxxla again for two reasons a) FD have said that one commander has been to the system Raxxla is, but has skipped it. b) they have hinted that they hope new tools will give players chance to find it more easily.
As Mengy said on a) no one's ever been able to provide a verifiable source for it. It's basically a 'bloke down the pub reckons' story. By contrast, other things are verifiable.

For b), was that from something in particular? Would be good to have a source.
