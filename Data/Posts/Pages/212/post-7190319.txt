I found a bug in beta, a persistent signal source with no matching frequency. Flew out to a distance that would make a Hutton Trucker blush, and still it loomed in the distance. It persisted through closing to main menu, complete shutdown, and logging back in 12 hours later.

I've seen this. It's a 180Â° reflection of another signal source. If you resolve all the signal sources behind you, it will disappear.
