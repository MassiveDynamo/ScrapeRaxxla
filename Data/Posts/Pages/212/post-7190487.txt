The codex says it's kind of "low emissive" station. Possibly unscannable. And not Orbis. Of a new type.

That's The Dark Wheel station. Not Raxxla.

I doubt they are in the same system.

It's fully possible that it's practically impossible to find Raxxla without hints or help from TDW, but I don't think even they have actually located it.
