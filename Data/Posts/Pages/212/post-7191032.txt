Right, Herr Professor-Doktor, as usually. [yesnod]
It's me. I am so convinced The Real Dark Wheel (not the one in SD) is the thread which is supposed to be pulled on.
The starting point to the personal journey... That's why, imho, both TRDW and Raxxla are present and related one another in the Codex.
Anyway I doubt Raxxla would be more "scannable" than TRDW base.
