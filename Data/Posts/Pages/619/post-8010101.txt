OK serious question, where / what is the Milky Way exactly?

Well, studying science we learn that: "The heavenly bodies are wheels of fire enclosed in mist which have certain opening through which they are visible." The sun is like a fiery chariot-wheel, stars are actually a star-wheel, with breathing-holes on the wheel. This wheel is closer to Earth than the Sun-wheel, about ten Earth diameters. The wheels themselves cannot be seen, of course, because of the mist. So, we can learn that Via Lactea is actually a concertration of star-holes of primordial background-fire, shaped as a path across the skydome because of this wheel shape, as Earth is in the center.

If you must know more, an initiation into the cult of Hera is required. They will ask you to deliver hundreds of tonnes of milk between several agricultural starsystems, as is their custom, before revealing their secrets.
