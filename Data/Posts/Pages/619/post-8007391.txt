Which one is worse?

Addiction to strong alcohol, and an interest in obscure mythology.
Randomly looking for something you don't what is, in 400 million places.
Neither look like a thing a rational person would do.

I would also like to add a third option.

- Doing obscure complex tasks in order to invoke a game mechanic (probably non existent) that gives you an invitation to a secret society that is supposedly also looking for Raxxla, with about the same success rate as us.

It’s not the strong alcohol that worries me (looking forward to my post-gardening brandy! this afternoon is top-dressing & levelling the lawn). It’s the weird mythology!
