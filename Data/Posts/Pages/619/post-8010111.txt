its worth remembering that 'Galaxy' is a modern term. Before about 1900 no-one really realised that there were other galaxies.

Mythology tried to explain the milky smear in the sky and 'the milky way' is a reference to the greek myths of Hermes and Hera see:

Milky Way - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org

also a nice potted history of the identification of galaxies.

Sol is towards the edge, just as it is in ED and this is why the smudge in the sky is localised - it is looking towards the centre and the arms on their side - the centre is in the constellation of Sagittarius, hence Sag A*..
