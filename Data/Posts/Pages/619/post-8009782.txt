Raxxla is a doughnut? Surely The DW is the doughnut, Raxxla is the hole in the middle, there but not there, that you can see but can't see, the gateway that is also the key...assuming you use your finger in the hole/gateway as the key to eating it....and the sugar is the stars, quick, someone map a doughnuts constellations!

I seem to be trying some new ways to get into the DW. Has anybody else tried setting new records for numbers of rebuys, eg 1 Billion rebuys with Small & Medium ships only? Most numbers of rebuys? Max Exploration data lost in one stupid incident? Max distance lost by returning to station when dead? Most stupid death?

They said it was a test of skill, they never said they were looking for good skill, maybe theyre looking for a hopeless pilot who is a blank slate they can train, how obfuscating is that hey?....I hope so
