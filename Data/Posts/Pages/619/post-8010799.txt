As we ponder Raxxla we surely can't dismiss all theories out of hand?

Yes we can.
Theory based on unsupported belief and ancient mythologies versus Theory based on scientific reasoning with supporting evidence??
The latter may not be the whole truth, but itâ€™s a whole lot more solid than the former!

True Believers will choose the former, rational folk will choose the latter.
