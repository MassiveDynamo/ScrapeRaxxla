OK serious question, where / what is the Milky Way exactly?

Since a small child I thought the Milky Way was 'our' whole Galaxy and the band we could see was the 'middle' but Im reading everywhere that it is actually (or originally) meant only the band we can see in the night sky and we are 'outside' of it?

Which is usually understood as correct? The whole Galaxy or the band of stars we can see from Earth?

May matter and narrow it down if the MB quote 'Its in the Milky Way' means its 'over in that direction' rather than 'behind us in that direction'. My knock a couple hundred thousand systems off the search which seems like a lot but actually isn't is all.
