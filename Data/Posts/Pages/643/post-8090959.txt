On a bit less scientific note, I had this day-dream about Ms. Fields again. She was walking inside a never-ending, artificial cityscape of a Coriolis spacestation for some reason, around the upper low-sec sector. Hiding her bright red hair among common spacejunkies and freebooters, to us she would seem just like another cyber-addict or a techpunk. Purple-haired heroes gathering in anarchy bars for another cycle of drinking Leestian evil juice all day and blowing up unwary traders all night. She wouldn't mind doing the same for a while, keeping it low and spending some credits from the last contract. In her business credits soon lost meaning, as one error could end it all quickly. Accumulated cybernetic memory from dozens of generations did help a little, creeping suspicion of a subconscious hivemind guiding her actions would ease in the bar. She had lost her ship, Viper III class fighter in assassination of some Federal military conglomerate executive, this happened sometimes, it could even be useful. This time the situation was less desirable, as if the holofac from last night was correct, The Blackmount are already taking over secure comms in the sector, and she needed some naive spacer to smuggle her out fast...

I think these sort of things happen to her fairly often.
