It pretty much seems to be a "hoax", but it doesn't change the fact with which fascination Raxxla is hunted by the ed community.
I even believe that it is not currently reachable ingame, at least for so long until fdev decided to be discovered.
Anyway I will go onto a trip to exactly the sector he stated, seems to be a interesting place for any explorer out there

/FOIL ON

ELYSIAN SHORE has many of "PSR" named stars (which are pulsars), others sectors too though + 1 of 2 existing in game "AXP" which are magnetars. And if u fss any NS - u can hear whisper ... Or ...AXP is on border with rift ..cant say exactly.
