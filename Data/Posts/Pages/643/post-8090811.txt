[thin foil thinking] What if Raxxla is only reachable when you select the system manually, never when you plot a route from let say from Sol to Delphi ? [/thin foil thinking]

You can never travel pass the Raxxla system with plotting a more then one jumping route .

My Thin foil hat thinking that the Raxxla system is excluded from plotting..

A common hypothesis from the early days of this Quest is that Raxxla (or its system) isn‘t visible in the galmap (easy for Pilots’ Federation (i.e. FD) to delete it) and it must be manually selected from the list of nearby systems in the navigation panel to be able to jump to it. The trouble is that it is very tedious in each system to go through that list selecting each system, then checking it against the galmap. I think I withstood it for half an hour. It also allows for happenstance location & I think DB would have wanted a more focussed treasure hunt mechanism to find it. I think that’s the message of the codex entry. First gain the trust of The Real Dark Wheel, then you might get nearer to Raxxla. I suspect there’s a series of hoops for us to jump through, but the first part has few clues & we won’t know we’re taking the test until we’re told we’ve passed it.
The problem then is what happens if we fail it? Do we ever get notification that we were close??
