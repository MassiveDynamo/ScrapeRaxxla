Source please.

To the best of my knowledge, there has never ever been anything which stated that Raxxla was accessible.

True, but DB did say it’s been in-game since the gamma, which sort of implies it’s accessible. I just can’t see him putting it into the game without it being accessible. It might be hidden behind a permit lock but if so I think there’s also been a mechanism available since the gamma to get that permit.

However I also have a vague feeling that one of DB’s utterances was that he was surprised it hadn’t already been found. I have googled this but can’t find the source for it, and may have imagined it, though lots of the old forum stuff seems now to be inaccessible. Might have been in a livestream? If he did say that then it would confirm it’s accessible!
