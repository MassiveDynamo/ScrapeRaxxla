...also, except checking his pictures, i tried to imagine why he could propose such a route, even if it is fake.
So got some thoughts i posted somewhen before too, main idea...if u look on raxxla/dw emblems it can be treated as galaxy shape. So what if we was wrong with the scale? So once u zoom out map ... u can see why that guy did such a route. For example "mother" - there is region "Izanami" which is godess of everything, and Sag A* is "jewel" and so on.
So all together this guess is no worse then any other we already spent time on

Also we know that game can measure distances, for example to unlock Palin. So those 3 parts of codex are triangle. And if u follow exactly u will do longer route then direct. That could be extra filter to remove accident findings. I really doubt u must visit exact systems. Never seen such mechanic here yet, which could count if u were somewhere.
Ya I poked around Izanami in my last trip... i liked her because of the uncanny similarities betwen the Orpheus myth and Izanami underworld. And ya i do suspect there is a hidden "social score" being talllied to determine if we are worthy of raxxla or atleast the dark wheel.

We know the Sap8 crystals had coordinates... while im still unsure about the markings on the raxxla symbol they could just be giving us a System description. A star surrounded by three belts and 33 bodies?
