TDW --> TDW "dark" station --> Raxxla...?

Whilst I've always harboured thought they are the link and would be cool to find the station anyway... Have I missed something? There's no confirmation in lore they found Raxxla (ED lore not FFE, etc!).

Isn't the current lore they found Soontil but never found Raxxla?
