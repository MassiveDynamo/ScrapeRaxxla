The Mayflower is still going full speed (0.6C). It hasnâ€™t stopped for a thousand years.
Was there anything confirming it for ED or is it just the FFE journals? I had a brief check but couldn't find anything ED wise to confirm the speed (though I did the calculation for the journey time to Achenar at 60%c anyway just in case ).
