Something occurred to me. It's probably not related to Raxxla, but who knows?

The Duval colony expedition to Achenar travelled as far as they could get from Sol to start a new civilisation free of the Federation, right?

They're also the only colony group to have done that (which in itself may be because it was just a crazy idea to travel that far that shouldn't have worked but did).

Yet Marlin Duval and her colony ships travelled to the only planet (moon) containing sentient alien life in this part of the Galaxy (not including the as-yet undiscovered Thargoids, obvs), maybe actually the only sentient life besides humans and Thargoids that exists at all in the Galaxy right now.

From what we know, it doesn't like they knew about the mudlarks beforehand. It does like just a coincidence, but wow, that's a one in a million shot right there!

Bad luck, or...

That is actually a really good angle. We really need landable Earth-likes to see if Mudlarks left any clues.
