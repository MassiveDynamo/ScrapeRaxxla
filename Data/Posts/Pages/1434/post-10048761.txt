Just a suggestion: focus on colonies first not the station. I believe even the Brewer Corporation codex says the first big station isn't even built until 2752. The earliest colonies is difficult enough to sort through. Raxxla pretty much predates all but the earliest of colonies. However, there are several wars buried in the lore, too, in the pre-3100s era.
