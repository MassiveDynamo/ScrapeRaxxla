I seriously doubt it's the case that it was the Mayflower that settled Achenar.

Firstly a convoy is multiple ships, not a single ship. And from Tourist Beacon 128: "Marlin Duval was a wealthy woman from Earth, who, disenchanted with their administration and authorities, set off with her own colonising fleet". So clearly it's a large number of ships, not a single ship.

More critically, Achenar is 139.5 ly away from Sol. If it was the Mayflower, then departing Sol in 2097 and arriving at Achenar in 2250 gives a journey time of 153 years.

That's an average speed of 91% the speed of light.

If we include it going to Tau Ceti first, that's an extra 3.2 ly distance, requiring an average speed of 93% the speed of light.

Again that's an speed of 93% the speed of light. Acceleration and deceleration time is going to push the max speed higher, and quite possibly make it non-physical (i.e. requiring a max speed which is greater than the speed of light).


So, realistically speaking, it's virtually impossible that the colonisation of Achenar was via the Mayflower. And by similar extension, it's pretty much certain that Duval's colonising fleet got to Achenar using FTL tech.


(I will say that the necessity of Achenar's colonisation being via FTL tech has been talked about in the thread before, but like much it's buried away in the depths.)

The Mayflower is still going full speed (0.6C). It hasnâ€™t stopped for a thousand years.
