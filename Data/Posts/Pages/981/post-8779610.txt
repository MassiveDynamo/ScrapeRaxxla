Song Gateway (Eitha) & Song Point (LHS 17) are suggestive. Point is a small promontory of land by the sea where a siren might sit & sing to passing sailors. Other station names reported by EDDB seem to be repeats of platform, terminal etc.

In music a song has a key, a gateway is a door, Song Gateway could fit “a door that is also a key”...


C.f. Old (now deleted?) Shin Dez Obfuscated in the Outer Rim mission: “Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth."
All musical keys come in either minor or major. The current constellations, we have:
Canis Major / Minor
Leo Minor
Ursa Major / Minor

Obsolete, we have:
Cancer Minor
Nubecula Major / Minor (In Magellanic clouds)
Tubus Herschelii Major / Minor

The musical notes are only: C, D, E, F, G, A, B(H).

Only Canis and Cancer have a match on the shorthand writing. Short for Canis Major is CMa, which matches musical key C Major. Sirius is 'a CMa' (alpha canis major) and could be considered a note in the key of C major.

Tubus Herchelii might pass as HMa / HMi, but that's a long stretch.
