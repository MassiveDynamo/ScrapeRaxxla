All musical keys come in either minor or major. The current constellations, we have:
Canis Major / Minor
Leo Minor
Ursa Major / Minor

Obsolete, we have:

The musical notes are only: C, D, E, F, G, A, B(H).

Only Canis and Cancer have a match on the shorthand writing. Short for Canis Major is CMa, which matches musical key C Major. Sirius is 'a CMa' (alpha canis major) and could be considered a note in the key of C major.

Tubus Herchelii might pass as HMa / HMi, but that's a long stretch.

Always had my suspicions about Sirius. Both system and Corporation!
