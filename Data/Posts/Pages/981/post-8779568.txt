There are like 20 stations called "Song xxxx". Check eddb.io

Song Gateway (Eitha) & Song Point (LHS 17) are suggestive. Point is a small promontory of land by the sea where a siren might sit & sing to passing sailors. Other station names reported by EDDB seem to be repeats of platform, terminal etc.

In music a song has a key, a gateway is a door, Song Gateway could fit “a door that is also a key”...
