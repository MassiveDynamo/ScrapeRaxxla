Don't give up entirely. I remember an old Porsche Ad which was something like "We don't stop playing because we grow old, we grow old because we stop playing!" Vetinari is right, you reached combat elite. Time to give your hands a break. And we need your tinfoil here, so leaving is not an option!

Well, swapped back to my CH Pro hotas this afternoon, to see if it helped my hand problem, then spent a fruitless and very exasperating time trying to get it to show up in-game. No success so far! Damn it FD, whydo you make things so hard?????

(Edit: previously had used CH Control Manager software but heard reports that this had stopped working under Win10 updates and so deleted it...)

Hope Odyssey sorts out the device setup problems, and gets past the current stupid button/axis limitations; might be a good reason to buy it!!
