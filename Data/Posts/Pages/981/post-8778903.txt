Ah the mantra of the Raxxla hunter.


Bit OT but are Degraded Emissions getting further and further out, or am I just thinking they used to disappear sooner?

I suspect degraded emissons are “dropped” by recent human ship activity which is getting further out from the bubble.
I thought the mantra of the Raxxla hunter was ... brandy, give me brandy!
