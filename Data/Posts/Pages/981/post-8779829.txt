Ah, Yorkshire tea, picked by t’hand o’ t’fair mill lasses near Ilkla Moor & trodden in t’tin baths wi’t cogs!

But, sad to say, they use plastic in their tea bags, hence I am buying no more. I now have a tea ball infuser and three packs of loose leaf teas. Protect the planet! It’s the jewel of the galaxy!
I was wondering why they tasted.... 'interesting' lately compared to what they tasted like 10 year back. Is this a recent thing?

Yes, this is completely on topic btw ladies and gents. We all need plenty of tea breaks to find Raxxla...
