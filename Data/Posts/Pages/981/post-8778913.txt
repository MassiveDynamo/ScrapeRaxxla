Guys did you ever noticed 2 systems have the exact same name before? why the heck there are two "q velorum" in the game?

Yes, I found a duplicate named system (think it was a 2Mass ....) out in IC1805 (Out on the way to Heart & Soul). Same name, totally different system contents. Suspect Stellar Forge had a hiccup when importing from extant star catalogues, maybe one of the devs fed it some lavian brandy after a friday lunch trip to the pub?

Seem to remember other people have reported similar. Report it to FD as a bug.
