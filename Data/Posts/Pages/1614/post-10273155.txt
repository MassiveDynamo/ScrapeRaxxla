Reading Tales of the Frontier (the re-released version with new stories for Elite Dangerous) and Reclamation during vacation has got me thinking. I am working on an alternative pathway to finding Raxxla by finding The Dark Wheel itself. The stations found so far appear to be the Nostrum starports built by Merritt Group mentioned in the Brewer Corporation codex entry. While important these are still newer mid-3200s. The Tales from the Frontier appears describe a torus station that was abandoned and much older known only as Citadel. There are two Orbis-esque Citadel stations and a number of Fort and Fortress stations that served as Galactic Navy sites in 2800s - 3200s (all these are again Orbis-esque). Further we have Coriolis stations with Ring in the name as well as Gateway. Additionally, the Coriolis we know and love isn't the first iteration which was more like an Isohedron (they were known as Ico station).

We'll see if this idea bears fruit when I return in a few days. Though, I am hopeful, as I know there are Coriolises where Fort is the first part of the name as well as Mining. At this point, with the word games, I wouldn't rule out something where part of rumors is there to throw the overly curious off the trail.
