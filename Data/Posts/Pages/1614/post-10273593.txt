A long time ago, in my youth, I played MechWarrior on a 286 computer. I don't remember exactly, but there I was doing various missions, buying robots, advancing further. And so I played until I was retired.
There are not many games, and I played like that many times.
But one day I started reading the dialog in the bar, etc. and began to perform not any missions, but those that were in the story. And the game ended in victory.
As much as everyone loves simple solutions, this doesn't seem to be one of those cases. We didn't know which Universe this was (or was it the same Universe as prior games), we receive a ship and perpetual insurance from an Unknown Benefactor, we are told we are part of The Pilot's Federation (but even they are secretive). There are groups with secretive agendas. Our past is deeply obscured. We appear to be something somewhere between hired mercenaries or gods.

If anything, this is something more like a "choose your own adventure" story.
