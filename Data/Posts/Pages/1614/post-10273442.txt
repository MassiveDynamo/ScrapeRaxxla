Batteries are running very low this close to the ninefold gates…

I’m currently in the process of mapping the gates of hell, I believe I have finally uncovered the boundary between heaven and hell….

Lights don’t seem to be working, emergency power enabled… going to have to shut down to bypass certain systems. I hope to have my discoveries mapped during this outage, found some candles in the cargo hold…
