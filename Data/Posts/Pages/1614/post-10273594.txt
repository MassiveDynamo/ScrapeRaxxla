A long time ago, in my youth, I played MechWarrior on a 286 computer. I don't remember exactly, but there I was doing various missions, buying robots, advancing further. And so I played until I was retired.
There are not many games, and I played like that many times.
But one day I started reading the dialog in the bar, etc. and began to perform not any missions, but those that were in the story. And the game ended in victory.
This is very close to the original intent I believe. Braben did say once “we got it wrong” and that originally missions ought to have driven players around the galaxy, if they got to know the small factions. But players were driven by grind and money, or they chose to explore far and wide.
