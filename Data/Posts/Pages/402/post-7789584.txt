Went to Aganippe, scanned and hacked the hackables. Nothing but data, no messages were sent to my inbox, I'm afraid.

Flew inside the structure through the hatch, couldn't see anything special though. Video uploaded to YT. Should be viewable when YT decides to make it so.

Thanks very much for cheking this out Macros, I really appreciate it. Sorry it was a dead end. You made it look easy by the way!
