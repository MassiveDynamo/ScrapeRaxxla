I just thought the whole anti-matter universe that shares the same space would fit with a place that isn't a place? Maybe.

Not to mention the concept of Raxxla as some kind of alien portal. In the episode "All our Yesterdays" the inhabitants of Beta Niobe's only planet, Sarpeidon, managed to escape their star's supernova by way of portals that allowed them to resettle into different time periods in their own planet's past.
