It's a good idea starbrow. I've already proven myself incapable of getting inside! I don't have any guardian stuff for the same reason. Do you fancy checking it out?

The problem would be getting the guardian stuff to settle between the two nodes without the use of an SRV. I think you'd have to be pretty adept at dumping cargo to get it into those goal posts. Maybe its wide enough for a SLF to squeeze in there?
