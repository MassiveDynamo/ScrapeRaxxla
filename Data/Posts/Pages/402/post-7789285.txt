I'm convinced Raxxla will be a very disappointing find. It's been in from the outset, so how could it be any other?
The fun is in the journey, not in the destination!

It's been in the game since the start, sure, but that doesn't mean FD can't update it along with the rest of the game. For all we know, we're actually on to our 3rd iteration of RAXXLA in the game

It would be epic if the final thing to unlock whatever it is was to gently whisper “raxxla” into your mic.

100's of CMDRs start whispering into their mic
