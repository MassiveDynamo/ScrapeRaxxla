Well, that one I can help you with. I came across the info whilst looking for info on star charts. Spock was from Vulcan right? Vulcan was based on the star 40 Eridani. This star is real, and in Elite Dangerous....I have it bookmarked because I went there to try to figure out the quadrants. I believe the Star Trek star maps were Vulcan maps, so I thought it might help, but didn't.

Vulcan is alternately listed as either 40 Eridani or Epsilon Eridani, depending on the source. PopSci has an article that mentions this: https://www.popsci.com/planet-vulcan-star-trek-eridani

Back in the 80s, before Gene Roddenberry confirmed it as 40 Eridani, I leaned heavily toward Epsilon Eridani.
