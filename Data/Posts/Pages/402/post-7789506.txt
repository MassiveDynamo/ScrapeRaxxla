A small snippet gif from the Interstellar Initiatives video, Bridging The Gap at 1:52. Sadly was not able to slow it down enough to see it frame for frame.
Starts in Dahan, closest system to Ithaca (Home of Odysseus) and as it zooms out it reveals Aganippe and Demeter, among others, including Ao Qin. Also shows Barnard's Loop and Andromeda. All the systems which launched me into this black hole of a journey.
