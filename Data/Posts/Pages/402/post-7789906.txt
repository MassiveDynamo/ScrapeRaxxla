The only star charts that I've ever seen of the Star Trek universe have been two dimensional. I'm not sure that you could reliably determine the location of anything from Star Trek using that information alone. Back in the 1980s I tried to figure out where some of Trek's fictional worlds would exist in three dimensional space (I really, really wanted to know the location of Spock's homeworld) but it was always a bust.

Well, that one I can help you with. I came across the info whilst looking for info on star charts. Spock was from Vulcan right? Vulcan was based on the star 40 Eridani. This star is real, and in Elite Dangerous....I have it bookmarked because I went there to try to figure out the quadrants. I believe the Star Trek star maps were Vulcan maps, so I thought it might help, but didn't.
