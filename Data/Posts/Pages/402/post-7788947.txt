I might have a possible lead, but I'm not good enough at combat to be sure!

So all the codex clues lead me to believe that we were looking for Thebes. Amphion is a character mentioned in Stella and Arestophel. In mythology, Amphion is credited with building the wall around Thebes. He then killed himself after his wife and children were murdered. A parent's grief, a lovers woe. Also, there is an Ophalos stone in Thebes.

When I found New Thebes in Aganippe I was momentarily excited before realizing it is not a landable planet. Right next to New Thebes, however, there is a government installation called the Universal Finance Beaurau, or something very similar. Strange that a financial institutions main concern is allegedly a stock of medical supplies that must be protected.....this is according to their distress call

The installation has a hackable comms array and two hackable data transmitters. I THINK that these may give us a clue to Raxxla.

The trouble is, despite being an Elite explorer, I am "mostly harmless" with mostly being more like totally and pathetically. Basically, I cant get my hand on the data because the automated defenses kill me!

I cant find anything about this installation or its data on Google. Has anybody checked this out already? If not, would somebody with more combat skills care to try?

My only ask is that if somebody gets the data, that they share it here, rather than running off to find Raxxla all by themselves! xD
