Ok, given the dead end at New Thebes, but continuing with the Amphion theme. I know this is a bit out there, but has anybody considered a Star Trek Easter egg?

I am not a Star Trek fan, but in researching Amphion, I stumbled across something interesting....

In Star Trek, Amphion was a dead star in an antimatter universe that acted as a gateway from our universe, which was accessible from a white hole in our universe in the Beta Niobe system.

If this tin foil theory was right, then we would be looking for the stella remnants of Beta Niobe, the location of which is "The chart depicted Beta Niobe close to Ariannus and as far away from Earth as the Romulan Neutral Zone for example. The chart, first seen chronologically in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, set in 2293, was also seen in several Star Trek: The Next Generationand Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes set in the 24th century."

Do you think this is an angle worth persuing?
Has anybody considered it already? If not, I don't suppose there are any Star Trek fans on here, who could help determine the location???

The only star charts that I've ever seen of the Star Trek universe have been two dimensional. I'm not sure that you could reliably determine the location of anything from Star Trek using that information alone. Back in the 1980s I tried to figure out where some of Trek's fictional worlds would exist in three dimensional space (I really, really wanted to know the location of Spock's homeworld) but it was always a bust.
