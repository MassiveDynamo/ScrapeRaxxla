FTL.. Wormholes.. Relativity is slippery ground. That's why ED was made "Newtonian" (but in an universe where "even light is faster than light", though).
One question, the point: is light travelling through a wormhole FTL ? Mmmh ? Ofc not. It is simply following a shorter path.
Frame reference is the point. As always in relativity.
