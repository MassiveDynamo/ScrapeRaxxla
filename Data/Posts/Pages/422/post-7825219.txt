The real issue here is that locating post-FTL generation ships without knowing the exact method of travel gets quite fuzzy.

Generation ships by design are ment to house a base number of individuals with room for many future generations to live, learn, and crew the vessels as the time it would take to reach the intended destination would far outstrip the human lifespan.

With FTL driven vessels, Generation Ships would ony be considered if the fastest mode of travel wouldn't allow a crew to survive the trip in their lifetime. Of course this doesn't take into account relativity.
