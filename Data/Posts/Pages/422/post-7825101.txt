Regarding wormholes you don’t travel faster then light whilst traversing them but they would transport you to a location faster than travelling at the speed of light but personally you’d arrive instantaneous so is a much higher form of travel

I didn't say you did travel faster than light while traversing them:

If we're talking realistically then you can't ever be moving faster than the speed of light, and all hypothetical forms of FTL travel involve getting around that restriction in a form where you don't locally move faster than light (which you can't) but still arrive at the destination faster than light would (if that light was travelling the 'ordinary' route through normal space).

And on the instantaneous front - what's your basis for asserting instantaneousness? As a very basic point, if you have to traverse the wormhole, and are doing so slower than light, then there is a time involved in that (from everyone's perspective, though the time will vary depending on perspective).

Happy to agree however that the 'time' isn't dependent on the 'real' distance.

On the other hand, it's also worth bearing in mind that wormholes are in spacetime not space. 'Time' and 'speed' all gets very fuzzy. For example, if you travel a wormhole and come out after light would have arrived there (or even say, in the same spot, but in the future), then have you travelled faster than light?
