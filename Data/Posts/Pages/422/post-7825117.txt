I didn't say you did travel faster than light while traversing them:



And on the instantaneous front - what's your basis for asserting instantaneousness? As a very basic point, if you have to traverse the wormhole, and are doing so slower than light, then there is a time involved in that (from everyone's perspective, though the time will vary depending on perspective).

Happy to agree however that the 'time' isn't dependent on the 'real' distance.

On the other hand, it's also worth bearing in mind that wormholes are in spacetime not space. 'Time' and 'speed' all gets very fuzzy. For example, if you travel a wormhole and come out after light would have arrived there (or even say, in the same spot, but in the future), then have you travelled faster than light?

Well light can travel through the worm hole can’t it? Therefore if you go through it at sub light speed and light is also going through it then technically you’ve not gotten there quicker than light as light also went though it and just so happened to do it first
