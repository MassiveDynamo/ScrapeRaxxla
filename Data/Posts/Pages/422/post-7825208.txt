Okay but, hear me out, if light travels through the worm hole with you then it would arrive at the same time as you or even faster than you? Yeah you’ve said standard space time bla bla etc but if you created a wormhole and light went through it
and then YOU went through it that light would arrive sooner than you and therefore you’d be travelling at sublight speeds.
Hypothetical I know but still it’s possible
