Mindblowing.
I just love "science-tinfoiling" !
Now, what if I use a Frame Shift Drive inside a wormhole ?
Well you’d move through the wormhole and since your nav computer would be like ‘wait what, where’d we go?’ It wouldn’t be able to lock onto you destination and you’d probs just drop out. Your organs I mean because you’d be turned inside out. Well at least that’s what I think would happen
ORRRR that’s how you find raxxla lol. If that was actually how you could I’d vacuum pack myself
