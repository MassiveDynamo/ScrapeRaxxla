So many things it could relate to: ED glitch when joining, Fed or empire rank (aka permissions achieved),
yep i hear ya , and i'm almost at max final Rank for both Federation & Empire ( i'm on last rank bar from being maxed on both ) .

do you own TOHF?, SAP 8 cores, Earth Relics, Mysterious Idols, etc..
Yes thanks to a fellow pilot , i'm pretty sure i have all of those items in storage except for 'SAP 8 cores' . i'll double check and if i'm missing any i'll get them ASAP.

Do you carry Guardian artifacts like Key, Orbs, etc..?
Yes, but only on my FC . However, once i had time to make my big "deep space" journey toward RAXXLA ( or whatever else might be out there in the "black" of cosmos ) i was gonna transfer the items onto my main exploration ship anti-corrosion cargo-hold , just in case having those types of items ( along with my 'Thargoid Sensor' and 'TOHF' items ) might have had some effect or parameter in the RAXXLA discovery factoring.

You in PC and Odyssey right?
Yep , and guess what guys.... LOL GOOD NEWS , see below:



.... no idea why TODAY it all of a sudden shows up for me ^ . Maybe a Christmas Miracle?? Or maybe my game just de-sync'd yesterday in GalMap search window or who the heck knows. UGH so sorry everyone and especially @mach10 , @D7 , and @Zimous for wasting u guys' time answering this particular question. But maybe, within the questions/answers, it also helped some other players reading this thread. o7
