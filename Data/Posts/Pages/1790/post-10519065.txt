Hey guys, I'm not a Raxxla hunter but just stumbled on this and the previous page, and saw you think something can be visible only for a commander who reached certain levels of something. Am I right?

I'm full Elite across the board, Admiral King.

So if you need someone with these credentials to fly somewhere to look at something, check, whatever, feel free to PM me. I'll gladly help.
