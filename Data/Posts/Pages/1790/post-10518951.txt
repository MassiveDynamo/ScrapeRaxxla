Rank makes no difference im Elite V x4, my wife is single Elite and it still shows, however i think you misinterpreted what i meant.
The pulsar that was originally designated LGM-1 is not in the game CP 1919 (PSR J1921+2153) in the constellation of Vulpecula (291LY).
LGM-1 which i know is in game (ive been there) is over 9K LY from SOL.
