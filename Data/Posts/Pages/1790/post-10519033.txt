I'm guessing the jewel is just a pulsar, but how did figure out which one is on her "brow"?
She discovered the first pulsar, LGM-1. Its the jewel on her brow.. aka an achievement. It has a double meaning in this case. a jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies would be a neutron star, just shy of the mass required to collapse into a blackhole
