Even though I've given up on the hunt for Raxxla I still follow the tinfoil here daily. Thanks to everyone who keeps that going.

A legitimate wondering: A year ago a certain user posted leaked material of a 5 year Frontier roadmap that I learned about on Reddit. I followed up on that post not long ago and the leak is, short of covid-19 delays and such, pretty much spot on. The author of the post signs off by saying there is no Raxxla in Elite, and given the accuracy of the post itself I was curious if this has made anyone feel differently about searching?

Without having any in-game clues I've been forced to hunt for real life ones instead.
