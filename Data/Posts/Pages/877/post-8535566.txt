Even more of a shame given "last addition, really, in terms of going from space all the way down to the planet surface." Meaning we may never be able to visit an ELW or WW. Let's hope Raxxla isnt one of those!
He was talking about legs. It's the last addition in terms of spaceship - ground vehicle - on foot.

Edit - copying and pasting myself (simply due to having already got it written out elsewhere and knowing how to find it quickly):

-----

“We’ve created the last addition really in terms of going from space all the way down to the planets surface, so now you can set foot, you can explore, you can interact with the environment”

Emphasis by me to aid clarity.

No causes for concern.

To paraphrase what was said: ‘We’ve already got Ship and SRV mechanics, and the final addition to that particular group of mechanics is being able to go out on foot.’
