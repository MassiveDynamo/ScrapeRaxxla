Sorry for slight off topic, but disappointed to learn atmospheric landing is "tenuous atmosphere only" so still no 100% garuntee of being able to land on Raxxla.

Even more of a shame given "last addition, really, in terms of going from space all the way down to the planet surface." Meaning we may never be able to visit an ELW or WW. Let's hope Raxxla isnt one of those!
