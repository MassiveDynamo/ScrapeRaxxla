Got Orange Sidewinder first time this patch, trying to drop in to signal source. Game stuck in the drop out loading (that blu haze tunnel) and after minutes disconnect.

Probably Frontier failed to load Raxxla/DW instance for me and crashe dthe server XD
Joking.
______Or not?

No, game stuck in hyperspace tunnel is a networking issue. Used to happen a lot, but things were improved significantly. Anyone else in your house using the internet, maybe streaming movies?
