If you listen both vgers are playing what I think is supposed to be the Golden Record of greetings in various Earth languages. The English version is clearly David Braben saying something trite along the lines of “to all inhabitants of Space, we wish you happiness in your search”. I didn't note down the exact phrasing, but it’s definitely his voice. I’ve interacted with them with the only mechanisms we have ( honking and shooting) but nothing happened....
I wonder if anyone has done a spectral analysis on the messages?
