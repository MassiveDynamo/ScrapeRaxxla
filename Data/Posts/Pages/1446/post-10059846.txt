As promised here's the bit from Lost Realms seemingly regarding the Raxxla mythos. It is seemingly connected with Earth but deeper than just that. It appears to be an origins story of humanity and how we got our start at space exploration. The Core Dynamics Eagle seemingly plays a large role as does symbolism. There is mention of Altuxor which is also connected to the planet Kamelios "Where the Time Winds Blow" by Holdstock. I believe where Kamelios is located is one of Federal locked permit systems (though obviously name has changed).

I will have to get a better photo of Galactic Cooperative from Tour of the Universe (which also has a time travel component much like "Where the Time Winds Blow") as it included Kamelios in the map. We are searching for our past and what happened as best I can tell:

Note: The second image at the very bottom mentioned the Kennedy family (specifically the Kennedys famously tied to the United States of America and the famous "We choose to go to the Moon" speech). This is wrapped into the mystery very deeply and is included in the first few pages of "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide". Apologies, glossy paper makes for difficult photos.
