Some of the above responses regarding Paradise Lost are interesting in the context of Elite Dangerous, as it makes me think of Raxxla as being a parallel to the tree with forbidden fruit in Eden. The fruit was wisdom and led to the exodus from Eden, just as Raxxla is said to be a gateway to other Universes. Does this mean a snake (-named system) will lead us to the fruit (Raxxla)?

The Michael Brookes tattoo is often in my mind and it does show, to my eyes, a journey that seems to begin in the underworld... . There are also many snakes (dragons), though I have insufficient familiarity with the mythology to identify systems with names representative of the creatures or locations depicted, though I suspect it does show a path that can be followed in-game.

There is still a step that is missing that I also think about often. It is like a final key that is needed to open the door when it is reached. People have visited systems all around the Bubble and there is even an on-going effort to search every system within 200LY of Sol (now over 70% complete). Yet no sign of anything Raxxla-related. So how come it was ever found and known about such that it was a myth by 2296? Our scanners are superior, our ships faster and better able to explore and yet nothing. Mis-jumps is the only thing that they had in the past that we don't. I have tried to mis-jump in ED before, even getting help to use a Thargoid Probe to try and shut me down whilst the jump engages. So I have a feeling that not only do we have to undertake a specific journey but to do some kind of 'unlock' at the final location - and I see no clue what that is.
