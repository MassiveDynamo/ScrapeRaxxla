We don’t know that it was.

The comparisons the Codex makes are to El Dorado, Atlantis, and the Kingdom of Prester John.

All are myths to us now, but ones which didn’t originate with the discovery of those places.
There is a whole book on that by Holdstock and Malcolm Edwards called Lost Realms. I swear the last chapter is entirely about the system Raxxla is located. I will see if I can get photos. I have pretty much everything done jointly between Robert Holdstock and Malcolm Edwards. I swear the entire set of those books were commissioned by David Braben and Ian Bell.
