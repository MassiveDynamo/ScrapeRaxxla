It warns you of what it can do and can't and says may contain errors and you should check the results... Only humans would ignore that . It's just a natural language query tool that's amazing at doing so much more than a search engine... Don't be afraid of new technology just use it appropriately I would suggest, after all you could use the exact same warning for using a Google search and it gave me a cautionary note every time I asked it a question... I guess the question is did you completely disagree with the answers? Would it help suggest new ideas by analysing the data it does have... Can you think of a way it may help initial theories you may have? I asked it about astronomy, mythology and it was certainly good at answering them and you can ask why it comes up with the responses and correct it when you see something wrong... Truly fascinating for effectively a beta/free service (when it's not off line due to demand!)
Not intended as a jibe, just a general notice to all, and particularly those new to doing internet based ‘open source’ research. I’m always seeing people sighting sources found online which they perceive as true, it’s not necessarily the case. Yes, always read the small print. AI is not dangerous, people’s complacency is.

It can be utilised for very quick idea generation.

I’ve used AI on a few instance to ‘rattle’ the data to see what I might have missed and it will extract references one has either glossed over or never seen before. Just use with caution.
