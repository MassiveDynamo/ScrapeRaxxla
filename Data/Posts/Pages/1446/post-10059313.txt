Another ‘hint’ for anyone interested, again I know many will know this but it always amazes me how many people don’t.

Don’t be reliant upon one search engine.

Example: Google uses its own metric tables, much of the data is paid content, so only the ‘popular’ results rise to the top.

Use another engine and you might get a whole other plethora of data.

Also nothing beats a good old dusty real world library…

Eg Yggdrasil…

Using Google and a key word search I couldn’t find any ‘direct’ named link to Donars Oak as it as a ‘world tree’… only generalists links… but you slap that into Duck Duck Go and you get a very quick reference to an old Saxon phrase linked to Donar’s Oak as ‘world tree of the Chatti’… not to say one couldn’t find that via Google, but it’s reliant on knowing the right thing to type in and if it’s high enough on the search chart, utilise a mix of sources to expand your horizons…

… so on and so forth…
