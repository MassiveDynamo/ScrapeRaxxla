Ok here is a thought for a concerted search since people seem to be bored - I am not a fan of the lets search every system in the bubble approach. I want clues! So I propose we assume that Raxxla is moving and it has an effect on systems/craft it comes in contact with. I can think of atleast three points that might make up part of that Trajectory (Thetis, Herpin, and Delta69). Lets get a list of potential "weird hapenstances" that could be possible raxxla encounters and start seeing if we can map a trajectory. Dates descriptions locations etc... Categorize them...

I think a good place to start would be hitting the EDDB list of tourist beacons and downloading the JSON file and see what comes up with searching various key words. Also - I think Delta69 might be a two parter.... It talks about the stranger as someone from a ship that had disappeared? I dont have it infront of me .. but ya lets check that too. These are all things on my list to do but i thought id open it up if people want to make a project of it. Would also be nice to come up with a possible explanation for raxxla being mobile - either as a rouge planet or as some kind of ship ? How and why is it traveling ? o7

This is a good starting point, I’ve been thinking along the same line regards the Thetis, just keep getting distracted.

Yup key word search anything which could be related, a link analysis of those may point someplace, or physically plotting them in the galmap to see what sort of spatial correlation there is, if it’s temporal, that could indicate movement and any spacial alignment could become a trajectory.

Again this has been on my to-do list for some time. I’m on board. Can’t confirm my commitment as RL takes precedence right now but will be doing as much ‘off line’ research as I can.
