Ok here is a thought for a concerted search since people seem to be bored - I am not a fan of the lets search every system in the bubble approach. I want clues! So I propose we assume that Raxxla is moving and it has an effect on systems/craft it comes in contact with. I can think of atleast three points that might make up part of that Trajectory (Thetis, Herpin, and Delta69). Lets get a list of potential "weird hapenstances" that could be possible raxxla encounters and start seeing if we can map a trajectory. Dates descriptions locations etc... Categorize them...

I think a good place to start would be hitting the EDDB list of tourist beacons and downloading the JSON file and see what comes up with searching various key words. Also - I think Delta69 might be a two parter.... It talks about the stranger as someone from a ship that had disappeared? I dont have it infront of me .. but ya lets check that too. These are all things on my list to do but i thought id open it up if people want to make a project of it. Would also be nice to come up with a possible explanation for raxxla being mobile - either as a rouge planet or as some kind of ship ? How and why is it traveling ? o7
