The Raxxla thing will never be over. Even if the actual Raxxla was ever found, enough people will refuse to believe it actually is the real Raxxla, and the search will continue. The winking cat isn't as old a mystery a Raxxla is, so yeah, that would be over
And those that DO believe it's Raxxla would argue about which sect should be set up to control it, and what god(s) it should be dedicated to, and whether it's compliant with lore!

And how much better it used to be in the old days before all the young ladies left Lave and before the brandy & biscuits ran out.....
oh sorry, that's me wondering off topic again.
