It was never confirmed as fluff / lore only in the same way as Gan Romero (Gon Roamin' ?) was but strong implication is it was. They could bring it back though and make a story of it...but its a bit like Raxxla, if you actually catch the Cat its all over.
The Raxxla thing will never be over. Even if the actual Raxxla was ever found, enough people will refuse to believe it actually is the real Raxxla, and the search will continue. The winking cat isn't as old a mystery a Raxxla is, so yeah, that would be over
