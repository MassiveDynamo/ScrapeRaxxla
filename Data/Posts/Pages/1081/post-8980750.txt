Ariel trading beacon remainds me the siren from Disney

There is so much data you have to collect! Are specific NPC-names a hint? There is for example the "Trading Beacon" which spawns a NPC where the ship has the name Ariel. I've seen in screenshots of other players that Trading Beacon-ship is named Ariel, too. So you start researching Ariel, which leads you to "The Tempest" by Shakespeare, where Ceres is also mentioned. Ariel was also imprisoned by the witch Sycorax. And then you must be careful not to start getting confused by The Expanse since it does reference The Tempest, too, through the name Caliban ("Caliban's War").

You correctly mention that we need to look for everything that looks out of place or behaves different than expected. But it is so damn difficult to discriminate between "that was intentional by FDev", "that is a popculture reference" and "that is just a bug".
hmmm Ariel daughter of Triton.. mmkay seem like i have to brute force it!! will try to complete 7 or 32 Ariel trading beacon missions, whats the worst that could happen appart from getting permission to land on Triton...
