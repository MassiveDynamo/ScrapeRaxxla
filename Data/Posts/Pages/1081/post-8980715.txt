We're stuck arent we? We are going round in circles and clutching at anything that might be a straw but we are completely and utterly stuck. All the 'obvious' ideas have been had and investigated to a degree, nothing wrong with having a go yourself anyway coz it has to be somewhere, do what thou wilt so to speak.

What if it is just random?

Did Frontier in a PEGI 7 game use inspiration from a text by a hard drug user who is generally viewed as Satanic and evil? Possibly not methinks.

Children's Book may well be a nod or homage to MB book, and thats all it is, unless we havent found something in-game yet?

I think to a certain extent all the... lets say "fringe" religious groups in the various permutations of Elite have been influenced by Crowley and the Golden Dawn along with other occult and secret societies- oh and hippies (probably hopped up on Onionhead). Raxxla in the codex evokes mystical and conspiracy theories... I think its safe to say that it probably was constructed with "Ancient High Technology" (emphasis on the High) as well...

As to being stuck? Nah- we have been going around and around in circles since this thread started ! the hope is that we are spiraling towards the omphalos
