More jump range is why there are so many unseen systems I think. Who's to say the best systems aren't in the 60+ lys worth of systems you pass by in a jump?
we dont need more jump range, we need the jumping sequance time is shortened. FSD heating up, countdown, jumping animation and in the new system FSD cooldown if you havent fried your pants yet. It takes a lot time when you are trying to do a long journey.
