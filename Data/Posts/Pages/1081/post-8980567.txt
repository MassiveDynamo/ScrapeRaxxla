We're stuck arent we? We are going round in circles and clutching at anything that might be a straw but we are completely and utterly stuck. All the 'obvious' ideas have been had and investigated to a degree, nothing wrong with having a go yourself anyway coz it has to be somewhere, do what thou wilt so to speak.

What if it is just random?

Did Frontier in a PEGI 7 game use inspiration from a text by a hard drug user who is generally viewed as Satanic and evil? Possibly not methinks.

Children's Book may well be a nod or homage to MB book, and thats all it is, unless we havent found something in-game yet?
