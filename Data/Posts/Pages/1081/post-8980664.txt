More jump range is why there are so many unseen systems I think. Who's to say the best systems aren't in the 60+ lys worth of systems you pass by in a jump?
Not important, it is 400 billions (9 zeros) of stars, compare with amount of sold copies and calculate years to map. It is still hundreds of years at optimistic numbers.
So this means right today, less then 10 years passed, it is not important how long is your jump or how fast you do jumps.
