Ok here is a thought for a concerted search since people seem to be bored - I am not a fan of the lets search every system in the bubble approach. I want clues! So I propose we assume that Raxxla is moving and it has an effect on systems/craft it comes in contact with. I can think of atleast three points that might make up part of that Trajectory (Thetis, Herpin, and Delta69). Lets get a list of potential "weird hapenstances" that could be possible raxxla encounters and start seeing if we can map a trajectory. Dates descriptions locations etc... Categorize them...

I think a good place to start would be hitting the EDDB list of tourist beacons and downloading the JSON file and see what comes up with searching various key words. Also - I think Delta69 might be a two parter.... It talks about the stranger as someone from a ship that had disappeared? I dont have it infront of me .. but ya lets check that too. These are all things on my list to do but i thought id open it up if people want to make a project of it. Would also be nice to come up with a possible explanation for raxxla being mobile - either as a rouge planet or as some kind of ship ? How and why is it traveling ? o7

Did we ever get confirmation that the Winking Cat was 'fluff' or 'solve' whatever mystery it was leading us towards?

I was just reviewing older material (again) and had a thought about the 17th, 20th, 23rd centuries which could be 17:00, 20:00, 23:00 times that Raxxla 'jumps' or a black hole 'appears and opens as a portal'. So perhaps scanning in a system earlier or later might mean you miss it? Hence the related comments about groups scanning, or more people et al... as that would increase the probability of discovery.

Just a thought.
