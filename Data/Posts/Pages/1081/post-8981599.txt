I think to a certain extent all the... lets say "fringe" religious groups in the various permutations of Elite have been influenced by Crowley and the Golden Dawn along with other occult and secret societies- oh and hippies (probably hopped up on Onionhead). Raxxla in the codex evokes mystical and conspiracy theories... I think its safe to say that it probably was constructed with "Ancient High Technology" (emphasis on the High) as well...

As to being stuck? Nah- we have been going around and around in circles since this thread started ! the hope is that we are spiraling towards the omphalos

Could be rotating on the outer rim!
