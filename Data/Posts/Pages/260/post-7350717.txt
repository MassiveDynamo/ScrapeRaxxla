Yeah. Well, nevertheless I like to think that "Raxxla", actually, is more the "Construct" than the planet where it sits. It might be "removable".
But don't pay too much attention to me. I just like the Oolite's concept of Raxxla...

Now imagine it will just be an ELW, with a tourist beacon in orbit with some random text about "there is a secret on the surface"... and nothing more
EPIC
