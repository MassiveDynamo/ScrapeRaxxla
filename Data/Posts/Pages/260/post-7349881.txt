... and going down all along to 8 ? (Carcosa, Aldebaran <= anything to do with Berenice ?, nah .. Taurus.. near the Sisters)

I now think that figure 8 may be the Demiurge. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge

It's often painted as a lion with a snake body.

The Demiurge is a creator of the material cosmos in Platonic, Gnostic and to some degree Mithraic cosmology.

The Demiurge is not a creator from nothing, but one that crafts the material cosmos from the pre-existing eternal forms.

Plato has the Demiurge as a perfect(within his limited realm) being, while the Gnostics see him as imperfect and to some degree malevolent.

The Gnostic text Pistis Sophia, Yaldabaoth(Demiurge) has already sunk from his high estate and resides in Chaos, where, with his forty-nine demons, he tortures wicked souls in boiling rivers of pitch, and with other punishments . He is an archon with the face of a lion, half flame, and half darkness.

This seem to be the best fit for MBs image.
