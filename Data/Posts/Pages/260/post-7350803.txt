Yeah. Well, nevertheless I like to think that "Raxxla", actually, is more the "Construct" than the planet where it sits. It might be "removable".
But don't pay too much attention to me. I just like the Oolite's concept of Raxxla...

Alien artefact, ophalos rift, Mars relic.... You might be able to put it in your pocket.

Should be a definite place though, according to the codex.

According to Plato, each soul assigned to a star. I hope the personal journey doesn't mean we each have our own Raxxla.
