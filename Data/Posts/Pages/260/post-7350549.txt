Wiki ? Nothing better ?
While the Witch certainly was a member (even 'High Priestess') of the cult, I keep thinking TDW was far above her reach. For me, she was nothing more than one of their instrument among many others.
But, anyway... Past times.

Oops, ninja'd by Pa Jorki ! [smile]

You’ve got to get up early to beat me mate; I think I’m about 7 hours ahead of your timezone!

(Even if I am currently in the Omega Nebula )

edit: seen some lovely sights between the first two DW2 waypoints, the organisers have set a nice route. This is my first organised expedition & it’s good fun. Fleet roster closes tomorrow or Friday so still time for anyone who wants to catch up!
