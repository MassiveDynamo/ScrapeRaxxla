Also, the head of the Dark Wheel is a decendent of other heads of TDW, namely the Ryder family. They select the best and brightest of each generation of pilots to become members. It would make sense that the emphasis on generational selection would come from a group that possibly came from a generation ship, no? It would also explain the 'Dark Wheel' station as it would be a darkened gen-ship with a set of habitation rings.

Should we try getting Allied with the Ryder Revolutionary Party in Maia?
