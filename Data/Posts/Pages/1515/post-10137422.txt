Now this is interesting! Yes I likewise recall such an article.

Humans are complacent and will either consciously or unconsciously utilise various phrases which have deep personal meaning or which relate to another subject close to them, within other contexts, it would be interesting to re-read those interviews around this reference as it may point to some unknown source material?

I’ve drawn some potential correlation to MB Elite Legacy, in regards the ‘child’s story’ again on its own it’s far too wide, but there are some weird locational correlations between that system and two others which has made me presume it might not be. My gut tells me the reference to Princess Astrophel and her book might not be literal, but another abstract metaphor for a location.

Click to expand...
Princess Aurora? Aurora is astronomical, and usually only seen when the stars are out....
Aurora is an in-game system IIRC. Seem to remember I went there checking out my Princess hypothesis (see unknown number of pages ago in this thread!)

Edit
Princess Athena from Little Mermaid? Athena is an X-ray astronomical telescope satellite. Athena system has several ringed planets & a GG with 8 moons.......
