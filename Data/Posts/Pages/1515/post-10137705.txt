Do we have daimons guiding us in Elite?
Perhaps. Though, the concept is a bit more nuanced. There certainly appears an argument to be made that the CMDRs themselves are essentially daemons or lesser gods. To be honest, a single CMDR can radically influence the state affairs of wherever they visit for better or worse.
