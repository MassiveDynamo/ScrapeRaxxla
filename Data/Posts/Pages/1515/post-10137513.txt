Fine, I'll go back to sitting in timeout. Good luck everyone.
Please try to believe in yourself. I believe the Demeter/Persephone myth is but one angle reinforcing an idea of rebirth. While the lore is crazy complicated, we keep getting little hints that CMDRs should investigate rumors of the past. However, few seem to pick it up. That or there are a lot more people like you but they choose to stay quiet because of other CMDRs. I know just based on CMDR's names for their carriers and ships, there are a lot of us who picked up what FDev is hinting.

You are not alone in your sentiments and analysis of the story. You do yourself and everyone else a disserve by not speaking up. I in my time here have had every reason to keep quiet. I don't because silencing yourself only allows those who shutdown valid ideas to be seen as the mainstream. They aren't. Those who make others feel ashamed should be loudly and frequently confronted. Take sides. Never give into the haters.
