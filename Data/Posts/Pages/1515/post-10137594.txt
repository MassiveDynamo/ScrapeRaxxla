Fine, I'll go back to sitting in timeout. Good luck everyone.
I didn't meant rise old skeletons. Sorry. My point was more that Nysa has received a lot of attention in the past, in fact I spent a few hours there following NPCs and learnt a whole heap about how they work, which was all to the good.

My comment is more about the fact that the current discussion is heading back to the root of the quest. We're once again trying to work out what it is we're looking for and how we are going to go about it. We need to be careful to try and break out of old habits and come up with something different or else we'll all get dizzy
