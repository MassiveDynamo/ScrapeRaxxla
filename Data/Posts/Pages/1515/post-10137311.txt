My mind keeps returning to “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars” and DB said ED has a storyline but
“it’s not a single-player threaded “rescue the princess” style story” (see my FD quotes thread). That “princess” phrase has cropped up a couple of times (seem to remember reading a games magazine interview where he said his father had originated the comment, but didn't note the reference).

So I suspect if (& I’m not convinced!) any mythology is relevant to Raxxla then it is based around a princess.
Now this is interesting! Yes I likewise recall such an article.

Humans are complacent and will either consciously or unconsciously utilise various phrases which have deep personal meaning or which relate to another subject close to them, within other contexts, it would be interesting to re-read those interviews around this reference as it may point to some unknown source material?

I’ve drawn some potential correlation to MB Elite Legacy, in regards the ‘child’s story’ again on its own it’s far too wide, but there are some weird locational correlations between that system and two others which has made me presume it might not be. My gut tells me the reference to Princess Astrophel and her book might not be literal, but another abstract metaphor for a location.
