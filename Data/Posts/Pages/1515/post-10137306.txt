My mind keeps returning to “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars” and DB said ED has a storyline but
“it’s not a single-player threaded “rescue the princess” style story” (see my FD quotes thread). That “princess” phrase has cropped up a couple of times (seem to remember reading a games magazine interview where he said his father had originated the comment, but didn't note the reference).

So I suspect if (& I’m not convinced!) any mythology is relevant to Raxxla then it is based around a princess.
