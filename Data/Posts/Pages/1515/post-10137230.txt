You're not wrong there.

Here's a thought.
I struggle with organizing my thoughts at times. I also worry it'll be interpreted or perceived as non-sensical blabber by some ego-maniac narcissist who takes things too far, which I hope is not the case. For whatever reason, I don't know why, the story of Persephone and Demeter just makes sense to me, along with its application to our quests. I'm not saying it's right, or that my ideas are complete. I'm saying these are my opinions and take on it, and it's how I view my experience, which, to me, just makes sense. I believe that my opinions and my ideas hold value, and that time has proven this to be true, especially in regards to Alexander the Great and the Eleusinian Mysteries, but not that Only my ideas hold value. I'm not looking for followers or a video game cult, the only thing I'm really after is understanding, just like yourselves. I don't understand why this quest just makes sense to me. It just does. You can disagree, and I accept that. I, like you, am only looking for answers, while a the same time feeling I have some answers. Nonetheless, the offer stands, as it always has; If you ask, I will answer as best I can, and may need some guidance.
