What if the toast was not a map of travel but more a map of noise.

You have the Landscape signal which you believe was for Sag A and the reference to the Jewell, is there something from the other lines that might overlay and give a different image?

Does the Void Heart Nebula give off anything for the 3rd line? Maybe.
