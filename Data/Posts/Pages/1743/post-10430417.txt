As a former QA & rudimentary 'coder' ( SWG ) , i tend to agree with you there ^ yep. However, something just occurred to me: Remember that aforementioned permit-locked planet 'LAVE 2' i stumbled upon ( without knowing it was commonplace) in my previous post earlier? Well, that planet is run by the..... 'Lave RADIO Network' . hmm.... coincidence?
"Lave Radio Network" is one of the player-named factions (and, as one of the earliest-added ones where Frontier really hadn't thought through the rules yet, were given placement in a lore-significant system)

They control the main system station so have default jurisdiction over any space not very close (varies depending on type, but never more than 1000km) to a station/settlement/installation owned by another faction

They took control of the system through normal BGS processes from an Alliance faction who really didn't want to give it up, leading to a big fight in mid-2018 which temporarily caused Lavian Brandy to be unavailable - and therefore, Didi Vatermann being really difficult to unlock for the new players of the time.

Wasn't it also confirmed by FDev that it was an intended feature? As in they knew what they were doing placing it in such a way and that it was not a bug.
https://issues.frontierstore.net/issue-detail/446 was closed as "By Design" without comment. Obviously that doesn't confirm anything about what it was designed for.
