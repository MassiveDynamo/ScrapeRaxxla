TDW in SD, are not OG TDW.

if these are true, then again I suggest removing TDW from SD.
It needs to be a tiny bit obvious.
Falicity Farseer says people posing to be TDW don't survive long, either TDW real gets them or the 'power that be' does.

Honestly I believe 'we' are TDW proper. That we also need to remove TDW 'fake' from SD. This if possible I feel is the unlock key.

RAXXLA most likely IS in the bubble just not what we expect it to be until unlocked.

You're going to need another tactic. The Dark Wheel minor faction is the only native faction in Shinrarta Dezhra. That means it cannot be evicted.
