I have no doubt at all that the Landscape Signal is (at the very least) an unsolved mystery deliberately put into the game.

As selbie said, the question is - what's next?

Assume this is what we're intended to have naturally stumbled on in the past (theoretically it would have been possible for someone to find it immediately on game launch), and assume this is the solution to at least parts of the Codex, then consider what's supposed to happen next?
Are we supposed to 'solve' the signal?
Is that signal a signpost on the way to other similar (as yet unfound) signals?
Was discovery & discussion by the community supposed to trigger "the next stage" from Fdev?
Is it feature complete and just supposed to be a strange signal with no solution?
Is there some way to reach the source via some esoteric method?
Is there an as-yet undiscovered way to get a cleaner/better signal?
My assumption is that it's been placed outside of any reachable system specifically because it's the signal itself we're supposed to focus on. If it came from a system we could enter we'd all be focusing on that system rather than the sound. It being outside of any known system also means that in future Fdev can build something there for us to visit, much like the Guardian Ruins weren't there until Fdev added them, they weren't always there to find.

If we assume for the sake of a decade-long thread that's got nowhere so far that this is Raxxla (or a signpost), what's the next part of the quest once it's been identified?
