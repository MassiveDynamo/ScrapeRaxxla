That seems ... highly implausible, to say the least. What coding would possibly require galaxy-level sound sources to be attached to a corner of a boxel? Why would anyone do it that way in the first place when the maths to locate a sound in space is exactly as easy - easier, since it doesn't have a superfluous rounding step! - when using full-resolution coordinates, and they have to be able to calculate the direction of out-of-system objects more precisely than "nearest boxel" anyway to stop the starbox looking very silly.

Yes, ED has some weird bugs which occasionally imply disturbing things about the underlying code, but this doesn't feel like the sort of mistake they (or anyone else!) could possibly have made.
Wasn't it also confirmed by FDev that it was an intended feature? As in they knew what they were doing placing it in such a way and that it was not a bug.

This would be enough evidence to me that, if it is part of a mystery, it performs the role of a siren's song to find 'something' in the vicinity.
It's frustrating that it effectively led to no apparent breadcrumbs to continue the investigation because the mystery of it is incredibly tantalising.

The more humbling option is that FDev are technically correct and it is simply just a correctly working audio feature that has nothing to do with any mysteries
