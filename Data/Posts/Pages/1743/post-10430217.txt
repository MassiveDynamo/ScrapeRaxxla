Yes - the only known player-driven way to remove TDW from the game (and even then, a reversible suppression rather than a removal) would be if the Thargoids captured Shinrarta (and all other systems they're present they were either retreated or also covered in Thargoids).

That wasn't even a theoretical option until late 2022 and the current war clearly isn't set up to make that possible without destroying 75% of the bubble along the way, so it seems unlikely to be a pre-requisite for anything Raxxla-related.

One could alternatively conclude from Farseer's statement that either TDW in Shinrarta does operate with at the very least the tolerance of the "real" DW if it's not a part of it ... or that something fatal has happened to the "real" DW so that they're no longer able to do anything about it.
