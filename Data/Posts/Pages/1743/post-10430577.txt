If we assume for the sake of a decade-long thread that's got nowhere so far that this is Raxxla (or a signpost), what's the next part of the quest once it's been identified?

What if it is the view point that matters,

We are looking at the signal as the thing that is important, but what if the system you are looking at it from matters more that the signal itself.
You have the rough location, but what if the prospective matters, they said the systems form part of a diamond, but from what perspective.

Can the systems that make up the lines (maybe even some more that have so far been ignored) been seen from a prospective that then makes the diamond look more like a hexagon?
