@ Neestar - O7 not intentionally.

Combination of bad day in the office, speed typing (auto-correct) and a stream of consciousness.
ah ok, no worries! o7

The Odyssey license should let you access all three of Odyssey Live, Horizons Live and Horizons Legacy (though the latter will require an extra download).
ok i might've asked this before but i've forgotten: So how do i know which version i go into or have access to while i'm playing, like for example when i'm on the Galaxy Map picking stars to jump & such?

Is it all just seemless for me since i "own" both versions? Or is it like some onscreen prompt saying "you are about to enter EliteDangerous: HORIZONS phase" or whatever?

i also see one of my ingame friends-list players is showing up online as being listed within "ED: Legacy" or something. What does that mean exactly?

What coding would possibly require galaxy-level sound sources to be attached to a corner of a boxel? Why would anyone do it that way in the first place when the maths to locate a sound in space is exactly as easy - easier, since it doesn't have a superfluous rounding step! - when using full-resolution coordinates, and they have to be able to calculate the direction of out-of-system objects more precisely than "nearest boxel" anyway to stop the starbox looking very silly.
As a former QA & rudimentary 'coder' ( SWG ) , i tend to agree with you there ^ yep. However, something just occurred to me: Remember that aforementioned permit-locked planet 'LAVE 2' i stumbled upon ( without knowing it was commonplace) in my previous post earlier? Well, that planet is run by the..... 'Lave RADIO Network' . hmm.... coincidence?
