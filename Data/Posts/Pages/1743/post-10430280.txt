From what I remember it was confirmed that the SAP8 containers were supposed to help discovering the first Ancient ruin (Halsey's vissions were also part of the intended path to discovery).
That’s interesting, it would seem logical yes, but you mentioned confirmation, can that be identified at all please?

It’s evident from the crash trajectory, that it occurred in a very special location in the bubble. I suspect it represented a series of systems denoting the walls of the Empyrean and so forth, as far as I can recall not much came of it all officially so it would be great to hear more on that subject as I mapped it extensively and I don’t think it was an arbitrary event!

I agree I suspect it may have been part of an original Guardian narrative that like the missions, was axed following the triangulation miss-hap, and all of that was probably related, but it’s in a very close proximity to the bubble, and based on my projections likely was intended to highlight something up there…

Crash site and the Morrigan systems



The Morrigan systems and the bubble of storm systems (aka Chaos?)


I’m convinced everything is linked, but sometimes I do wonder if everything is not actually linked to Raxxla.

It’s evident parts of the narrative have occurred in specific locations of this cosmological model, which would make sense, so it may not point to Raxxla, but simply only establish the architecture exists!

“any writer of ustopias has to answer 3 necessary questions: where is it, when is it, and – in relation to maps – what shape is it? For unless we readers can believe in the ustopia as a potentially mappable place, we will not suspend our disbelief willingly.” (2004: 73)’ Margaret Atwood.

A bridge to the Empyrean?
