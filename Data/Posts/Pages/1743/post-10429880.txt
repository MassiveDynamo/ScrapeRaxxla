Didn't a Nostrum starport explode in Tau Ceti killing thousands?

From the Brewer Corporation codex entry:

While the Orbis proved popular in wealthier systems, questions were raised over the starport's price. Brewer was unmoved, however, asserting that the company's high safety standards and extensive testing process made their starports well worth the cost. This did not stop several competitors emerging in the wake of the Orbis's release, claiming they could build Brewer-quality stations at a fraction of the cost.

The Merritt Group was one such challenger, an industry newcomer with a background in planetary infrastructure. Launching the Nostrum, an industrial station sold as a low-cost alternative to the Orbis, president Caleb Ferrin bragged about the starport's technical specifications, claiming it would eliminate the need for exorbitantly-priced installations.

Ferrin's assertions were definitively answered in 3255, when a catastrophic structural failure in the main ring of a Nostrum starport in the Tau Ceti system killed over 100,000 people. Investigating the tragedy, industry officials attributed the incidents to "a lack of adequate safety planning" and repeated failures to correct a fatigue fracture.

Following a very public enquiry in which huge amounts of footage of the disaster was made available to the public, outrage over Merritt's negligence bolstered Brewer's reputation. Brewer called the incident a "tragic loss of life that could have been avoided with a better regard for safety". The Merritt Group closed its starport division in 3257, leaving Brewer as the sole name in large orbital infrastructure. Its prowess has not since been challenged.
