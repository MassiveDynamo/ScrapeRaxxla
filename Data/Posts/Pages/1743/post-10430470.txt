Much appreciated.
The depth of analysis from everyone involved seems to have ruled out all of the obvious places to find something in the neighbouring systems and it was clearly established that there was no point of origin accessible by players. Therefore, there are two possible explanations:

By design, it is a simple implementation of a locational audio source (sound design emphasising the vastness of the Milky Way from any location in the galaxy), OR
It is a clue for a mystery that, by design, does not require the player to find its source. -- or both 1 & 2.

If #2 is factually correct, then conclusions can be extrapolated about why it is not accessible:
It is only there to attract the attention of curious players - ie. a siren song.
We are supposed to find something else that gives context to why it is there, or a better way to 'enhance' what it is showing.
Despite the extensive searching, there is still something physical hidden in a nearby system that was not found yet.
There is also evidence that rules it out as a newer addition for the Odyssey or Beyond expansions.
The distinctive LS audio is clearly present in this video from February 2016. So until I can find some earlier video evidence, this shows the LS has been present "by design" since the early days of Horizons.

If the sound was present prior to Horizons, this could be an original feature of the game - potentially part of a planned mystery - Raxxla being one of many present at the time.
If the sound was introduced in Horizons, that could signify that there might be a landable planet involved.
