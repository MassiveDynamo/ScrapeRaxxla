"Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light."

Drew wonders if his interpretation is correct, and they are signalling: "Yes it is".

The greatest challenge in this game is making sense of what it is; a video game, an Elite remake, a space simulation, a strategy game, arcade space shooter, rpg tabletop computer software. You have to believe in some fantasy to keep going. There had been such history in such rpg's and elite novels and personal journeys and space-trading clones, they thought the context was obvious. All those old fansites for older games are like that. All this "science" stuff is way too serious. That's why they are calling us illiterate, not talking enough fantasy, and novels. Elite itself, much in there is recycled ideas and tradition, Brabens pride is the contribution to the genre in form of a game made out of this stuff, and they've been crazy. But then, Braben probably isn't lying when he says "it's there", something like Capitol or New Africa or Olgrea 7 C or what you have probably fits the criteria. Thus also Palimpsest. But this time they were not reptilians. People forget, die, and legends are born. The citation in the beginning is not relevant.
