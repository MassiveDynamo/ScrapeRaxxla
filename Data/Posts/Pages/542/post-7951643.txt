We should not be down hearted. Nothing has changed. Gan is very different to DW and R. For a start and probably most importantly he was ONLY in galnet and NOT in the Codex...
That's the disappointing thing. To find we've been fed so much fluff over the last five years via galnet, and what appeared to be a new strong storyline is just more fluff...
well, it's just too fluffy for words.
Must be dragon-related!
