At the time of the Eafots mystery, was first discovered/first mapped tagging bugged? From everything I've heard on this thread, I'm struggling to believe the amount of undiscovered goodies
There was no EAFOTS "mystery". The message was just to put us on the right track along the RR line towards the deep Rift and the Zurara. I wouldn't say EAFOTS is properly in the Rift... (Besides I'm still convinced that the "original" Rift position should have been one arm closer to the Bubble...)

EDIT: oops ! Ninja'ed by the psycho-penguin !
