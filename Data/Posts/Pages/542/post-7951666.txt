yes, I never understood that EAFOTS clue, it seemed to pull us back towards the bubble...WHY?

My take on that was that prior to the Tionisla clues, everything about the Rift had been out-of-game. Those clues were intended for people NOT aware of the Rift mystery, not for the 'old guard'. Hence everything just amounted to a big arrow saying "Over there".
