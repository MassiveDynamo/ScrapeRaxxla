First mapped = answered
Given the abandoned settlements in the eafots sector, that were tied to the club, I am struggling to believe how many undiscovered goodies I am finding. Was the first discovered tags bugged during the period of high activity in this sector?

No, they weren't bugged - there's just a LOT of systems in EAFOTS.
I'm guessing you were expecting it to be like the Bubble - most everything explored - but even when it was the focus of activity, there still weren't that many commanders in the area. Plus the Conflux and Hawking's Gap areas were drawing attention too.

Basically, space is big

Edit:
Also, since we disagree on everything, you'll no doubt be unsurprised to find that I never thought there was anything to find in EAFOTS beyond the bases (which we were spoonfed anyway).
