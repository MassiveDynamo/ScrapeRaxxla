Just a new experience really for this particular scenario. Some have tried to follow the Thargoids into witch space, but afaik no one has successfully made it.
Edit: Also Thargoids are a late addition to the game so reaching Raxxla using Thargs is unlikely.
Only unlikely if we are assuming Raxxla discoverable, rather than just existence from day 1. It's all still possible
