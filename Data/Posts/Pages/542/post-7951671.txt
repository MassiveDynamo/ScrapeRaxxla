In NGC 7822 checking out ("piercing") all the black holes. Thought I'd found an undocumented, unscannable planet - turns out to be the Iris Neb a couple kylies away! FD still haven't corrected the bug where distant nebulae show up unobscured (even highlighted) by closer nebulosity. (first seen during early FRifting visit to Soul Neb- thought I'd found a Dyson Sphere! lol)
Darn, it takes a long time to travel 300kls in each system to check this hypothesis!

Maybe you need to find a system with two BHs, then line them up and 'pierce' them both

Be grateful they fixed the bug with nebulae disappearing altogether.
