There was no EAFOTS "mystery". The message was just to put us on the right track along the RR line towards the deep Rift and the Zurara. I wouldn't say EAFOTS is properly in the Rift... (Besides I'm still convinced that the "original" Rift should have been one arm closer to the Bubble...)

EDIT: oops ! Ninja'ed by the psycho-penguin !
Yeah I'm sorry, I was being lazy. Let me try again....
First mapped = answered
Given the abandoned settlements in the eafots sector, that were tied to the club, I am struggling to believe how many undiscovered goodies I am finding. Was the first discovered tags bugged during the period of high activity in this sector?
