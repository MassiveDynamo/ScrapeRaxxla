Look, I think they talk "siren" saying "super-nova". Cefeids?
So "siren of deepest void" gets sence - some super nova from far away?
So if we speak about SN Ia ...which is standard - then it must be white dwarf + giant or another wd and close enough each other. Also it sems it should be DZ exactly. because Ia does not have hellium/hydrogen lines and have methals.

And there is single 1 candidat which fits in 250ly around "12 Virginis" (don't ask, i just logged out there )

This one can explode as SN Ia pereodically.

And this one less visited: https://www.edsm.net/en/system/bodies/id/49467/name/HIP+84876
