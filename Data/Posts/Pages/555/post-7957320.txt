I think I'm gonna stop looking. If they actually did want us to find it they wouldn't be silent ASF about it entirely. There would be clues. If it is in game it's probably all glitched out and not supported by ps4 anyways. This is a sad day.
I do hope you change your mind fella. I enjoy this thread as much as I enjoy hunting Raxxla and its contributions from yourself, the OP, Jorki, Scytale, the Penguin, thatch, jiatu, 6, sim, han zen, yelloc and all the other regular contributors that make it what it is. Arguments and banter are part of the fun. Would be a shame to loose any dedicated hunters.
