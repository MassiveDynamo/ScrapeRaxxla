I'm not at all inferring that they should just come out and give us hints weekly or even monthly. but there should be discoverable in game clues that you know what you found when you find it. I'm not even saying they should be easy clues, far from it. but it should be obvious what they are clues for.

we all keep going back and forth with stuff that turns out it was to do with the formadine rift or galnet fluff. We all talk about clues, then argue that there are none. It can't be both

Im starting to think this whole thing is a ploy to keep us mystery hunters fromgoing to play other games.
