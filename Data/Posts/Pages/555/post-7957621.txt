There are a couple small stars that could be it at an angle from Minelauva.

There is a lack of names, but why can't it be one of the unnamed stars?

I would say, take those pics and put some lines between stars that would cross over or near it. You could probably find which one it is.

Edit: You are right. It appears it doesn't exist. Does it move enough that maybe the date of the astrology tool doesn't have it in the same place? I've seen some where you can set them to future dates like 3305. That picture is set to our current time by the looks of it. Maybe fast forwards to 3305 and see if it's there.

Edit2: I think it may be the star I circled. But it may have moved over time as the game is 3305 and not 2019. The circled star is slightly up and to the left in the first picture. The star I circled also doesn't exist in the ED pic. I assume it's the culprit.

The FTS.doc is a picture of this.
