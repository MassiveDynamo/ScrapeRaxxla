How can you name an unknown star in the ED skybox ?
You need to select stars on the galaxy map and see if it is selected on the skybox.

Look, i have identified all stars around Shoujeman. It really does not exist on the sky in reality. The only question is if it is FD mistake or they have added it by purpose.
