It's all about bums on seats...
Playing the game, buying ships and buying things for ships on the store, ofc.

Maybe FDev have learned from one or two apparent 'mistakes' as the project unfolded and they've decided to remove the means of finding Raxxla from the game, temporarily. Maybe they're being reworked to cope with the anons cracking their puzzles too quick, and broken up into annual stages?

Has anyone consulted the Oracle of Delphi? Could name changes contain clues?

I'm not at all inferring that they should just come out and give us hints weekly or even monthly. but there should be discoverable in game clues that you know what you found when you find it. I'm not even saying they should be easy clues, far from it. but it should be obvious what they are clues for.

we all keep going back and forth with stuff that turns out it was to do with the formadine rift or galnet fluff. We all talk about clues, then argue that there are none. It can't be both

Im starting to think this whole thing is a ploy to keep us mystery hunters fromgoing to play other games.
