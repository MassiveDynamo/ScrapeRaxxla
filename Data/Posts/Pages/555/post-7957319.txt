I have suspended disbelief on many investigations. And yes, my hypothesis is supported with available evidence as presented.

You wrote, The thing to do is see if it gives you any predictions that you can then test?

This is exactly what I have done. I keep waiting for your rhetoric to help in any manner. I presented the evidence and hypothesis. Perhaps we could get into some philosopher quotes over private messages and spare this channel used for Raxxla related ideas and not semantic debate.

I was encouraging you to follow your own beliefs. You believe you have a workable hypothesis, with supporting evidence and it can produce predictions. I donâ€™t share your belief, but that is immaterial. Discussion in this thread helps to point out strengths and weaknesses.
I was encouraging you to go check out those predictions for yourself. If that produces positive results then your hypothesis is strengthened, if negative it is weakened.
