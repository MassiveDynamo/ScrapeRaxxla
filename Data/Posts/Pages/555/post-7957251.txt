I think I'm gonna stop looking. If they actually did want us to find it they wouldn't be silent ASF about it entirely. There would be clues. If it is in game it's probably all glitched out and not supported by ps4 anyways. This is a sad day.

There's a line between 'want us to find it' and 'spoonfeeding the information' and I'd prefer FDev to continue to be silent, rather than give us a clue which we solve in a week. It's not like there's another mystery we can move on to.

Also, they can want us to find it, but also want us to earn it.

I agree that it's probably bugged though
