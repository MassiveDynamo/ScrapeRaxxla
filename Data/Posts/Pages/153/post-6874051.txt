So we're looking for a system with two gas giants orbiting the main star, possibly white dwarf/nutron? And raxxla is the outermost of 3 planets is the system. Think we can all agree on that?

If it needs mentioning, I'm cocooned is a tin foil burrito.

Ps, does Braben play the guitar can anyone confirm?

This is the origanal image I saw where the dails reminded me of gas planets.

That was quite a tangent, until you followed up with the pic!

I do believe that has been shared here before. I have no idea about it, but do wonder if it was named by a fan of the original game/TDW novella?

If we follow the line of thinking though (tin-foil hat on), would 'IN' and 'OUT' represent the portal? [big grin]
