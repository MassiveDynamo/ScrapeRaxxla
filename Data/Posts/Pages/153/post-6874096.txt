Also a question for anyone: I'm curious if the Soontill Relics have any reaction with the Thargoid starmap inside one of the ground sites.

No reactions from Thargoid ships to Soontill Relics either IIRC.

Not much we can read into it though IMHO as it’s very possible from descriptions that the Thargoids wouldn’t recognise them, even if they were of Thargoid heritage.

Always worth re-testing this stuff though, as it could always be an oversight.
