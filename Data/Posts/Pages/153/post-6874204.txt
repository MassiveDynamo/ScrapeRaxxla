I bet there will be a horde of new hunters after that colourful description.

I actually took the commander name Han Zen, because thatâ€™s what every east asian I ever worked with called me.

My RL last name is Hansen. The east asian version sounds much more space like.

Han was apparently a skilled pilot in a galaxy far away. It is of course also an Imperial name used by the royal family in Elite.

A galaxy far away you say? *Han Zen confirmed Raxxla finder!*
