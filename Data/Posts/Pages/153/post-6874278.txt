I don't know who designed that guitar effects pedal, but he seems to know pretty well the Raxxla lore. The 'inside' of the planet showing that network connecting different stars starting from the central main button: Door that is also the key? It is full of stars -like ? Dark system or BRIGHT main star ?
Anyone for asking Shift-Line Co what is this about ?
