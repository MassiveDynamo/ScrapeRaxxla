That was quite a tangent, until you followed up with the pic!

I do believe that has been shared here before. I have no idea about it, but do wonder if it was named by a fan of the original game/TDW novella?

If we follow the line of thinking though (tin-foil hat on), would 'IN' and 'OUT' represent the portal? [big grin]

Ooooh, dimensions! Coordinates! Lines In & Out! Mk2!....... excuse me, but I could be gone a while. This hole seems to be deeper than I thougggggggghhhh.........
