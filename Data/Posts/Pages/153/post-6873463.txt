Found Raxxla system



So we're looking for a system with two gas giants orbiting the main star, possibly white dwarf/nutron? And raxxla is the outermost of 3 planets is the system. Think we can all agree on that?

If it needs mentioning, I'm cocooned is a tin foil burrito.

Ps, does Braben play the guitar can anyone confirm?
