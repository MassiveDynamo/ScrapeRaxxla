Door that is also the key.

Key....musical? We do know how much FDev like sound based clues...

Random brain blast... KGBFOAM contains 4 musical 'keys' (A, B, F and G). Could it be related to star types in some way? Or is this just rabbit-holing on account of a tenuous connection to a musical FX pedal?
