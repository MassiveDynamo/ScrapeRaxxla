Yes, we’ve always operated on the principle that what happens in Alpha stays in Alpha and isn’t discussed here. The reason is that Alpha is all about bug testing, and the context is intentionally divorced from the main game, so anything found in Alpha is likely to be misleading if not outright false. FD are usually careful to avoid leaking hints in Alpha to in-game mysteries, but conceivably they might slip up on that. But it would be a bit harsh if anything found in Alpha is relevant to Raxxla or TDW since it is an optional extra while Raxxla has supposedly been in-game (and therefore should have been discoverable) by anyone without Horizons or Odyssey.
I'm not telling no one. Everyone else in Elite Dangerous has a secret, now I have one also. Two actually. Possibly three or more.
