Or someone here to summarise!

But thanks for that thread link, will read later! Yes, clearly the nav info is in code

Ya haven't been looking at the codes myself yet either - these things always progress at a snails pace until boom rush rush rush to keep up
I think I know the general area its heading though - That "galactic equator line" from the codex map runs along the divider between the inner orion spur and the sagineous rim - just off the edge of Barnards Loop- it crosses that meridian. Im starting to think this whole thing (raxxla included) is a reference to the "Age of Discovery"
