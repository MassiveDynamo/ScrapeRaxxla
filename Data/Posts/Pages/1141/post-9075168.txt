If you think 'Yes' is deliberately vague I have no reply.

If instead you are accusing Arthur of bare faced lying in his verbal reply then I give up. Tinfoil is fine but that crosses the line for me.
I wasn't talking about anyone in particular. Most of the puzzles seem to require connecting dots with pieces of seemingly disconnected details. Just lots of the game's puzzles seem to require a reading between the lines of what is meant (from the codexes, making sense of the history, connecting dots with generation ships, and deducing which groups are behind are events. I was in no way referring to any individual just the typical nature of the clues. I don't even know what you are talking about in terms of Arthur. I assume you think I was talking about Arthur Tolmie on the one of the livestreams. I don't engage in tinfoil-hattery and I don't bad mouth people. I was more referencing the way details are hidden like on the generation ship (and how date stamps are done). I have zero problems with the community managers. In fact, I wasn't saying this is a bad thing. It makes the puzzles in the game interesting to decipher. Also, to add to this: I haven been working during the day and rarely see the livestreams. I never saw Tolmie's reply so if you could enlighten me that would be appreciated. But my comment was actually a praise of the puzzles and not an attack on anyone. I just reply on the forums between technical support calls and on the Elite Dangerous discord channels.
