They shouldn’t have said she was heading for a secret base

Where did they say that?

who’s overseeing these bits of storyline? Have they never heard of continuity? Lore? Consistency?

No, apparently not, not if you read the current GalNet set anyway, theres lots of discrepancies and missing info. I put it down to human error or overexcitement when writing the story.

eg a while ago I got an answer from the CMs in the Q&A that the earlier date of the 2 we had at the time was the correct first contact with Thargs. Then not long after we got Adamastor which was later and a 3rd date an is now stated in GalNet to be the first contact.....ho hum. Just go with it sometimes is the best way.
