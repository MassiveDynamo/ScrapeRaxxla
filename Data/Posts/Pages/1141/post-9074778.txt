Where did they say that?



No, apparently not, not if you read the current GalNet set anyway, theres lots of discrepancies and missing info. I put it down to human error or overexcitement when writing the story.

eg a while ago I got an answer from the CMs in the Q&A that the earlier date of the 2 we had at the time was the correct first contact with Thargs. Then not long after we got Adamastor which was later and a 3rd date an is now stated in GalNet to be the first contact.....ho hum. Just go with it sometimes is the best way.

Remember the days when the Executive Producer did the lore, and was on the forums, and even answered questions from time to time? Oh those were the days.
