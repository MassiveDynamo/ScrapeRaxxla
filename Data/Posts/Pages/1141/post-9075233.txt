Its coz you quoted my post below and replied saying 'Deliberately vague is the FDev way' and 'you have to learn to read what they are giving subtle hints about' to this conversation where Arthur gave a definite answer about the Hesperus mystery so forgive my confusion. You joined in the middle of the conversation so probably missed the context or the earlier bits. No worries.

In one of the LS after all 3 sites were found outside Chukchan (but LP was still not working at the time) someone asked 'Have we found everything?' also with reference to the ongoing direction from the stones site and dog-leg back to Chukchan, Arthur replied 'Yes'

I agree about the Codex etc being deliberately vague and obfuscating and why and love it too. After all if it said Raxxla is in XYZ system what kind of game would that be?

FWIW I think the GalNet mysteries, LPs et al are there to be solved and keep us occupied in a similar fashion because they dont want us to find Raxxla or DW station...or not yet anyway and dont want us to get fed up. And thats fine by me as well. Its only when they stopped GalNet and seemed to throw it all out the window I got sour.

Its just me I think lol but thank you all for your consideration, it is appreciated (I've had to give up lots of threads, LS, some YT and even current LaveRadio for now)
