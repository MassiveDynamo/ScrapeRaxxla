Before my time Im afraid, but I get the impression we used to have one Dungeon Master who oversaw everything and knew every detail and what had been said* and now we dont so can see why people are disappointed and get angry. I never had it so just accept the mistakes or inconsistencies as [redacted] annoying and try and work through them as best I can and just glad we have a story at all after last Summer when I feared it was gone forever. Love the new story though so can forgive and forget.

*Still didnt stop them retconning stuff though, apparently even stuff in the authorised novels that were supposed to set the scene for ED specifically. Cest la vie.
I was sort of being ironic as even before the retconning there were similar issues and bugs with mysteries (Unknown Artefact not drawing one specific ship type, grr, I'm not bitter), but having one person who knew the old games and lore and actively involved with writing the new stuff and helping to clarify things when they came up certainly helped.
