Before my time Im afraid, but I get the impression we used to have one Dungeon Master who oversaw everything and knew every detail and what had been said* and now we dont so can see why people are disappointed and get angry. I never had it so just accept the mistakes or inconsistencies as [redacted] annoying and try and work through them as best I can and just glad we have a story at all after last Summer when I feared it was gone forever. Love the new story though so can forgive and forget.

*Still didnt stop them retconning stuff though, apparently even stuff in the authorised novels that were supposed to set the scene for ED specifically. Cest la vie.
