Well theres all the INRA ones and the Adamastor was certainly in the right ballpark for those but waiting for @Jorki Rasalas to source the reference to another one the Adamastor was heading to from the Nebula before I go looking along their route...again. I spent 3 days looking the first time just in case but didn't realise we had any info from Frontier saying there was one or Id have kept looking. And when Arthur said we had found everything I gave up and went back to LPs in the region and followed them around the bubble outskirts all the way round towards WHN.
