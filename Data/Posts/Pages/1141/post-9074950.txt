Ask on Reddit or Discord for an answer now, as the official Frontier Elite forum doesn't exist most of the time for Frontier staff (I'm not bitter either lol and I never look at the PlanetZoo and other official Frontier forums and sigh either, no siree not me, not one bit)
On certain player groups' Discord at least... not mentioning any names. ;-)
