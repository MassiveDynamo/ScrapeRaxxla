So, I know folks don't want any Alpha stuff here, so I won't post what I just came across in Alpha 2, even in a spoiler. Relatively minor, but potential implications for Raxxla hunting and other things. It may also be a bug or a work in progress possibly, or obfuscation on the part of the devs for Alpha. So I'll try to keep my mouth shut until launch.

Instead I'll just tease you all. ;-)
