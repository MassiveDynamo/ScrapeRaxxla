In one of the LS after all 3 sites were found outside Chukchan (but LP was still not working at the time) someone asked 'Have we found everything?' also with reference to the ongoing direction from the stones site and dog-leg back to Chukchan, Arthur replied 'Yes'

So Bloop direction and 370LY range was purely a plot device to put us in the right area, combined with Star type and just to be sure the 2 systems on the way for the right line to follow., remember they wanted that one solved quickly for Halloween so gave us all the info. The LP is 365 LY and almost a direct line with the 2 named systems and when working the LP showed us the correct new direction for the next bit (but we misread a wrap-around at end of sentence as a space or similar, or it was incorrectly formatted). It was just found out of order due to 'The stones' binary message naming the nebula so we went there first. The circle is complete

Deliberately vague (obfuscating lol) above to avoid spoilers for future readers but hope you know where and which sites I mean
