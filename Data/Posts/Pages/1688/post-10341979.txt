Yes, weve discussed that before, but "Julia" doesnt feel to me like a clue in the his context.

On the other hand we have both the novel's "book about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon” and the Codex's "the children's story Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars"....seems one or both of these is a clue but there are obvious differences between the two. I'm pondering whether the two need to be reconciled to actually generate the real clue. The two phrases appear to be a dichotomy but may be a single clue "for those with eyes to see"

Perhaps it was a "Prince" Astrophel? (googling suggests Astrophel is a boy's name)

Maybe "Astrophel" means astronomer? possibly with royal connections?...Tycho Brahe was "a member of a Danish noble family, but it was not mere lineage that gave Tycho his lasting image. He practised astronomy in a princely manner and on a grand scale."

Or "Princess Astrophel" might mean wife/sister/daughter of an aristocratic astronomer...Sophie/Sophia Thot Lange (née Brahe), Tycho's sister, "was a Danish noblewoman and horticulturalist with knowledge of astronomy, chemistry, and medicine."

Also Astrophel can mean "an unidentified plant, commonly believed to be akin to an aster"

Perhaps "Spiralling Stars" & "alien dragon" are linked/substitution?? Draco constellation??

Need more coffee!!! I feel as though I'm missing something here!

Yes - this is old ground, we’ve been here previously. I do likewise agree the two are somehow intertwined.
