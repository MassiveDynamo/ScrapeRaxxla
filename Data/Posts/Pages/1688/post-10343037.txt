Player-named, and not founded until July 3303, so definitely not related.

Its my understanding that “Carcosa” wasnt player named and the “Nameless” isnt a player group. Is that so? I know you put some effort into cataloging Colonia.

@Rochester It could fall into the “tribute” type of system as well - also a fictional lost world, though is not in the bubble. But of course it was related to Lovecraft and earlier authors… and the Yellow King….
