Probably because Sidney coined the word first, and his other works were very visually explorative utilising utopian concepts similar in theme to those in other influences in game, especially the Odyssey; or more likely there’s nothing more exciting than the allure of an obscure link.

Swinburne and others didn’t coin the name, Sidney did, and Swinburne’s text itself is a reference to and is about Sidney. Hard to know where to draw the line.

We all are also utilising the internet to cross-check our ageing memories - not the game…

The algorithm only shows information which scores highest in searches, and information that’s actually uploaded to the net….

Theres a likelihood there’s a real book, written by an Ethel Moonshot from Dorchester, but the only copy is in the Cambridge library…

I suspect a lot of the Codex is allegorical, some of it literal but ultimately is identifying spatial locations….but I also think the Codex author/s mixed their references…

It’s certainly a keystone to this mystery… and presumably we’re overthinking it all.
