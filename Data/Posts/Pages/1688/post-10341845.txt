Mmm, been thinking about clues. MB clearly left us a few!
MB's Legacy novel: As a girl heroine Julia Cavus grew up without toys with a single possession, a book “about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon” locked alone each day in the tiny family cell while her parents slaved in the mines. Julia as a girl “dreamed of being the first pilot to discover Raxxla”...She hoped to keep her Eagle as she’d grown accustomed to its idiosyncrasies...”whether it was a suitable ship for travelling all the way to Alliance space was another matter"

So: the toast guides us to Sol /Li Qing Jao station, which has gardens that point to Milton's cosmology; he told us Raxxla is in Alliance space, which matches the locale from @Rochester 's theory on Milton's cosmology as implemented in-game.

SO we have the novel's "book about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon” and the Codex's "the children's story Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars"
..are these two parts of a single clue?
