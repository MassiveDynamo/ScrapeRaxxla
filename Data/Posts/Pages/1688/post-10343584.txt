Myself and few others have verified that this is not just a graphical issue, or if it is, it can be repeated by anyone, even in Horizons.

These shots were taken from one of the stars in Orion's Belt, Mintaka.
So, what are we looking at and how is it achieved?

This "door" or whatever ya wanna call it is found hidden in the Horsehead Dark Nebula, which is basically as close to Barnard's Loop and it's permit lock as you can get.

So how?
Step 1. Supercruise to the black hole in Mintaka and get as close as it will allow (til SC drop). Now center the black hole directly over Horsehead Dark Nebula, as close to center as possible.
Step 2. Now, flip your ship 180 degrees and fly away (in normal flight, not Supercruise) from the black hole while maintaining its alignment over Horsehead Dark Nebula as much as possible. Maintain this alignment during the entirety of all three steps.
Step 3. At a certain distance, a few minutes of flight time flying away from the black hole (in normal flight, not supercruise), when you strafe your ship left or right, this door/panel will appear.
