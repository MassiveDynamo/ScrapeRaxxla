And LP could be new clues to old content! Or at least some of them...

You are correct that we just dont know what is relevant. But Yelboc is also correct in that we have had years of multiplying possibilities. We just need to find Raxxla, then we’ll know what “clues” were valid (if any) and which were red herrings! Until then it’s all an open book (not Astrophel!)
