I think I've said, the last document I wrote explained the progression between 2b drives and Stardreamer to current drives.

It was sent to Michael Brookes. I'm not sure it went much further. I could try and resend it to Frontier? That might help reconcile the analysis.
I would absolutely love to know more about that and I imagine there's a ton of people would too! I've no idea if Fdev would feel the same lol.

In terms of the "quest for Raxxla" though, I think info on the early history of space-travel and early FTL would actually be some of the most useful information we could get hold of.

Hell, I'd pay full-game price for an expansion where you got to uncover archaeological secrets of ancient human spaceflight in dusty crash sites, pulling data from ancient data cores and ancient abandoned settlements and stations. After all, early FTL/exploration days were as far away from 3300 as we are from the early middle ages, and I do love me some archeological diggin' It's actually weird that there isn't more old stuff kicking around.
