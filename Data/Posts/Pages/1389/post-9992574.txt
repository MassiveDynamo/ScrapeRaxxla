Loving the reference to the coin, had seen this previously but discarded it out of complacency. The for in a circle is now I think of it in this context more likely to relate directly to the Omphalos. It's a description that pops up regularly and as you clearly pointed out - referenced by the coin. That could be very helpful...
Another abstract reinterpretation of the Raxxla logo:

Central dot and circle = Omphalos,
The 3 encircling lines = a tripod, of the Oracle…the rest erm…
