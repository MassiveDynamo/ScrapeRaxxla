Great podcast the other day @Allen Stroud, I agree with everything brought up, call it semantics or irony, but at 02:19:44 we hear the team ask the question (verbatim) - ‘Does anyone think that, FD should actually put Raxxla in game?’ - some responded no, Allen provides his ingenious player run DW idea across again.

I take it this inferred the Lave Radio team believes it’s ‘not’ in game?

We know historically M Brookes and D Braben said it was, but what would inform the Lave team to have such an opinion that Raxxla was not currently in game?
Nothing informs the team that Raxxla is not in game. Ben just framed the question as he framed it. There's no hidden knowledge behind the way the question was phrased. I think John and Alec were commenting from the perspective of being long time players and it not being revealed.
