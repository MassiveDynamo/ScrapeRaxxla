FSD technology is a horribly messy affair in so far as the lore goes. One question to get people thinking:

If Lave is settled by Deep Space Colonial Cruisers Hershel and Oberon per the "History of Lave" in 2412 does that not imply either that Quirium had been used prior or there was another fuel type possibly? I mean it is hard to colonize a system with no fuel.

Note: Per "Galactic News: Hyperspace" the Faraway system comes 400 or so years after Lave is settled in the 2800s. Pilots' Federation is founded the same century (believe that is 2805).
