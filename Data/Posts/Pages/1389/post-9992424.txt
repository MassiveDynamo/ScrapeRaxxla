Yes, but presumably this was done from an account where you have are least one Elite. The test would do realistic view on an account with no Elite ranks and see if it shows up.
Nope sorry, I used my PS4 account which has no progression on any career, no permit unlocks nor engineering, itâ€™s pure noob vanilla account I used for testing base mechanisms. No elite status.
