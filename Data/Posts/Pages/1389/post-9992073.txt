Great podcast the other day @Allen Stroud, I agree with everything brought up, call it semantics or irony, but at 02:19:44 we hear the team ask the question (verbatim) - ‘Does anyone think that, FD should actually put Raxxla in game?’ - some responded no, Allen provides his ingenious player run DW idea across again.

I take it this inferred the Lave Radio team believes it’s ‘not’ in game?

We know historically M Brookes and D Braben said it was, but what would inform the Lave team to have such an opinion that Raxxla was not currently in game?

But yes a great show as always. I do think it’s necessary to have clear instructions for a product, either way I prefer ‘no instructions’ because then it’s really interesting, but FD did drop some clues indicating certain content was in game, however since we know FD removed the DW missions, a potential story (as confirmed by FD) linked we think to Raxxla, that leaves the game open to contradiction, especially when FD never told us what they did. Generating dead ends.

I presume the codex is FD’s method of communicating this indirectly, but if they changed something - did they actually replace it with something else?

Was the original DW just s series of storylines taking you into another narrative wall, as is FD modus operandi, or did it lead to an actual objective, or is that just a projection of the community!

My goal is simply to assess if it’s narratively locked or not, simply because if so there truly is no reason to look, because you have to wait for FD to unlock it, but you also run the danger of FD altering the narrative because you jumped several chapters otherwise it’s too much like tipping at windmills.
