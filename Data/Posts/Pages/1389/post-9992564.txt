I answered a distress call (or maybe it was a combat aftermath?) the other day. Got a mission to collect a black box, which would be automatically decrypted and the contents sent to the mission giver. They were, and then 6 local mafia ships appeared and tried to kill me. Seems like a good basis for something significant to happen, but it didn't
