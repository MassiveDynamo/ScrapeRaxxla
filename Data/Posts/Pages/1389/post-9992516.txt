Dredges suggest that there were contemporary alternatives to Quirium drives.

Reading between the lines, Quirium was just faster and better, and so retained monopoly, but other forms existed... unlike post-3300 apparently! I think any more detail depends on whether you accept stuff like the RPG and novels into your lore reading.
