Not really. We're trying to find significant correlation between a large number of different "clues" each of which could have different meanings - but presumably only one configuration is correct.

Just like doing real history research, you don't find one document and build a thesis around it, you look for corroboration, and also things that dont fit, as you try different arrangements of ideas and facts to build something that's a "best fit" given what you have to work with.

Highlighting specific things here to each other is a way of doing just that, it's saying, "hey there's a few things here that seem significant, let's investigate".

If you disagree that something is relevant, or want to suggest new ideas, that's what it's all about

Unfortunately, I think you will find that all installation names are procedural. So there can be no significance in any of them - they are just mechanically picked from a set of three dictionaries based on the system ID, and their position.

Add that to the fact that they were a late addition to the game, certainly post dating the origin of the 'its in the milky way' comments by some years, and I think you are on very shaky ground.

The risk is one of drawing connections that are irrelevant and multiplying the possibilities, leading to numerous rabbit holes. After so many years of multiplying hypotheses, whats needed is some reductionist thinking to narrow the possibilities.
