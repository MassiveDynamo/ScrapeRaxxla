A nice series of episodes, some good writing and voice acting, nice to find these things. I do appreciate the work by FD to put some narrative back into the game.

However effectively these like prior narratives are just part of a drawn out drip fed, episodic, community treasure-hunt narrative, there’s no real additional gameplay nor optional content unless your collectively involved. You can simply wait it out and read it on the Forums.

There is no way of actually ‘solving’ that particular story, eg to make and then test assessments, not until the chapters are released and inserted by FD, who have confirmed that’s how they release such content - you could be sat in that system 2 days prior and see nothing, until FD flip that switch, in that respect it’s not actually a ‘mystery’ more like an episodic cliff-hanger….which could go anywhere.

I’m not gripping, just somewhat disappointed FD are reliant on such methods to engage players rather than developing more complex in game mission / npc algorithms, it’s a little lazy and more about PR and galvanising a community, it’s short lived and reliant on FD putting in the effort episodically over a protracted time; I’d rather they work on the original concepts they proposed at kickstarter, that sounded like a fun, engaging game!

The Future? “It’s on the list….”
