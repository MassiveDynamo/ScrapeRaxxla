Sorry that was an incomplete post. I just wanted to note the similarities between the artistic design of her in this image and the dark wheels logo.

Also would like to submit the goddess EOS for examination in relations to the mysteries of raxxla. They're are numerous connections I believe in be mythology.
On your post it's definitly Isis (from ancient egypt).
Eos is from greek mythology and despite you can find some similiratires between old cultures, they are not the same person.
