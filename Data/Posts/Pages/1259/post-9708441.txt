A nice series of episodes, some good writing and voice acting, nice to find these things.

However effectively these are just part of a drawn out drip fed narrative, there’s no real additional gameplay nor optional content unless your collectively involved. You can simply wait it out and read it on the Forums.

There is no way of actually ‘solving’ that particular story, eg to make and then test assessments, not until the chapters are released and inserted by FD, who have confirmed that’s how they release such content - you could be sat in that system 2 days prior and see nothing, until FD flip that switch, in that respect it’s not actually a ‘mystery’ more like an episodic cliff-hanger….which could go anywhere.

I’m not gripping, just somewhat disappointed FD are reliant on such methods to engage players rather than developing more complex in game mission algorithms, it’s a little lazy and more about PR and galvanising a community, it’s short lived and reliant on FD putting in the effort; I’d rather they work on the original concepts they proposed at kickstarter, that sounded like a fun game!


What’s going to happen next? Tune in next week kids to find out!

Drip fed entertainment... I guess this is Arthur’s influence, cos there was bug*** all before these “storylines” started to happen. Well, at least nothing since the Unknown Artefacts (aka Thargoid Sensors) started to appear. I occasionally wonder if this is why MB left; as an author he must have been appalled at the way the narrative is handled.

Edit: and I see Chancellor Blaine is saying the Empress will return to public life soon; so TDW have grown another clone?
