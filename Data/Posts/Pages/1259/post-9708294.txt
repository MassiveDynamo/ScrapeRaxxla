Apparently the Alexandria has been found, at least wreckage and associated logs. Thought it would be on Galnet yesterday. Apparently if you were involved in Ram Tahâ€™s investigation you received a message and had to find some signals near a named system. There was a thread about it yesterday https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...have-been-seen-near-wregoe-sc-x-b29-2.597740/
