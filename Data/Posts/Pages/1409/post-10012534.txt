FD confirmed the DW just removed. They didn’t specify they’re relevance to Raxxla or anything else only that they were ’removed’. I know sorry, because I was the one who obtained that information from FD - data is in this thread.

FD likewise confirmed the Trinkets were linked to the missions, again FD reiterated now removed (no reason given nor context) expect the Trinkets were linked to that ‘story’, but left in situ as at most a ‘curiosity’; FD then stated it ‘maybe’ turned back on again in the future.

So DW / Trinkets mission not confirmed linked sorry.

The link is attributed contextually because in the mission texts it utilises descriptions used in the Holdstock novel to describe Raxxla.

There were another 2 aspects linking it to John Milton -IMO; the silent song of the spheres, the outer rim, there were also various phrasings of the text which sound like they were written by a fan of Milton.

So no no direct references to Raxxla. But no definitive confirmation they were not.
