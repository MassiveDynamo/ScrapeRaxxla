@Virtual Yoda: the long-removed E/F missions were counter-DW! The mission giver was Pilots Federation and were against TDW ships-read the mission descriptions that Macros has on the OP. Iâ€™ve not seen anything similar since their removal.
That was my point mate, to look for other against missions. maybe we were always meant to counter and destroy them. so to speak.

Occams Razor in this ca is, as we've been discussing these last few days, that we do have all the clues we're going to get at this stage, we're just not reading them correctly yet.

Yep, and ofc we keep combining TDW and Raxxla issues lol, maybe they are linked, or maybe were just making it harder
