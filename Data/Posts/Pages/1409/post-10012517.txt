IF you want to test the potentially false Dark Wheel in Shinraz, we should help the opposing factions and make it small enough for the Real DW to take out.
Easier said than done, I know especially with its location.
I've been thinking that exact thing!!

See there's been this big movement for years by a group that have been trying to expand the Shinrarta Dark Wheel to other systems. But I've been thinking about what Felicity said, and I've been thinking about the idea that the Real Dark Wheel tests people covertly....

Codex: "It is futile to attempt to contact the Dark Wheel on one's own initiative, however - it is always they who initiate contact, initially in disguise, revealing their true identity only once a suitable test of courage and skill has been discreetly administered, and passed."

What if the 'test' (or part of it) is to take out the imposters, not help them.
