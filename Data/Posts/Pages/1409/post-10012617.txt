The question still stands. How do we reconcile the fact that Felicity clearly says she knows the Dark Wheel shut down imitators, and yet most people here seem to agree that the Shinrarta Dark Wheel (SDW) are imitators, and yet haven't been shut down.

Assume that's deliberate (because the codex was released after SDW grew), and therefore, surely, this is actually a pretty massive hint at something, right?
