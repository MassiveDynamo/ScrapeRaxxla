I did ask fo confirmation that it had been recently accessibility tested for both, but don't honestly expect an answer

Sunya, so sorry for the delay. Are you still having issues? Nah, most of my friends likewise had to wait 10+ minutes for it to begin tracking the install progress. On console and on Steam it all went fine for everyone I know, just the frontier launcher experiencing this delay.

Trouble is, a lot of changes have been made to the game since the Gamma...a lot errors have been corrected, but a lot of errors have crept in!!
