You cannot quietly shutdown a multisystem faction, so maybe that's why they are still there.
They are that now - but in 3300 they were only in Shinrarta as a very small minor faction.

They only reason they are as big as they are now is that many people (myself included) allied with them and did crap tons of missions for them, and as I said, there's a group who have been actively working for years to spread the Shinrarta Dark Wheel to other systems.
