@Virtual Yoda: the long-removed E/F missions were counter-DW! The mission giver was Pilots Federation and were against TDW ships-read the mission descriptions that Macros has on the OP. I’ve not seen anything similar since their removal.
Exactly my point. I really freaking wish you weren't ignoring me.

....and you can also investigate the “comms installation” named Josie Rosa orbiting the planet also named “Josie Rosa” there.

Yea I mean I would agree, could well just be lazy story from F Dev,
If it is the real DW and we have been growing it for 8 years and all that has happened is 6 "now deleted" missions - I say poor show lol
I really don't think they'd have gone to the effort of inserting the DW and Raxxla Codex entries if they were nothing. They could more easily and "lazily" have simply not put them in. I think we need to put to bed the idea that Fdev 'did it bad' and assume that these are clues we're meant to consider.

Occams Razor in this case is, as we've been discussing these last few days, that we do have all the clues we're going to get at this stage, we're just not reading them correctly yet.
