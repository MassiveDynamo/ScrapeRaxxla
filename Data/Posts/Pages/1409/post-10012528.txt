This is from the DW codex, of course Felicity is pretty dang certain that the Real Dark Wheel takes out imitators quickly "Doesn't happen, does it? Not for long, anyway.". Yet at the time of the Codex (3304) the Shinrarta Dark Wheel has been operating with impunity for 4 years, and has been for another 4 years since.

What do we make of this?
It also contradicts other parts of the codex.

"Those who believe in the existence of the Dark Wheel consider it to be a continuous and
clandestine organisation, operating since the very earliest days of interstellar travel.
According to the lore, only a handful of the bravest and most competent pilots of each
generation are honoured with an invitation to join the group. It is futile to attempt to
contact the Dark Wheel on one's own initiative, however - it is always they who initiate
contact, initially in disguise, revealing their true identity only once a suitable test of
courage and skill has been discreetly administered, and passed."


If the Shinraz group is real half the codex can be deleted.
