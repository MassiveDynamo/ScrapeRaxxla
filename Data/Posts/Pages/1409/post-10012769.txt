@Virtual Yoda I'm up for doing anti Shinrarta Dark Wheel (SDW) missions...though may have to take a backseat to fighting Thargoids.

I'm a total noob when it comes to the BGS stuff though. Do we take any mission that's against the SDW, or is there specific missions to look for, etc?
Its a case of replacing them i think which as they are on only 30% influence possibly wouldn't be too hard for a PP group.
