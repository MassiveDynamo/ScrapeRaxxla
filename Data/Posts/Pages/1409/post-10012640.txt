The question still stands. How do we reconcile the fact that Felicity clearly says she knows the Dark Wheel shut down imitators, and yet most people here seem to agree that the Shinrarta Dark Wheel (SDW) are imitators, and yet haven't been shut down.

Assume that's deliberate (because the codex was released after SDW grew), and therefore, surely, this is actually a pretty massive hint at something, right?
Yea I mean I would agree, could well just be lazy story from F Dev,
If it is the real DW and we have been growing it for 8 years and all that has happened is 6 "now deleted" missions - I say poor show lol

I might investigate missions around Shinraz to see if there are any counter DW missions, such as assassinate missions. I would feel bad on the guys that spent 4 years building it up though lol
I'm kinda hoping someone somewhere is going to organise a counter strike on the goids cause the screen shots would be epic
