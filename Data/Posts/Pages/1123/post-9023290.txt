It would be hilarious if it was out near Heart and Soul somewhere, after all the time all those people (including me) spent searching out there for something else entirely,

I only recently went to H&S, a few weeks behind the Lore Tour @drew did, and even following hundreds of Cmdrs on the exact same route there I still found undiscovered systems all over...on the way back I came fairly straight across the 'void' and same, even found an undiscovered system with Crystal site in the 'void' (which may have been impassable before engineering though so less traffic).

So even well explored areas have lots and lots of undiscovered systems and 'secrets'. Never give up, never surrender to the 'everybody knows' argument.
