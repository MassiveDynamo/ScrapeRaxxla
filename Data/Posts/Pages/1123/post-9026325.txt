finding Raxxla was going to be a "personal journey" or the like for each commander

'Its a journey everyone must make for themselves' - Michael Brookes (before FCs but after MC iirc....and he must have known FCs were coming so not sure how literally to take that) Plus Trade & Combat ranks can be earned in MC....not sure how Explo MC works.

One reading of it is that you have to go somewhere and receive some info or invite or the 'key', which you dont get in MC eg you dont see the LP text or similar in MC. Especially if its a sound / note / tone that is in the key of G for example and only stored on your ship to be used later.....like honking the UAs to get a response.

Or it may be more imaginative thinking than practically thinking and applying it to gameplay, time will tell....if we ever find the darn thing that is
