The locations Sirius factions holds may be relevant. Attacking Sirius affiliated factions (via bgs) may force them to use their advantage/capabilities w.r.t controlling Raxxla more openly.
Interesting (and quite possibly valid) theory from a lore perspective. That said I am not sure what role, if any, the BGS would have to play in unlocking Raxxla. According to an early statement (by Braben or Brookes IIRC, can't remember which now) finding Raxxla was going to be a "personal journey" or the like for each commander. Not sure how mass player BGS (or Powerplay) activity would fit that definition myself. That said, I am biased against both of those, so am quite possibly very wrong.
