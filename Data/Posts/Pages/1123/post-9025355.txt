I have some important break throughs. And I am at the point of needing community help. https://discord.gg/bfMXJr4 Is the IRH hunters discord. Join my angels-and-demons channel.

I have explained what the Dark Wheel is - and who at least two of the members are. I have also revealed their possible locations in the galaxy, and why they have ORBIS stations.

In the channel a lot of symbolism in the game is explained as well as why it is there guiding us.

You will find the location of a Guardian Exile in every large Orbis dock. They are watching us. They were always watching us.

And you will learn about the Orbis station connection to Raxxla.

https://discord.gg/bfMXJr4 I need help researching the points listed for the other Orbis stations, and understanding the clock during your CMDRs death sequence in a unique location.

Send me a message on discord if any of this makes sense to you and after you have read the channel, watched the videos, and looked at the imagery.

Image that's been recolored to reveal the Guardian Exile in every Large ORBIS station. Watching over humanity. Guardian siting image below- recolored to bring out the eyes - guardian site image below as well courtesy of Falconscreech, showing the bar between the eyes, and the eyes.
