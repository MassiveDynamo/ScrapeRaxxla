Has anyone really read this stuff and understood it?

I tried, failing hard.
I mean yes sirens could be nymphs, but there are about 6 passages with nymphs in this sonnets, lovers mentioned 1000 times, parents none. Dunno.
This is the stuff that drives you crazy.

And the thing with the spiralling stars. I counted stella in this sonnets and made a fibonaccs sequence.
You have no idea when to stop. Damn iterations.

Well, it wouldn't be a puzzle (or obfuscation - remember it is quite possible it has nothing to do with Raxxla) if we figured it out right away.

I just assumed spiralling stars was another reference to a Black Hole (or binary system). I don't do math. ;-)
