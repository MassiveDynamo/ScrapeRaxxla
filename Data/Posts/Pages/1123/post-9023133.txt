1. Do I understand correctly that the missions from the stranger are from TDW ?
Probably not but no-one can say for certain. We know that it aint triggered anything yet.

It seems that just about this is written in the Codex about TDW.
Theres a lot of mysteries in ED that could be related to The DW, I think they are deliberately written to let the reader jump to their own conclusions without actually saying anything. Just like from the very beginning theres hints at something without actually linking anything, it keeps the mystery alive in the players head and we can make of it what we want. Very little is actually 'finalised' one way or the other....it might be, it might not and that keeps us guessing and talking and playing and wondering.
