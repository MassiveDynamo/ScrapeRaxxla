Diana's train is a bunch of nymphs. The Pleiades are among them.

Venusâ€™ badge was in Shakespearean time often represented by a strawberry, because it's red and heart shaped. Could be another Heart nebula thing?

Yeah, I thought there was another reference with a Pleiades connection but I was too tired to look for it last night. I also gave up at Para 65 so there could be much more (as well as stuff I missed of course or haven't bothered to look up yet like the mother/son vagabond/runaway stuff among others). Haven't even checked to see if the Diana asteroid is in game yet, I was thinking if it is in a belt the train could be the other asteroids orbitting with it.

It would be hilarious if it was out near Heart and Soul somewhere, after all the time all those people (including me) spent searching out there for something else entirely, and not finding it. I can hear FD now, "Quick, Wagar has hundreds of commanders going to Heart and Soul - shutdown the Raxxla server!"
