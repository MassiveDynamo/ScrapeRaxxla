I'm interested in why Gan Romero was mentioned at all, if that would be an off camera story not present in the game.

One entry that we have from his dream journal is:"an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven,' and being called by 'voices that didn’t come from anything with a body"

This radiant area of space, sounds a lot like stellar remnants,which are deemed quite rare by the exploration community.

Some recent finds:

I've found only two in my journey through the galaxy so far, and was always intrigued if this is somehow the area dream journal mentioned.

Given that stolen DBX was fitted with deep space exploration, Gan must've been heading very far of the Bubble.

Anyway,I'm on my roundabout way back from Colonia and plotted course trough couple of Nebulae,just in case if they might fit the bill as well
