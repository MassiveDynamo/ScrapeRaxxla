Its a space Duck?

Exactly my thought too! Hard to unsee it as a bird, but... idk why it would be Like, even if it's a joke or Easter-egg just for fun... it's weird!

Maybe each toast 'point' is something else to listen to? Now to keep trying to deduce what each one actually is
Yes! If "Sirens" are the Landscape Signal, and "whisperer" is the D7 anomaly, then there may be more (or these things may not be related?!)

The inner semi circle part look a lot to me to the galactic center, rotated a bit:

Other intersecting lines above, that looks like Giraffe someone mentioned, might be the regions near it, and the emphasis dot might be 'x' mark the spot.
Hmmm, that's interesting too. I believe the segmentation and naming of those segments happened in Beyond Chapter 3 along with the Codex in 2018. The D7 anomaly seems to pre-date that, but possibly the odd shape of the centre of the Galaxy may be intended to resemble it? I wonder why they didn't make the Galactic Centre region just a circle?

I found this interesting but have no idea if its actually in game?

Many of us have investigated Saturn a lot for this very reason, sadly no investigations have ever found anything (and the hex isn't present in-game)
