I'm interested in why Gan Romero was mentioned at all, if that would be an off camera story not present in the game.
Because it's exactly the same as every other "off-camera" narrative element that's ever been done (building the story) - Gan is building/continuing the story that started with Halsey. It's clear that they are linked, and Gan's story added more information and clues.

Edited for clarity
