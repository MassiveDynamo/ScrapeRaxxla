They're mostly named after either nebulae, star clusters, constellations or particular stars. The former two are self-explanatory, and the latter seem to be for helping with flavour on the bubble's system names... but what about the exceptions (like the Regor sector, from which the Guardian cone of influence extends)?
Regor is an informal name for Gamma Velorum, which is the star at the centre of it, so it seems to fit that pattern.

Then you have oddities like the faraway permit sectors with procedural-esque names (Bovomit, Dryman, Froadik, Hyponia, Sidgoir, Praei[1-4], Bleia[1-5]) and the ICZ sector being composed of multiple overlapping spheres; also, does anyone knows what ICZ even means?
Given where ICZ is, my guess is "Imperial Core Zone" as a counterpart to the Federal(ish) "Core Sys Sector" near Sol - but I don't recall seeing anything officially stated anywhere.
