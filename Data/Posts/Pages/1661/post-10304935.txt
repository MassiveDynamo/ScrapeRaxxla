Because it's exactly the same as every other "off-camera" narrative element that's ever been done (building the story) - Gan is building/continuing the story that started with Halsey. It's clear that they are linked, and Gan's story added more information and clues.

Edited for clarity
Anyone successfully cross-referenced the hints Drew gave us about Rifth and Halsey? Late for the party I am, sorry for noob questions.
