Yes, I have read this thread. The main (I think so) tester of these missions also speaks Russian and it is clear to me that he answers me.
He said that if you do a large number of missions from any faction then appears task from a stranger.
It seems that just about this is written in the Codex about TDW.
Except AFAIK the missions you are given are just more of the same "take x fish to planet y and bring back z biowaste" or whatever. Which doesn't seem to have a Dark Wheel vibe about them. And as lots of people have been getting and doing those missions for some time now, if there was a Dark Wheel connection someone likely would have come across it by now. I could be wrong but I think it is just another RNG mission mechanic. Maybe there is some sort of secret counter and after doing 10,000 of them you get TDW invite, but I doubt it. Same reason I think that having a TDW invite locked behind finding everything in the Codex would be silly, as it would just be more RNG grind. I could be wrong, FD does love their grind.
