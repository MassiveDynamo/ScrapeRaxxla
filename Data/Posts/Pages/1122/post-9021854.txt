You’re responding to a post that’s over a year old!

Those start screens used to be shown on my PC. I spent many (happy??) hours fruitlessly searching based on them. My posts will be in this thread.

The trouble is that FD manipulate their images, so the star types, colours, background stars and scales could all be changed, if they ever truly represented something in-game. Of course there is no guarantee that the start screens represent anything at all, could be clues or could just be marketing fluff.

I think they might still be in-game but if so the current start screen overlays them pretty fast.
