Except AFAIK the missions you are given are just more of the same "take x fish to planet y and bring back z biowaste" or whatever. Which doesn't seem to have a Dark Wheel vibe about them. And as lots of people have been getting and doing those missions for some time now, if there was a Dark Wheel connection someone likely would have come across it by now. I could be wrong but I think it is just another RNG mission mechanic. Maybe there is some sort of secret counter and after doing 10,000 of them you get TDW invite, but I doubt it. Same reason I think that having a TDW invite locked behind finding everything in the Codex would be silly, as it would just be more RNG grind. I could be wrong, FD does love their grind.
I know what you mean, but the entry in the TDW code about missions is very similar.
Maybe you should be a 4x Elite and do such missions?
