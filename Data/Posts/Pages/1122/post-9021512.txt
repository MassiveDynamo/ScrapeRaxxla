And as the poem is about the "star lover's" Astrophel love for Stella ("star"), that would seem to me to rule out the Venus/Diana possibility in Sol. Unless of course that is where you go to view Raxxla first, or get another hint or something...

Also, the Venus' sceptre reference - not sure about this one, but I think it is related to biblical scholarly and not-so-scholarly interpretations (historical and contemporary) around the alignment of Mercury, Mars and Jupiter (which in some of those interpretations includes Venus, even though it is low in the sky and not aligned at all) and the appearance of a sceptre as part of the biblical imagery around the Star of the Magi being formed by that alignment.
Venus is often referred to as The Morning Star....

I feel regarding a poem or children's literature this would fit in still
