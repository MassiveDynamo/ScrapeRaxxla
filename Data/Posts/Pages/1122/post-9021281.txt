1. Do I understand correctly that the missions from the stranger are from TDW ?
2. Why the limit of the jump in the 2nd and 3rd phase alpha 20 and 50 ? Why is it so ? If you take the core, there can be a lot more systems in circle 20 than in circle 50 on the outskirts.
1. I don't believe so, but who knows. It could be possible. There is another thread on that elsewhere where someone has been analysing them.
2. Likely best asked to the devs in the Alpha thread.
