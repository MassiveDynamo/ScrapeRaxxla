Ok, buckle up and get ready for the juice, here comes some more Stella and Astrophel theorizing [in addition to my earlier brief analyses here and here ] I've been doing keyword searches on the text (I won't say I have read it all as early modern poetry bores me to death) looking mostly for eyes, stars, navels, rifts, brows, arrows, constellations, planets, you know, all the usual stuff. I've made my way through a fair chunk of it now and have come up with the notes below for those who are interested. I've excerpted pertinent bits with my observations/ideas in brackets after the line or the paragraph. This is by no means a complete analysis and is just some preliminary thoughts. The original text is not complete below, just the bits I have found interesting so far, but if you want to get stuck into it you can find a transcription of it here and the 1888 edition of the 1591 original here as a PDF.








































































































tl;dr Raxxla may be a trinary system, with two main sequence stars and a black hole, perhaps in or behind the "veil" of one or more nebulae, (as viewed from Earth perhaps?) Those nebulae could be:


OR... Raxxla might have something to do with Venus and the and its "train" in Sol.

It also talks about Stellaâ€™s two black eyes, so you could hypothesise Raxxla is something to do with a binary BH.
I did and dived quite a few before I got bored!
