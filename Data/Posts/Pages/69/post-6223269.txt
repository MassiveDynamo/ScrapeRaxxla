A bit more Sirius nonsense.

Sirius B will be in apoapsis(furthest away from it's orbits CG), in 2019.
SPOILER

In game the system has an orbital period of 18149.7 days or 49.7 years.

2019 + (49,7 * 16) = 2814.2. Meaning that Sirius B would be in apoapsis in 2814.

Ten more laps and we have the next one in 3311.

The wheel of time turns slowly.......
