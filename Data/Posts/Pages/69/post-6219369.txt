Both The Dark Wheel and CIEP have circular references in their names. A dark matter halo spreads out from the galactic centre in the Milky Way. Witch space? Speedier tunnels to other parts of galaxy?
The whole INRA and The Club thread in ED I feel has more purpose with relation to Raxxla. Other than the beacon in Soontill is there more lore on CIEP?
