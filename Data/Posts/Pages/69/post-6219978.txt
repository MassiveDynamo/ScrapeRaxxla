Speaking of crazy ... if you read the letters in Raxxla as "medieval Roman numerals" you get the following values:

R = 80
A = 5
X = 10
X = 10
L = 50
A = 5

I was doing some Guardian poking (relating to Raxxla), and remembered this post when I noticed my current coordinates weren't far off if you turned those into X/Z/Y.
Took a look in Galaxy Map, and checked if there were any systems near +/-805 +/-1010 +/-505 (+/-RA+/-XX+/-LA) and there was a system almost right on one of those! On the rim? Check. A little bit obvious? Kinda check.
Headed out there, but nope... no USS, POIs, stations or rogue planets*.

All I found was a condor(?) way out in the middle of nowhere:


and a lot of black empty space...


* Given the difficulty of dropping on a comet which is known, I do wonder if it's in any way reasonably possible to find a rogue planet by accident.
