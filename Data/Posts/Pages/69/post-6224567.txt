I became allied with all of them (including TDW of course) and then noticed I was getting mysterious stranger missions. Not sure if coincidence or not. Must get round to doing the missions..

I've gotten a handful of those as well. I believe it has more to do with RNGesus than it does anything else. All of them led to some airless rock with a huge fortification on it that I had to fight my way through for a data packet that paid well less than the repairs to my ship. Mysterious stranger indeed.
