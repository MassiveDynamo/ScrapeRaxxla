hum,,,
The correct quote from the mission is:
Place that isn't a place,
Door that is also the key.
The Myth.
So, still 26 characters long but only when including punctuation.
If we're going to assume this is a riddle then "the Myth" is probably also important.

Honestly, I believe that Raxxla is only visible to a quad-Elite player, maybe also needing max Fed and Imperial ranks and max Alliance rep. When it's visible that's when we need to know where to look, and I'm sure the missions will appear then to help us find the way.

So when I asked before there was a triple-Elite player but no quad-Elite player. Anyone care to admit they're played more CQC than is healthy?
