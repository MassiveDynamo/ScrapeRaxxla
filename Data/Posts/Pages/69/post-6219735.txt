But in the end I am compiling what I know and writing it down to see if maybe there was something so insanely obvious in there. But the bottom line is I would put money on the fact that it is staring us right in the face.

Imho, it seems clear the "not-insanely-but-tiny-bit-obvious-thing " is the presence of TDW faction in the game and it's former Soontil Relics missions, eventually bugged and actually removed. I bet everything we need is in the FP. Macros did/does a great job.
