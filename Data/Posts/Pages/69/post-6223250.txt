Honestly, I believe that Raxxla is only visible to a quad-Elite player...

Of course DB said it was in the game before CQC launched... Hence why i think only Triple Elite would be the max, and more likely only a single elite, or if in Shinratra a potentially non-Elite Founder pass holder, is required.
