I remember Braben saying follow the missions. Now i dont know what exactly he was refereeing too, but if we follow the missions from Shinrata via organisations connected to the Dark Wheel etc but it might lead some were. It will be a massive grind getting rep with each faction, but have we not all done that before. i see a lot of work has gone into this from the start. did the trail end.

I am near to be allied with every single faction (as far as I know ..) involved in these Elite missions. Some weird things already happened but nothing conclusive. Keeping on just to not let loose ends.
