I am near to be allied with every single faction (as far as I know ..) involved in these Elite missions. Some weird things already happened but nothing conclusive. Keeping on just to not let loose ends.

I became allied with all of them (including TDW of course) and then noticed I was getting mysterious stranger missions. Not sure if coincidence or not. Must get round to doing the missions..
