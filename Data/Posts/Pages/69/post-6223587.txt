A bit more Sirius nonsense.

Sirius B will be in apoapsis(furthest away from it's orbits CG), in 2019.
SPOILER

In game the system has an orbital period of 18149.7 days or 49.7 years.

2019 + (49,7 * 16) = 2814.2. Meaning that Sirius B would be in apoapsis in 2814.

Ten more laps and we have the next one in 3311.

The wheel of time turns slowly.......

So... the next time Sirius is aligned the same as it was in 2814 will be in 3311?

Would be awesome if they'd calculated this to be once the initial 10 years plan is over they can do the leadup to finding Raxxla for year 11 - I'm getting excited just contemplating that level of foreplanning.
