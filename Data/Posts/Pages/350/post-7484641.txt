I would not concentrate too much on symbols. INRA , DW and Raxxla symbols can be correlated with stuff outside of the game almost 1on1 in a matter of seconds. There is math behind and a reason for that math.

The only things that is bothering me is that unresolved pic with a map of a system (or part of galaxy map) from some ship (7-8 circles, similar to federation logo?). That one does not fit (to me).

Each to his own, enjoy the game and keep em coming!

And obligatory prophecy: there shall be pirate base in space (demolished space outpost or mega-ship,
(most probably in an asteroid ring) in a story.
