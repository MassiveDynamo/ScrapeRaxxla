Would it be helpful to try and reconstruct the Bubble at the time of the first Raxxla quote (2296)? Having the ability to visualise the region of inhabited space at the time might provide some clue as to where might have been a good place for The Dark Wheel to position their base and also suggest the reach of the exploration ships of the era, which are perhaps more likely than other types to have encountered Raxxla (but certainly not the only type - e.g. the Faraway Jump Network took centuries to complete so might have been under construction at the time and the ships that built the network would have been travelling deep into interstellar space).
Sorry for another text wall! TL;DR Is it known how many / which systems had been colonised by 2296?

Discussion of the size of the Bubble in 2296 and its relevance to the location of TDW base and Raxxla
SPOILER




There is a separate issue of working out when Raxxla could have been first found and exploited based upon looking for sudden changes in the rate of technological advancement. Revolutions can happen of their own accord, especially in times of change or conflict (there were big environmental problems on Earth that doubtless contributed to the development of large scale space transportation) but, just as we are experiencing a revolution now from our contact with the Guardians and Thargoids, so should there be some signs that someone was getting some advantage from exploiting new knowledge.
