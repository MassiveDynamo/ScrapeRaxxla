Hi Cmdr,
from my background of crop circle research I was suspicious about the blueprint of the TDW logo as well as that from the CoR.

It is the crop circle of June 1st, 2008, found at Barbury Castle, Wiltshire. They altered the steps towards the center a bit.

I have written confirmation that the human makers of this crop circle have no affiliation to FDev nor do they are affiliated with any of the authors (i.e.Drew). Their aim to create this crop cirlce was completely different. Sooo, the time the book with the logo was published has a coincidence with the time the crop cirle ("The Pi formation") appeared. The crop circle was taken over for the TDW and CoR logo.

Links? Lucy Pringle claimed the photo credit on this circle but it seems that resource has been 404'd since I had to credit it for borrowing. (Daily Mail coverage)

I wasn't aware humans had claimed to manufacture it?
