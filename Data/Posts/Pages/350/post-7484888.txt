It could be I suppose, but if it is a Toroid then that's what the shape is. And the Guardians were pretty similar to us, and so the basic principles of station shapes would apply to them just as they would to us (assuming the no-artificial gravity rule is maintained). A lot of it is just down to basic physics.

miscommunication!
yes, TDW is a toroid, therefore orbis.
but I was saying that if Raxxla is a station it could be either an early small galcop coriolis, or a guardian station.
