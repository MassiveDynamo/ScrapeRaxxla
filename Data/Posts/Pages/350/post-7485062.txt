I don't think anyone has mentioned it.
How is Pi incorporated into the image?

I believe the left white image is indeed fan-made (researching where it came from) but the circular graphic at the centre directly references this representation of Pi. To confirm this for yourself, from the centre of the image on the right count the number of dotted segments the line crosses before "stepping" to an outer ring. You should end up with Pi to 9 decimal places. Yes I have far too much time on my hands.



I have seen other Thargoid puzzles showing Pi to 3 decimals which I'm unsure if anyone solved! See that below



Perhaps math is involved after all!

EDIT: I *think* the image on the left is real? The earliest I have seen it referenced is 23rd September 2016 where it appears on this page about the whole Salom√© business. Supposedly it's the emblem for the Dark Wheel :/ https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Kahina_Tijani_Loren
