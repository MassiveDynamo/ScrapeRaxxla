That logo is fan made. FD has nothing to do with it and itâ€™s not the Dark Wheel symbol.

I feel like the longer this thread goes, the more we're having to repeat the same things. "Erhm, sorry, no one has actually honked the system Raxxla is in; at best, it's an unsubstantiated rumour." "The logo is fanmade." "Drew doesn't know...yes, I know he wrote the...yes, I understand that he...just, please. He doesn't know." "Again, no, it's not in the Formidine Rift" "CMDR Thrust from Bradford is not, in fact, already there."

Things like that.
