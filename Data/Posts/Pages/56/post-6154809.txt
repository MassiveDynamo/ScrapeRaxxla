Sirius corporation produced Military Fuel on Lucifer. This was anti-matter based fuel and therefor much more energetic that hydrogen fusion.

The trick was to store a stable atom of anti-matter within a complex molecule and use it as a fuel. The production started in 2350. Probably long before GalCop or Quirium saw the light of day.

In FFE there was an ongoing 'Ban Military Drives' campaign. This seem to have succeeded, as there hasn't been a single mention of Military Fuel in ED.

Both the Argent's Quest and the pilotable Thargoid war ship used Military Fuel.

Yeah, problem is we have no real idea of how much of that (if any) is still accurate.

Military fuel was really only relevant for the 2b hyperdrives (in any version of Lore) - so Sirius making Military drive fuel from 2350 doesn't really fit unless you speculate that there's always been a military version of the hyperdrive and each version uses the same fuel, and if that were true then the Quirium drive-issues that caused the development and use of the 2b in the 3200's would have been unnecessary.

We have no references to the Military drive in ED at all that I'm aware of - and no specific evidence that military ships don't use the FSD just like commercial ships.
