As an aside, following the Steven Eisler (Robert Holdstock) origin of Raxxla, I found this mentioned in a Google search from his book "The Alien World":

"The Eye Of The Beholder. A Raxxlan projection which appeared above the primitive world Winter D, populated by sentient, but unadvanced insectoids. The Eye became an overwhelming symbol of the evil that stared from the heavens, so disorienting the creatures that the Oisir-Raxxla were able to build their structure and depart without life being lost."

I don't suppose that could have anything to do with the genesis of The Thargoids?
