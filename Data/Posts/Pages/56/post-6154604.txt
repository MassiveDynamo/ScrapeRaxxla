I believe Sirius was colonised directly from Sol in the original expansion phase. I'm not sure if anyone has explored the Sirius-Sol line, but I'm taking a trip to Alioth later this week so I'll swing by and have a look

The ambiguity in the details about early space travel are annoying because we also know that early hyperspace tech relied on Quirium (but when that started is vague). Quirium was linked with GalCop, but it's hard to know whether the fuel referenced in the tourist beacon at Sirius related to conventional drives, or whether it meant hyperdrives, and if so, might it mean that Sirius supplied Quirium? If we're speculating that Sirius is Raxxla, it's possible they lost access to the gate(?) That they used to acquire the Quirium catalyst...

Sirius corporation produced Military Fuel on Lucifer. This was anti-matter based fuel and therefor much more energetic that hydrogen fusion.

The trick was to store a stable atom of anti-matter within a complex molecule and use it as a fuel. The production started in 2350. Probably long before GalCop or Quirium saw the light of day.

In FFE there was an ongoing 'Ban Military Drives' campaign. This seem to have succeeded, as there hasn't been a single mention of Military Fuel in ED.

Both the Argent's Quest and the pilotable Thargoid war ship used Military Fuel.
