Hypothesis: Raxxla is (in)Sirius.

Now this is the Han Zen we all know and love and haven't seen for a while. Out of rep, +1.

10 songs in C Major Scale:

Song 1 - Ode To Joy
Song 2 - Lean On Me - Bill Withers
Song 3 - Falling Slowly - Glen Hansard
Song 4 - Happy Birthday
Song 5 - The Chain Fleetwood Mac (UK F1 Theme)
Song 6 - When The Saints Go Marching In
Song 7 - La Bamba
Song 8 - Rhiannon - Fleetwood Mac
Song 9 - Mr Tambourine Man Lead Line
Song 10 - Let Her Go by Passenger

When the Saints Come Marching In is also When the Spurs Come Marching In. The Gateway to Raxxla could be White Hart Lane. Alternatively, there is also the William Shatner version of Mr. Tambourine Man, perhaps there is a vital clue hidden there? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0hTtsqiFCc
