I believe Sirius was colonised directly from Sol in the original expansion phase. I'm not sure if anyone has explored the Sirius-Sol line, but I'm taking a trip to Alioth later this week so I'll swing by and have a look

The ambiguity in the details about early space travel are annoying because we also know that early hyperspace tech relied on Quirium (but when that started is vague). Quirium was linked with GalCop, but it's hard to know whether the fuel referenced in the tourist beacon at Sirius related to conventional drives, or whether it meant hyperdrives, and if so, might it mean that Sirius supplied Quirium? If we're speculating that Sirius is Raxxla, it's possible they lost access to the gate(?) That they used to acquire the Quirium catalyst...
