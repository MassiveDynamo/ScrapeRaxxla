Get your tinfoil hats.

It's in Betelgeuse.


Tharg the Mighty was from there. He called it Quaxxann.

Guy is a green alien, has a small white mohawk, a circular feature on his forehead associated with Sirius, and can run off plastic. The analogies are clear, obviously he's a Thargoid or a Tharglet gone awry.

As an aside, following the Steven Eisler (Robert Holdstock) origin of Raxxla...
You know, I'm starting to think modern fans of sci-fi have no perspective of how the genre came about and blossomed. There was a very creative, and often as eccentric, underground. I have only just put the image together in words, but still don't always see it.

Long story short; homage, references, one-upping, and selective copying was very common, as it is today. However...

A fan of several fictional but loosely similar stories, a natural dreamer, would pass idle time thinking about each series and the possibilities. The perceptive of them would see ways they could appear to cross over without actually crossing over. The writers of them would make it so.

Finally, the readers would go wild with what-ifs, "unknowns," dreaming, for example, about how and why Tharg the Mighty is really a Thargoid/let.

And so on.
