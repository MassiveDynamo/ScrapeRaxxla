Sirius has always been a pioneer of Hyperspace travel. It's possible that those early colony ships discovered some alien technology in the system and decided to keep a secret and monopolise it - something like a Hypergate - that's possibly where the myths of Raxxla come from. The tourist beacon says "In 2339 a commercial colonial expedition reached the unusual binary Sirius system. The colonisation was the first solely corporate colonial mission and the company rapidly rose to become the premier supplier of drive fuel throughout human space."
Did that expedition come from Sol? Is there anything in the Sirius system heading in the direction of Sol (up to, say, 2 million ls out)? If Sirius was the primary supplier of fuel in that period, then it also makes me wonder if (m)any Generation Ships began their journey there rather than in Sol.
