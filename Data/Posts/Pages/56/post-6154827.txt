Now this is the Han Zen we all know and love and haven't seen for a while. Out of rep, +1.

10 songs in C Major Scale:

Song 1 - Ode To Joy
Song 2 - Lean On Me - Bill Withers
Song 3 - Falling Slowly - Glen Hansard
Song 4 - Happy Birthday


Song 7 - La Bamba
Song 8 - Rhiannon - Fleetwood Mac



When the Saints Come Marching In is also When the Spurs Come Marching In. The Gateway to Raxxla could be White Hart Lane. Alternatively, there is also the William Shatner version of Mr. Tambourine Man, perhaps there is a vital clue hidden there?

Oh dear, as sad a case of space madness as I’ve seen, White Hart Lane indeed!
clearly Raxxla is in a black hole (you may fall in but the time dilation makes it appear as though you never reach it) which you must enter on your birthday after celebrating by drinking several large Lavian brandies (Raxxla was in Lave for one timeline, and you need to lean) while handcuffed (chains) and stood atop a funeral pyre (saints burned as heretics), within your ship named La Bamba, playing a tambourine while singing Ode to Joy (in German). You need to be preceded by a female companion (let her go) named Rhiannon.
Sheesh, no wonder we haven’t found it so far!
