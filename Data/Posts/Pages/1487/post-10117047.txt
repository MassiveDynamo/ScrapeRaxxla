Do you have a source reference for that purported MB refutation? Because when I tried to get clarification I just got the standard “no comment”.

Sorry, the Mars Artefact disappeared?? What’s the source reference for that?

FD dont have to have changed anything if Raxxla is that hard to find. If it is a body & you have to be within 50 Km to drop into its instance, as comets suggest, then without a visible signpost we’ll never find it. But as I’ve said, I think the Omphalos needs to be found before Raxxla is downloaded. Not only do we not know what Raxxla is, we don’t know what the Omphalos is either. Hardly surprising it’s not been found yet!!!

“Little bit obvious” means there must be some hints/clues & I cant see any reason why FD would remove those clues on MB’s departure. I suspect “Mother Gaia” is the first, it’s an odd name for a faction. Does it indicate the Gaia satellite as the source of the Raxxla myth, or does it mean something else???
