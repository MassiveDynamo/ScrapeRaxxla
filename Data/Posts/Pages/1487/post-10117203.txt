It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves.
Hopefully, this journey isn't the narrative itself.
Otherwise, it refers to the players who will simply tag along the whole time until Raxxla is woke up by the scenario... I wouldn't rule this out, as disappointing as it would be.
And we will be left with the question: "Could we have found it before it was revealed?"
