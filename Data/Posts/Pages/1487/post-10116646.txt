So... They made it a tiny little bit obvious by now?
I have no idea whether they have or not personally, but a few things to bear in mind that have changed since the statement was made:
Michael Brookes moved on from ED
FD will have got much better pertinent quantitative info - numbers of people getting Elite, and the speed at which they do so, for example.
FD will have got much better pertinent qualitative info - i.e. what the player base does and does not find obvious.
They have definitely been caught out by 3 before, and I suspect they got caught out by 2 fairly early and it has changed much more substantially since. - thereâ€™s no point having secretive missions that only appear to the few who manage to reach Elite rank if every man and their dog can get Elite in less than a day and with pretty much zero skill, effort or knowledge required via following an out-of-game guide and doing some deep core mining (or whatever the credit making meta is at the time).
