Or they let all beta backers in to Shin Dez by mistake from the start and they had instant access rather than the Kickstarters only...?

Just a thought...
Imagine what must have happened during the First Thargoid War when we had almost no ELITE combat rank CMDRs. How did we fight when Pilot's Federation is formed 2805? Yet, we suddenly have enough capable combateers to wage a war when Peter Jameson was allegedly the first. I detect rubbish or mass production of CMDRs. What, you say CMDRs don't grow in trees?

First Thargoid War was the first big case of credentialing inflation for the ELITE or we are being lied to about what went down. I just don't see a one man army working.
