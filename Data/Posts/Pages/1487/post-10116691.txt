ELITE doesn't mean what it used to.
Completely agree, its one aspect of the game i dislike, not to be snobby, but the sense of achievment isnt really there.
I have been an Everquest player since it started and Epic quests took years, i came here and was Elite V in trade and exploration within a year, admittedly i play a lot (far too much my Mrs says!) but when i hit triple Elite i was a tad disappointed.
Thing is folks these days don't have the patience and we live in a 'give it me now world' (just look at those complainig about engineering grinds) admittedly most dont have the time to play much these days with other ditractions like crap reality TV
