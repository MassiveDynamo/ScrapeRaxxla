about engineering grinds
I understood what they meant when a guy said he had about 100 ships.
Of course, after upgrading several times the SAME ships, it gets tedious.
I never thought of playing Elite that way, don't know why he needs so many ships.
I don't even plan to buy one of each, let alone engineer all 36! But 100, this is madness.
Akin to those who rush toward the Corvette, as if it was the only goal of the game or as if the ship could fit every role, and call the whole process a grind.
Man, play something else it sounds like it hurts!
Bottom line, Elite is not an easy game and it has a gameplay of its own which is really not mainstream nowadays.
The epitome being the Raxxla/TDW hunt, probably!
