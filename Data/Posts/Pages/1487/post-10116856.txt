In my humble opinion the potato hunt, although highly commendable and a great example of data collection, is not thorough enough, although a group effort, some may be more thorough than others… much of the data may not have been cross examined etc leaving room for doubt.

It’s primarily focused on one principle, that Raxxla is within this bubble and can be found by normal means.

A sound hypothesis, however it’s possible FD altered Raxxla, it’s possible FD moved it, it’s possible it’s not going to reveal itself to just anyone, or that the path to Raxxla may start at X but leads somewhere else…

At most once the potato hunts complete, to be truly useful the data should be cross checked by other Cmdrs. But it only rules out Raxxla being a body or object in this area, it might not be so obvious?

Well, I have to disagree. I dont think logically it rules out in any way Raxxla as a body or object in this area. How can it....it cannot be named “Raxxla”, it might be named “Triton” for all we know...hidden in plain sight but the way to access it is not apparent. All the Hunt rules out is that it is not obviously within the searched area.

Actually, I still think we should be looking for the Omphalos Rift as the gateway to Raxxla, which is likely an instance which will only be downloaded from the FD server when we trigger the Rift.

Is the Rift hidden as a tunnel in a space structure? Is it hidden in plain sight as the hexagonal storm on Saturn (named “Omphalos” in a NYTimes readers’ competition)? Is it a Guardian beacon?....
