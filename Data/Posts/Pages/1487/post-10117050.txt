Do you have a source reference for that purported MB refutation? Because when I tried to get clarification I just got the standard “no comment”.

Sorry, the Mars Artefact disappeared?? What’s the source reference for that?

FD dont have to have changed anything if Raxxla is that hard to find. If it is a body & you have to be within 50 Km to drop into its instance, as comets suggest, then without a visible signpost we’ll never find it. But as I’ve said, I think the Omphalos needs to be found before Raxxla is downloaded. Not only do we not know what Raxxla is, we don’t know what the Omphalos is either. Hardly surprising it’s not been found yet!!!

“Little bit obvious” means there must be some hints/clues & I cant see any reason why FD would remove those clues on MB’s departure. I suspect “Mother Gaia” is the first, it’s an odd name for a faction. Does it indicate the Gaia satellite as the source of the Raxxla myth, or does it mean something else???

I’m trying to dig that reference out, I saw it only a week ago whilst data diving the internet for various odd links, I had seen it before… it’s a screen grab of a forum post, again, this is speculative and it might be out of context, but I will attempt to re-find it.

My speculation around the Mars relic, is only based upon the potential correlation of dates. Again this is speculation, but I feel the temporal similarities are too close. I don’t believe it identifies anything new (if true), but one speculation is maybe it was stolen or moved, maybe it was linked to the discovery of Raxxla or it points to someplace else.

All just pie in the sky.

But the spacial mapping speculation, I am certain of, again this is based off simple application of logic - it only holds obviously if FD too are applying actual logic as well, and that my interpretation is valid - which of course it might not.
