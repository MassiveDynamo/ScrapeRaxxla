I had the same thing the 1st time I went out bug zapping. Handed in my bounties to PF and they congratulated me on becoming an allied. Think it must be a bug.

That was my thought back then as well, I simply assumed this would be just a String Error and simple oversight.

Just the separate Reputation thing would be a different thing (already being Allied), which is what caused most of the confusion on my side.
I believe doing Tasks based off Pilots Federation Rescue MegaShips (SAR, Thargoid Combat Bonds) was a new code segment to the Game, which possibly introduced a separate new Reputation Branch - at least that's my best theory.

The ASCII String error alone wouldn't be surprising, I'm used to those (i.e. getting pulled by a Pirate NPC while holding uncommon Cargo such as Deep Space Salvage : also results in the NPC Text demanding what looks like placeholder Strings that someone simply forgot to fill)
