Found the picture I was talking about. You can see it on the right side, with what appears to be a little portal/opening in space to the right of it. Furthermore, looks like some natural light coming thru it and hitting the planet looking thing.

I see your img, but I dont see any planet looking object on the right, or anything that looks like a portal.... I just see normal witch-space distortions....
Not sure if im missing somthing, but lets see what others say
