Ever since i first knew of it, I wanted to find Raxxla. I want to help, but I am not a clever man. I dont know where to go. There is so much to read through, and i am very lost. I have two out of three Elite ranks and I almost have Deadly, I've been to the Formadine rift, gotten as much influence with the Dark Wheel as possible, and a bunch of other details i cannot remember right now.

I have a feeling that finding the important things can only be done in open, so I've built a borderline ganker proof ship to hunt for clues.

Where do you need me to go?

Edit: I also have a bunch of exploration data i need to dump. Where should i put it?
