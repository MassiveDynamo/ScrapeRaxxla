ALSO, anyone know whats up with this:

SPOILER: LINK

It seems to think "The Dark Wheel", is not just in ShinDez, but also in AMAUNET??

Is this just wrong/old info? or anyone got any ideas?
Im thinking its just old/wrong, becuase it doesnt list LFT 926... but still... curious

I just spent a fair amount of time in Amaunet. No Dark Wheel present. No gas giants. There is one station for medium ships and smaller. One faction in system is in lockdown. If you look at the page you linked. Most of those factions listed are in lft 926 and not in Amaunet. This is probably the result of human error or possibly intentionally misleading on the site. I am otherwise unfamiliar with the site. Both inara and edsm list the dark wheel as present in lft 926. My squadron is aligned to tdw in shin dez and it associates tdw in lft 926 with them.

Has this been a satisfactory investigation or is there anything you would have me check?

Edit: Additionally i killed a pirate while there after scanning and hatch breaking them. Anyone familiar with trinkets of hidden fortune? Im going to bring these to tdw and sell on the black market as the are both illegal and stolen, unless someone has other suggestions...
