Im not under the assumption we will be told we have found it in such a way

I think they meant, if it was in game, but not accessible, somthing like that would have happened if someone found its location....

And I dont think so, it could have been in game, but the asset itself not generated at the launch of the game, hence the quote "we know where it is and why it hasnt been found" or what ever.... if it was like comets are now, where the asset technically exists, but the visuals for it dont, so finding it would be near impossible without being right on top of it...
