Sometimes you need to take a step back to see the full picture. Raxxla is described as a journey everyone must travel for themselves. It doesn’t make sense that you can do anything Raxxla related by doing anything that any normal player would do. Missions, rep, regular exploration, combat...these would all make it so that any player would have some random chance of discovering Raxxla. There’s no way a secret as big as Raxxla would be designed in a way that I could be discovered by chance or luck.
So I say, any common mechanic in the game should be excluded from a possible path to Raxxla. We have to search for things that we don’t know we can do, or that we shouldn’t be able to do. Perhaps a combination of actions that normally wouldn’t be performed together. Such as supercharging and FSD and flying into a black hole (already been tried). Non of the previous mysteries were discovered through general mechanics of the game..

Addition: Another example is that a while back I posted about how I noticed a planet looking thing in witch space between certain systems. I forgot the exact systems but it was very close to Delphi while traveling from the bubble. If I had to guess, I would say Raxxla is a place/thing inside witch space.
