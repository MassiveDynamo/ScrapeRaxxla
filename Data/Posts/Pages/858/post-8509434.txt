That was my thought back then as well, I simply assumed this would be just a String Error and simple oversight.

Just the separate Reputation thing would be a different thing (already being Allied), which is what caused most of the confusion on my side.
I believe doing Tasks based off Pilots Federation Rescue MegaShips (SAR, Thargoid Combat Bonds) was a new code segment to the Game, which possibly introduced a separate new Reputation Branch - at least that's my best theory.

The ASCII String error alone wouldn't be surprising, I'm used to those (i.e. getting pulled by a Pirate NPC while holding uncommon Cargo such as Deep Space Salvage : also results in the NPC Text demanding what looks like placeholder Strings that someone simply forgot to fill)

No, that's the devs beeping out the expletives the pirate are throwing at you...
