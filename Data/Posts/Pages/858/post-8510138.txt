Edit: Additionally i killed a pirate while there after scanning and hatch breaking them. Any familiar with trinkets of hidden fortune? Im going to bring these to tdw and sell on the black market as the are both illegal and stolen, unless someone has other suggestions...

Trinkets! one of the first things im going to do when i get back in the bubble is get some for testing, Im hoping that they are RNG lucky charms for getting dark wheel invite.
