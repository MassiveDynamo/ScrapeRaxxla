Other CMDRs have received the start of the chain missions randomly without the need to do those 7 steps above. Iirc as long as you hang out in a system long enough without activity, missions get triggered. I'll probably test it again later.


Btw, how long was your longest chain of missions?

Mine was 11 missions, after mission 7 I was intercepted by Dark Commander. One of my squad members had a 28 mission streak though. No progress. Like I said, probably a false rabbit hole, but might as well document it.
