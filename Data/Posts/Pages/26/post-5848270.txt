Good day meatbags! just our weekly check in to keep this thread alive. We have found no trace of Raxxla out in the Formidine Rift while we were out visiting our conque...we mean the Zurara and the EAFOTS bases. The lights sure are pretty out here in witch space. Like a sirens song. We think we see a cluster of bright blue stars pointing in an arrow behind us, but that is probably just space madness, will try jumping in different directions for a little while.
