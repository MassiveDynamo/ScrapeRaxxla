Exactly that is why I'm guessing it's "out there" but still unfindable. All of the early Tharg clues were obscure, but findable, and led to something, then something else, etc. As hard as the OP and others have been looking for Raxxla, there must have been something if it's findable. Or maybe The Brab and FD are evil geniuses?

Unfortunately we have confirmation on only 2 things, its in-game and FDev know where it is... we do NOT have confirmation that it's actual find-able though. This would be my biggest fear is that we are looking so hard, and it may very well be inaccessible due to permit-lock or some other reason. (I'm looking at you Polaris). In the absence of any other clues or hints, if it was in a permit locked system we would never know, and all this searching would be in vain. I would love to get at least one more confirmation our of FDev, and that's if it's at least accessible as it currently stands.
