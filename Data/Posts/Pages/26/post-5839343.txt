Yeah, I figured. You guys have been looking so hard, no way I could accidentally bump into something useful. Good luck!

Chances are its going to be some lone pilot who plays in solo and has never heard of Raxxla who will find "it". They'll dock, refuel and never look back. Years later they'll mention having once docked at a very unique starport ... but can't remember what it was called or where it was. Oh well.
