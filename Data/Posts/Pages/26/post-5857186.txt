2 - Out-game empathy. Think like a dev! If you were tasked with storyboarding the Raxxla mystery, how would it play out? Consider how FDev has handled the story of the Thargoids, or the Guardians or the Formidine Rift.

This is the primary reason that I've decided to pursue the problem from a literature standpoint. Raxxla was basically invented by Robert Holdstock and it seems plausible to me that someone at Frontier would have created the Raxxla of Elite: Dangerous as a memorial to the late author who died all too young in 2009.
