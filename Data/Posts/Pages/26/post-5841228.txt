Exactly that is why I'm guessing it's "out there" but still unfindable. All of the early Tharg clues were obscure, but findable, and led to something, then something else, etc. As hard as the OP and others have been looking for Raxxla, there must have been something if it's findable. Or maybe The Brab and FD are evil geniuses?
