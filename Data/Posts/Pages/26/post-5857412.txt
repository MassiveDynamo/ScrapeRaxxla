The lost missions was a hint of a storyboard, the "there will be no clues" statement effectively closed down any hint or indeed, a need of a storyboard. The Raxxla story has inertia on it's own, and no effort whatsoever has to be made to keep it going. In fact it's best if it's never found to keep the mystery going, so keeping it as a needle in a haystack in galaxy of haystacks is a good way of ensuring that.

Yet, I still have faith [smile]

Raxxla will be show up eventually. What the old Elite mission text tells us, is that several organisations are actively looking for it. Non of them have found it so far.

I don't think even the 'real' Dark Wheel knows how to get there.

If I were to guess, I would say that Raxxla has some kind of connection to the Guardians and the Mars relic.
