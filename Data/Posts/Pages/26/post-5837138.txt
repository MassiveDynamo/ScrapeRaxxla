Just discovered this mystery for the first time, and I've read much (not 100%) of this thread, so forgive me if I'm behind, but I just saw this on reddit:



Is this a known thing to you Raxxlers and maybe a useful clue?

It's known. Part of the build up to Drew Wagar's novel Premonition. The staging posts were setup as content placeholders for us players to monitor and patrol while Drew was working on a way forward with Frontier Developments. They are now tourist sites.
