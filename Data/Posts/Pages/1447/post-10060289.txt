This has always perplexed me as well.

He’s a ship board mechanic, based out of Tau Ceti, in the year 2296.

That means an ‘engineer’; on a mobile ship; travelling originally away from Tau Ceti / maybe returning; he knew of Raxxla circa 2296… why not 2292 or 2297 or 2298?
There's nothing suggesting Art Tornqvist leaves Tau Ceti. We know from other context-lore that pretty much only governments and military travel interstellar at this stage.

Art's personal ship is likely to be a system-ship (like a shuttle), the ship he works on is likely to be a system-ship (like the Canterbury Ice mining hauler from the Expanse). He might work on a ship that travels back to Sol, I would imagine there's some FTL megaships that go back and forth to the colonies stacked with cargo for trade.

Remember that people back then weren't zipping about in small ships like us

No need to assume interstellar travel - doesn't mean there wasn't, but I think probably is that it's not.
