Voyager plays for about 2minutes. It's an entirely newly constructed audio - as in, it's not the "actual" golden record welcome message. I did a post about it a couple of months back with all the details. Both Voyagers have the same message. I checked it and it's the same as the one on the Canonn page for the Voyagers if you want to listen to it.

As with all things, more eyes checking it the better

Edit: I do have recordings of them if you want the raw files for whatever reason, and New Horizons.
Can you shoot me a DM with New Horizons audio? Asking for that one specifically as I believe both Voyager probes were in at launch. New Horizons might also have been as it was launched in 2006. However, Frontier didn't see fit to confirm they were out in the black darkwaters of Sol's backyard until closer to promotional period leading up to Horizons. I think New Horizons may have something buried in the audio as a consequence.
