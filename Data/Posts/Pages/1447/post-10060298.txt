It seemed rather more like a single layer of sound. I mean something might be there but I have my doubts. That said the probes themselves make noises that sound like it could be converted into Morse code so that may be worth looking into. It has been forever since I was out by those probes. The beeps though seemed like there may be a pattern there (this was especially true of New Horizons). New Horizons only beeps so it may be the better choice to get a clean sample. I believe the sequence repeats about every 15 minutes. I do not remember how long the Voyager probes audio sequence plays.
Voyager plays for about 2minutes. It's an entirely newly constructed audio - as in, it's not the "actual" golden record welcome message. I did a post about it a couple of months back with all the details. Both Voyagers have the same message. I checked it and it's the same as the one on the Canonn page for the Voyagers if you want to listen to it.

As with all things, more eyes checking it the better

Edit: I do have recordings of them if you want the raw files for whatever reason, and New Horizons.
