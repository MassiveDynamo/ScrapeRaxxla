In Paradise Lost (II, 580) John Milton names the Phlegeton (not in game) as one of the rivers of Hell, it is also known as Pyriphlegethon (also not in game) as well as the Rivers Styx (in game); Acheron (not in game) and Cocytus (not in game).

The river Lethe (in game) is also counted among the rivers of the underworld.

Note, in game Styx and Archeron are not in a close relationship, nor either to Pandemonium. Styx is actually in the northern celestial hemisphere. I donâ€™t see any direct correlation.
