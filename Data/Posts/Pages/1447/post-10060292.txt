It seemed rather more like a single layer of sound (the Voyager Record audio). I mean something might be there but I have my doubts. That said the probes themselves make noises that sound like it could be converted into Morse code so that may be worth looking into. It has been forever since I was out by those probes. The beeps though seemed like there may be a pattern there (this was especially true of New Horizons). New Horizons only beeps so it may be the better choice to get a clean sample. I believe the sequence repeats about every 15 minutes. I do not remember how long the Voyager probes audio sequence plays.
