Anarchy as a system state can change and have been disappearing due to player BGS interactions since the game launched?
I think @Rochester was talking more factions that are anarchy government. There are tons of these but only a few where the anarchist faction maintains control of the system. Best bet would probably be INARA minor faction search to facilitate locating all of them. Keep in mind pretty much any faction that claims a given system home are pawns of the much larger Pilots' Federation per beacons in Shinrarta Dezra. Pilots' Federation basically financially supported those factions who cannot be kicked out because that is their home system.
