In regards to a mapping of a relationship concerning heaven / hell, the only thing I’ve achieved is to plot a potential Milton Celestial north and south hemisphere, the north hemisphere is the heavens, the south is chaos, the South Pole is Pandemonium aka hell. But, this is only based upon the positioning of Pandemonium as a potential South Pole and this pole being in alignment with the celestial equator (zodiac).

The following shows the Yggdrasil systems with a Celestial pole drawn from pandemonium and a celestial equator, identifying the north and south celestial hemispheres. Note the image is shown with galactic north / south alignment eg top of image is North etc, the Milton pole is shown as is, it does not align with Polaris.



Now in comparison many of the Yggdrasil systems seem to align with this too, but that’s as far as I’ve taken it.

It’s not definitive as I suspect some are either placed incorrectly / in error or are irrelevant (we don’t know how many of the Yggdrasil systems are intentionally placed and which aren’t).

I’m in the process of finding time to plot anarchy (Chaos?) systems into this relationship, however memory serves that they may not correlate, but plotting them might confirm this..
