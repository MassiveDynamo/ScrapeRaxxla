My concerns with Sargasso Sea of Space is that yes it kind of is a gateway but it is also a kind of time trap or anomaly in space-time at worst and at best just a boring Lagrange point. Talmor Lens was built to control time. Control is lacking here (though I admit concept of Sargasso Sea of Space is really cool). Further, we have that recent capture that appears to show our ships upload telemetry before jumps. I suspect Raxxla is going to be something else that allowed Humans to somehow have better control over Witchspace or similar. The Dark Wheel myths treats it like if they found Raxxla (not a given) that it would confer power or access to something unique. Plus, Sargasso Sea of Space just really doesn't really connect well to the Raxxla Codex other than being close and linking other science fiction universes. So, I don't know whether to think this is it or hope for something more. I don't know.. I guess the quest continues.
