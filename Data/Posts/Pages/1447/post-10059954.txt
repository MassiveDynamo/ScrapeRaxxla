A nice relationship link there, between Holdstock and Yggdrasil. I’ll insert that into the key information of the Milton / Yggdrasil Conundrum. O7

I couldn’t make out much of the second picture (I’m on mobile so my ancient eyes aren’t too clear, need an augment). But the text doesn’t seem to highlight anything new, nor draw any new interpretations, but then again maybe it needn’t.

As a link relationship it helps establish another reason for Brookes to insert Yggdrasil, other than him having an affinity for T-Shirts…maybe the description utilised by Holdstock was the primary basis for its layout in game?

I’m of the persuasion the Yggdrasil structure is intentional, but likely formed part of some grandiose Raxxla narrative arc of Brookes, linked to the old PF/DW missions, now retconned.

If true then some semblance may still hold in game physically, but we don’t know how or why; I suspect it was mission driven, but likely those triggers are now gone, all we have is a ghost.

But there is hope this archeological structure has some root in the current game, how and why remains a mystery.

The only clue we have linking Yggdrasil in game to Raxxla, is the station ‘Donars Oak’ - ‘the world tree of the Chatti’…at Delphi, that being the home of the Omphalos…is this an intentional clue or just a coincidence; the Codex very likely was written without Brookes input; there may be content in game Brookes designed that FD do not know of or consider unrelated.
