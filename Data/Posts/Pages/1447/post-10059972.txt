I couldn’t make out much of the second picture (I’m on mobile so my ancient eyes aren’t too clear, need an augment). But the text doesn’t seem to highlight anything new, nor draw any new interpretations, but then again maybe it needn’t.
Acheron. Near the beginning of the second line of the second page.



Acheron is older name for the for one of the rivers of Hades per Wikipedia. Where is Achenar located? Achenar is at the end of the constellation Eridanus (it is also known by the Bayer designation of Alpha Eridani). This also is linked to the rivers of Hades.



In other words, the Voyager 1 and New Horizons probes may be meant to highlight the direction of Yggradasil/World Tree/Axis Mundi:

Hades/Roots/Underworld - Achenar
Earth/where the tree leaves soil - Sol
Heavens/Olympus/Valhalla - Polaris

I believe this should be nearly a straight line. It would also mean Sol runs at least a solid chance of being the Omphalos (navel of the world). Though, still not sure that would imply Omphalos Rift is in Sol itself. Nearby possibly. However, Sol is certainly the navel or center of colonization.
