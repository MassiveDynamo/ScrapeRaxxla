Question for the thread as a whole:

Has any work been done to see if there is an alignment pattern amongst the cultural neighborhoods of the Bubble? Meaning where the respective Heaven/Earth/Hell would result in a similar directional pattern to other cultural neighborhoods. I would think if this were a hint it would work consistently on the micro-scale of the cultural neighborhoods of systems as well as the macro-scale of the Bubble itself.

I ask mainly because my research has been macro-scale of the Bubble itself. If you want something to seem important, you would want to have the lesson show up repeatedly.
