I personally would love to find smugglers junction. However I don't actually think it's in game. And why would it be? Tionisla orbital cemetery isn't even in game and I don't even think that would be hard to do. Just put a whole bunch of corroded-paint various ships in fixed positions on poi, right?
Right, but that might be part of the finishing touches they can't do until the game is a bit more, finished.
