Maybe you should turn to the history of the game? a rider is featured in a holdstock report. it means the novel is a dark wheel, most likely a canon. Maybe here is not a love affair? itâ€™s just translated into Russian that it says about loved ones that does not mean love. it is to be love for relatives. Not sure if Google translates correctly.

Over the grief of the fathers. perhaps it says about grief that Neptune and Oberon quarreled, the father is upset.

for the sorrow of loved ones. As you know, in the novel in Alexa there was a partner, a clone. delightfully they had a love line.
I just translated my message. Google translator fails, greatly distorted the essence.....I will try again as simple as possible)
Holdstock mentions the rider family. then probably the novel is a canon. The grief of the fathers - the sons of Alex quarreled. Alex also had a co-pilot, this is a girl, it seems a clone. I think Google will not let you down
