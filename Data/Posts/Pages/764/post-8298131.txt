Holdstock mentions the rider family. then probably the novel is a canon. The grief of the fathers - the sons of Alex quarreled. Alex also had a co-pilot, this is a girl, it seems a clone. I think Google will not let you down

& @Filthmick420: I think neither the Holdstock novella nor AHTW are now canon, though I may be wrong.
I’m totally confused about what is canon nowadays! Perhaps the next update should be called “Elite Retconned”.

Though the Ryder link may be valid for the DW toast, it could be worth pursuing! However I think it is fairly clear from what the codex says, and the DB Gamereactor “story that embraces all the players" interview, that the DW invitation will be triggered by some set of Commander statistics on your “personal journey” through the game and cannot be found until then.
