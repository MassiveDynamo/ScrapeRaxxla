Holdstock mentions the rider family. then probably the novel is a canon. The grief of the fathers - the sons of Alex quarreled. Alex also had a co-pilot, this is a girl, it seems a clone. I think Google will not let you down

And here the wheel also mentioned is the Ryder family and I'm under the impression it was made not canon. I'm not a hundred percent sure because they don't verify whats Canon and what's not anywhere do they?
Yes, it's mostly believed these days that the old lore may have been retconned.
But these systems do hold a magic spell over us regardless.

Anyway, my previous post was just to try to bring a smile to your lips.
