It was! But I enjoyed the read, however not convinced. I’m not really in favour of the mythological approach, as I’ve said before. The trouble is that the various mythologies (all of them Greek, Roman, etc etc) are full of characters that could fit TDW toast. Doomed lovers, parental grief etc are a common theme. How do we narrow down the choices?
Maybe you should turn to the history of the game? a rider is featured in a holdstock report. it means the novel is a dark wheel, most likely a canon. Maybe here is not a love affair? it’s just translated into Russian that it says about loved ones that does not mean love. it is to be love for relatives. Not sure if Google translates correctly.

Over the grief of the fathers. perhaps it says about grief that Neptune and Oberon quarreled, the father is upset.

for the sorrow of loved ones. As you know, in the novel in Alexa there was a partner, a clone. delightfully they had a love line.
