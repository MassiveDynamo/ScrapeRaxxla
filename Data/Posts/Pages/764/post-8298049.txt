Comedic value probably lost in translation. [Edit: Those four systems were in the original 1984 version.]
I think those systems are all named in 'the dark wheel' novella too. It would be a cool way to have a out in the open but not necessarily obvious clue that is super obvious once noticed.

I'd be a complete liar if I said I hadn't been on my galmap lately trying to run a line off of this arrow to see anything that might be in a direct line. There's a few stars almost on a direct line and I only went so far and pretty much on the same plane as lave.

But who's to say my line was even straight or to the correct degree because im completely capable of simple error . Im not gonna go runnin off in my ship along that line, unless i something too coincidental. Might be pointing to the dark wheel station instead
