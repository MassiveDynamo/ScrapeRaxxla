And here the wheel also mentions the Ryder family and I'm under the impression it was made not canon. I'm not a hundred percent sure because they don't verify whats Canon and what's not anywhere do they?
Yeah, I thought The Dark Wheel shipped with Elite in 84 was no longer canon for some reason or other?
