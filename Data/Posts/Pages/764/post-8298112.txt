According to my records there's four: Sol / Triton, Sol / Moon (the one near Earth), Lave 2 and Diso 5C.

Included a list of permits you should still be able to get via military rank, exploration data or missions here.

Ah yes, I’d forgotten those.
I recall something (perhaps in this thread??) along the lines that FD locked the Moon to avoid people complaining about discrepancies with the real thing, while Lave 2 was locked at the request of the author of the relevant book (Alan Stroud?). Don’t remember anything about Diso.
