Holdstock mentions the rider family. then probably the novel is a canon. The grief of the fathers - the sons of Alex quarreled. Alex also had a co-pilot, this is a girl, it seems a clone. I think Google will not let you down
And here the wheel also mentions the Ryder family and I'm under the impression it was made not canon. I'm not a hundred percent sure because they don't verify whats Canon and what's not anywhere do they?
