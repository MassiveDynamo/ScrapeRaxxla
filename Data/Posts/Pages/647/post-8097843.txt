The 7 ly limit, was a Galcop Cobra specific limit. It probably means nothing.

The Art and Cora story is from 2296. It's a time of explosive expansion.
2270s - Second attempt to terra-form Mars started.
2280s - Discovery of first non-human relic in space. Origin still unknown in 3200.
2290s - First man "outside" on Mars (ie breathing unaided) on completion of terraforming.
2300s - Remaining indigenous life on Tau Ceti 3 preserved in special enclosures.
2310s - News of elimination of a reputedly sentient race on Achenar 6d by private colonists causes outrage in the Federation. Achenar refuses to join Federation, many terra-forming projects started.
I think the Mars relic may have contained info on Raxxla. That's why it has been kept hidden for a thousand years.
The Imps had managed to wipe out the Mudlarks by 2310, so people could probably get to Achenar in the 2290s.
If you can go to Achenar, you can go anywhere. It took time though. You lost a week per jump, with the pre-frameshift drives.

I would think they could manage a few kly on a well planed expedition.

2250s for arrival in Achenar (mid 23rd Century anyway)

2290s for Colonisation of Capitol and formation of the Republic.

(IIRC, anyway. I’ve got it all in a post somewhere in this thread, but it’s from the period that the search function doesn’t work for.)
