I wonder if it's worth building a "research" vessel that's deliberately limited to a 7Ly range?
I don't think so. The restricted jump maps of the original game was linked to the Calcop Pilots license. In lore(not in the game), an Elite Pilot could apply for a 'ful jump license'. This would allow you to travel unrestricted in the same way as federal, imperial or independent pilots probably could, at that time.

All Dark Wheel members were Elite. I would assume that those with a Galcop background, had the ful jump license.

All the info on the Galcop Pilot licensing are described in Imprint: http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/elite/books/imprint/

Imprint is like The Dark Wheel. Not quite canon. It seem to have been written partly to explain the transition from the Elite galaxies to the FE:2 galaxy.

There is nothing about Raxxla in Imprint, but it tells a story of Galcop being under great external pressure form pirates, thargoids and shady groups with support from other powers in the galaxy.
