So, in other words the entire game could be based on the premise that the real world lack of stars is just a list of planets the map company allows us to visit. And there is an entire different world we are restricted from right around us. Full of populated planets, also, like we are trapped in some cage and are guinea pigs?!

ED was initially supposed to have dark systems. Systems that wasn't shown on the galmap until you explored them. Unfortunately this was scraped. I don't think FD managed to make a sensible mechanic for manually plotting jumps, before release.
Removing all the brown dwarfs from the map at a later point would probably just look silly.
I don't think there are any systems in ED that we cant see in the map.

Then again, who knows. There could be one.
