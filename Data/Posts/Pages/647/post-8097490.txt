And in 2296 Raxxla was already being described effectively as a 'myth/rumour/fairy-tale' in the context of disbelieving a pirate map and 'might as well find Raxxla while we're at it'

So that implies the story originates much earlier to have become a myth by this point, when were 1st probes sent out and FTL/Jump achieved? Where was the human bubble at that point? Disused Star Station for DW implies we had been, built and abandoned for some reason, which takes time. What happened between 2100 and 2280s and taking above post in mind, is that relevant, has it been RPd into the building of Raxxla in game as that would limit its location?

But, the fact that the entire human race forgot about the Thargoids could mean that it was the 2280s discovery of non-human relic a mere 16 years earlier at most from Cora story and it being a myth already.
