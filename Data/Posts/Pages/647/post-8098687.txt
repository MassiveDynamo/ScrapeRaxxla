Has nobody suggested that the reason Raxxla would've been known at all since (or before) the discovery of the Martian Relic, was because of dreams? The "visions" of Halsey and Gan could've been happening for Eons, and that's why the Dark Wheel became so hellbent on Raxxla. The Dark Wheel were once well known for chasing all sorts of legends, and Raxxla possibly became such a big deal because they did the research, and realized many different people from around the different old worlds were all having similar dreams and connected the dots. They maybe investigated and discovered something about these dreams that proved (to them) that Raxxla was no simple dream, that it was a real place, and THATS how to wider galaxy learned OF Raxxla. Eventually the DW realized being so open about what they knew and were up to was a bad idea, and went fully "Dark" and underground so to speak. Eventually the DW themselves faded into mere stories. If this theory is true; then Raxxla could be Guardian related and far from the bubble, as these "dreams" could be broadcasted to the whole galaxy from anywhere. My best guess is its in a distant system, not yet reachable (but not permit locked).
NGC 1245?!
