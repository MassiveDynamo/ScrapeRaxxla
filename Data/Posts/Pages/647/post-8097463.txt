gl Alexzk, if genuine error it should be sorted out but you may not be able to play on Linux for a bit

7LY - Just to clarify. In the 1984 game we had 8 'Galaxies' that needed a special Jump but you could travel to any system within each galaxy via series of 7LY jumps. Total distance was unaffected by 7LY range, just a series of jumps. At least one planet had only one 'entry' system, only 1 other system within 7LY of it and often a few of these together so you could get in and out 1 way only on a route through 3 or 4 systems. 7LY did not restrict from jumping 1000s of LY across 8 Galaxies - time was much less important as we could speed up time. Every system was reachable from somewhere.

In todays game the systems are X LY apart and we had/have Y LY range but time is much more important. Generation ships couldn't jump as such so the actual total distance is much more relevant and restrictive in todays game than in the 7LY range of 1984 if you see what I mean.

It would take a lot longer in todays game to jump to the other side of the Galaxy than to reach the furthest point of the 8th Galaxy in 1984 even with the 7LY range as time and distance works differently. Time means much more and restricts distance today.

And I don't know which version of time Raxxla was built in, in game, in production. In 1984 game it could be anywhere, in todays version it 'should' have 'limitations' on where it can be.

I am not saying we need a 7LY ship or anything like that
