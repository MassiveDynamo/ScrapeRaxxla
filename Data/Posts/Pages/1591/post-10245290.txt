Nysa - home of the Hyades Nymphs

Nysa is in game and situated close to Achenar. Many of the systems in this area have a similar link to concepts of an underworld or lost / sunken kingdoms.

Within the marriage between Persephone (daughter of the goddess Demeter) and the god of the Underworld, Pluto. Nysa proudly boasted a sanctuary of Pluto and Core (Persephone), as well as a cave thought to provide an entrance directly into the Underworld.

Persephone was also guarded by Sirens while picking flowers in , thatâ€™s also the location where Hades abducted her!
Been thinking about the golden thread in relation to Zeus... Anyone remember why they added Persephone to Sol? Pluto being Hades and therefore the underworld...
