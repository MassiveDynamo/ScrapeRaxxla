Circling around back to Egyptian symbology... With Mehet-Weret as the celestial Cow and mother of Ra – she wears the Eye of Ra… as do other goddesses in the line who perform as mother goddesses. Isis even “steals” magical powers from Ra which could be symbolized in the Eye.

Looking at the Thargoid Symbol the Orion Nebula in game and the symbol from the Garden... they appear to be related. I think they are all the Eye of RA.

Egyptian myth related to the constellation Sah (Orion) has him as father of the gods with his consort as Sopdet (Sirius). Sah was later replaced with Osiris and in his dying and rising aspect - dwells in Orion after being resurrected. It is also where the Pharaohs soul goes.

The path would be the Ladder of Horus (see Ascension-Myth paper below)...think Jacobs Ladder.. the Golden Chain. Which initially in my mind leads to the Sun door followed by a journey across the “river” the milky way to the gateway to the duat. In Orion?
