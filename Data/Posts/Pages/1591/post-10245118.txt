Not sure what you are speaking to here exactly but when i first made that view of the compass points- I did compare it against Polaris (earths pole) and Cats Eye Nebula ( solar system north pole)â€¦. Cant say that it made much difference - if anything it matched those less. I took those things out as it just cluttered the map. The thing i was trying to point out was the pattern of the compass point systems themselves.
Won't Gamma Cephei be closer to the celestial pole in 3300's?
