The Guardian of the East gates

Going over Paradise Lost for various directional insight and recalled how the archangel Michael guarded the east gate of Paradise…

I now don’t believe the system Michel and Sopedu are intentional nor mark a reference to the guardianship of eastern gates due to the presence of a player driven faction occupying much of this area!

In an attempt to clarify this data anomaly a support ticket was raised, FD responded stating no comment.
