Don't worry im always doing this myself!
The main issue is that within paganism there are many different interpretations that very from country to country, nothing in the early years was ever written down and in later years passed from mouth to ear due to Christian persecution.
Also it has to be said that some of these folks may not have existed at all.

Many of course also interpreted things from their point of view ie Geoffrey of Monmouth's telling of Artorian legend is from a Catholic perspective, not wrong just an opinion based on his beliefs.

Agree, but the initial assumption was incorrect, based upon random open source search and the Google analytics algorithm ‘pushing’ the most popular answer (irrelevant of its accuracy) to the top. I do honestly appreciate the feedback, one of the reasons for this thread is to learn from such insights.

It’s possible FD didn’t delve so deep, or maybe they did, thing is the link is real and that’s enough O7.
