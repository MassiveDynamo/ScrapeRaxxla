Was the Gan Romero story reflected in-game?
The Gan Romero storyline was always envisaged as an off-camera narrative. The fact that some people assumed it had an in-game component, and went searching for Romero, was for me further evidence that off-camera GalNet stories could be detrimental to the player experience, and cemented our desire to ensure that all GalNet content related to things that were actually in the game.
No one found anything and FD confirmed that there were no Gan Romero NPC flying around.
There could still be something hidden in Vega.
It would not surprice me If there is a sound clue, somewhere in the system.
