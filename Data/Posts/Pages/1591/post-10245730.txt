A few days ago I tried to argue that Vega and the other Pole stars, were the most likely candidates for Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1589#post-10240706

Now I think Vega fits quite well with the Dark Wheel toast as well.
- "To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!".
Vega is known as the Jewel of the Lyre / Jewel of the Harp. I does also sit just above the main visible band of the Milky Way.


- "To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!"
Gan Romero was in Vega when he was called by 'voices that didnâ€™t come from anything with a body'. Vega is also the main star in the constellation Lyra, that represents Orpheus' Lyre. That Lyre was magical and "could charm the birds, fish and wild beasts, coax the trees and rocks into dance". It also helped the Argonauts get safely past the Sirens.

- "The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!"
The story of Vega and Altair as the cow heard and the weaver girl is a story of parent's grief, the lover's woe. To Raxxla signifies that Vega is where the journey must start. It's not the goal. This is reinforced by the fact that Gan Romero stole a ship that was fitted for long range exploration.
