Taliesin was a magician Druid who ruled Annwn, the Celtic Otherworld!
Not sure on your source for that old bean but Taliesin was not the ruler of Annwn.

His only connection to the 'Otherworld' is that he described crossing the sea to it in an 'Imramma' (adventure) - Mysteries Of Druidry by Brendon Cathbad Myers.
He does write about the four realms according to Irish and Welsh Druidry:
Annwn (Ah-noo-in) - the chaotic underworld ruled by Arawn, god of the dead and (father of the human race)
Abred (EH-breth) - The mortal realm (Midgard to our northern brothers)
Gwynfyd (Goo-in-fith) - realm of the spirits - all pagans true home and the equivalent of Folkvangr in Norse.
Ceugant (Coy-gant) - Realm of the Gods - Valhalla

We have lots of story's from this chap, he was the Welsh main poet who travelled many lands solving problems.
It was allegedly he who solved King Iud-hael dreams and wrote many poems that are still used today in druidic rituals.
There is some good details in 'Celtic Visions' by Caitlin Matthews, will dust it off and see if there is anything that may help.
