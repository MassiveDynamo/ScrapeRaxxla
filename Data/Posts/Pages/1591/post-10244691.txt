Don't worry im always doing this myself!
The main issue is that within paganism there are many different interpretations that very from country to country, nothing in the early years was ever written down and in later years passed from mouth to ear due to Christian persecution.
Also it has to be said that some of these folks may not have existed at all.

Many of course also interpreted things from their point of view ie Geoffrey of Monmouth's telling of Artorian legend is from a Catholic perspective, not wrong just an opinion based on his beliefs.
