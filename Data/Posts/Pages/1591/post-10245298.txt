Been thinking about the golden thread in relation to Zeus... Anyone remember why they added Persephone to Sol? Pluto being Hades and therefore the underworld...

Ya ive wondered about that too - after adding all the new bits they still wanted a connection to the underworld to be on the edge of the solar system i think.
