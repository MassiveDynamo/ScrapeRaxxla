- "The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!"
The story of Vega and Altair as the cow heard and the weaver girl is a story of parent's grief, the lover's woe. To Raxxla signifies that Vega is where the journey must start. It's not the goal. This is reinforced by the fact that Gan Romero stole a ship that was fitted for long range exploration.
Was the Gan Romero story reflected in-game?
The Gan Romero storyline was always envisaged as an off-camera narrative. The fact that some people assumed it had an in-game component, and went searching for Romero, was for me further evidence that off-camera GalNet stories could be detrimental to the player experience, and cemented our desire to ensure that all GalNet content related to things that were actually in the game.
