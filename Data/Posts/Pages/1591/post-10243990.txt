Just found a system: Taliesin

One source shows this might be a Welsh origin name meaning “Radiant Brow“ that’s interesting!

It was also the name of a 6th century Welsh bard between 534 and 599 in the courts of three kings of Britain, and is associated with the Book of Taliesin, a text from the 10th century containing his poems: ‘The life of Taliesin was mythologised in the mid 16th century by Elis Gruffydd, whose account drew from Celtic folklore and existing oral tradition’.

I still find this interesting considering it’s relative locality to other Celtic named systems within the lost realms sector.
