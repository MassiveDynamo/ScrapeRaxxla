It's funny you should mention this, because (a LONG time ago) I recall a topic talking about that exact galaxy. For some reason I remember it as the "spinning top galaxy", but using google-fu I cannot find a reference to it now. It looks like a colliding galaxy - so I refer to others here about which galaxy it is. How come nobody has not noticed this before?
You might want to raise this with Erimus Kamsel or Dr Kaii since they seem to have been behind much of the galactic mapping efforts
