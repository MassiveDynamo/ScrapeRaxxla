Anyone else spotted that the andromeda galaxy in the skybox is rather odd. Above pic shows the ED in game image on the left and the visible spectrum image from univ. of wiki. on the right to a similar scale. Pink??? and distinctly the wrong shape, and nowhere near big enough

They went to the trouble of including M110, so why is the rest of it completely wrong? I guess what I'm getting at is - poor workmanship or deliberate act?

It's funny you should mention this, because (a LONG time ago) I recall a topic talking about that exact galaxy. For some reason I remember it as the "spinning top galaxy", but using google-fu I cannot find a reference to it now. It looks like a colliding galaxy - so I refer to others here about which galaxy it is. How come nobody has not noticed this before?
