That could still be "parallel" in terms of the original 84 Elite that had eight galaxies, so maybe 4 and 8, or 3 and 6 while it seems all of them may be contained within the same Milky Way in the current version.

Edit: In 84 Elite it cost 5000CR for every galactic jump and the drives themselves were hard to find, tech level 10+ I think, so being able to cover half the 'map' from galaxy 4 to 8 in a single hop, or even being able to select which one of the eight you wanted to go to would be a huge time, cash and effort saving.
