Possibly, but that I guess would be virtual universe(s), not the real universe. FD definitely said there is only one universe in ED.

But the Codex says the Omphalos Rift theory was discredited, which seems like a big hint from FD. Still think that any gateway relating to Raxxla is just part of the myth, i.e. it may not be true, or may be only partially true. Hence my previous speculation on an old station named “Raxxla Gateway”, or guardian or thargoid planet-ship (since a ship is a type of gateway taking the inhabitants to different places, etc.

I agree that the Guardian AI is highly likely to be still around. I suspect the number of permit-locked large areas of space (got another one to get around this week on last leg to Beagle Point) means there are (1) several disparate groups of them &/or (2) other alien civilisations yet to be found. Thargoids still exist, so Guardians may also. Just so long as its not the bug blatter beasts of traal!

Regor Sector (parallel to the Guardian sites) is still permit locked, as is much of the Horse Head Nebula which has a totally bizarre, bottom of a cube like star formation within it.
