It's not discredited if Princess Astrohphel and Spiraling Stars contains concealed facts about Raxxla's location. Some tried to discredit it, because "these details [...] bear a striking resemblance to the children's story".

Edit: It's not a virtual, but parallel universe.

The story was discredited by people who don't know where Raxxla is. Some other people that don't know where Raxxla is, believe the author of PAaSS knows and has left hints.

Both opinions are made by people who are more or less as clueless as us.

I don't think virtual, parallel or other universes make much of a difference either. The story is vague enough for all to fit.
