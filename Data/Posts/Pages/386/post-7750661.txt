I The Dark Wheel it says: "on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes".

Construct is the same word FD uses for the sentient Guardaian AI. I doubt that that's a coincidence.

A two million years old, hyper advanced synthetic species that viped out their own creators and left without a trace.
With the Monolith network still fully operational, they are probably not gone. They could well have made all kinds of artificial universes and still be in the Milky way.
