Regor Sector (parallel to the Guardian sites) is still permit locked, as is much of the Horse Head Nebula which has a totally bizarre, bottom of a cube like star formation within it.

Edit: Collecting reference system names, standby...
Corner 1: Oochorrs AH-Q C20-6
Corner 2: Col 70 Sector PC-U C3-2
Corner 3: Col 70 Sector DA-Q D5-11
Corner 4: Col 70 Sector BR-C C13-0
Note: Can't get in most of them, obviously. Set bookmarks and view in Galmap
