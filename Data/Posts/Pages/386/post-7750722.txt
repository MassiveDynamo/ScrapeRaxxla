It's funny you should mention this, because (a LONG time ago) I recall a topic talking about that exact galaxy. For some reason I remember it as the "spinning top galaxy", but using google-fu I cannot find a reference to it now. It looks like a colliding galaxy - so I refer to others here about which galaxy it is. How come nobody has not noticed this before?
Can this help to refresh your memory?
