I read somewhere that a lot of system descriptions were written by players. I remeber asking support about one that in the description stated the system harboured a dark secret. They replied to say it had been submitted by a player.

Players were asked to submit recommendations and descriptions for interesting places/sights for tourist beacons. It is possible that FD incorporated some of those comments into the sysmap descriptions.
