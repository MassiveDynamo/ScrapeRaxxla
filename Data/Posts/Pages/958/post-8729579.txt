Hi @Jorki Rasalas. I wish.

There have been a number of discussions among the hard-core bookworms and nobody (that I know of) has come to a firm answer yet. My personal default position on CGs comes from Society, though, who knows?

"Indeed," Society replied. "We've given them all sorts of financial enticements to stay away from any areas of interest, naturally. Community goals promising rich rewards seem to retain their allure for the most part. For the determined, we provide other enticements, luring them into areas where they can be... embroiled in some unfortunate accident in the depths of space."
"Exterminated," Exo said. "Like the infestation they are."
