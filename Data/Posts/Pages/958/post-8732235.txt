Now that Galnet is back I’m back. Has anyone given some more thought to the fact that we were given carrosion resistant cargo racks and 3 alien devices and that was the end of it, just a spinning star map. I still believe those are the keys. Not to Col Sector but something else. Those 3 Alien devices are searching for something, probably in a place they can’t reach (within the bubble).
