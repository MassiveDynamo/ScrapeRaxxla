Point of Order!
Empire is invading Eurybia, accusing Eurybia Blue Mafia of having links to NMLA and asserting that the explosives were created by Liz Ryder & delivered on cargo transports linked to the Eurybia Blue Mafia. There is no evidence supplied to support the hypothesis that EBM are Marlinists, or have links to them, nor that the explosives were so delivered or indeed created by Liz Ryder.

This may be a Club attempt to disrupt The Dark Wheel, assuming that Liz has hereditary links to TDW. Indeed it could be a Club response to Erlaed's anti-Club initiatives!

as an afterthought, it may even be The Club trying to flush out TDW and find out who they are, since all known members (Luko, Rebecca, Salomé, Elyssia) were killed off, just as we have no real confirmation (though several educated hypotheses after reading Premonition) of who is in The Club.


Mmm, or maybe it’s a TDW test to see who can be relied on to defend Liz, in which case how could they discriminate to test if those defenders were actually The Club infiltrators? ...... ........ .................

Paranoia here we come, here we come, here we come,
Paranoia here we come, STOP!
