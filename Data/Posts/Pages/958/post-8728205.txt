Point of Order!
Empire is invading Eurybia, accusing Eurybia Blue Mafia of having links to NMLA and asserting that the explosives were created by Liz Ryder & delivered on cargo transports linked to the Eurybia Blue Mafia. There is no evidence supplied to support the hypothesis that EBM are Marlinists, or have links to them, nor that the explosives were so delivered or indeed created by Liz Ryder.

This may be a Club attempt to disrupt The Dark Wheel, assuming that Liz has hereditary links to TDW. Indeed it could be a Club response to Erlaed's anti-Club initiatives!
Still kind of falls in to AHTW plot line too... (now with less CIEP)
