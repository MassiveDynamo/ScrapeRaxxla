I read somewhere that a lot of system descriptions were written by players. I remeber asking support about one that in the description stated the system harboured a dark secret. They replied to say it had been submitted by a player.
The Nuentes description has been there since release. This was well before player factions. Authors and high tier kick-starters were the only players to have descriptions, in game.
