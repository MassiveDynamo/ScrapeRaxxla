I think this may have been a kickstarter award.
It appears so... and now I have more videos to trawl for insights!

Pledge £4,500 or more
The writer’s pack: The right to write one piece of written fiction set in the Elite: Dangerous world, and (subject to reasonable approval of the content) release it commercially, without paying Frontier further royalties, independently of the game. This category includes all the rewards above. Frontier will cooperate to allow the system name, commander name, planet name, planet description, space station names to be positioned and used in a way to support the fiction within the game. Frontier will also help publicise your title at the time of release of “Elite: Dangerous”, as long as it is finished at that point, alongside the official sequel to “The Dark Wheel”.

Travel: Travel across star systems and between them. Risk leaving the relative safety of the Corporate-run space station to explore distant planets or stars. Space is big and you never know what you might find; perhaps a salvageable freighter wreck or some valuable asteroids? There are secrets and startling beauty waiting to be discovered by the intrepid explorer.

Btw, what was the official sequel to The Dark Wheel?
