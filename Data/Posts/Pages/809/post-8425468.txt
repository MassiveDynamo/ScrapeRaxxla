The people who make the fake Raxxla hoaxes are doing it for one single reason: Attention. There's literally no other reason to make a fake hoax, they get their views and they get off on it. If they actually found Raxxla they'd post the actual location because they'd go down in Elite history and get TONS of attention for it.

It's happened so many times, it really doesn't need to derail the thread for two pages lol
