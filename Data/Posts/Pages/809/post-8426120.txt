It doesnt necessarily autocorrect. It will take you to a system that starts with whatever was typed or has whatever was typed in system like a planet or station name. For example if you type of Meredith City into the search bar lft 926 will come up. If you type PSR and search you can keep searching it'll cycle through all of the psrs.

Edit: Also some/most if not all stars have multiple designations. they're listed on its info
