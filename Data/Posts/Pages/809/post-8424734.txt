Hmmm...was farming imperial ranks ...got mission from "mysterious stranger" to find & scan some crashed explorer....
Sounds like DW ...

Damn, google says that: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/mysterious-stranger-tip-off.382789/
I.e. .... nothing special >:

...but it seems perfect place to hide dw ... like do 20+ such a missions and DW will contact you ... maybe I will bother some to do, it can be triggered doing couple missions to new fraction each time.
