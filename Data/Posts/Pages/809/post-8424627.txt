There's too many thargoid sympathizers in the galaxy. Im not one to support genocide but when it comes to humanity vs tharganity , I know which side im on.
Typical human mistake. Once we speak about local animals, we must support them and take care, because we evolved together and cannot live on Earth for too long if we change too fast animals present (that what we see actually now - covid19 happened because we broke animals balance, because without helping "home" animals and airplanes virus had no chances to spread so wide and fast.).
Any way, thargoids is different story. They're not part we need to live. They are threat. So you can stop here altruism and act as protecting from threat. If they fill like they're dying species they can start to talk to us, until then no mercy.
