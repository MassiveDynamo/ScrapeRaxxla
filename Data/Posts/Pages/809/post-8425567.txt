Did anybody try already to do "mysterious stranger" quest many times, like 20-30-50 ?
Google found some people do 5-7 times and said it is trash. But it seems very convenient option to hide DW there.
As I understood, each time you do 4+ quests for some new fraction (for u) you may get that random invite. So it fits DW lore - getting 30 such invites proves you're "elite" as you did many quests.

When you say “quests” do you mean “missions”? Particular types of missions?
