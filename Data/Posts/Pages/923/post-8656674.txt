When a planet speaks to you?

Second 1, 16 and 29.... I thought I was suffering from space madness when the planet asked me to speak.... recorded it and shoved it in audacity (one copy normal volume and one amplified... I take no responsibility for your hearing...)

Can you hear it or am I mad?
And has anyone noticed this before?

Now how do you speak to a planet?
