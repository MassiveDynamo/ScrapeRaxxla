No no. This is the sound of old scanner, the one that happens when you target planet and a circle is spinning at the left panel - this is the sound of it. This is left over from old scanning and I hear it all the time near objects.

AHHHHH ya ... so likely a bug . I knew id heard it before but it was so out of place and i couldnt figure out what triggered it. Thanks!
