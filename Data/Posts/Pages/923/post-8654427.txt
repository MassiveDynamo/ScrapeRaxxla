I could tell you stuff, but its confidential.

Is that how it works?
"Pssst!
Yeah you! Hey!
Psst!
....I've figured out another possible Sanskrit etymology for Raxxla, ऋक्ष. It means star, constellation, lunar mansion, a star under which one is born among other things. It derives from Proto-Indo-European *h₂ŕ̥tḱos, meaning bear, lot of cognates in another Indo-European languages, like Hittite. Now, Proto-Indo-European "h₃rḗǵs" and "reyǵ-" are good possible candidates too, but "*h₂ŕ̥tḱos" opens up a whole new world of bronze age mythologies for interpretation. This stuff is confidential remember, so keep your mouth shut about this okay?"
