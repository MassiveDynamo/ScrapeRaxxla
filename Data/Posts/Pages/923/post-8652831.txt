Without going into too much detail to protect a confidential source but does this picture mean anything to anybody

Hmmm i want confidential sources! Sounds fun. There was an odd noise i got in one system after discovery scan and again after detailed scan... but never was quite sure what it was signaling. I think i posted it a while back. Been meaning to dig into it a bit more... wasnt sure if it was some kind of notification tied to the codex or what.
