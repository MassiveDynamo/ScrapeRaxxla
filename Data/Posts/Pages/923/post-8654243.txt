Ah ok so a correction - the weird sound started as I jumped into the system for roughly 20 seconds and again when i come out of the discovery scanner.... No one else run into this?

SPOILER: NOISE SPECTROGRAM
Kinda sounds like some aboriginal musical instrument....
Maybe its the sound of an Iynx Wheel ? hmmm might have to go back and see if i can repeat that...
