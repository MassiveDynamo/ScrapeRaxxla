Ah ok so a correction - the weird sound started as I jumped into the system for roughly 20 seconds and again when i come out of the discovery scanner.... No one else run into this?
SPOILER: THE NOISE

Kinda sounds like some aboriginal musical instrument....
Maybe its the sound of an Iynx Wheel ? hmmm might have to go back and see if i can repeat that...
No no. This is the sound of old scanner, the one that happens when you target planet and a circle is spinning at the left panel - this is the sound of it. This is left over from old scanning and I hear it all the time near objects.
