Last time I tried it wast't possible. I know some cmdrs has the permit though.

With regards to Mingfu - its on the list of "This system is locked by the Pilot's Federation, no permits are currently issued." types, but it has the relatively unusual permit message of "access to this system has been denied " - only this and Witch's reach have that exact wording.

Does this mean it was a (relatively) recent permit lock?

Perhaps if someone does have the permit they'd like to confirm how they got it?
