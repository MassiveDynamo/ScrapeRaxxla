I think that's a valid theory; Raxxla in the bubble, not pingable, but only will appear when nearby, far off from any stars (dark planet?). Currently reviewing 18 hours supercuise in Shinrarta Dezhra headed for Lave.

Make sure you're not flying faster than 2-300L/PS. You only have a 1000 LS detection capability to detect an anomaly if you're looking for anything within the normal 'surprise' mechanisms. Same as with the Voyagers.
That should give you 3-4 seconds to detect it and slow down before it's gone again.
