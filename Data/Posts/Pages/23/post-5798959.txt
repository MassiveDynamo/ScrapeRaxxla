it's this line that bother's me a bit:



Seems like whatever version of Raxxla is in-game, it may not be in keeping with the original idea (Despite the bitterness of the quote). I have a sinking feeling also that whatever version of Raxxla is in-game will be non-interactive and/or behind a permit lock.

I wouldn't put a lot of stock in that particular quote. While I'm sure that some of Bell's bitterness is justified I think his criticism of Elite: Dangerous has more to do with his history with David Braben then the game itself or its "limitations". Ian Bell's own website features collections of examples where the media or publishers of the official Elite: Dangerous fiction have failed to mention him alongside DB when crediting him as the creator of the Elite franchise.

Since we don't know exactly "what" Raxxla is (or how it would be realized in-game) it's not possible to rule out the likelihood of it existing in the game as it is now.
