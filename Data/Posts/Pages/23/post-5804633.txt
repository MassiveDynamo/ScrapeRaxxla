Make sure you're not flying faster than 2-300L/PS. You only have a 1000 LS detection capability to detect an anomaly if you're looking for anything within the normal 'surprise' mechanisms. Same as with the Voyagers.
That should give you 3-4 seconds to detect it and slow down before it's gone again.

Maybe starting at Earth and flying in the direction of Lave might reveal something? Earth being the most important planet to humanity and Lave being the most important planet to old-school Elite fans.
