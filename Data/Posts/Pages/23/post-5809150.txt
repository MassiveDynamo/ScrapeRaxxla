It is quite exciting to think there is an undiscovered gateway out there, that could lead to another galaxy, where untold riches or new high tech awaits. While we won't actively be searching for it every day, we will keep my eyes and ears open at every station and in every system. We may even set my jumps to economical and start scanning every system from one point to the other.

I can't see FD programming a second universe only accessible via "Raxxla". I suspect that the Raxxla that DB/MB have confirmed is within game and for which there will be no clues (suggesting no lore is applicable) will only be a metaphorical treasure and a literal dead end. But it's nice to have something to look for!
