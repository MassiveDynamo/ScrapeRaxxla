I wouldn't say that searching for Raxxla right now is a lost cause. This is THE big puzzle of the Elite universe.

Raxxla.

Everyone and their dog knows about Raxxla.

When Jason Ryder, moments before his death, spoke that word to his son Alex ... Alex had no idea what the word meant. It was foreign to him. Totally alien.

Flash forward to the year 3303 and Raxxla is now a brand name (and no, I don't mean guitar pedals).

We have "The Children of Raxxla" advertising the place in their faction name. Salome speaking about Raxxla from Beagle Point and stating that it was first mentioned "in Federation data banks on Earth in 2814".

I just really have to wonder ... what happened in the galaxy that something so obscure that Alex Ryder had never heard of suddenly becomes so prominent that an independent minor faction includes it in their name?

Ah, so on her tour round the Sol system Salom√© was actually investigating the Fed databanks for any hint on the Rift and/or Raxxla; thanks, that finally makes sense-I had wondered about her Beagle Point reference to Raxxla. So it is a widespread urban (galactic) myth by 3302/3. As an Imp Senator she probably would also have been given some sight of the Alien Artefact.

I'm in the process of catching up on this thread, and just my off the wall thought process, but has anyone considered Raxxla might be Triton? It is permit-locked, it is visited by Fed military ships (I've watched them), it is a landable moon of Neptune (i.e. ties in with Neptune Ryder), is at the heart of the bubble, "Triton" & "Raxxla" have the same number of letters- I'm no good with codes but it may be an encryption of the name...
