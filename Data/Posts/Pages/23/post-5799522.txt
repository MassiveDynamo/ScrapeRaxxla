Oh well, more useless speculation.

Useless speculation is just about all we really have
The novel referes to humands and sentient alien races living side by side. This is not in line with ED canon. Therefore whatever was in the Dark Wheel is open to revision, including the nature of Raxxla. Therefore again, making Ian Bell's statement redundant.

Walk with me for a moment. In the original Elite it seemed like intelligent alien life occupied every nook and cranny of space. When Frontier: Elite II came along it was almost as if this life had been wiped from memory. It's easy to blame this on David Braben retconning the galaxy to make way for the next game, Frontier First Encounters, in which humanity has its first encounter with an alien intelligence: The Thargoids.

I'm not sure if I said it here or elsewhere but one of the things we do know about Raxxla is that Rafe Zetter believed it to already be occupied by what he termed as "twisted men". What if these twisted men are using the portal on Raxxla to cross the barrier of time? How do you insure that a galactic human empire has the best chance to thrive without the worry of being wiped out by a potentially hostile alien race? Why you wipe that alien race out before it has the opportunity to evolve of course. As soon as you find another sapient civilization just go back in time and wipe out the competition before it has evolved intelligence. This would explain the enigma of why the Elite Dangerous galaxy seems so devoid of life.
