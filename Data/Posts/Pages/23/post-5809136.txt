Since MB said yes Raxxla is in the game, you will get no hints about it, it could very well be Permit Locked. It is in the game like he said, but he never said whether or not it was accessible. We think the more likely scenario for that permit locked moon is a Thargoid Base.

Triton is geologically active; its surface is young and has relatively few impact craters. Although Triton's crust is made of various ices, its subsurface processes are similar to those that produce volcanoes and rift valleys on Earth, but with water and ammonia as opposed to liquid rock.

But it could also be locked because it has an atmosphere:

Triton has a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere, with trace amounts of carbon monoxide and small amounts of methane near its surface
