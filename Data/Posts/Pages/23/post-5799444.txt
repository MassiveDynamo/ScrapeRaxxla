Just reread the Dark Wheel, haven't done that is i read it back when i was a wee lad when our school got it for the lone BBC Model B we had.

Made me think again about this whole thing. Some things came to mind.

In the novel, Raxxla is meant to be a planet. Regardless of what Ian Bell says, if its a planet, it can exist. Maybe he was referring to the alledged gateway to other universes which unless FD have been sneaky, there are no other universes/galaxies/regions.

The novel referes to humands and sentient alien races living side by side. This is not in line with ED canon. Therefore whatever was in the Dark Wheel is open to revision, including the nature of Raxxla. Therefore again, making Ian Bell's statement redundant.

Considering the limitations of drives back in that era (which does match ED lore) and that Jason Ryder found it and was spending time with his son before planning to return would indicate that it shouldn't be too far away from the old Lave/Leesti area in terms of galaxtic scale. Going off the sparse information we have from that, and (big assumption) assuming DB had it placed in line with the novel, it might even be within the bubble itself. If that is the case, it probably means that it doesn't appear to pings and can only be found by flying (relatively) close to it... possibly way out of the system or off the system plane.

Oh well, more useless speculation.

I think that's a valid theory; Raxxla in the bubble, not pingable, but only will appear when nearby, far off from any stars (dark planet?). Currently reviewing 18 hours supercuise in Shinrarta Dezhra headed for Lave.
