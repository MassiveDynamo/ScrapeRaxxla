Not sure that means it’s the name of the Thargoid structures. It could be read as ‘encountered a Thargoid Imprint’ sure, but it could equally be read as a name/description of the type of encounter (i.e. ‘a Thargoid Imprint happened’).

Mmm
just remembered to check my Codex Cmdr stats-no mention of any "Thargoid Imprint", though I've scanned & visited inside several, including triggering the goid spiral galaxy display at least once! ANybody else checked their stats for this?

Mmm, after spending quite a while goid scout hunting in the Pleiades for my third star none of that seems to show under the “encounters” stats, interesting!
