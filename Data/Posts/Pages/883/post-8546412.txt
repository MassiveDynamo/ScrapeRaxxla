Second thoughts on surface sites.
Thargoid Probe Required
Probes collect and transmit planetary data (mass, gravity, temperature..) and distance calculations to Merope 5c and Col 70.
Thargoid Sensor Required
Sensors scan and transmit back low poly ship model to Merope system.
I would postulate that the surface sites are barnacle seeders. First the probes find suitable planets that meet the requisite environment for barnacle growth. The small pods in the ceiling are barnacle polyps which are released via the ceiling port. The Thargoid Sensors were sent after or along with seeding to monitor any ships in the vicinity of the barnacle sights and report back activity.

Perhaps locked away in Col 70 there remains a functioning surface sight not infected with the Mycoid virus.
