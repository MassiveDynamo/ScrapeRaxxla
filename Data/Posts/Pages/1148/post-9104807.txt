So, been poking around in Sol a bit. Am I correct in assuming all the bodies are already 100% mapped in the DSS? Has anyone tried remapping them with probes again (even though the map will show 100% complete from the start) to see if any new POIs come up? I'm sure someone has so I'm going to hold off trying that for now and see if I can play hide and seek with asteroids for a bit.
