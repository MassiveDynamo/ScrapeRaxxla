But you are chery picking.... MB answered a question from an Interviewer asking for Clues about Raxxla ... he said 'there will be no clues" ... that is not an offical statement about Raxxla from FD that there will never be any clues ever about raxxla.... it was a man telling an interviewer im not telling you anything about the biggest secret in the game. And the fact that a Codex article exists within the Game specifically about Raxxla .... but that cant be a clue ... because of what MB said in a random interview? Amen brother

There will be no clues is exactly a statement that there will never be clues. It's the mouth piece of Fdev with directive from his higher ups on what he can and cannot say about raxxla telling the public that there will be no clues.

That means that the existence of the codex requires it to not be a clue. Or you dont believe what Fdev has stated about raxxla. End of story. there is no cherry picking there. Just language and facts.

I'm not sure what is confusing there. Either you dont trust what Fdev has stated and thus anything is possible, or you do and have to conclude that the codex and everything in the game that might mention raxxla is not a clue/hint/puzzle that will point you in the direction of raxxla's whereabouts.


I mean, it's not like he said "i'm not going to tell you any clues". He stated that there would be no clues. Now of course, fdev has retconned their own stuff in the past and could always decide to reverse course here. But until someone gets an alternative statement from them, that's what we have to go on. We can only assume that any in-game content mentioning raxxla is not a clue in any way to where it's located. or you've decided you can't trust fdev and then literally anything is possible. Which makes for fun lore writing, and not much else.
