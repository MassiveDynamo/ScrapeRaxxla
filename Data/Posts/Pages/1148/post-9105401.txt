no, i'm saying the codex is irrelevant as are the books because they're part of the lore and the lore is written by people who dont know anything more than we do because nobody knows where it's at and have been searching for it for a thousand years.

I'm not cherry picking what fdev as a company has stated about it. That's the only source of truth that exists if you consider what they say to be truthful.
But you are chery picking.... MB answered a question from an Interviewer asking for Clues about Raxxla ... he said 'there will be no clues" ... that is not an offical statement about Raxxla from FD that there will never be any clues ever about raxxla.... it was a man telling an interviewer im not telling you anything about the biggest secret in the game. And the fact that a Codex article exists within the Game specifically about Raxxla .... but that cant be a clue ... because of what MB said in a random interview? Amen brother
