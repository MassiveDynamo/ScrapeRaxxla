I'll just drop a personal thought about this... that Permits were implemented on a galaxy-wide approach, all at once and that Frontier changed the mistery-driven "the truth is out there" to "permit-lock" most of it so we may have a sense of actual progression whenever we unlock them and they will make some of it story-driven by granting specific ones every now and then.
