The main religion with raxxla is that there is a reason it will exist where it ends up existing. And that this reason can be deduced if you're clever enough, allowing you to find it without tedious searching. Despite the fact that it's been stated that no hints would be given, ... which negates any such puzzle to solve and being clever.

It's more entertaining to think that you could be more clever than everyone else and find it. When the reality is far more likely that it'll be just some random schlub who finds it (when Fdev allows it to be found), if it's able to be found at all, or someone in a team that is brute forcing the search. No clever puzzle. No use of myths and stories to unravel of a puzzle 30 years in the making.

as for no religion in ED - lore-wise... it's at least one thing future humanity got right.
