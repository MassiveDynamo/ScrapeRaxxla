When you're at that point then, you really have nothing to stand on at all. Everything become a potential lie or falsehood. The entire search simply becomes a lore story you're making up as you go.

Which granted, seems to be the case for most people anyway because the alternative is so unbearingly boring (grid searching not just systems, but roid fields and rings in systems where the only non-random assumption you can make is that the starting point should be sol system and working outward from that)
