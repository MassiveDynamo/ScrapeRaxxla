However, whether 'in game since gamma' means 'accessible since gamma' is still heavily debated


Apparently

When you allow that possibility, then it is far more likely that it's locked behind a permit that can't be acquired than anything else. Which makes the entire search pointless. So it is generally assumed, if you're searching...then you believe the statement implies accessible in some way.
