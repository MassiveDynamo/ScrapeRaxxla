Absolutely not, i dont believe there are clues in the game currently or in the past that will lead to the location of raxxla. However I do believe it is in the game.

i think it will just require either luck or tedious searching to find it and/or a time when Fdev is ready for players to find it.

I dont think you can take what has been stated by fdev regarding raxxla without taking all of what they said about it. No clues or hints in game.... and that it's something that is a bit obvious so that players will recognize they found something special if they found it.

Everything else (the codex entry, books etc) are irrelevant.

If you dont believe what has been stated by them, then you're working in the realm of infinite possibilities ... and there's nothing determinant about the infinite.

Not really commenting either way, but thought it’d be good to have what MB said in the DJ Truthsayer interview stated exactly as it was said.



DJ Truthsayer: <referencing MB’s response to the previous question>I like it, it’s cryptic, and it doesn’t reveal a damn thing. You’ve always said there’ll be no clues though, haven’t you.

MB: Errrmm <thinks> that is true. Errm <thinks> but I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious just so people know what they’re doing.

DJ: Yep

MB: Err.. But yeah, there’s nothing to be revealed at this stage.


Key point - he did say ‘so people know what they’re doing’, not ‘so people will know when they’ve found it’.

Other key point however - it’s not clear whether MB is talking about what they had already done or was thinking about how they would have to approach it.
