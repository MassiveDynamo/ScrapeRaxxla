See now you are just cherry picking - which things to believe.
no, i'm saying the codex is irrelevant as are the books because they're part of the lore and the lore is written by people who dont know anything more than we do because nobody knows where it's at and have been searching for it for a thousand years.

I'm not cherry picking what fdev as a company has stated about it. That's the only source of truth that exists if you consider what they say to be truthful.

edit: Plus, any such in-game content came after the statements about there not being any hints or puzzles in the game.. nor would it be connected to the narrative etc. So the codex being helpful contradicts the assumption that you can trust what fdev has stated. Since I'm working under the basic assumption that I must trust what Fdev has stated, then the codex is useless for raxxla. And the books were always useless for raxxla facts.
