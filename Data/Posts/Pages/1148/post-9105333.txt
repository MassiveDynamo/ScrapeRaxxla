The main religion with raxxla is that there is a reason it will exist where it ends up existing. And that this reason can be deduced if you're clever enough, allowing you to find it without tedious searching. Despite the fact that it's been stated that no hints would be given, ... which negates any such puzzle to solve and being clever.

My point is that very contradiction indicates you need to take a leap of faith and accept that you believe in its existence and that there are clues and a path... In order to continue.
The question is ... Are you a Believer?

as for no religion in ED - lore-wise... it's at least one thing future humanity got right.

I was commenting on a thread in the Lore forum ... there is tons of religion in ED for those with eyes to see....
