what would a POI on the surface have to do with raxxla though? That would imply that raxxla wouldn't have been discoverable until poi's were added to the game. Which doesn't jive with the general idea that braben and all saying "it's in the game since gamma" implies that it's discoverable by players since then. Since that would technically be closer to lying than the truth. Not that Fdev is required to tell the truth.
