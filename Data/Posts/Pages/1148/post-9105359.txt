My point is that very contradiction indicates you need to take a leap of faith and accept that you believe in its existence and that there are clues and a path... In order to continue.
The question is ... Are you a Believer?

Absolutely not, i dont believe there are clues in the game currently or in the past that will lead to the location of raxxla. However I do believe it is in the game.

i think it will just require either luck or tedious searching to find it and/or a time when Fdev is ready for players to find it.

I dont think you can take what has been stated by fdev regarding raxxla without taking all of what they said about it. No clues or hints in game.... and that it's something that is a bit obvious so that players will recognize they found something special if they found it.

Everything else (the codex entry, books etc) are irrelevant.

If you dont believe what has been stated by them, then you're working in the realm of infinite possibilities ... and there's nothing determinant about the infinite.
