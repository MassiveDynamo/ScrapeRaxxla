Do you guys dss atmospheric planets? I did for a while but they seem to be worthless if they've already been mapped

I don't DSS anything* since I realized that all the biological and geological sites are essentially the same.

* I did DSS an ELW I found in a red dwarf system which also contained a gas giant with 8 moons. Also, if I ever find an 8th moon that's an HMC I'll probably DSS that too.
