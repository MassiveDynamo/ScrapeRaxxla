I don't think it's locked. I wouldn't rule it out completely though.

I think Raxxla is invisible to system scan and could be in any system we have visited, without us noticing. It is after all, a ghost world. This is just a guess.
Based on the much repeated but never confirmed with an official source claim that the Raxxla system has been entered by at least one CMDR, honked and then immediately left I'd have to disagree with this.

We don't have official word either way but I don't think FDev would take that risk.
