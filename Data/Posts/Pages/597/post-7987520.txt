There’s a whole load of stuff floating round that could potentially come into the game at a future date.

What’s the alternative to region locks? There’s only so much ‘oh yeah, many of you passed through an area but never spotted/encountered anything for... reasons’ that can be credible.
I'm inclined to agree with this observation. It's one thing for a system to have been semi / fully explored (but not mapped) and present in eddb / inara and all the other external databases since prior to the Horizons release and then have an INRA base retroactively dropped on an airless moon much later with a handwavium "Well, you couldn't land on moons to find it the last time" from FDev.

In theory now they added the FSS / mapping, nothing can hide on any planet, even if we can't land on it.

[Edit: Gets up to make coffee and stumbles head first through a logical perception error and sees an obvious flaw in that argument: If / when the Atmos / Gas Giant patches are added there could be a further locking mechanism that's removed only for those who purchase the upgrade, revealing untold millions of occupied, living and breathing settlements that may not even exist prior to FDev retrofitting that content.]
