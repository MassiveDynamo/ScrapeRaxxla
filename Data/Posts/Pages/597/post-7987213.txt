Yeah, I was only talking about systems out in the black with that particular post!

Ah sorry, perusing thread whilst eating pizza, drinking whisky and watching True Grit (recorded).
But Iâ€™m working on the hypothesis that TDW station leads to Raxxla, and both are in the bubble. Visited Aulin today. Aulin Enterprise is an orbis that looks just like TDW codex station pic, and Abraham Lincoln station in Sol is also the same type!
