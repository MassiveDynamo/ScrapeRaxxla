Plenty of stuff that they could be potentially locked for isn’t going to really deliver until we’ve got full atmos landings and spacelegs.

Personally I’d suggest not expecting too much in the way of region unlocks until both are in place.

Which can potentially increase the wait of getting anything done with these locked systems. 5 to 10 yrs of waiting if they wanna establish these functions before unlocking these systems.
