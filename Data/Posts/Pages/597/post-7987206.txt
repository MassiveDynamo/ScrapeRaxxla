There are, but we don’t speak of them as they were found using nefarious means.

(Well, when I say ‘we’... they were kind of ok’d to be talked about, so it’s more a matter of personal principle really. Cheating’s cheating, so they remain firmly on my personal ignore/disregard list.)

Well, there’s Witches Reach which I found enroute, and another locked system I found via Galmap while looking for a tourist mission destination, very close to Shin Dez though can’t remember its name, no population so no way to get the permit unless its in FD’s gift or perhaps TDW. My current hypotthesis is that first you find TDW station, then become allied, then you get the permit opportunity for RAXXLA’s parent system. All mechanisms in-game from the outset. I am beginning to suspect TDW station may itself only be found once one has passed a test, until then it may not be visible, but I think finding the test is going to be tricky.

But I agree, there’s a special place in hell reserved for code dippers!
