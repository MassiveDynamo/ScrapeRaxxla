Two observations today, one in-game, one out.

In-game, I've been exploring around the neighbourhood of the tri-partite goddess systems Dana, Epona and Idunn. Nothing to report there (only two moons in a seeming trojan orbit in HIP 772, around planet 1) but whilst visiting a station interior I took a look at the Brookes Galactic Tours advert and realised that next to the top point of the five-pointed star is the Andromeda galaxy, fairly similar to how it appears on the skybox...

Out of game I've been checking for systems named after runes and there are a few, some but not all also seem to refer to Pre-Germanic deities. So far I've noticed Tir (and Tyr) (possibly a god associated with Mars), Opala (heritage, inheritance), Ehwaz (horse), Ansuz (another deity, or perhaps an oak or ash tree), Ingwaz (I think an ancestor of a line of Swedish kings), Laguz (lake or just water), Berkanan (birch tree) and Jera (harvest). (No, I do not think I can get them to spell Raxxla!). I suspect there are plenty more! (But not all are here, that I can see...). Given that they were likely placed deliberately, I feel that there is the possibility for a message hidden in this way but I will need to see them for myself in the Galaxy Map.
