Looking at the current discussion...Got me thinking about things...

Im sold on Raxxla being tied to the world or celestial axis...I agree that the Hero fighting Dragon/Snake for the "prize" is the general theme that is being referenced - and I think it is associated with idea of the Axis. Some obvious connections are Indra fighting Vritra, Apollo fighting Python, Odin fighting Wyrm or Thor fighting Jormungandr.

However.... with the Norse symbolism- We have an axis tied to Ragnarock.... which might be problematic for us...

To add to what Selbie put together...

There was a "burning Warg" early on in this game...reference to Fenrir? with students chanting "babykiller" (ostensibly to do with the attacking of Panem)... Parents Grief? or maybe a reference to the coming of Ragnarock?
SPOILER: BURNING WARG REFERENCE


Then is fulfilled Hlín's
second sorrow,
when Óðinn goes
to fight with the wolf,
and Beli's slayer,
bright, against Surtr.
Then shall Frigg's
sweet friend fall.
From the Volspa stanza 40

The First Sorrow being the Death of Baldr, son of Frigg (The Parents Grief?)
The Second Sorrow being the Death of Odin, husband of Frigg (The Lovers Woe?)


Anyhow so back to Raxxla.... what if it is Ragnarock? and the dark wheel of fate is turning us to our destruction. Does Sol get plunged into darkness by Fenrir ?
Are Thargoids - Frost Giants bent on our destruction? Stay tuned ... same bat time same bat channel ...

Supposedly the Hyades and Aldeberan make up the "Wolfs Jaw" constellation - which could be Fenrir. Might be worth checking out...

The Belt of Orion is known as Friggs Distaff.... The distaff and weaving being associated with the idea of Fate and the World Axis and Frigg "knows the fate of everyone"(from Lokasenna) ....
