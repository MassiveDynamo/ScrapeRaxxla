To save a Princess from an alien dragon, as Brookes puts it in Legacy, we might need the 'sword' first, then the location of the dragon's lair... .
I thought this was very interesting since, to my knowledge, it's the only time anyone in Elite fiction mentions a children's book (this reference is when Julia is remembering her childhood and she mentions that book). That children's book specifically references a Princess and an alien (dragon).

Of all the made-up children's stories Brookes could have used, he used that one. I wonder what the title of that book was? I wonder if the Princess' name was Astrophel?

Interestingly, the origin of the "princess being rescued from a dragon" is the Greek myth of Andromeda being rescued from Cetus by Perseus - linking us back to Greek myth again, much like many of the names and themes Brookes used in his book (set in the Artemis system near the planet Laphria, etc.).
