Those with eyes to see:
Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Mind/Memory) - ravens who bring information to Odin - the eyes and ears of Odin or,
Heimdall's watch (Heimdall was born 'at the edge of the world' of 9 mothers of the sea)
This is somewhat reinforced via Muninn's Nest in Ayethi (this was the Argent home system originally prior to Alioth). This system also contains the Earth-like Raven's Landing.
