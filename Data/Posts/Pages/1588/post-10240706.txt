I thought this was very interesting since, to my knowledge, it's the only time anyone in Elite fiction mentions a children's book (this reference is when Julia is remembering her childhood and she mentions that book). That children's book specifically references a Princess and an alien (dragon).

Of all the made-up children's stories Brookes could have used, he used that one. I wonder what the title of that book was? I wonder if the Princess' name was Astrophel?

Interestingly, the origin of the "princess being rescued from a dragon" is the Greek myth of Andromeda being rescued from Cetus by Perseus - linking us back to Greek myth again, much like many of the names and themes Brookes used in his book (set in the Artemis system near the planet Laphria, etc.).
It is interesting that MB has the dragon in his children's book. The dragon in the sky, Draco, is surrounded by the only true spiralling stars. The pole stars.
All of earths pole stars are constantly spiralling. It is a very dense spiral as they revolve around their center every 24 hours, while it takes almost 14000 year to reach the outmost point of the spiral. It then takes another 14000 years to spiral back to the center.

All this time Draco revolves around the center at the same distance.

Of the pole stars, Vega is the only directly identified as a Princess. Vega is the “Weaving Princess”, celebrated in the Japanese Tanabata festival.
Vega is currently approximately at the outmost diameter of it's spiral.
