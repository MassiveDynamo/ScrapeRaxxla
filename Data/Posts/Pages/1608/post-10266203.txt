So support got back to me regarding the presence of a WR in LAWD 26:

"I'm afraid that due to the question being narrative related, it is unlikely that we will be able to provide you with an answer. I'm really sorry."

It's a bit disappointing as a reply to be honest. There's no "having spoken to the development team..." clause to say anything with certainty. It's possible they did, in which case this is a clear indicator of something.
I dunno.
Feels wishy-washy in the wording.
