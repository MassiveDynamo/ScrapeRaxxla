Going to be honest, I think the only book that might have any hints on Raxxla would be the official Michael Brookes one which was Legacy. From what I remember the other authors had access to Frontier and their stories are cannon but I highly doubt Frontier gave them anything on Raxxla to be included. Might just go and re-read Legacy actually.
