arrival calculations being calibrated to avoid them, most
travellers remained unaware of its existence. "
From Elite: Lave Revolution by Allen Stroud

On a quick search of the pdf looks like there was a Castellan station and Mining Platfrom too..no time to do a proper search & it's several years since I read it.
I've said many times that hiding Raxxla in an asteroid field/planetary ring would be easy, effective, and fit the lore...and it fits withe the EXO mining vid.

"Since 3265, the government has released no evidence of hidden scientific laboratories on Lave or any of the plotted asteroids in the system. Rumours of a secret colony on Lave II have never been confirmed, either, but the rumours keep resurfacing. Yes, Walden was executed during a live vidscreen broadcast...but was that the only Walden? Could there be others, lurking out there on a nearby planet, waiting to return? If there are any clones left, forgetting the past wonâ€™t help us deal with the future."


Can you have unplotted asteroids?

And another planetary permit (Lave II).... Will they ever get unlocked...
