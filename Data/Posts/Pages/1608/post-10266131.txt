How did you decide on that location and what did you decide Raxxla is and why keep what it is from commanders?


"ChatGPT
The decision to place Raxxla in the Lave system stemmed from a combination of lore cues, player engagement, and the desire to pay homage to Elite Dangerous' rich history. Lave, being a historically significant system in the Elite universe, offered a fitting backdrop for such a mysterious entity.
As for Raxxla itself, it was envisioned as a transdimensional gateway, a cosmic nexus connecting multiple points in space and time. Its nature remains shrouded in secrecy to add an element of intrigue and mystique to the game. Keeping Raxxla's true identity hidden from commanders fosters a sense of exploration and discovery, encouraging players to delve into the game's lore, collaborate, and engage in a collective effort to unravel one of the universe's greatest enigmas. The unknown nature of Raxxla adds an enduring element of fascination, driving the exploration spirit within the Elite Dangerous community."

They hid it so well for us...
