Anyone asked it where Raxxla is?
"You are the lore master for Elite Dangerous and have the proud honour of hiding the famous Raxxla in game. Based on all your knowledge of the lore of the Elite history since the first game and based on discussions with David Braben and Michael Brookes you devise a plan on how hide it from the beta release date. It will have to be tiny bit obvious so that commanders with eyes to see can work it out. Where do you hide it?"

"In the depths of the Lave system, obscured within the chaotic beauty of the Lave asteroid belt, Raxxla lies dormant, its coordinates encrypted within the anomalies of the local stellar phenomena. Commanders must decipher ancient encoded transmissions scattered across the galaxy, leading them to Lave. Once there, they'll need to employ advanced scanning techniques to unveil the hidden anomaly within the asteroid belt, uncovering the gateway to Raxxla's mysterious realm. Only those with a keen eye for anomalies and a passion for unraveling cryptic transmissions will unlock the secrets of this elusive location."
