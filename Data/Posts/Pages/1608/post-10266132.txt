FYI: Enaness clues ran into a possible issue which is requiring investigation of flare stars and neighboring systems. So, hopefully soon but this is one of the harder ones to track down.

I am hoping to have possible suspects soon. Given the connection to a space-faring civilization, this one is not easy to track down.
