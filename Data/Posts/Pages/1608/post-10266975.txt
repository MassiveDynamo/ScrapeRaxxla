Interesting that Lave has a named asteroid belt. Not seen that before. Castellan belt. A fitting name for a belt - guarding the planet from the sun I suppose.

- edsm lists the belt as between the sun and Lave, while the wiki has the belt further out. Apologies for not being able to check.
"The Castellan Belt is an iron-rich cluster of asteroids in the
far reaches of the Lave system. Owing to most hyperspace
arrival calculations being calibrated to avoid them, most
travellers remained unaware of its existence. "
From Elite: Lave Revolution by Allen Stroud

On a quick search of the pdf looks like there was a Castellan station and Mining Platfrom too..no time to do a proper search & it's several years since I read it.
I've said many times that hiding Raxxla in an asteroid field/planetary ring would be easy, effective, and fit the lore...and it fits withe the EXO mining vid.
