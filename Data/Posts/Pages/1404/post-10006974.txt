I think most of this is brilliant. It makes sense, I like it a lot - I need to think more on it so will reply in more detail later, just wanted to complement your ideas atm.

Only note is that the Dark Wheel logo you used in that last bit is fan made and not any part of Fdev's game, so don't read anything into it
I didn't know about the logo, thanks for that info and all the compliment =]
