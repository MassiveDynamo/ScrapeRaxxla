In Elite Dangerous, there is definite repeating theme of triples (this even show up on materials collection as you get 3 of that type of material). Insofar as the mythology connection, triple deities is a definite thing that shows up in Elite Dangerous. This actually predates the Abrahamic religions and comes from the concept of mother, daughter, and crone and father, son, and elder/sage. Also, we have 3 intelligent species: Guardians, Humans, and Thargoids (and yes they are in that specific order on purpose). I personally suspect this is actually intentional.

This goes further as triples are important as it represents non-dualism. I cannot quite explain it without you being fully aware of the religious group that seems to run the Federation (potentially linked to The Dark Wheel - though explanation on that is exceptionally long and complicated). Details are in beacon "" around Cooperworld in Aymiay. Symbols for non-dualism are also prevalent on our ships and in stations. Much more detail is in the First Encounters journals. They basically became something similar to the Gnostics of ancient Earth. The groups has locations in Aymiay, Beta Hydri, and Olympic Village, Mars.

Three has always been an important number, especially for us Druids, and this realm (Earth or Abred) seen by many within the order as not the real world.
The celestial realm Gwynfyd is spiritually our home with Abred where we get to experience every life as a different creature.
We all originate from the other realm Annwn (the underworld)
Basically its the mind that travels and not the body.

There are many references to duality and the Barddas describes the spiritual journey as the ‘triplicity of realms’.

Not sue if that’s relevant
