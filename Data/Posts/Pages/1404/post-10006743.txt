So, what the heck was discovered in 2296 or earlier? Was this mystery station built on some alien structure?
The codex says that the Omphalos Rift is an alien artefact, described as a gateway or tunnel... (allegedly). There's no way to know how big it is. It might be the size of a child's hand or a Niven ring megastructure. The idea that it's contained inside a station isn't at all unreasonable Edit: Actually, stations are pretty much the first thing we were able to interact with in-game, so if Raxxla now is the same as it was back then, Raxxla being in a station (or a station) makes a lot of sense. Trigger it somehow, the mailslot is the Omphalos Rift - Zoom - you end up somewhere different instead of inside the station. That's 100% a thing that could have existed since day 1. Edit 2: As Jorki says too, DB's "You don't know what it is" could also be applied to the idea that Raxxla is a station. People are looking for something weird and alien, the best hiding place is in plain sight.

The only problem with that idea (as with so many other good ones) is testing it.
