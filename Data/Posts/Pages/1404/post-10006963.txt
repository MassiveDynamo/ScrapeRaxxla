The Dark Wheel Logo

View attachment 333962 Something I dont see too many people comment is this logo for The Dark Wheel.
For me it shows a portal that the repitilian Raxxlans only allow Elite members through. As it was in the lore. But it also shows an orbit of 3 planets with differently specific sizes.
I think step to Raxxla or Dark wheel information is on this system. Where the planets orbit around a ''portal'' or revolve around the elite status
.
for this bit... it's fan created... which is why people don't comment much ;-)
