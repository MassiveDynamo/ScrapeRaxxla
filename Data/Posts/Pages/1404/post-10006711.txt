Can a object have a very weird orbital path that would be hard to predict due to it's nature of how it is aligned with in the system? I would have to draw it but a very very dumb idea.
You mean like a three-body problem sort of 'weird orbit'? or something massively off-plane and elliptical like comets and such?
