I think @Maidor made some good points. particularly this idea:
Raxxla is real and has been the same since the very begining ... It was added by very specific Frontier employees into the game, and since no new updates can affect the way it is found, it needs to be in a constant system of the game (not galatic system, but game-mechanic way). One that has never changed....
Although I personally agree with others in the idea that Raxxla has likely been updated at least once, as we saw with the Zurara, I still think it's really valuable to actually list out and see what the possibilities are.

Let's explore some of the plausible Raxxlas that have been put forward here over the years. I've made a start below, and tried to arrange them from "easiest" to "hardest" to implement and maintain in the game - input most welcome in better defining these or adding more versions

As per Maidor's suggestion, it's reasonable to assume that we need to consider not only the effort to implement 'Raxxla' in the first place, and what is feasible technologically, but also what's needed to keep it running across updates, patches, and staff changes. Also consider that there's been no leak, and nothing has been data mined or even accidentally discovered via bugs in 8 years (that we're able to identify as Raxxla related), it's easier to keep smaller and simpler things secret over longer timeframes...

What do you all think?
