Hi, I've searched for Raxxla before and gave up 2 years ago.
Seeing the coversation get what I think, I'll throw in my tin-foil hat and share some theories.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raxxla is real and has been the same since the very begining

As stated in early interviews, it's there, they wont hint further. People been there and left, no one found it as far as we know.
Using the lore and extenal inverviews. I belive It is achieavable without following any processes and all the hints in game are either misdirections or very basic information on steps to triangulate it.

Also that it haves been moved in-lore and it's tracking method is contantly 'moved' in game.

There is also no ''new information'' update in-game to facilitate its finding. So changing of names and places, variations to the games narrative, none of that will change the ''intended steps method'' of finding Raxxla. It still follows it's original pattern.

Therefore it is in space. Just space, no scanners to find it, no SRV, just looking at it. But it's not meant to be seen.
So all the steps are meant to make you realise it's there. It was added by very specific Frontier employees into the game, and since no new updates can affect the way it is found, it needs to be in a constant system of the game (not galatic system, but game-mechanic way). One that has never changed.



The whole mistery of Raxxla is a meta factor to the game. A way to unite lore, imagination and community. Therefore, every hint is not meant for a single person, so most of them incredably simple solutions hidden among confusing possibilities, or based on specific undersanding of the lore, needing different skills to find a solution to each step.
Therefore Raxxla is not easly findable by looking at clues but more on how the people hidding it thought. Both developers and in-game characters.

Therefore I belive the solution to finding it revolves around a very simple thing to stumble uppon in-game, but quite impossible to observe a pattern alone. The way to consistantly find Raxxla involves a game breaking feat or an oddity in the recurring and most basic gameplay.



Looking at all the evidence posted here and other sources. I belive the period of finding new ''clues'' is gone and we are starting to overlap conceps, probably all the steps are there, as said no information will be added. And I think all has been found.

There is the meta part of piecing it all together and bulk-testing the hipostesis. And I think the current ''green-glow'' is a good start. To go about decifering the inner workings of Devs/Characters and find a pattern to identifying what is a clue and what is just a causallity. A first proof of its existence would also start generating the ''right questions''.

For me it shows a portal that the repitilian Raxxlans only allow Elite members through. As it was in the lore. But it also shows an orbit of 3 planets with differently specific sizes.
I think step to Raxxla or Dark wheel information is on this system. Where the planets orbit around a ''portal'' or revolve around the elite status
.
And for last I think the Omphalos Rift naming is to create a '''direction'' and since Delphi is the first mention and a rare instance of name changing, it might not be the way. But if it is, than it is litteraly a direction, creating a north from sol and stablishing where is ''up'' or ''left'' one position. I think Geb might be the opposing direction since its where ''the other omphalos stone'' should be resting. But taking the Hyperjump-Route centric nature of my theory. I think the Omphalos Rift is reinforcing the Idea that whatever is Raxxla, a sun is involved. The center of somewhere.

I hope this gave some ideas to you guys.
My only objective sujestion is that we create a collective effort to test the Sol Glow. Use 33 ships to record 24h during a sunday. One in each sector. And look at the footage to find a pattern. Arrange the 33 sectors with some orientation that we can universally refer to until more information. But so far, test a possibility.

Good luck on the hunt and thanks for reading.

I think most of this is brilliant. It makes sense, I like it a lot - I need to think more on it so will reply in more detail later, just wanted to complement your ideas atm.

Only note is that the Dark Wheel logo you used in that last bit is fan made and not any part of Fdev's game, so don't read anything into it
