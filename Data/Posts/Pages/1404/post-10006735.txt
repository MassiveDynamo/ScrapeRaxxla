There is a further clue and it is buried in the very end of the Brewer Corporation codex entry with a VERY EXPLICIT REFERENCE to Tau Ceti (Raxxla rumors start there per the Raxxla codex). There was a competitor to Brewer Corporation call Merritt Group mentioned that that had a station get destroyed. The etymology of Merritt means "boundary gate". Is this the mysterious Omphalos Rift?

Interesting idea

According to the Codex the Meritt group's station was destroyed in 3255 in the Tau Ceti system. I suppose you could investigate by going to Tau Ceti and examining the space around planets?
