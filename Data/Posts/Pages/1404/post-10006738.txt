Interesting idea

According to the Codex the Meritt group's station was destroyed in 3255 in the Tau Ceti system. I suppose you could investigate by going to Tau Ceti and examining the space around planets?
So, what the heck was discovered in 2296 or earlier? Was this mystery station built on some alien structure?
