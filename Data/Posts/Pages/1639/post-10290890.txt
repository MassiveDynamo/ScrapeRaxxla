The only obvious thing that was lost IMHO is the Guardian sites, which were lost since the extinction of their creators. The "crystal maps" of the old E/F missions could have been part of the clues intended to lead us to that discovery, as reputedly was the visions of Gan Romero and Jasmina Halsey's.

I don't think FD have ever provided any illumination on those visions or old E/F missions...it was just assumed that they would lead to Raxxla because of the wording...but then Raxxla might be Guardian-related and in that region of space. Indeed Raxxla might be the Guardian word for city/arkship launch site/henge/anti-Thargoid air defence battery.....
But guardian's code wasn't present before Horizons. And we know that Raxxla was already present.
I don't trust Raxxla has been modified as only 2 persons ever known where it is (MB and DB).
