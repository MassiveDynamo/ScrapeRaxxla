Arbitrary tin foil ramblings. Following on various references one of my current theories is that the logo is some type of symbolic map in itself.

The central dot and circle I now am more inclined to believe is an omphalos. The ring outside of it is a representation of Hecates Wheel, although I ponder that it doesn’t represent Hecate herself, but rather a triple deity, of which there are a few in game. The outer black shapes I wonder if they could represent Thorns hidden beneath the hexagon?

Systems named after Thorns (or trees) surround a series of three systems linked to a triple deity, at that centre is our goal?

Or is this triple goddess system ‘above’ our goal, is this map a 2D representation of a 3D construct?

This was the image which flashed in my mind as I read Robert Holdstock’s ‘Ragthorn’.
