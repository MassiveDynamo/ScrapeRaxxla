Another rain depression day here -_-"
And another depressing Raxxla thought...

More than half the galaxy is server sided.
The entire BGS.
There is an absolute, 100%, possible chance, that only when the proper "gates" or "checkpoints" are reached/actived by a CMDR, that further Raxxla stuff could happen/be found/unlocked.

I mention this because we often get the argument about Raxxla that there are no assets for it in the game files, but assets are meaningless in this game, as they could be downloaded/pushed, at-will, by the server, in real-time, but only once activated/unlocked.

And most the assest are already in game, so having a handful of additional ones that only get downloaded/pushed when/if activated correctly by someone the first time, isn't hard to do.... and it would be even more achievable if Fdev simply had a single instance running on their server, that runs in the system that has the hidden stuff, and until someone completes the "gates" to enter this specific, server sided instance, they can't see the assets, and they're not directly downloaded as physical assets to any PC until after first discovery by a CMDR, likely with a cut scene like Salvations Pulse, a long loading jump, or some such other mechanism for the first CMDR that discovers it, and then probably just a game update for everyone else....


Don't know why I'm even mentioning it really, it doesn't really help the search, but it's just a theory
