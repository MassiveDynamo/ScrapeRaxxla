So my current thinking is that maybe jumping around the Landscape Signal with a Thargoid Sensor (the same objects Jaques had with him, and the object that some suggest might (for some reason) be hidden in the Exodus Beacons in the Rift mission) might attract the Caretakers!
Interesting.
When you carry thargoid artefacts in the pleiades, you have more chance to lure them. Next time i go to colonia, i will take some with me
