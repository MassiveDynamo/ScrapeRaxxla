Hello Commanders.
The thing that i think most now is that we don't seek for Raxxla Place but rather the key to find Raxxla anytime. If i remember correctly FDevs said that Raxxla can be find many times so to find something again it have to bo lost again and again.
Maybe influential humans found Raxxla but lost it and now they are searching it again?
It would really help if we knew what exactly we are searching for exactly. Despite demonstrably getting closer to understanding how things are structured, we have a very poor understanding of what is being sought.
