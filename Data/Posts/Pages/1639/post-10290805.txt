Also, wondering, just theoretically, might be a potential "gate" required to access Raxxla...

If we suppose the First Gate is Elite Status, then that's not a biggie, can be achieved.

But what might other gates be?
What kind of data might be used to check the potential of access?

Like, I've wondered, if flying around potential locations, with a Fully Loaded Cargo Bay of Ancient Keys from the Guardian Beacons, would trigger something? The easiest way for testing this would be by a single 4t cargo bay, 4 keys, and your ship would "register" as fully loaded with all Ancient Keys as cargo... or maybe there's a required number, like 33 or 42.... obviously it's not the easiest thing to test over the wide potential of places, but it's somthing I've wondered about for some time....


I've also wondered about the statements about the DW being a sinister cabal...
What if they want us to make our own Cabal of Elite pilots, that does somthing very specific...

I believe there are 10? Guardian sites that can be accessed for blueprints...
What if in a Private Group or Open Play, and/or a squadron, 10 Elite CMDRs went to the 10 sites, and actived them, but do not enter the keys, just activate the plyons and release the spheres, so that all 10 spheres are powered at the same time in-game.
Technically, they would not be in the same instance, but, the server might still recognize this activity, maybe more so if the players are in a Private Server or Squadron so that the servers are syncing the in-game activity "better"/more efficiently.....
If nothing happens, have everyone then release their keys together as best as possible, and see if there any any results...

Again, just theoretical and spacemadness thoughts...

Anyone else have any other completely out-there theories of any potential "gates" or requirements? Share them, you never know what might spark debate/research/trial....
