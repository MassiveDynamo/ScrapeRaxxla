Maybe it could be wormhole that opens in different places but in some kind of pattrern?

Another thing - is it possible that all Guardian planet structures are the relics of Talmor Lens system?
I believe so, but I would add human surface Installations, orbital installations, power sources, and those random pyramidal buildings into the mix. It doesn't appear to be entirely alien constructed. But then again humans may be ones from another galaxy ... after all we are the ones explicitly linked to reptilian symbols (and especially that of snakes). This also being the reason Earth is covered in megalithic structures and there are pyramids on nearly every continent.
