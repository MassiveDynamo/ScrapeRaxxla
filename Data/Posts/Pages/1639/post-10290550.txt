Hello Commanders.
The thing that i think most now is that we don't seek for Raxxla Place but rather the key to find Raxxla anytime. If i remember correctly FDevs said that Raxxla can be find many times so to find something again it have to bo lost again and again.
Maybe influential humans found Raxxla but lost it and now they are searching it again?
Your idea could fit an old mission about TDW: "What was lost will soon be found".
Good point, but what do we have in-game that can be lost ? I just see POIs for the moment.
