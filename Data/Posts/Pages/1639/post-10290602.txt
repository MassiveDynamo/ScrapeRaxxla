Hello Commanders.
The thing that i think most now is that we don't seek for Raxxla Place but rather the key to find Raxxla anytime. If i remember correctly FDevs said that Raxxla can be find many times so to find something again it have to bo lost again and again.
Maybe influential humans found Raxxla but lost it and now they are searching it again?

Your idea could fit an old mission about TDW: "What was lost will soon be found".
Good point, but what do we have in-game that can be lost ? I just see POIs for the moment.

In all the games so far, our ability to travel FTL between stars is entirely controlled by the mapping software.

In Elite Dangerous, as we all know, that's Galmap.

Losing an entire star system would be as easy as just not including it in Galmap, even if it's there, we wouldn't be able to ever reach it.

Whoever controls Galmap controls the (human) galaxy, fundamentally... and covertly.
