I always have been attached to the idea that "the gate(s)" to whatever Raxxla is move from place to place. Would fit the idea of being both a key and a door. Maybe even related to the icon. Idk just my two cents. For now, the Landscape signal is the best lead to something, I don't think anything apart from the arrival of the Stargoids has ever been so clear and audacious in this game.
