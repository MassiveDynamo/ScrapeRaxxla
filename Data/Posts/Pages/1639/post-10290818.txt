Your idea could fit an old mission about TDW: "What was lost will soon be found".
Good point, but what do we have in-game that can be lost ? I just see POIs for the moment.
The only obvious thing that was lost IMHO is the Guardian sites, which were lost since the extinction of their creators. The "crystal maps" of the old E/F missions could have been part of the clues intended to lead us to that discovery, as reputedly was the visions of Gan Romero and Jasmina Halsey's.

I don't think FD have ever provided any illumination on those visions or old E/F missions...it was just assumed that they would lead to Raxxla because of the wording...but then Raxxla might be Guardian-related and in that region of space. Indeed Raxxla might be the Guardian word for city/arkship launch site/henge/anti-Thargoid air defence battery.....
