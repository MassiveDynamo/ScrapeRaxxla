Reading the codex entries, one thing that made me wonder is "mother of galaxies"; could this be "cobra" as in the engine, and thus "Serpentis" or otherwise?
I realize it might be a stretch, it's just something that always stood out to me as i read someone say there is a constellation with the name "Cobra".
