This article doesn't mention the Mars Artifact though. Recognizing the difference between the two events of finding fossils on Mars, and finding some kind of mysterious, small alien artifact on Mars/close to Mars is interesting. Apparently there is also a long gap between these two events. Unobscuring these two events reveals something about the nature of these events. Further information is required.
There is no confirmation of the fossils in ED. They are probably still part of FD’s timeline though.
When the game was released, the timeline was available on the ED home page. It still the backbone of ED history, even If parts of it is no longer valid.

The fossils are probably an indication of primitive life, on Mars in it’s distant past.

the artefact points to extrasolar visitors.
