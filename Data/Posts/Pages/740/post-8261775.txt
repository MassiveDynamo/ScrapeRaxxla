Fossils on Mars is not new- see Galnet News, Foundering of the Federation, 5 July 3301
This article doesn't mention the Mars Artifact though. Recognizing the difference between the two events of finding fossils on Mars, and finding some kind of mysterious, small alien artifact on Mars/close to Mars is interesting. Apparently there is also a long gap between these two events. Unobscuring these two events reveals something about the nature of these events. Further information is required.
