I've been delving into some of the historical videos available from the official Elite Dangerous YouTube channel to see if there are any tip-bits in chats/releases/updates that might help us out a bit.

During this video:
Join the Elite - Everything You Need to Know About Exploration

Michael Brooks makes an interesting point about SagA* (time ~26:30m ) being a special case, which I don't have context for, so I'm reaching out for collective ideas since I don't quite get if the reference. Is he referring that SagA* is actually different for known scientific reasons, or is it a special case because FDEV have decided to make it so?

He also mentions that another system was renamed, but deliberately they both choose not to reveal the original name (time ~36:30m).

Thoughts on these comments?
