So far nothing new. I've visited some Guardian systems again. Cool thing, there is another thread here which deals with the guardian bunkers. There seem to be drawings on top of them. Maybe just some fancy decoration, maybe something else. I never noticed them before.

Currently I'm reading the Dark Wheel text again..
Does anybody know whether someone tried to call his Commander "Henry Bell", got Elite, bought a Cobra, called it "Nemesis" and docked at Jameson Memorial?
Maybe that will trigger something? Could be this "tiny bit obvious" thing..
Interesting idea, haven't heard of anyone trying that. CMDR Henry Bell appears unused. Fastest CMDR to Elite?
