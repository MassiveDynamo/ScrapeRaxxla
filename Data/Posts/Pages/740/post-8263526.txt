P.S. - last round galaxy trip payed out 2 billions. So i just trying figure how to spend it.
It could be more if u do fair jumps wout NS

Without diverting this thread onto it...the answer to both of those comments is....Fleet carriers coming soon, don't spend it all too soon

So for no particular reason and certainly not any deep investigation, scientific theory or ancient myth connection, I am now looking between Sol - Lave and maybe Tau Ceti for Raxxla. I keep thinking how 'big' Sol is in game compared to most systems, obviously we know more but theres a lot a long way out and now we have these new FSS mechanics maybe theres another system nearby that's also quite big.
