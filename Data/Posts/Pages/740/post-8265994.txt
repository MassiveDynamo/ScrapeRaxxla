Was Beagle Point ever renamed from an original system generated name?

Also on the Winking Cat art theft theory, could the 17th, 20th and 23rd centuries for the art works be a time reference? Perhaps 5pm, 8pm and 11pm?

Just a left field idea forming...

I seem to remember it was named after Erimus Kamzel, who first reached it in his ship DSS BEAGLE. But it was quite early in the game. Perhaps a search through FD Newsletters?
