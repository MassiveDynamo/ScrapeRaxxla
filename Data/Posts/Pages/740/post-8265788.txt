I've been delving into some of the historical videos available from the official Elite Dangerous YouTube channel to see if there are any tip-bits in chats/releases/updates that might help us out a bit.

Join the Elite - Everything You Need to Know About Exploration



Michael Brooks makes an interesting point about SagA* (time ~26:30m ) being a special case, which I don't have context for, so I'm reaching out for collective ideas since I don't quite get if the reference. Is he referring that SagA* is actually different for known scientific reasons, or is it a special case because FDEV have decided to make it so?

He also mentions that another system was renamed, but deliberately they both choose not to reveal the original name (time ~36:30m).

Thoughts on these comments?

Just got round to watching this, great find! MB manages to make everything and anything possibly connected to Raxxla in my mind.

Sag A special case - the galaxy has hotspots of star classes or types depending on the age of that bit. WDs are stars at the end of their lifespan so are in older systems in the older parts of the galaxy for example. the Three Pillars Nebula has mostly disappeared in 3306 and new stars and planets have formed at the beginning of their system lifespan from the stellar dust and gas. Sag A is the BH that makes our galaxy exist at all, we are all rotating and spiralling into it and also crashing into the galaxy next door. Sag A isn't a normal BH in that respect creating its own system, its Supermassive creating its own Galaxy and not in the main BH regions of galaxy space, I don't know about Universe space or time but I think we are in a fairly new galaxy space time wise.

Dunno about the renaming or the post behind it, may be more clues there. May be referring to Beagle Point or other requested one.
