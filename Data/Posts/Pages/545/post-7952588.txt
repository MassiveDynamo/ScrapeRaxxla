GalNet articles mentioned that Wreaken Construction had a presence in the Col 70 Sector, although I now think that was the usual GalNet fluff: https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/588b1e769657ba121799dc8e

Wreaken was a plot point for Premonition, I wouldn't call it "fluff" per se, but the Galnet articles had a particular purpose for the book - we had no idea what was going on at the time and they appeared to be mostly unconnected news reports, until the book came out and pulled them all together.

Col 70 is still the end point of the research into the Thargoid artefacts, and all the breadcrumbs for that is still in the game. So I wouldn't discount Col 70 yet, although given that FD only agreed to put bits and pieces of Drew's story into the game world because of other priorities, I wouldn't expect to find a capital shipyard in there when it opens up - only more belligerent mantids.
