I now suspect the Omphalos Rift of the Codex, also “Astrophel and Spiralling Stars”, are strong hints that Raxxla is a black hole, entering the right one will transport the ship somewhere else. Possibly within the Milky Way (when it may be useful to gameplay) or perhaps more likely to a satellite cluster from which there may be no return (end game). We all have an Omphalos Stone in our ships-it’s the hologram display & when a BH is selected it shows matter funnelling in (Omphalos stone had a funnel-shaped hole). IIRC rotating black holes are a possible solution to cosmic wormholes.

BH have been in-game since the beginning; I think the first intimation that rogue planets might be possible was in the journal update for (I think) v3.

Edit: I’m going on perceived clues in the Codex here, and knowledge that DB is into astronomy IRL. Playing the percentages. Raxxla could, of course, be entirely different...

It may also be that the destination is in a cloud of angry goids in Col70! At some stage there was a hint that there be a way into there.

GalNet articles mentioned that Wreaken Construction had a presence in the Col 70 Sector, although I now think that was the usual GalNet fluff: https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/588b1e769657ba121799dc8e
