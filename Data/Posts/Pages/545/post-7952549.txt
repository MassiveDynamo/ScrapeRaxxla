Raxxla is a hot desert planet in the lore. I submitted images of what may be there.

There is no canon lore that describes anything about Raxxla or its location.
Everything has been retconned; Oolite books were fan fiction & never canon. The only thing of Holdstockâ€™s that seems to have (partially) made it into ED is the name Oisir-Raxxlans, which I suspect is where the Oresrian-Klaxian names originated.
