I dont really mean the rift. I mean Eafots. I think this because there are the club bases which say they have heard whispers in witch space and siren calls (exact wording on cannon, or I posted it a few pages back). So my theory is we were meant to find Raxxla during that mystery but didn't. Therefore they put that clue in the codex to point us back to this area. Dont listen to me know. I think I'm the only person on the thread who thinks its plausible.

As Han_Zen says, the Eafots base logs are recordings from ships in the expedition, so they were likely further out towards the Rift. (Edit: they didn’t know about Zurara, so their detected heat signature might have been her) In the original lore the Rift was a place of dread (that the goids travelled across but that’s been retconned & no longer canon, but it makes me think FD changed their minds and moved the goid threat detection from Bovomit to Col70). There is also the Wayfarers Graveyard-loads of derelict wrecks on the way out, never fully explained. If I remember correctly the logs suggested sabotaged fsd, Sirius Inc implicated, perhaps the Club preventing explorers from finding their Dynasty project etc. There may be more things to find out there, but it’s a big place to search, several people missed Zurara by a only a couple of lightyears. But Zurara is worth visiting if you haven’t done so yet.

Don’t think there ever was a coordinated attempt to record sounds of hyperspace or anything else, other than UA/UP; Audio analysts were/are in short supply! That “whisper in witchspace” crops up several times, think DrewW has also used it, but I suspect it’s only more fluff (until I actually hear some, but then I usually fly listening to radio).
