I wish. Unfortunately, not really understanding what ED was, when I started, I play on PS4, not on PC, making useful and interesting experiments like that very difficult. Probably possible....upload video clips to Twitter, download to PC, maybe.

My truthful but far less impressive plan was to jump around aimlessly, listening for anomalies during jumps and mapping undiscovered planets, in to futile hope I may get a human, or unknown POI pop up.

If you have a PC you could download the game onto it. Then login with your id. Don’t think you’re limited to number of copies, but can only play one at a time based on id. I have two PCs, with both my accounts on each. Then just login to whichever clone I want to play.
