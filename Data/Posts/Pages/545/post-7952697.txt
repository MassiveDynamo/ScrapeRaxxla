Tried to search on map "cassiopeiae" - didn't found even "ao cassiopeiae" ...searching "androme" found "andromedae" and "breamen" in loop ...can't see how they can be same...
ED names don't always reflect the name most commonly used in astronomy. Go to Simbad and plug in the system name there and you'll get a list of alternate names. Check for those. Of course, there's always the possibility that the star you are looking for doesn't even exist in-game. Trust me.
