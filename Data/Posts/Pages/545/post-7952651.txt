There is no canon lore that describes anything about Raxxla or its location.
Everything has been retconned; Oolite books were fan fiction & never canon. The only thing of Holdstockâ€™s that seems to have (partially) made it into ED is the name Oisir-Raxxlans, which I suspect is where the Oresrian-Klaxian names originated.

Everything is based on something. Go back and read my discovery post and reasoning about what is on Raxxla, and why. The logic is simple. If it is there, then someone made it. And I look into the artists, and techinical artists employed by FDEV at the time. If it exists, they created it. Then I explore their art related to Elite Dangerous - and question them about their art, which they cannot answer because of NDA from FDEV. If the art was not related to the game, they would of been able to discuss it. No response is an answer by itself. The locked door is the key.
