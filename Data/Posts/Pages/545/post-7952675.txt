Everything is based on something. Go back and read my discovery post and reasoning about what is on Raxxla, and why. The logic is simple. If it is there, then someone made it. And I look into the artists, and techinical artists employed by FDEV at the time. If it exists, they created it. Then I explore their art related to Elite Dangerous - and question them about their art, which they cannot answer because of NDA from FDEV. If the art was not related to the game, they would of been able to discuss it. No response is an answer by itself. The locked door is the key.

And the artists will respond to some random on the internet because? There is any number of reasons that they choose not to engage.
