Curious, does anyone know first person to reach Sag A in lore? How long did it take them? Was it an NPC or a player? Lastly what year was this?

Trying to get a correlation of time and technology.
In lore, no idea. We don’t have access to that kind of info. It might not even be publicly available.

In game, it was Cmdr Zulu Romeo. Don’t know the date off hand, but it was quite early on in the game IIRC.
