ZR has first discovered. That is lore.
He got there in the Gamma, just before release.
Yeah, but just in case it’s not clear to anyone what I meant, I was talking about the fact that UC First Discovered is not equal to ‘first discovered by humanity in the history of the game universe’, and although we can know (or find out) the former, we generally have no way of knowing the latter.
