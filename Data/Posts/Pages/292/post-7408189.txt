Problem with permit-locked systems is that we can SQL-query them out of the game database, and people have done this 100 pages back or so. Permit-locking Raxxla would make it *easier* to find, because we have access to the game files, and sites like EDDB and EDSM. I'm not going to spend the time to dig and find the exact threads from a year ago, but I specifically remember the discussion when Col 70 WAS locked, after a patch, and how a lot of the stars inside are actually "found" by people who've traveled there before the lock and long ago.

So, contrary to your theory, my theory is that Raxxla has been in the game since its debut, just no clues about it. And after 3? 4? years of us not finding it despite exploring the galaxy (because 200 billion stars vs. 30,000? players, makes it a needle in a haystack), they started adding all these Codex hints and some sort of mission-based themepark train ride to take us to it if we interpret "clues" correctly. Because I'm guessing the devs are tired of nobody finding it, or maybe not even caring. So, yeah, my theory is they haven't changed Raxxla, they're just adding clues and missions, more and more until we finally stumble upon it.

yeah, so many people are searching but how many of them are triple or quadruple elite + allied with the pilots federation etc? How many of them are worthy?
