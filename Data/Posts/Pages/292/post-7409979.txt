Quick question. I’m at work at the moment myself so I can’t check but Delphi seems connected somehow, and since the story goes that a stone was placed in the very center of the world and found to be Delphi, the Delphi system seems to have bit one landable planet. Has anyone gone and landed at 0/0 coordinance to see if there’s anything there?
