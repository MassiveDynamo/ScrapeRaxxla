Curious, does anyone know first person to reach Sag A in lore? How long did it take them? Was it an NPC or a player? Lastly what year was this?

Trying to get a correlation of time and technology.

Earliest Galnet mention of Sag A* give the name of the record holder, but nothing about the first visit.

23 APR 3301 â€“ Race to Center of Galaxy Starts in Sol

"At the time of broadcast, the galactic record holder for the fastest travel from Galileo station to Sgr A* is commander Anuranium, at the helm of a Faulcon DeLacy Anaconda."
