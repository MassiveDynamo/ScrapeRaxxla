That's a very cool image. How are you creating these images and alignments? are the stars shown (and your other posts) correct to the galmap locations?

If you had, say, 6 systems, could you draw lines between them and see where they cross over and relate that to the Galmap. like this:

Yes - one can.

Itâ€™s accurate and simple X;Y;Z plotting - I use a combination of in-game coordinates from gal-map and those obtained from EDDB. I utilise a very simple 3D CAD tool on Iphone, so I can build on the go, stars are indexed in an Excel document.

That rather pretty diagram of yours is exactly how I imagined the logo as well. Excellent.
