So due to such consistent obfuscation like many Cmdrs we got lost within the various rabbit holes looking for some context, the biggest burrow being Astrophel.

Going back ‘Astrophel’ simplest interpretation is ‘Astrophel and Stella’.

Afraid I strongly disagree! The simplest interpretation of “Astrophel” is the basic translation from the greek as “Star Lover”!

I’ve never been convinced by this assumed reference to Sidney, it’s a huge leap, & it’s well outside the game so therefore highly unlikely to be canonn for ED, so what is the attraction of this hypothesis? Has MB expressed an admiration for his prose? Was it referenced in any of the novels?
(Though I did subscribe at one point and dived a lot of dual black holes, since
“When nature made her chiefe worke, Stella’s eyes, In collour blacke
onely those two starres in Stella’s face.”)

Whether you want to interpret “Star Lover” as David Braben (oft expressed love of astronomy), or Black Hole (possibly supermassive), or something else is another question....

Edit: sorry, don't mean to sound grumpy. Copawlot had a fit at 06:20 yesterday. Licking his paws a lot during last night, so I woke at 3:30, 4:30 & 5:30. Then another fit at 11:00.
