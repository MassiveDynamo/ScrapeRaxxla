The toast as a map would make sense if viewed from Raxxla, the 6 points being landmarks visible from that location.

It’s the first concept I developed, but never applied due to not having a reliable source for all these 6 points… that’s ‘if’ they represent 6 points; in the same breath the introduction is equally describing just one thing.

So due to such consistent obfuscation like many Cmdrs we got lost within the various rabbit holes looking for some context, the biggest burrow being Astrophel.

Going back ‘Astrophel’ one of the simplest interpretations is ‘Astrophel and Stella’.

In this text Philip Sidney utilises many local astrological metaphors, but they are just that ‘local’…eg the moon, Mercury etc. However a numerical reading does draw correlations to Homers Odyssey.

It contains 108 stanzas, 108 iambic songs and 108 sonnets. This has been associated to be a numerical reference to where Penelope had 108 suitors.

I always interpreted Penelope as the yearning of the vagabonds heart! A journey home…Here we go again, another rabbit…
