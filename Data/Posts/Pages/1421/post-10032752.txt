First I'm hearing that there were six. I was only aware of three with the "security permit", which are coincidentally the three that still require permits in your list. Googling the others comes up with a blank except for your own message. Are there any screenshots or details on when these were locked?
it was a reddit post in summer 2021 whit a list of a bunch of permits. ppl ignored it saying that it's already on the wiki. i checked the list against wiki and these systems where not listed. so i bookmarked them as Security 0 - 5. the post was then deleted for some reason. I am sure they were permit locked. and had all the same description. I remember going to PRO EUR IG-Y D132 trying to find anything around that could give the permit
