Could well be! I wonder if that vertical axis, in your example here, might be Polaris then? Edit: I just realise Polaris relates to Earth's axis, not Sol.. right?
Polaris is the celestial north pole. It relates to earths rotation axis.
The ecliptic north pole is in Draco and is the top of most star maps. It relates to earths orbit around the sun.
Then there is the Galactic north pole in Coma Berenices.
There are of course south poles as well. We usually focus on the north poles, because most of us live on top of the globe.

Al the other planets in sol also have their own poles, as well:

In the search for Raxxla, Mars, Saturn or any planet may be as relevant as earth?

All these are 'valid' ophalos points, if we find relevant hints to back them up.
