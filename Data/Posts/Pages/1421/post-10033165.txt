Though along such lines, too.
But, knowing Fdev, that would probably be too easy.
We should expect some grind, like star coordinates forming a set of equations.
My personal favorite is "spiraling stars" as a coordinate transformation with a rotating/scaling matrix.
Maybe, but I don't think anyone's actually tried it, have they? If so what 6 systems did they use as points (will save me time if someone else has done the work!).
