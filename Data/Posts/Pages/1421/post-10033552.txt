That's a very cool image. How are you creating these images and alignments? are the stars shown (and your other posts) correct to the galmap locations?

If you had, say, 6 systems, could you draw lines between them and see where they cross over and relate that to the Galmap. like this:

We have been messing quite a bit with this interpretation of the Raxxla symbol, in the past. There are several ways it can be viewed.
Personally I have mostly focused on the interpretation with Sol as the centre. This is because of the Sun symbol in the logo.


The idea is then that the the use of the word Omphalos, suggests that Raxxla would lie somewhere on the vertical axis (location 1 -2 on the drawing).
That limits the search to the four locations, that makes up the horizontal plane (location 3-4 and 5-6).

We would still miss the distance though. This could possibly be indicated by other elements in the Raxxla symbol.
