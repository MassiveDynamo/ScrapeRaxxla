Yes - one can.

It’s simple X;Y;Z plotting - I use a combination of in-game coordinates from gal-map and those obtained from EDDB. I utilise a very simple 3D CAD tool on Iphone, so I can build on the go, stars are indexed in an Excel document.

That rather pretty ‘stupid waffle’ diagram is exactly how I imagined the logo as well.
Thanks! Good to know

You and Edelgard von Rhein gave me the idea of it being a 2d representation of a 3d shape.

I think the codex and possibly other clues give us 6 locations. It fits with something being in game since day 1. The clues all point to systems in galmap, we identify which 6, draw lines between them, see where they cross.

Just need 6 system names basically. Working on that atm but i suspect they've all been identified in this thread
