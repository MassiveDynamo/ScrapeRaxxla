I'm going to rerun the Yggdrasil race I mentioned above, with a Thargoid Sensor and Thargoid Probe and after visiting Bifrost touch down at Donar's Oak before activating the Thargoid Structure nearby. Currently I have two Thargoid Sensors but need a bit of luck to find a Thargoid Probe; am searching NHSS Threat 4 out in the Pleiades.
It would be ironic if a Buckyball Racing Club event from 3303 was part way to solving the mystery! The course can be run in either direction and I intend to take the route below, docking at the stations as in the race:
Jotunheim, Big Harry's Monkey Hangout
Vanir, McClintock Dock
Niflheimri, Roentgen Settlement
Nidanga, Blodgett Colony
Muspelheim
Midgard, Rontgen Port
Hel, Jones Orbital
Asgaa, Wheeler Horizons
Alfheim
Bifrost, Godwin Hangar

I might have to be careful if the Thargoid Probe is marked as stolen but then it will be a bit like The Black Riband, an old standing challenge that involved smuggling rare (and illegal) goods through a set of waypoints around the Bubble!
