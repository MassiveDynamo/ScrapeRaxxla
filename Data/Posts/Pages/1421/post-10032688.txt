Ha - yes come to think of it that would be a logical conclusion for that whole - someone went through the system idea.

One of my never-realised concepts was to retrace the Yggdrasil systems as they are portrayed in various prose, logically it ought to fit some narrative procedure, I never got around to it.

Systems I located were: Jormungand; Skuld; Veroandi; Uror; Uroarbrunnr; Utgard; Jotunheim; Midgard; Muspelheim; Niflheim; Alfheim; Urd; Jotnar; Helheim; Hel; Utgaroar; Niflhel; Ratatosk; Vanir; Bifrost; Nithhogg and Nastrond (a permit system).

Then the Nordic Runes - Ansuz; Fehu; Haglaz; Dagaz; Ehwaz; Laguz; Wunj√¥; Algiz; Ingwaz; Gebo; Tyr; and Jera.
