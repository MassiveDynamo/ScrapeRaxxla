That's a very cool image. How are you creating these images and alignments? are the stars shown (and your other posts) correct to the galmap locations?

If you had, say, 6 systems, could you draw lines between them and see where they cross over and relate that to the Galmap. like this:

Edited to remove stupid waffle

Though along such lines, too.
But, knowing Fdev, that would probably be too easy.
We should expect some grind, like star coordinates forming a set of equations.
My personal favorite is "spiraling stars" as a coordinate transformation with a rotating/scaling matrix.
