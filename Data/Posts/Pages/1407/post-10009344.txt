Yes, should be there since very early versions.
The problem is that we still don't have any confirmation it can be accessed. It has been stated it exists, but not what it is - what kind of resource/asset it is, whether it is any asset at all. And that kinda makes it hard to understand whether it's accessible.
Being accessible or not also depends on which version, what kind of asset, resource, location, permissions etc.

So it's hard to conclude one way or the other where it will be - it depends on all the mechanisms to make it available, and if those mechanisms are in place. And which version it happened (or will happen in the future).
