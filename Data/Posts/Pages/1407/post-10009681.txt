'The Toast' sure is a tantalising potential clue And parts of it match pretty accurately written logs recovered from the Dynasty missions regarding witchspace... in fact, I wonder if the Dynasty logs in their entirety might actually provide more matches to codex clues? I only actually re-read them recently for links to TDW novella, not actually looking for connections to the codex's.

The below is just the extract I already used, I'll go see if there's anything else interesting:
SPOILER: MATCHES BETWEEN DYNASTY MISSIONS AND DARK WHEEL CODEX TOAST









The use of the specific phrase "siren Song" could be a coincidence (as discussed previously it's not an uncommon trope), but... well... we've so little to go on.
