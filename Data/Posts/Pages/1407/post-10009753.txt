Honestly because of Drew Wagar being involved ... well... I'd long ago consigned all the Formidine stuff to the trash pile and assumed it was unconnected to anything important.

However, it's worth another look since there's little else to go on. I decided to widen it to literally ever other discovered log, outpost, comms relay, everything. There may be some through-line of hints that connects with the codex in a meaningful way... maybe...

You know... it's getting kinda interesting. I'll post a full report when I'm done
