As is the Toast as it is also for TDW which is why I assumed you were talking about TDW by the contents of your own post...

Aside from the Logo and Codex entry for Raxxla you have nothing else to go on for those, TDW Toast is not a clue for Raxxla.
Not sure if your assuming this is an argument with the multiple full stops, its not.

Raxxla Codex - TDW toast. this is why it was mentioned
