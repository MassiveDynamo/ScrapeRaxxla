That would more relate to TDW then, the codex image for TDW, which is why it was not mentioned.
As is the Toast as it is also for TDW which is why I assumed you were talking about TDW by the contents of your own post...

Ultimately - The toast is actually the only thing we do have to go on, along with small hints from FD in the past.
The Formidine Rift missions logs is what lead me to call it the song of the void, as per my other post.

The circle continues
Aside from the Logo and Codex entry for Raxxla you have nothing else to go on for those, TDW Toast is not a clue for Raxxla.
