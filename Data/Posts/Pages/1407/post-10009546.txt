The problem is that we still don't have any confirmation it can be accessed. It has been stated it exists, but not what it is - what kind of resource/asset it is, whether it is any asset at all. And that kinda makes it hard to understand whether it's accessible.
Being accessible or not also depends on which version, what kind of asset, resource, location, permissions etc.

So it's hard to conclude one way or the other where it will be - it depends on all the mechanisms to make it available, and if those mechanisms are in place. And which version it happened (or will happen in the future).
I already have a list of systems that would have been traversed from start to end of the route of the couriers that apparently introduced Mycoid to the Merritt Group station. Route plotting is being done with a stock Cobra MkIII drive which can get approximately 11 LY in as-is. Details have been confirmed and we have Universal Cartographics names for the end points: Atlantis and Regulus. I am hoping before long we have the station for TDW. If that can be found, we likely will have details on how to access Raxxla. I am fairly comfortable in the assessment that Soontill Relics are frauds as the characters behind the destroyed station were known to have sold alien artifact and technology forgeries in the past (multiple times). We are finally getting closer.
