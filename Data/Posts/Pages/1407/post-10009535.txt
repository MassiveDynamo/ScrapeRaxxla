Something that just occurred to me for things in my own methods.

Witch-Space is mentioned in the toast and I for one have never tried this till now.

When your looking at things in various places you have a list of things you do, i.e. honk three times or spin twice ECT ECT.

Add a unplotted hyperspace jump to the list, it has an audio trigger in the game, so could also have a position based trigger for something else.
Just a thought, and it only takes 1 second.
