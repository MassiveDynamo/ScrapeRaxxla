For me with TDW never finding Raxxla, I try and treat them differently/sepertaly.
Which is hard, as you say, it is TDW toast that we are working with effectivly.


TBH no one has a clue who is right or wrong or if were all right, or all wrong.
To me this forum is a brainstorm area. I don't disagree with anyone's opinions or findings, and apologies if my post came across wrongly. to old to fight on forums
My point being as for Raxxla, all we have is the toast in the codex, and some choice words from FD.

I'm just throwing thoughts, ifs and buts in for the greater good of the bigger question

I dont have twitter either, which i feel from a few of your posts i should get lol.
