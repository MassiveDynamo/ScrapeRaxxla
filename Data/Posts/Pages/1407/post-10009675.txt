I have tendonitis in my right hand...the sound of one thumb twiddling.......



Stopped off at a friendly FC in Statue of Liberty nebula yesterday afternoon to sell some UC data & reload AFMS.
Back enroute to Circinus Pulsar...176 jumps to go...
Now Fsd has server interruptus

...Then probably a couple of days to await the bug fixes and update to EDDiscovery to suit legacy/live galaxies
