Whatever the Arthurian legends tells us, they are at least acknowledged in the game. Both Annwn and Avalon are represented by systems.
Annwn can be seen as Hell (Welsh otherworld) and Avalon can be a Heaven.

The systems are close to each other, just bellow Achenar.
The Lord Of Raxxla casts his gaze out upon Heaven and Hell and the Plane In Between, with his Right Hand he gives his aid through His Servants the Children of Raxxla to therefore the House of Raxxla within it the Holy Generation these things all must grow with time. The Lord of Raxxla is not Dead as some say he merely is the Once and Future King he who gives the Cup of Covenant to all his Servants to act as the Incarnation of His Word.

There are more Templars than the Dark Wheel. This is from the book Imprint (set in the later years of GalCop): "The bulletin analysis already laid the blame on the Knights Templars, a terrorist force across the galaxies which seemed far better organised in recent years and was committed to destabilizing GalCop."
Where do you learn these things unless you perhaps are a member of such a secretive organization yourself, or a veteran of the Lore of Raxxla?
