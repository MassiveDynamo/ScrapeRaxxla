It makes sense that Raxxla which is a state of Enlightenment shared among a Sacred Kinship, it makes sense that an Ancient Order of Knights a Holy Brotherhood would have sworn by this Cup of Covenant passing it down to the Templar as had been to them, by their Elite Combateer Ancestors, the Templar obviously becoming the Freemasons then happens to evolve into the Modern Day Dark Wheel (which may be a reference to the galactic monument found at the Tionisla Graveyard, where the Elite Combateer look o'er the Realms of the Dead across Eternity and the Living and the Dead working to secure the Celestial Portal between Realms. When you get to the Battlements of the Heavens at least you'll have experience there Commander.
There are more Templars than the Dark Wheel. This is from the book Imprint (set in the later years of GalCop): "The bulletin analysis already laid the blame on the Knights Templars, a terrorist force across the galaxies which seemed far better organised in recent years and was committed to destabilizing GalCop."
