Is Raxxla not within the Empyrean but in Hell? Or rather below it in the Otherworld!
I don't think Hell or Chaos ties in at all with MB's love of Paradise Lost, which he clearly expended a fair amount of effort to embody in the game. You've identified the Empyrean as being in/on the border of Alliance space, which definitely agrees with the clue we have from MB in his Elite Legacy novel.

If Han_Zen's hypothesis is correct that there is a gateway/doorway/alien construct related to Raxxla then I suspect either Raxxla is Paradise and there is a gateway to it, or Raxxla itself is the gateway &we have no idea to what...either way as DB said "you don't know what it is!"
