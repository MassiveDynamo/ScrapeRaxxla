There are lots of possible connections. Most are probably pure coincidence.
King Arthurs last name is Pendragon, meaning head dragon (from Welsh). The name Arthur is speculated to mean bear, from Celtic Arto or Welsh Arth. This actually fits even better with Art than Arthur.
Bear links to the Ursa constellations. As does the idea that the name comes from the star Arcturus. Arcturus means "guardian of the bear" in ancient Greek.

Arcturus in ED has a gas giant named Arcas. Arcas was the son of Zeus and Castillo (Ursa Major) that ended up in the sky, as Ursa Minor.
Arcturus also have a rocky body named Major.

Colm means dove. That would be the Columba constellation.

This is from just some quick googling.

It makes sense that Raxxla which is a state of Enlightenment shared among a Sacred Kinship, it makes sense that an Ancient Order of Knights a Holy Brotherhood would have sworn by this Cup of Covenant passing it down to the Templar as had been to them, by their Elite Combateer Ancestors, the Templar obviously becoming the Freemasons then happens to evolve into the Modern Day Dark Wheel (which may be a reference to the galactic monument found at the Tionisla Graveyard, where the Elite Combateer look o'er the Realms of the Dead across Eternity and the Living and the Dead working to secure the Celestial Portal between Realms. When you get to the Battlements of the Heavens at least you'll have experience there Commander.
