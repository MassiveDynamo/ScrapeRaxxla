Whatever the Arthurian legends tells us, they are at least acknowledged in the game. Both Annwn and Avalon are represented by systems.
Annwn can be seen as Hell (Welsh otherworld) and Avalon can be a Heaven.

The systems are close to each other, just bellow Achenar.

“The systems are close to each other, just bellow Achenar.”

“The Beaumont system was a frontier world far below Achenar.” Elite Legacy.

Far below these Lost Realms is a system called Michel (French for Michael) and Sopedu - (Guardian of the East), this is in alignment with the Brookes Tours; in Paradise Lost Michael casts out Adam and Eve at the Eastern Gates of Paradise.

Is Raxxla not within the Empyrean but in Hell? Or rather below it in the Otherworld!
