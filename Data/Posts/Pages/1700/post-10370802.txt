I like the Art - Guardian reference… so it could be guardian of the thorny branch? Back to Guardians…
The Guardian parallel is definitely strong. Like Han_Zen touched on, the Pendragon name was derived from Arthur's father Uther who seems to have laid the seeds of his son's downfall by "shape shifting" into his enemy to have an illegitmate child with Lady Igraine. This illegitimacy then occurred with Mordred who ended up being the downfall of Arthur. It does feel similar to the Guardian's being undone by their own Construct which determined they are unfit to rule the galaxy. The fact it was the Civil Construct making that determination and not the Military one is also telling.

The naming Pendragon as the Uther wiki suggests,
"is composed of the Old Welsh prefix pen- "a tall hill; headlands; great heights", which is still used for place names in Wales and Cornwall (as in the famous Cornish town Penzance, or "holy headland") combined with the Old English dragoun "dragon" which was borrowed from the Old French dragon (originally the Latin accusative noun draconem "a massive serpent or sea creature"
More mountain and monster parallels.
