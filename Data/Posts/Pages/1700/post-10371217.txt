The term upon the outer rim from the removed missions, if viewed through the prism of Paradise Lost, in context to the phrase, the jewel that burns upon the brow, and the Miltonian quote about a pendant world; does make me suspicious that FD is describing the location of Raxxla in the same manner to which Milton did for Paradise, as being upon the outer rim of Chaos.

I feel a lot of the information from the codex is painting a very wide picture which actually identifies the Miltonian Cosmological Model, and therefore Raxxla’s position below the Empyrean.

This however might be conflicted against the prominence of systems and environmental factors pointing to the Lost Realms zone. So in my opinion Raxxla is still in this intermediate flux; it’s more likely higher up, upon the Empyrean/Chaos boundary, but equally it could be below the Otherworld?

Of course I do strongly believe this Otherworld/Underworld realm is likewise an integral part of the cosmological model in that its linked via the Path of Jacques, which technically could be the path of Satan out of hell.

A bridge to the Empyrean?
