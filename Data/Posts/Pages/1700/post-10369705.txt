There are multiple references to thunder gods in the game. There are references to princess being rescued from dragon…the heros quest…. And references to the celestial axis.

All of these can be related to the early myths involving (usually a thunder god) fighting a dragon/serpent. Sometimes related to a world axis, often the snake is a”world” snake … later the gods are replaced with larger than life Heros and the snake is guarding some kind of boon or treasure…

Ya this is the kind of stuff Holdstock enjoyed - especially in his Mythagos. The Arthur legends have alot of that - and when i think of Art Tornquist i think of Holdstocks Ragthorn …
There are lots of possible connections. Most are probably pure coincidence.
King Arthurs last name is Pendragon, meaning head dragon (from Welsh). The name Arthur is speculated to mean bear, from Celtic Arto or Welsh Arth. This actually fits even better with Art than Arthur.
Bear links to the Ursa constellations. As does the idea that the name comes from the star Arcturus. Arcturus means "guardian of the bear" in ancient Greek.

Arcturus in ED has a gas giant named Arcas. Arcas was the son of Zeus and Castillo (Ursa Major) that ended up in the sky, as Ursa Minor.
Arcturus also have a rocky body named Major.

Colm means dove. That would be the Columba constellation.

This is from just some quick googling.
