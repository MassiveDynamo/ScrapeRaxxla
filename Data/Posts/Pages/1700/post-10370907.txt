The Guardian parallel is definitely strong. Like Han_Zen touched on, the Pendragon name was derived from Arthur's father Uther who seems to have laid the seeds of his son's downfall by "shape shifting" into his enemy to have an illegitmate child with Lady Igraine. This illegitimacy then occurred with Mordred who ended up being the downfall of Arthur. It does feel similar to the Guardian's being undone by their own Construct which determined they are unfit to rule the galaxy. The fact it was the Civil Construct making that determination and not the Military one is also telling.

The naming Pendragon as the Uther wiki suggests,

More mountain and monster parallels.
Whatever the Arthurian legends tells us, they are at least acknowledged in the game. Both Annwn and Avalon are represented by systems.
Annwn can be seen as Hell (Welsh otherworld) and Avalon can be a Heaven.

The systems are close to each other, just bellow Achenar.
