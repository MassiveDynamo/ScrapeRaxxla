There are lots of possible connections. Most are probably pure coincidence.
King Arthurs last name is Pendragon, meaning head dragon (from Welsh). The name Arthur is speculated to mean bear, from Celtic Arto or Welsh Arth. This actually fits even better with Art than Arthur.
Bear links to the Ursa constellations. As does the idea that the name comes from the star Arcturus. Arcturus means "guardian of the bear" in ancient Greek.

Arcturus in ED has a gas giant named Arcas. Arcas was the son of Zeus and Castillo (Ursa Major) that ended up in the sky, as Ursa Minor.
Arcturus also have a rocky body named Major.

Colm means dove. That would be the Columba constellation.

This is from just some quick googling.

I like the Art - Guardian reference… so it could be guardian of the thorny branch? Back to Guardians…
