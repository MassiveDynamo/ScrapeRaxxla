Where do you learn these things unless you perhaps are a member of such a secretive organization yourself, or a veteran of the Lore of Raxxla?
I'm not very secretive. I have been around the Elite universe a while though. I've played the games and read the old books. Nothing more than that.
My memory is quite key-word sensitive. When you say 'Templars', I think 'we have those in Elite'. So I just look it up.

The book with the quote is called Imprint. FD has reused that word, for the Thargoid Imprint. A stat you get for scanning the Thargoid device.


Another example of reuse of particular words, is the word construct. It was used in the Dark Wheel to describe the portal on Raxxla. FD has reused it as a name for the sentient AI, created by the Guardians.

Things like that makes me think that the old books are worth a quick read.
