I don't think Hell or Chaos ties in at all with MB's love of Paradise Lost, which he clearly expended a fair amount of effort to embody in the game. You've identified the Empyrean as being in/on the border of Alliance space, which definitely agrees with the clue we have from MB in his Elite Legacy novel.

If Han_Zen's hypothesis is correct that there is a gateway/doorway/alien construct related to Raxxla then I suspect either Raxxla is Paradise and there is a gateway to it, or Raxxla itself is the gateway &we have no idea to what...either way as DB said "you don't know what it is!"

Well MB may have indicated what Raxxla was not, which is to say it might be ‘something different’ when someone asked if SD was a good example, so we might assume it’s not a body?

I suspect Raxxla to be certainly in a system, for everything in game is within a system (an instance) so it must be something in a system but probably not a body, and like the garden design might indicate its within the structure of a system so possibly something around a body?

I suspect Raxxla is the construct/gateway/state of enlightenment but it’s - in a system, and that system is simply a ‘representation’ of Paradise - as a type of ‘Lost Realm’ like other examples also appear in game, that system hangs from the Empyrean. One might presume its in or of the rings of a particular body?
