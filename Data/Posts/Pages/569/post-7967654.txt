Finding Raxxla goes through TDW. The part a tiny little bit obvious.
What the point of the invite, if not ?
TDW is it's own mystery as well as part of the Raxxla mystery, isn't it?
Getting a TDW invite has value in it self.

As TDW still hasn't found Raxxla, an invite is only one step towards it. It could be a required step, like 'We know it's in Bovomit. We can hack you a permit. Good luck' or it could be a set of myths that has to be interpreted. Hopefully those myths make more sense to us than they do to TDW.

Reading the codex makes me think that the way to get an invite, is to first find the station. There may have been plans for other routs when the old missions were about, but now it seems the station is the key.

We have no info for how long the station has been in game. It could be a relatively new addition, for all we know.
