Notice - GalNet changes
Meh. "Show, don't tell." Put another way, if Frontier are interested in world-building (as they should be imho) there are better ways of doing it than what we've been getting via GalNet.

"The Gan Romero storyline was always envisaged as an off-camera narrative. The fact that some people assumed it had an in-game component, and went searching for Romero, was for me further evidence that off-camera GalNet stories could be detrimental to the player experience, and cemented our desire to ensure that all GalNet content related to things that were actually in the game."

Off-camera. Same as Halsey was. Nothing happened until there was a CG to locate the wreckage of SS1. That was more than a year later, I think.
Almost all stories in ED have started of as off-camera. Some have materialized into something, while others haven't.
