I don't think the Gan Romero story is just fluff. I think it's a 'primer' for the next phase in the Guardian story. It has obvious links to Halsey's story, that was meant (according to the codex) to lead to the first ruins.

I Halsey's case, it took quite a while from the story, to actual in-game assets.
No. It was totally fluff according to this post from Community Manager Stephen Bannedetti:
Notice - GalNet changes
Meh. "Show, don't tell." Put another way, if Frontier are interested in world-building (as they should be imho) there are better ways of doing it than what we've been getting via GalNet.

"The Gan Romero storyline was always envisaged as an off-camera narrative. The fact that some people assumed it had an in-game component, and went searching for Romero, was for me further evidence that off-camera GalNet stories could be detrimental to the player experience, and cemented our desire to ensure that all GalNet content related to things that were actually in the game."
