FDev removed the 'fluff' writers from Galnet because the community went chasing after some 'clue' they accidentally dropped, and moved them, where? Feedback on the Enclave II was pretty good compared to the first one too, so maybe FDev have finally noticed that a good story goes a long way with players?
What we really need is for Frontier to go back and curate all of the old Galnet stuff and provide us with a definitive list of which articles are significant. As it is I've completely thrown out my "murder board" of Galnet articles that I thought might be significant. Everything seems completely irrelevant now. I haven't dusted off my HOTAS since finding out that the whole Gan Romero plot line was pure fluff. I'd always assumed that everything in Galnet (the official stuff not the player submitted stuff) was significant to the game in some way, even if the payoff wasn't immediate.
