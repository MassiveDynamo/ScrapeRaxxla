I don't want to get too deep into an argument but there is a different between something that occurs off-camera and eventually has an in-game element. I think Frontier is admitting here that the Gan Romero story never was never intended to have an in-game element. What they've said is that future Galnet content will actually be relevant to the game ... meaning that Gan Romero and his story arc simply weren't relevant at all. It was window dressing.
It's a pity that FD are planning to stop these stories, with no in-game element. If nothing else, Gan's story was a reminder of Halsey's visions. New player may not be aware of this. If a few new players learn something from a story like this, it was worth writing.
Not allowing in-game lore with out in-game content, is just an excuse to reduce writing hours.
The off-camera stories were always better, as they weren't limited by the game's relatively simple mechanics.
