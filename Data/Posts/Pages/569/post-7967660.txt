One possible perspective we might not have looked into with parts of the toast.

Ex. The Parent's Grief

At this point all I can think is we looked into the parents themselves we never did a search on the name of the person/god they are grieving over.
I think The Parent's Grief refers to to the previous generations of TDWers and their grief that they were unable to locate Raxxla.

There could be a double meaning though.
