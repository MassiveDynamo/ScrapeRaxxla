Off-camera. Same as Halsey was. Nothing happened until there was a CG to locate the wreckage of SS1. That was more than a year later, I think.
Almost all stories in ED have started of as off-camera. Some have materialized into something, while others haven't.
I don't want to get too deep into an argument but there is a different between something that occurs off-camera and eventually has an in-game element. I think Frontier is admitting here that the Gan Romero story never was never intended to have an in-game element. What they've said is that future Galnet content will actually be relevant to the game ... meaning that Gan Romero and his story arc simply weren't relevant at all. It was window dressing.
