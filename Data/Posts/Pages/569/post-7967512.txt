Update: Operation Less Than Three
The Quest To Find Raxxla
I believe Galnet reported that the Martian Artifact was no larger than a child’s hand. If that is true then it can’t be any of the Guardian artefacts that we are currently aware of. I think this is where a lot of the omphalos arguments are coming from...

This is more of an FYI post for those interested in TDW 'invitation' way of finding Raxxla, so stop reading now if that's not your style.

A few more points of interest.

1. I haven't ever seen a 'Founder or Elite' mission for a wing in TDW faction, it's always solo missions only.
2. Founder or Elite missions aren't just isolated to The Dark Wheel faction, each faction from JM can give missions ranked as such. I'm just choosing to focus on TDW.
