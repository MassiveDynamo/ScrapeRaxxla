What we really need is for Frontier to go back and curate all of the old Galnet stuff and provide us with a definitive list of which articles are significant. As it is I've completely thrown out my "murder board" of Galnet articles that I thought might be significant. Everything seems completely irrelevant now. I haven't dusted off my HOTAS since finding out that the whole Gan Romero plot line was pure fluff. I'd always assumed that everything in Galnet (the official stuff not the player submitted stuff) was significant to the game in some way, even if the payoff wasn't immediate.

I don't think the Gan Romero story is just fluff. I think it's a 'primer' for the next phase in the Guardian story. It has obvious links to Halsey's story, that was meant (according to the codex) to lead to the first ruins.

I Halsey's case, it took quite a while from the story, to actual in-game assets.
