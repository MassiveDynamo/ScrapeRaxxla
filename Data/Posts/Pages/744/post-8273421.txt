Yeah, there are a few good hits in that hypothesis. The old Greek myth of the Lyre also fits well with the DW toast.

Orpheus, it's owner was one of the Argonauts(vagabonds) and quelled the voices of the sirens with his music. He also went to the underworld (deepest void) to retrieve his dead lover.
He was also was a founder and prophet of the Orphic mysteries.
