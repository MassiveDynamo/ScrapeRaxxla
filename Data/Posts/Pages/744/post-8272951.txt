I've been also looking for nuggets in PAX East 2017 - Interview with David Braben and If these are CMDR Braben's ship locations, why Asellus Primus? Except the 8th 'moon' is a sun that's the right colour for TDW station image and it's a casual 5M LS away from entry point! Will check it out after I finish my journey to Voyager.
Edit: Ugh, exited super-cruise at Voyager and ended appearing at SOL (Sun). Grr.. fine checking out AP now!
SPOILER: INTERESTING SHIP DOCK LOCATIONS

I don't expect much except a lot of integrity damage to my trusty AspX explorer ship from the long trip, but will keep you posted.

Fly Dangrously!

Some weird interaction at Asellus Primus B (which is a loooong trip to get too).

Probably bugs, or if I'm thinking positively it's potentially a station that I can 'see' because I'm not invited!. However, I couldn't find a moon/asteroid/planet like the one from the DW post which I suspect is a pretty definitive clue IMO.

It doesn't discount the system importance though, since DB doesn't just 'randomly' put things into his video streams. After watching a lot of them I get the impression he likes to drop these little teasers to intrigue and aid people subtly.

SPOILER: CONTACTS, THEN CONTACTS LOST - LOTS





Edit: Seems to have been an instance blip - re-logged to check Open again, Private Group and Solo and all appears 'normal'. I still see some ships but the contact visible and lost doesn't seem to be occurring.

So that'll teach me to be positive! [Slap] Ok, back to my pessimistic searching with some mild optimism.
