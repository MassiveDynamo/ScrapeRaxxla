raxxla ....if we are to believe the elite dangerous universe timeline, almost certainly is within 300 ly of sol as there are less than 300 years since space travel to other systems began and the first mention of raxxla and the fastest ships could travel at this time appears to be 1ly per year.

We've already had hints from fdev employees that it's near the bubble, so this fits.

Since it hasn't been "discovered" yet as any given planet. ..i'm convinced still that the beans were semi-spilled and that it is an object hiding in a roid belt. Most of these are unexplored in-person (normal space) even in the bubble.

I'd say that sphere of searching is really the best guess.
