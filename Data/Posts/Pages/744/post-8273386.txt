raxxla ....if we are to believe the elite dangerous universe timeline, almost certainly is within 300 ly of sol as there are less than 300 years since space travel to other systems began and the first mention of raxxla and the fastest ships could travel at this time appears to be 1ly per year.

not so (quote from other threads here):

22nd Century - Hyperspace Travel (of some sort) Invented.
2800 - Faraway Jump (used navigational systems to make Hyperspace safer - took hundreds of years to establish)
3100 - Quirium Drive (Single-ship safe Hyperdrive jumping using 'Quirium' as 'fuel')
3200 - Class 2B (Totally different type of Hyperdrive, possible wormhole travel)
3300 - FSD (Almost exactly the same as the Quirium Drive, but longer range and not Quirium Fuelled)

In addition there is some conjecture that the timelines for FTL travel have been altered. Haven't got a reference for this but I know Drew Wagar was exercised about it.

Jason Ryder could have traveled 10kly on his search for Raxxla - he had months or years to do it and the ships of that time were not constrained to jump only to stars - they could be just plotted through space 7ly at time. See the Dark wheel novella where Alex and Elyssia hyperspace to Rafe Zetter's ship 0.1ly out away from Tionisla, for instance..

We've already had hints from fdev employees that it's near the bubble, so this fits.

Either you can provide evidence or this is not true.
