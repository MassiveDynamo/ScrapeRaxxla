I tend to agree with you, I was just messing about to see if any references popped out though. And you see where it lead me ...
EDIT: Still trying to see if LYTA can be some other kind of reference in physics as well. I doubt the codex entries have such relevant reference or meaning though.
I doubt FD coming up with such an elaborate piece and non-coherent 'hoax'. But this is the first time we actively use the codex as part of the metadata to solve the mystery.

Lyta Crane is at least an interesting name. It's anagrams contains several funny words, like Cat, Art and Lyre.

I dabbled a bit with the Lyre / Lyra / Lyra variety, because of Vega and stellar princesses and all that.

My best find is the Anagram: T Lyrae can.

T Lyare (HIP 90883 in ED) is a Binary system with a carbon main star. That would take care of T Lyrae a C (HIP 90883 a is a C class star) and just leave the N. I haven't scanned it, so I dont know if the star is actually a C-N class.
The N could also be a counter. As the 14 letter in the alphabet, it could point to the 14th planet: HIP 90883 A 2f. This is the 8th moon of the A 2 gas giant.

T Lyrae is also known as "The Jewel in the Harp": http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/tlyr.html

That name is sometimes applied to Vega, as well.

I haven't had the chance to visit and probably wan't for a few day. If anyone is close, you could take a look.
