New Contact / Contact Lost usually refers to USS that have timers before degrading. If youre lucky you farm a HGE one that respawns as you pick it up. Easiest way is to use FSS to find the new signals if nowhere near a nav beacon. Nav Beacon resolves all signals and current USS even if they aren't on your NavPanel yet.
