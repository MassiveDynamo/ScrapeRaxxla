thx by google translate

I wouldn't thank google translate too early. It looks like your written English is far far better than google translate

A lot of missions have follow-on missions including Sol factions. I like your thinking about how we are 'expected' to play the game, as in how they thought we would, not how they think we should. I know DB has said he expected people to jump around more, instead we tended to stay in one spot and investigate and explore every inch of it, no idea if that just means they built a bigger inhabited bubble and put more things in more system so more activity or something more meaningful though.
