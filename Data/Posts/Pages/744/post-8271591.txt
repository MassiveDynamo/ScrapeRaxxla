Youâ€™ve been here a long time, as I understand it, tell me, and you were looking for the voices that were in the ship Thetis?
No. I havent figured much of the riddle out at all. Most of my knowledge in game comes from this thread and a few posts and youtube videos from guru-951.

Most of my theories were based on comparing the Raxxla image to things in game with similar shapes from different angles.

One involved how close the Raxxla image looked compared to a specific image of a tesseract, but without any ideas of where we should be looking.

Another was, i thought the guardian beacon from a certain perspective looked very similar to the Raxxla image's specific shape, but still no real idea of how to use that.

I wish i could be more useful to the thread but im just learning as info comes along.

I cant find either images to display anymore but they are buried in this thread, somewhere in the last 300 pages or so.
