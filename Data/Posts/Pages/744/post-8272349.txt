Lyta is not really a name.. that may be good or bad. My 1st guess was LYTA are all star classes, but I've not got anywhere wit that either. Astrophil not really related to Lyta crane - one is TDW , the other is Raxxla - it may be a mistake to join the codex entries in this way, but link Astophil with Astro-physics in general may be helpful..

Spiralling stars might point to merger events for detecting gravity waves, but unfortunately these events are all outside the milky way.
