Ok, on a few different occasions, I have seen repostings of this hoax and friends have brought up OA's April Fools Video claiming Raxxla has been found and to use a set of keystrokes in the Jump sequence to deactivate the jump and find yourself in a system containing Raxxla. Folk's. If you have not already figured this out to be false and a joke, let me put this to rest right now.

Now, having stated this, this is not to say that another sequence of keystrokes, done in some sequence during the Witch Space (Jump Sequence) which has yet to be found, may work.

IIRC, miss-jump was shortly in the early version (beta ?) of ED, but was soon removed?
In a book it was joystick down (or up) and engines shut down during the countdown.
