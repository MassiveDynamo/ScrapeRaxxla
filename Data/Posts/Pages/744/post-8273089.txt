New Contact / Contact Lost usually refers to USS that have timers before degrading. If youre lucky you farm a HGE one that respawns as you pick it up. Easiest way is to use FSS to find the new signals if nowhere near a nav beacon. Nav Beacon resolves all signals and current USS even if they aren't on your NavPanel yet.
Yeah I used to farm HGE that way when I was heavily engineering.

For the Asellus Primus system, I checked the FSS and actually scanned all the new signals for the entire system (~40) and again when I arrived at 'B', just to make sure there wasn't something hiding nearby that I couldn't see. I checked all new signals as they appeared just in case... which were all 0.19ly away, and alas no hiding DW station.

I'm actually still out there. Wondering why there is a MK3 Cobra just circling. If they were from TDW I'd call it, but alas they're just from the local faction.

SPOILER: KITTY PALMER - A WANDERER 5,000,000 LS FROM THE STATION!
