Lyta is not really a name.. that may be good or bad. My 1st guess was LYTA are all star classes, but I've not got anywhere wit that either. Astrophil not really related to Lyta crane - one is TDW , the other is Raxxla - it may be a mistake to join the codex entries in this was, but link Astophil with Astro-physics in general may be helpful..

I tend to agree with you, I was just messing about to see if any references popped out though. And you see where it lead me ...
EDIT: Still trying to see if LYTA can be some other kind of reference in physics as well. I doubt the codex entries have such relevant reference or meaning though.
I doubt FD coming up with such an elaborate piece and non-coherent 'hoax'. But this is the first time we actively use the codex as part of the metadata to solve the mystery.
