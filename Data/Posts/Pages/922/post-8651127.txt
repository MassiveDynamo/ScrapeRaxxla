Tinfoil.

A COVAS purchase is available that has either Norman Lovett or a soundalike, sounds exactly like a HOLographic computer from another sci fi series, Red dwarf.

In Red Dwarf during one particularly important moment involving complex equations, during the countdown HOL skipped the number 7 and then said something like '7, Ive always had a blind spot with 7s'

Conclusion:

HOL is not just COVAS but actually running the software!

On a side note I am working on a much longer disconnected tinfoil saga involving retcons that may well be my magnum opus of tinfoilery, hows everyone else doing?

Ahhh, the old HolyHop drive. He always had a blind spot with 7. Took them to a parallel universe where the gender attitudes of the 1990's were reversed.

I have that COVAS on my mining ship, which is a type-10 painted red and named "Red Dwarf". (Sure it's not the only one in the ED universe ) but if I hear him say "Frame shift drive engaged" one more time, I'm going to fly it into the nearest black hole
