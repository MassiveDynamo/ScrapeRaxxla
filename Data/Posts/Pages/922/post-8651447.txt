Funny you mention number 33 in astronomy there is a Messier Object M33 which is also referred to as the constellation Triangulum which is also known as Triangulum Galaxy.

I remember hearing about the number 33 has a lot of mystery as well.

Even the number 3 has some going on but I recall what exactly anymore. I doubt this has any relevance to Raxxla or anything I figure I put it out there as it was the first thing that came to mind.
