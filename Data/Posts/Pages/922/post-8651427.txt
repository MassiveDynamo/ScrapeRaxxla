I think it's clear that Astrophel in the poem Astrophel and Stella, refers to the author Phillip Sidney. Sidney was know as the Swan, due to the similarity of the words Sidney and cygne. In a eulogy by Edmund Spenser, he is described as a swan that dies and rises to the heavens to become a star sign......

I was also hoping for 34 dots in the Raxxla symbol, but it seems most likely to be 33(unless we count the dot in the middle).

"The poem consists of 3 prefatory stanzas, 33 stanzas of elegy, and 3 describing the grief of Astrophel's fellow shepherds, in sixains rhyming ababcc. The concluding lines prepare the reader for another elegy, "The Dolefull Lay of Clorinda", presumably written by the Countess of Pembroke.[6] "
