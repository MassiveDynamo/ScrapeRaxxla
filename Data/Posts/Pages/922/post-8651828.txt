Nice summary and strong leads.

Does the system have a couple of barycenters perhaps?
7 and 8 could be barycenters. Perhaps if someone could check a system with barycenter or two for comparison? (sorry I'm off to bed now, so I can't test it myself)

I've seen something similar when you scan a new system via EDD and it throws up a temp-barycenter (a fake 3d-planet as a placeholder) until the siblings have been scanned.
If the barycenter needs to be tracked by Starforge it would make sense that they have an ID.
The system has one barycenter. It's the one denoted as {"Null":9}. It's the parent of 34 P Cygni 4 and 34 P Cygni 5.
