I'm currently out and about in 34 P Cygni: https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/6097757/name/34+P+Cygni

Why?
I think it's clear that Astrophel in the poem Astrophel and Stella, refers to the author Phillip Sidney. Sidney was know as the Swan, due to the similarity of the words Sidney and cygne. In a eulogy by Edmund Spenser, he is described as a swan that dies and rises to the heavens to become a star sign.

P = Philip and perhaps Princess
Cygni = Sidney = Astrophel

I was also hoping for 34 dots in the Raxxla symbol, but it seems most likely to be 33(unless we count the dot in the middle).

P Cygni brightened considerably in the year 1600 (shortly after Sidney's death) and was a considered a possible Nova, by Kepler and other astronomers.

The system has 'spiralling stars'. 4 Y class dwarfs. 3 with large rings and one with a planet. The planet is not landable, but has two rings it self.

The system is also a decent 'Gate to Elysium', as it's right on the border to the Elysian fields region.

I haven't found anything mysterious in the system, but there is plenty of places to hide something in the rings.

I do have a question though. I peaked at my Journal log file and spotted that the system body IDs are a bit odd.

They are:
BodyID 0: 34 P Cygni
BodyID 1: 34 P Cygni 1
BodyID 2: 34 P Cygni 1 A ring
BodyID 3: 34 P Cygni 2
BodyID 4: 34 P Cygni 2 A ring
BodyID 5: 34 P Cygni 3
BodyID 6: 34 P Cygni 3 A ring
BodyID 9: Null (Center for 4 and 5 pair)
BodyID 10: 34 P Cygni 4
BodyID 11: 34 P Cygni 5
BodyID 12: 34 P Cygni 5 A ring
BodyID 13: 34 P Cygni 5 B ring

7 and 8 are missing. I wonder if this is normal or if it is a sign of something hidden?

Nice summary and strong leads.

Does the system have a couple of barycenters perhaps?
7 and 8 could be barycenters. Perhaps if someone could check a system with barycenter or two for comparison? (sorry I'm off to bed now, so I can't test it myself)

I've seen something similar when you scan a new system via EDD and it throws up a temp-barycenter (a fake 3d-planet as a placeholder) until the siblings have been scanned.
If the barycenter needs to be tracked by Starforge it would make sense that they have an ID.
