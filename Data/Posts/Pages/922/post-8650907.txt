There is nothing that is unscanned in the system. I was lucky that all the sub stars have rings in their branch. If not, I wouldn't have been able to probe them.
The result comes out like this: "ScanType":"Detailed", "BodyName":"34 P Cygni 5 B Ring", "BodyID":13, "Parents":[ {"Planet":11}, {"Null":9}, {"Star":0} ], "StarSystem":"34 P Cygni"

It's a nice system for mining, if you bring an FC. Lots of expensive material hot spots. I don't even have a mining laser.
Yeah, didn't really think there would be anything unscanned, was just a double check before looking at other stuff.
