Huh? I kinda thought it was 36, like 36 decans of the ancient Egyptian astronomy. That would have been cool.

So was there like 33 regions in the galaxy or something?
Got my Type-7 spinning so it produces perfect Imperial gravity, great conditions for eating canned Irukama snails and binge watching Onionhead Channel on Galaxy TV, so can't check at least for a few days.

Maybe it's a leap year

Quote:They were able to calculate that the Sun took 365 days to complete its cycle by noting the time between one heliacal rising of Sirius and the next. For ease of division they adopted a year of twelve 30-day months and added an extra 5-day period at the end of the year, which was mainly used for festivities

old astrology deals in my option a lot with mnemonic and magic/psychology far from science

36 Decans Example with "nice" Numbers:
1 = ? (spirit)
2 = polarity (plus - minus)
3 = out-going, expansive, returning (cardinal fix mutable)
4 = hot, cold, moist, dry (fire water air earth)
12 = is circular, recurrently, birth live death and so on (zodiac)
3 + 4 = 7 planets
3 * 12 = 36 decans

Aries - plus - cardinal - fire
Taurus - minus - fix - earth
Gemini - plus - mutable - air
Cancer - minus - cardinal - water
Leo - plus - fix - fire
Virga - minus - mutable - earth
Libra - plus - cardinal - air
Scorbio - minus - fix - water
Sagittarius - plus - mutable - fire
Capricorn - minus - cardinal - earth
Aquarius - plus - fix - air
Pisces - minus - mutable - water
