"The poem consists of 3 prefatory stanzas, 33 stanzas of elegy, and 3 describing the grief of Astrophel's fellow shepherds, in sixains rhyming ababcc. The concluding lines prepare the reader for another elegy, "The Dolefull Lay of Clorinda", presumably written by the Countess of Pembroke.[6] "

I think the Astrophel poem is hard to analyse. The old language is tricky, for a non native English speaker.
The same can be said for Astrophel and Stella, but I found a decent translation for that one: https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/English/Sidney1thru27.php

By the way, the 'eulogy' I was referring to is Ruines of Time: https://www.bartleby.com/153/19.html
The astronomy stuff starts on line 589.
