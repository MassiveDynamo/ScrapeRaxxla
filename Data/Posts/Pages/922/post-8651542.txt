One would expect the 7 and 8 IDs to be planets / moons in orbit around 34 P Cygni 3, outside the A ring. I doubt there is room for an orbit between 3 and 4/5.

The ring on 3 is wide, so I guess a couple of tiny moons could hide inside the ring?

Could also be a couple of comets. In that case, I have no idea how to search.
Hmm, I wonder if the SF simulates shepard moons but doesnâ€™t actually present them as objects.

I think we just need to establish a couple of baseline examples for comparison. Having looked at a couple of logs, here's phase 1.

Pareco:

Travel to Pareco
Honk
FSS scan all system objects including stations
Check logs
Do logs give the Stations' Body IDs from having FSS'd?
If yes, post all Body Names and ID's from Pareco here. Done.
If no, continue below
Travel to each station one by one (no need to enter station, just exit supercruise at the station as normal then re-enter supercruise and proceed to next station.
Get the Stations' (and other) Body IDs from the logs and post all Body Names and IDs from Pareco here. Done.
This should tell us how comets are handled in terms of Body IDs. (Or it'll confirm/eliminate one possibility for how they're handled at least.)

Can't do it myself at the moment, so over to anyone who's in the vicinity of Pareco, is on PC and who fancies giving it a look!
