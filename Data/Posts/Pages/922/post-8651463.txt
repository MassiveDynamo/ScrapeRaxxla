"The poem consists of 3 prefatory stanzas, 33 stanzas of elegy, and 3 describing the grief of Astrophel's fellow shepherds, in sixains rhyming ababcc. The concluding lines prepare the reader for another elegy, "The Dolefull Lay of Clorinda", presumably written by the Countess of Pembroke.[6] "

Interesting. Could correspond to Raxxla logo, where we have:
6x6 sided shapes on the outside
Then 33 dots
Then 3 dashes
Before the final circle and dot???

Where are you getting 171, 171, 204 from?
