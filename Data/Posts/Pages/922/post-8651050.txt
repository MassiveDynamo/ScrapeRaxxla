Yeah, didn't really think there would be anything unscanned, was just a double check before looking at other stuff.
One would expect the 7 and 8 IDs to be planets / moons in orbit around 34 P Cygni 3, outside the A ring. I doubt there is room for an orbit between 3 and 4/5.

The ring on 3 is wide, so I guess a couple of tiny moons could hide inside the ring?

Could also be a couple of comets. In that case, I have no idea how to search.
