Remember, the bases in EAFOTS weren't where the whispers were heard. Those were heard by ships in/beyond the Rift, and the logs transmitted back. At least, that's my understanding of it.
Right ok thanks. I didn't get that. That's useful. I thought they were recorded by people on the way to the base.
