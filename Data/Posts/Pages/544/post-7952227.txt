My take on that was that prior to the Tionisla clues, everything about the Rift had been out-of-game. Those clues were intended for people NOT aware of the Rift mystery, not for the 'old guard'. Hence everything just amounted to a big arrow saying "Over there".


We have two more system take overs to get the THS (Tionisla Historical Society) back to Tionisla, perhaps it will unlock something in the "escape room" type puzzle mystery.
