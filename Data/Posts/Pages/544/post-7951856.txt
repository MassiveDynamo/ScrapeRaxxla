Yeah, thx for the link. I meant did Canonn set up some listening survey of witch space across the MW. Those lazy nerds are much too much relaxed for some months !
I've recorded a few jumps and ran some YT vid. jumps trough Audacity. No sign of any visuals in them and they all look the same(noise).
If there really is something in the whisper, I think you have to hear it.

Personally I doubt there is anything to find. I think the hyper-space visuals and sounds are just a fancy loading screen. Just a loop that runs while the software is busy with other stuff. I don't think it knows where it is.

I would be more intrigued if I head the witchspace visper somewhere else. If I could hear witchspace somewhere it shouldn't be.
