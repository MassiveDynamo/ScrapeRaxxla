It's late but reading some things lately, I thought I'd highlight a couple of points regarding what I understand Raxxla might be and where and how we might notice it.

1) Raxxla as a Rogue Planet.

2) Locating Raxxla from the correct system.

3) The Nature of Raxxla.

4) Finding a Rogue Planet.

5) The role of The Dark Wheel in finding Raxxla.

Raxxla is a hot desert planet in the lore. I submitted images of what may be there.
