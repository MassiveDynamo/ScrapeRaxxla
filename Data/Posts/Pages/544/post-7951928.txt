Right ok thanks. I didn't get that. That's useful. I thought they were recorded by people on the way to the base.

To be honest I don't think it was ever explicitly stated that they were sent back, but since the Rift expeditions uniformly ended in disaster then the assumption has been that they were. Difficult to carry on towards the base when you're ship has been blown up or you've suicided by airlock
