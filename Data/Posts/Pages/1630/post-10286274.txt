Have you checked the Great Raxxla Potato Hunt data? They've now covered almost 80% of the systems within 200ly of Sol.

It's possible they've covered all your suspected areas, and therefore we know that there's a very good chance that anything anomalous doesn't exist there - at least in terms of 'normally detectable' object or signal that might have been missed by non-thorough specific cataloguing.

If that's the case, then you can narrow your ideas about what to look for considerably.
Sadly although I appreciate and champion their excellent work, I don’t feel the project is detailed enough to capture the possibility, it’s something arbitrary as a POI or something floating around some dull moon, last time I checked the pentameters weren’t very robust.

Prior to the tech we have now, any random persistent POI had to be flown past at slow speed to get noticed. And even though some people were consistent many were not.

I remember those first days of exploration, everyone literally headed for the hills, many we’re consistent, but years later I’m still find the odd ‘missing’ moon which avoided their initial ‘detailed’ scans…

At most I feel we were supposed to find the system, honk it, then travel around to each body and scan those too, then a POI probably should have popped up. Or it’s so weird we ought to have just seen it and gone OK that’s not normal!

Currently we scoot in, scan and quickly check POIs. Maybe it doesn’t appear on scans, maybe we still have to roll past it, or it’s a surface feature; or maybe it’s not actually anything, maybe it’s intentional spelt wrong, maybe it’s bigger, a concept or a series of systems,..

I think the codex probably tells us all we need to know, maybe there’s a planet named after a Princess or some two moons after lovers! Who knows!
