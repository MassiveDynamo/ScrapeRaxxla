I think the codex is a map that is intended to point us to the correct system. I believe Raxxla is likely in a persistent POI and / or much like Gen ships, far out on the boundaries of a system. I habitually ignore POIs, I suspect we’ve rolled past it several times. But if we can establish an area, we can focus our resources and stress test that system for every known mechanism.

If there is a more complex process then it makes the codex redundant, as many of us would have probably triggered it already. So my bet is it’s a POI or as you’ve identified something on a moon.

Have you checked the Great Raxxla Potato Hunt data? They've now covered almost 80% of the systems within 200ly of Sol.

It's possible they've covered all your suspected areas, and therefore we know that there's a very good chance that anything anomalous doesn't exist there - at least in terms of 'normally detectable' object or signal that might have been missed by non-thorough specific cataloguing.

If that's the case, then you can narrow your ideas about what to look for considerably.
