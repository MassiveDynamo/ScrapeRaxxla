Have you checked the Great Raxxla Potato Hunt data? They've now covered almost 80% of the systems within 200ly of Sol.

It's possible they've covered all your suspected areas, and therefore we know that there's a very good chance that anything anomalous doesn't exist there - at least in terms of 'normally detectable' object or signal that might have been missed by non-thorough specific cataloguing.

If that's the case, then you can narrow your ideas about what to look for considerably.
Im not convinced that the GRPH can rule out any systems, the terms of reference as far as i am aware was an FSS scan, a left panel POI check and a visual scan of the system in System Map.
Whist a commendable enterprise we may be looking at visual scans of each planet or even landing and checking POIs to find Raxxla (if it is indeed on a planet) and that takes a considerable amount of time just for one system.
To start with nobody would know what the POI would be listed as, its easy when scanning for Guardian or Thargoids as they nicely pop up in the Planetary Information, what are we actually looking for? Nobody knows.

So its just my point of view but for my exploration/Raxxla hunt i have to forget that the GRPH ever exsisted, no disrespect to anyone that took part.
