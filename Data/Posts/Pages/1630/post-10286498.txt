Unless it moves... You can after all "find it more than once"?

...and more people scanning was mentioned by DB?
Everything in space moves. It's either in an orbit in a system or on a trajectory through a system. Either way it does not move terribly fast, unless it is FTL(hyperspace or SC) capable.

Everything in ED lives in a instance. FD has a system for setting scan detection distance for all instances. At least for USS and planetary POI. Probably for everything. The "more people scanning" comment could suggest that the scan detection distance for Raxxla is rather small.

This would fit well with the regular FD modus operandi, where you first need to figure the clues then and it takes a huge collective effort by the community to find it.
It also fits with the original TDW story of Jason Ryder, that "came back from Deep Space to get a proper team togetherâ€¦"
