...and more people scanning was mentioned by DB?
He did say that, but I think the impression I got was just from a sheer numbers standpoint.

Was it him though, or MB who said the honk range was a mistake? Either way the implications of that - discovering something hidden in ~3 seconds work - could have been goalpost shifted. Or maybe not, FD have gone through various behaviour patterns as they updated the game. Depends depends depends...

I'm far more interested in DB's "We expected people to follow the missions" remark [probably a misquote there, sorry].
