I think the codex is a map that is intended to point us to the correct system. I believe Raxxla is likely in a persistent POI and / or much like Gen ships, far out on the boundaries of a system. I habitually ignore POIs, I suspect we’ve rolled past it several times. But if we can establish an area, we can focus our resources and stress test that system for every known mechanism.

If there is a more complex process then it makes the codex redundant, as many of us would have probably triggered it already. So my bet is it’s a POI or as you’ve identified something on a moon.

Yup, could well be correct. How many unidentified signals or POI's do we scoot past? Loads if truth be told because there's nothing to identify if any of them have any significant meaning.
