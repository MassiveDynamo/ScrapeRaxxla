From the Guardian Codex in-game:

From the Guardian Data "culture" logs:
oh well spotted with the Guardian culture lore, I totally breezed over that one.
You could even say their art is quite.... thorny

Edit: wait, that actually makes sense from some of my earlier Norse research ideas...
Art: in Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish it means a kind(type), nature, character, or species (Swedish)
Torn-qvist:
Ã¾orn, as in thorn = an annoyance / troublesome,
Kvist = a 'dormer': a room-like projection from a sloped roof

A character of thorned room - RIDDLES!!
You could also call a thorned room a MOUTH - just as a mouth could be the room-like projection from one's face Guardians were carnivorous which implies sharp teeth as well - hence, thorned.
So it could be describing the nature/character of the mouth - the troubled/affected song of the Guardians.
