Just an FYI for what it is worth: distress beacons and similar crash POIs end at approximately 2,500 LY from Sol. I don't know if this is supposed to represent a maximal distance in the search for Raxxla. Even though that is solidly within Inner Orion Spur it is an absolutely huge volume of space with a ridiculous number of systems. Also, while we are on it growing increasingly convinced our docking areas in stations especially the lower section has hints about the system. There are desginations for S-1 through S-8 tucked in tiny corners. This apparently extends to our fleet carriers, too. Found this aboard my own when I went into free camera view (you'll notice S-2 is scrawled nearby). If I had to guess at the meaning - a system with 2 sets of planets where first set has first 2 landable but the other two not. The 2nd set - all are landable but the 2nd. Could be a misinterpretation but going to keep my eyes looking for similar hints. The number 8 repeats in various forms in the cockpit of our ships.

Symbols are one of a very few means of hiding something in plain view.
