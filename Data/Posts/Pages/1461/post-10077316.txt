Pardon me if my recollection is off, but if I recall the roll-out of the Guardian story, the ruins came in 2 phases, 1st the ancient ruins, then the guardian structures, and then the beacons came into the game later, so the beacons were not in game at the time of the discovery of the ruins or structures.
You were pretty much right in the first place, except it was 3 phases: 1. Ruins. 2. Structures. 3. Beacons and associated structures.

A slight proviso on that though - I've always had a strong suspicion that the Beacons and associated structures were intended to be elsewhere in the galaxy and were shifted to the main Guardian bubble following all the moaning from people about getting the Guardian modules and weapons. There's a chance that they were introduced at the same time as the first set of structures and were just moved at a later date, but I would go with them being introduced at the later date personally.
