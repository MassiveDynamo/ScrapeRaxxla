Question 1: Pondering the 'clue' about missions that have not been taken, I vaguely remember from somewhere in the bubble a mission manager greeting me with words on the line of "I've always hoped to meet an Elite pilot, but I will obviously have to wait longer." Doing scans in the Raxxla Potato Hunt I try to visit mission managers where I can, but so far that particular greeting has not re-appeared. (While have ranked up, I'm not Elite in any category.) The idea I've got stuck in my mind is that that might be a 'tiny bit obvious'.

Does anyone here remember that kind of greeting? As I've restarted with Horizons Legacy for the Hunt, and it is from this period I believe I recall it, I may have to revisit the first dozens of systems at some point, starting at Dromi (which is apparently no longer in Odyssey? Permanently so, or only during spring cleaning, does anyone know?) That assumes it is not a standard greeting that every totally unranked commander will get.
Never seen it!
