Pardon me if my recollection is off, but if I recall the roll-out of the Guardian story, the ruins came in 2 phases, 1st the ancient ruins, then the guardian structures, and then the beacons came into the game later, so the beacons were not in game at the time of the discovery of the ruins or structures.
I wouldn’t be so certain. It would seem that a lot of the stuff was in here but not discovered yet. But who really knows? Unless we found logs of people going through those systems before such Tech was added we would have no proof anyway. The logs I believe were meant to put you on the trail and you were supposed to learn to read the details in the ruins and let them lead you through the puzzle. When it started taking too long I think that’s when they made another mission to get you to focus again on the puzzle. But the first mission turned into a mad rush to discover things. And the second one became a mad rush to get blueprints.
