I know the Landscape Signal has been researched intensely, but do we have any ideas what the two “A” ‘s allude too? Kind of strange. My first thought was that it was for Sag. A but considering the signal hasn’t been moved and no bug report as of yet has confirmed it’s existence or location as a bug we have to think it intentional right? Maybe it’s a signature for an Audio designer in FDev? Like a little Easter egg. Or is the A meant to lead us somewhere.

The only region name with two words both starting with A is Achiles Altar. But région names were added later after the LS signal, which was present in the vanilla game afaik.

Plus other questions that arise, what is creating the signal? As of rn unknown as you can’t fly at the signal from any nearby systems. And who is this signal for? If this is a man made signal, or alien signal, what is it’s functional purpose by it’s creator. (If it even has one, if it’s a natural phenomenon than it’s much older)

And I mean following the route that the “A”’s could be a message or signature. One character’s name starting with an A is Alex Ryder.

Ps: just watched MATTIUS ‘s video, awesome work, got me thinking about the LS again from a different angle so good work mate : )
