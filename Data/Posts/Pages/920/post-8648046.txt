You actually can hear it in your ship! This has been ingame since before FSS. The IRH report will help you and anyone else hear and decode this audio for yourself!When your as far out from the core as the bubble all you have to do is point yourself at Sag A! Although keep in mindthe origin region is a couple ly’s away from Sag A. Ofc!
It has always been in the game. You can hear it all over the bright part of the milkyway band, If you are in normal space an away from any planets. Stronger towards the center.
if I remember correctly, there are several ‘bright spots’ where the volume pics up.

My guess is that the sound corresponds to the brightnes of the sky box.
