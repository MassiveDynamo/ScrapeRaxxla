Hmmmm i am going to have to spend time going over that... im obviously not keeping up on some of these. Thanks!

It’s difficult to keep track, which is one reason why I produced the spreadsheet (from available information, cant claim any originality!!); the other reason was to try to analyse if there was any pattern to their placement, in particular for GCS Sarasvati where the logs suggest there should be sister ships hiding around, though I now suspect that was fluff.....

Also as an aid to explorers. I’m always wiling to update it if anybody comes across any more!
