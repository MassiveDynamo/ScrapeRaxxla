They died before selling the data or they havent got back to a station to sell it yet.

Theres about 140 systems of mine that didnt get sold on a route to Hawkins Gap, including a very valuable one c20m, but I never went back looking.

BTW when you get to the Rift and beyond youll find a lot of WW and tmfc, but mainly WW, a lot of WW. Also found Crystals actually in the Rift between Zuara and INRA bases. havent handed it in yet and I know you got an FC so the race is on.
