Center of galaxy? What does he mean? Just rotate FSS to center from any point?

You actually can hear it in your ship! This has been ingame since before FSS. The IRH report will help you and anyone else hear and decode this audio for yourself!When your as far out from the core as the bubble all you have to do is point yourself at Sag A! Although keep in mindthe origin region is a couple lyâ€™s away from Sag A. Ofc!
