Here is the link to the report findings of the Landscape Signal by the Independent Raxxla Hunters : http://bit.ly/embrsum1

For anyone wanting to start investigating this, this is the place to start as they have done extremely intense research into this.

Here is the Spectorgam for the Landacape Signal provided by IRH: I apologize I had to slice it into two pics, had trouble letting to upload the whole longe image. The A’s appear at the start and end of the audio.


Finally here is a small history on their current point (or current at the time of the end of of the first investigation) provided by IRH to help answer some people’s questions easily!
