What's this based on?
The idea of two INRA's is interesting I just can't find a source for an older/other version of INRA in Elite Dangerous.
Novels.

Regardless of that, as I said, I'm not sure I understand the connection you're making between some of these things? Could you elaborate, it seems interesting.

We were talking about the connection between the generation ships and raxxla. I tried to explain that the ships themselves have nothing to do with it. But they were created to find worlds in the "case" of a new war with the targoids that we are seeing now. Every time you start exploring the lore of the elite, you run into the targoids and guardians. New technologies? Thargoids or guardians. New discoveries? They. New events? They.

The club, the wheel, the organizations are different, they have always had a very great importance on the events of the elite. And always, one way or another, were associated with the targoids and the guardians.That's why I'm saying that raxxla is also somehow connected with aliens.And of course, this has been explicitly mentioned more than once in all books and short stories.
