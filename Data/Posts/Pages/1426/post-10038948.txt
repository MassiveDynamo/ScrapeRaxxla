I wish I had screenshots of it but one or more INRA sites mentioned the phrase "science division" just below the main logo. When things calm down I have to do a second pass at the INRA sites to see if Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm exists earlier than 3193 or are there differences on ones that required captured Thargoids for tests because that detail is important. I am working on more precise dating for first game but all indications point to sometime between 3174-3199 due to Lave being a dictatorship at that point (when Walden came to power). If so, the Thargoids disappeared for mere decades.

We really, really need to know when supercruise came about and if it was connected with one of the various INRAs. Venusian generation ship seems to indicate a much earlier origin of this technology.
Try. Because they may soon be gone. The most logical action on the part of the developers is the partial destruction of the bubble. So I expect in the near future in the game: Mother ships of the targoids, the construction of bases by players, and so on. Because the size of the stargoids coincided with the size of the targoid bases with holomaps. Only these are not bases, but motherships.
