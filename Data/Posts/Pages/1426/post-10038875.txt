Even if we take into account that the ships of the expeditions were sent thousands of years ago. For Zurara, it was always a one-way ticket. The distance is too far. So the purpose of Zurara was not the search for worlds, but something else.

In fact, if you look from a logical point of view, the discovery of Zurara, as well as the events with Salome and so on, everything was a stage for the preparation of current events. That is, the arrival of the Targoids.

However, all these stories, the whole ent, sends us back to the time of Galcop and maybe even earlier. That is, in the very first days of space exploration. And the legend of raxxla appeared just somewhere in that time period.

Great logic, I agree with your summary. But again that direction is as open-ended as all the other directions we can take regarding clues.
Have you been doing some poking & sniffing around out there, perhaps during the lore-tour? I've taken the trip, but I'm none the wiser.
