There is 2 Inra organisations.
First Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm - joint Federal-Imperial initiative in 3125
Second Imperial Naval Reserve Arm between 2680 to 3100 - On the basis of which the modern inra was born

But everything else - Yes you're right. That's why I pointed out that whether we want it or not, but all events revolve around history, politics, and so on. But the ships cannot be pointing points because of the large time gap
There's also a third: "Independent Naval Research Arm" which was in "..And Here the Wheel". I believe additionally, the First Encounters journals made multiple references to "research arm of INRA" and "Intergalactic Naval Research Arm". There are apparently multiple INRAs in existence. Check the Thargoid codexes but I believe one states Mycoid originated in 3125 and still another references the official founding date of "Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm" as 3193. This poses a problem because even "Azimuth A Historical Perspective (Part Five)" reiterates that Thargoids were gone and vanished by 3151 following deployment of Mycoid against a Thargoid mothership. This means Klatt Enterprises, Stack, and Stuart Retreat (probably multiple others too) must have happened before 3151.
