3150: INRA was a Federation-led project which officially disbanded after the first Thargoid war (approx. 3150s).
This is not accurate in that is not the INRA you think it is. INRA here is the Imperial Navy Reserve Arm not the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm which is founded after the First Thargoid War had already ended in 3193 (that is per one of Thargoid codex entries). Also, per Galnet "Galactic News: The Thargoids" has the Thargoids appear in 3125 and then disappeared in 3151 (believe that date is from a Thargoid codex entry). Further, "Galactic News: The Thargoids" covers the Veliaze incident though that appears to be pirates per "Ships Lost in Space" and the "The Black Prince" beacons in Zelada which has the planet New Africa in the system. Zelada is currently the best candidate for the location of the Zelada Incident.
