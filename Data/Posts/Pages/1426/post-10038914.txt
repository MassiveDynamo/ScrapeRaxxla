Very interesting

I think some of the things you mention are separated by a significant gulf of time, I'm not sure if I misunderstood the connections you're making though?:
2097: The "Generation ships" like Thetis are ships sent from earth prior to the creation of FTL travel (and later concurrent with the earliest days).
2296: First mention of Raxxla.
2690s: Galcop formed
3111: Adamastor expedition dispatched to Barnard's Loop.
I do agree with the idea that the Zurara / Formidine Rift expedition have had a greater purpose than only setting up the Exodus project.

Personally though I think the Dynasty / Exodus projects obliquely related to Raxxla, but more in a political and background sense than a practical. For example, The Club does very cleanly match the idea of a 'sinister cabal controlling humanity' as suggested by the Raxxla Codex - and Drew Wager has said the Club was Braben's idea and was given to him to write into his books.

The Club has a lot of information, particularly about what they believe the Thargoids are doing, and why, and they are shown to have essentially ultra-classified information known only to a handful of people. We also know one of the Club is a major bigshot at Sirius (another contender for the 'sinister cabal' title).

I could well believe that The Club are involved with Raxxla somehow.

There is 2 Inra organisations.
First Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm - joint Federal-Imperial initiative in 3125
Second Imperial Naval Reserve Arm between 2680 to 3100 - On the basis of which the modern inra was born

But everything else - Yes you're right. That's why I pointed out that whether we want it or not, but all events revolve around history, politics, and so on. But the ships cannot be pointing points because of the large time gap
