There's also a third: "Independent Naval Research Arm" which was in "..And Here the Wheel". I believe additionally, the First Encounters journals made multiple references to "research arm of INRA" and "Intergalactic Naval Research Arm". There are apparently multiple INRAs in existence. Check the Thargoid codexes but I believe one states Mycoid originated in 3125 and still another references the official founding date of "Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm" as 3193. This poses a problem because even "Azimuth A Historical Perspective (Part Five)" reiterates that Thargoids were gone and vanished by 3151 following deployment of Mycoid against a Thargoid mother ship.

Disappeared from the bubble. Here it is also necessary to do, so to speak, separation into several views. The events describing the first Targoid war are almost always in inhabited regions. So if you look from this point of view, then yes, the Targoids have disappeared from the bubble. I'm more interested in where they come from. The same Stargoids: If you look at the paths, so to speak, came from three regions known to us. On the one hand, developers could make such paths, simply because. On the other hand, all these paths intersect with regions that are historically associated with the targoids.

The only 2 who gets knocked out from scheme is the region Prooe Drye because its to close to bubble and in the same galactic region.
And one from Elysian Shore. Since the path lies between Bernards Loop and Formidine rift

Everything else is related to Barnards loop.
