Dont understand what noble you are talking about.

David Braben and Michael Brookes have both confirmed Raxxla is in-game.
In-game source for Raxxla is the Codex entry. Externally, interest arose in 1984 with Robert Holdstock’s The Dark Wheel novella which accompanied the original game, and some have been looking for it ever since
Elite: The Dark Wheel

Though it has been confirmed that it has been implemented, for the first time, in Elite Dangerous.
But we dont know what it is!

Have a look through my FDQuotes thread (see my signature) which captures potentially useful things FD have said (though some of the links may now no longer work).
