Bright like the heavens could be referring to a supernovae?
Already had the idea. Went to Bubble nebula to it check out. Checked every star inside Bubble Nebula's space. Nothing new. If it IS a nebula it has to be; 1.) Far from the Bubble. 2.) It must be "radiantâ€¦glowing like heaven". 3.) Said nebula (if it is one not permit locked) must have at least one star inside it.
Inside said system there could something that fits: "voices that didn't come from anything with a body", a beacon perhaps? Or a Guardian Constructs.
