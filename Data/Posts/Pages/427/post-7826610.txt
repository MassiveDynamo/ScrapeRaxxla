Most probrably a beacon of some sort, emiting signals that u can pick up on the FSS and investigate, that will lead u to another place to look for clues again...

I for one would go for that what we seek and need to find will only be find when FD wants it, cause it is most likely in a permit locked system, just below the bubble there are some areas of interest to me, and also under the guardian space but u cant acess them, and all i read so far, even the most absurd thinfoild theories all lead me to that conclusion and that i cant really follow up on them.

That is why when im in the bubble, i have been mapping the places that are borderline with those areas, and its not the 1st time i decide to follow a DW ship just to be unable to continue on its track cause it went into one of these areas... Or following thargoid activity to try and pinpoint a source and get stuck cause of a invisble wall of permit locked system...

I wonder if i leave my ship in supercruise for quite some time heading into one of these areas if the ship can get threw or it will be somehow stopped?!
