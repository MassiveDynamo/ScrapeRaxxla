I am aware of some of his work. He can be contacted directly through the University. Maybe he is aware of Stellar Forge and/or Elite?
Ross | Department Of Physics & Astronomy | Eastern Kentucky University

I sent Dr. Ross a bit of email to ask if he would be interested in chiming in on this subject and Stellar Forge in general.

Yeah... About that...

Dr Ross in this context is the Dr Ross who designed/built the Stellar Forge.

Never mind though, still good of you to go to the effort of doing what you did!
