Google says Romero is a Spanish and Italian surname meaning: A person on a religious journey or pilgrimage from Rome (possibly to Jerusalem); procession of elevated holy items. The pungent botanical herb of rosemary symbolizing remembrance and fidelity. A guardian of religious cemeteries or shrines.
