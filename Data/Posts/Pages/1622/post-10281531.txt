Going off this interest with Shamash in the diagram below I’ve shown the Norse Norns, against the Greek Fates. Note how Shamash and Thetis are just above! Very weird.

Then if we add the path of the Shibboleth and Brookes Drabbles, a weird alignment might be seen… travelling through a space relative to Shibboleth and the Brookes Drabbles?

So in my opinion, seeing as this area is also right on the upper rim of the Storm / Chaos zone, I get a feeling its pointing someplace…
