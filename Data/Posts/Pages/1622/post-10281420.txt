I don't think they map to Rochester's hypothesis at all; the Guardian and Thargoid regions of the ED Milky Way are outside the areas that Rochester seems to be postulating. It seems that MB took aspects of several mythologies and used them to name various systems that are within the ED human bubble. I keep trying (currently without success) to map this hypothesis against this diagram from the Astronomy of Milton's poetry (see Project Gutenberg ebook https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28434/28434-h/28434-h.htm ). I need to see this overlaid to understand how the hypothesis might lead to Raxxla...
Jaque's trip and possible "bridge" is a bit far from the bubble! ;-)
