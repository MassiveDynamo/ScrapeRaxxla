Have you considered the 3 main races in game in relation to Paradise lost and mythology and perhaps how the regions of activity for each map to your model?

e.g.

Humanity - Us - cast from Eden (Raxxla) for breaking the rules - What was lost....?
The Watchers/Olympian gods - Guardians?
Fallen Angels/Satan/Titans - Thargoids?

If the Guardians and ancient deities are figures who are tasked with protecting or guiding humanity. e.g. In Norse mythology, the Aesir and Vanir are groups of deities who are responsible for maintaining order in the world.... or Prometheus in Greek mythology? (Stole fire and gave it to humans... the Guardian tech?)

Both fallen angels and rebellious gods are figures who have challenged the established order and rebelled against their creator or ruler. In Greek mythology the Titans rebelled against their father, Cronus, and were imprisoned in Tartarus.

Just a thought.... not properly thought out....

I don't think they map to Rochester's hypothesis at all; the Guardian and Thargoid regions of the ED Milky Way are outside the areas that Rochester seems to be postulating. It seems that MB took aspects of several mythologies and used them to name various systems that are within the ED human bubble. I keep trying (currently without success) to map this hypothesis against this diagram from the Astronomy of Milton's poetry (see Project Gutenberg ebook https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28434/28434-h/28434-h.htm ). I need to see this overlaid to understand how the hypothesis might lead to Raxxla...
