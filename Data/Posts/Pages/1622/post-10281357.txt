These identify the key locations referenced by Robert Holdstock which I’ve found in game, as well as those with a close contextual association.

That zone technically is within the Underworld zone - because this concept of an ‘underworld’ is technically rolled up with the concept of an ‘Underworld’, which is more of a punitive Christian concept.

The Underworld zone is much wider.

There are an extensive level of star, so I’m not going to record these separately. I’m make maps based upon relationships.

Of interest to me is the shapes of these zones. I long thought the Underworld was a dense focal point; it isn’t - it’s more of a level… where as the Lost Realms, certainly is a defined area.

Similarly I found that in the Older gid network is this enclosed sphere of gods linked to Storms… I thought this at first was just a ‘bubble’ around Sol. But it clearly halts at the level of water and the Underworld. And there’s a clear ‘upper zone’ above it…

Again this what Ivwas attempting to convey in my last post. The system’s attributed to the potential gates of hell do fall upon this circumstance…

In addition - i have not posted this, because I feel it can’t be substantiated, but if we now accept this underworld level is a little wider, this technically makes sense of Jacques travels outbid the bubble…

Thanks I will review the post in detail..... and whilst I'm not as well read as your good self in the fictional areas (Milton, Holdstock, etc)...

Would I be right in concluding we should focus on the zones of Chaos, Lost Realms, and the triad goddesses as these zones are the most likely locations for Raxxla based on your theory?
