Well I'm pretty sure this is not going to pay off, so only go there if you're sanguine about that But it would be awesome to have someone actually check it out, just in case there's a stellar object there that's not visible on the map.

The exact location is where the circle is here in the "Newton's Vault" region:

The two nearest systems are: BYOI AUSCS BA-P D6-7 and BYOI AUSCS JR-A C15-0
If you were to go to one, and look towards the other, I think the sight-line would pass relatively close to the coordinates 23114, 584, 46931.

I've no idea how hard it is to get there, stars look pretty sparse out there.

cool, I'll stop by and take a look around both systems for a while, jump between em a few times, Supercruse for a while between them just too look for things that may be far out like the voyager probes in Sol...
I didn't quite make it out to Beagle Point just yet, I'll be there this week still, but just got home from out of town all weekend so not sure if I'll get any playing in tonight.... but yeah, I'll be headed here afterwards, lol, got nothing better to do after except stop by Sag A*, and maybe the supposed area for the landscape signal, but those are not a priority of any kind...
