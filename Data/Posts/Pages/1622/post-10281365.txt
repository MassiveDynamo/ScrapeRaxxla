Thanks I will review the post in detail..... and whilst I'm not as well read as your good self in the fictional areas (Milton, Holdstock, etc)...

Would I be right in concluding we should focus on the zones of Chaos, Lost Realms, and the triad goddesses as these zones are the most likely locations for Raxxla based on your theory?
Yes very much so I believe.

Sadly I’m not in game to test anything, presently in middle of a house renovation, so all I can do is mapping.

I think those areas are key. They don’t pin point any specific location (or do they). But Im certain these areas are intentional.

FD inserted only recently the Brookes Tours, the first leg of which takes us right into the Lost Realms zone. I see that as FD throwing us a bone.

That’s either them telling us it’s right there, or there is something around there that ought to highlight the correct path.

Some parts of this are too complex to ever warrant as being an intentional clue, I don’t think FD would ever be so complex, but rather this is an archeological clue towards the architecture that Brookes built for his narrative/s. Understand how the house was built and you can try and understand how people move and live within it…
