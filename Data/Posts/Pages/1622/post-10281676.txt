So I've recorded a video where I've plotted "Underworld" references I could find on the galaxy map, along side plotting a route from Artemis to PMD2009 48 for the Brookes Memorial Tour as reference....

Not an exact science as with any mythology, but tried to find systems with links to the Underworld... feel free to correct me or suggest additions....

Any thoughts?
