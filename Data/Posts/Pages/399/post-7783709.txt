Don’t know where you got “19....” from. The correct quote is:

‘You should not consider the Dark Wheel a single organisation, gentlemen. How could it survive for so long if it were? The Wheel has many levels, many hubs, cogs, gears and spokes.”
“It is more akin to an affiliation of organisations that share certain common goals. Interlocking in purpose. Consider yourselves now spinning on the outermost rim.”

Excellent pickup.

It actually was from an earlier post in this thread which I had linked as a reference for my research.

With your accurate quote, I did some more detailed fact checking of my own.

It appears that when copying text from a Children of Raxxla PDF document the page number which coincidentally aligns perfectly between the two sentences will be input into the text copy. I verified this and noted the page (18 or 19) from the two different sources I found was incorrectly pulled.

So please disregard the number of factions in the 'affiliated organisations' for The Dark Wheel.

How awesome is knowledge shared!
