But many players and writers predict that Raxxla is going to be something Really BIG. They have been holding on to this secret since 1984. Not even writers know what it will be in Elite Dangerous. A Game changing experience.
Parallel reality? New Galaxy? New Aliens? Everything is on the table.
They better brainstorm this properly to avoid Raxxla becoming an underwhelming experience.
