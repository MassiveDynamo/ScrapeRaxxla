You might be on to something. Because Ra is one of the systems that existed in Original game from 1984

Ra was very close to the old worlds(Lave cluster). Iirc. it was only 0.7 ly from Quator.
Quator is in ED and in the Lave cluster, but it seems to have jumped to the other side of it.

If you look at the old map, Ra, Reorte, Lave, Orerve, Reidquat and Uszaa make a nice Hexagon, with Diso in a central position.

The position of the systems are similar in ED, but there is no system that replaces the missing Ra.
