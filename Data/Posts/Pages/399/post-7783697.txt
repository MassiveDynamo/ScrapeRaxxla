Wow you must be heavy involved in the game development to know these things.
Well they are busy with Space Legs for the next 1,5 years. Than it's Iceplanets and Fleet carrier + 0.5 - 1 year.
Than who knows what next.

But many players and writers predict that Raxxla is going to be something Really BIG. They have been holding on to this secret since 1984. Not even writers know what it will be in Elite Dangerous. A Game changing experience.
Parallel reality? New Galaxy? New Aliens? Everything is on the table.
