Ra was very close to the old worlds(Lave cluster). Iirc. it was only 0.7 ly from Quator.
Quator is in ED and in the Lave cluster, but it seems to have jumped to the other side of it.

If you look at the old map, Ra, Reorte, Lave, Orerve, Reidquat and Uszaa make a nice Hexagon, with Diso in a central position.

The position of the systems are similar in ED, but there is no system that replaces the missing Ra.

Well that's a good start. A missing System from the know Galaxy charts. Could it happen?
Between Reorte and Orrere, RA should have been just above them on a 2d plane, somewhere in sector 80:49:90, or on the edge of it.
