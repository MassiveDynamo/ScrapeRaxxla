Go back a couple pages and look at my posts and screen shots.

Also for everyone else: I can’t seem to spot the dark planet in witch space while jumping around unless I’m at the systems I mentioned in my posts.
When i turn your image 90 degree, the whole shape, part of which you highligted, looks like a Gigiantic Humanoid shape with a tail. Which reminded me of the original description of OISIR - RAXXLA race from 1980 book: The Alien World.
Dominant intelligence: OISIR-RAXXLA -- GIGANTIC, REPTILIAFORM, PSI-PROJECTORS.

So you might be on to something.
