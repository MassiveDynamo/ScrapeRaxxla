(Note: This is on the assumption I have understood the meaning of 'Target Faction' = non-beneficial for a planetary scan job, otherwise they're both beneficial and you can ignore this post.)
In strict BGS effects, planetary scan - assuming it's the "random spot on a planet" sort, rather than a named installation - are neutral to the target. This may be a bug, or it may be a reflection of the mission not involving anything actually marked as that faction's assets.
