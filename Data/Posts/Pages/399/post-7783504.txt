Well that's a good start. A missing System from the know Galaxy charts. Could it happen?
Between Reorte and Orrere, RA should have been just above them on a 2d plane, somewhere in sector 80:49:90, or on the edge of it.

Ra is in ED, but is a totally different region. Probably just the same name.
Lots of systems from the original Elite are missing or have 'moved'.

If Ra was in the map, it should be close to Orrere. So should Quator, which it isn't.
