hrm.... I'm thinking the thing we are looking for is actually in 'witchspace', and visible during your transition when traveling from 1 system to another. The specific system to trigger this is in the name:
Ra (Starting point for jump)
xx (the thing we are looking for)
La (Desination of Jump)

It a place but not a place, you get see it but not interact with it yet. Its been in the game since the beginning, it doesn't require engineers/Horizons to see it.
You might be on to something. Because Ra is one of the systems that existed in Original game from 1984
