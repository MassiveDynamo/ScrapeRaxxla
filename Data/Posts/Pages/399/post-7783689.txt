Whether someone finds it, won't matter. The content for Raxxla won't be ready for 3 to 5 years.
But when the contant is ready, they will give out actual clues in the game to find it.
You might be right there. Almost 2 years passed between the first UA discovery and the first contact.

Wow you must be heavy involved in the game development to know these things.
How much time did they need to fully unfold the Thargoid story, from the first UAs to the first contact?
How much time did they need to fully unfold the Formidine Rift mystery?
Judging from the experience, he's just being realistic.
