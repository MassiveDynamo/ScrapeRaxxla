Went to the system from Guru's last post, LP 102-320, for poops and laughs while waiting for my combat ship to be towed to Demeter.
Found this tourist beacon: https://i.imgur.com/CB1vvO4.jpg
LP 102-320 Visitor Beacon:

"Tourist Spot 0409"
"Ice worlds aren't always the most exciting places to visit, but this one does have some interesting features for those visitors desiring chillier climes."
(Note that it isn't "Nice worlds" but rather a broken \n (newline) character preceding "ice worlds".)

Not sure if it means anything, or really if anything means anything anymore, but I thought I'd share. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
