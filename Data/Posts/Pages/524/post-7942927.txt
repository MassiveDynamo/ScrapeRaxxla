Guardian?
Any of the other N specoes that are rumoured for the game??
I might be misunderstanding you here, but I think the acid test is to ask of any given idea the following question. What most accurately describes the material/tech in question:

- they do not quite align with known Thargoid tech

or

- they are nothing at all like known Thargoid tech

Guardian stuff is the latter.

It’s probably fair to say that it’s going to be the same for any other species (unless one has somehow adopted Thargoid materials and tech.)

Now if on the other hand we’re talking what lead to the divergence of the Soontill Thargoid tech/materials from the main set of Thargoid tech/materials known to humanity then that’s a whole different matter! On that front, yes, IMH(and also researched and considered )O it’s Guardian related, both in terms of influences/sources of the divergence in the tech/materials, and in terms of the separation/isolation part of the divergence.

I did a big thread on it all a while back now, will fish it out and post a link!
