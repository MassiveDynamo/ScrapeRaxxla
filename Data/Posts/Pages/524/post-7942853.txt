In another ‘never ever go off the wiki without double checking the original sources’, I suspect it’s also the cause of some Soontill Relics confusion.

The Soontill Relics are Thargoid in origin.

What the wiki says:

“Chief Xeno-Chemist Lyran Betar said that scientific tests revealed the elemental make-up and crystalline structure of these relics are not made by human hands and could be tens of thousands of years old. It doesn't align with known Thargoid material.”

What the original source actually says:

“The research team’s results clearly state that no known human technology could have created the relics, yet they do not quite align with known Thargoid materials.”

That ‘quite’ makes all the difference.

Given the nature of Soontill, the relics not quite aligning with known Thargoid materials is perfectly in line with what would be expected.
