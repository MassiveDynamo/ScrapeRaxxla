Agartha is in Galmap. Just going there to have a look for funs sake.

Well, in Stargate, the constellation "keys" were just labels of the corresponding stargates or whatever tech they used to open wormholes...
We humans tend to use numbers and letters.
Anyway, the questions is what 6 "keys" could the "Raxxlians" have used to define the position of Raxxla in this hypothesis ?
The dashes, imho, represent a kind of obfuscation or limit, border, etc.. The three curved lines, a kind of "emission" or defenses. The 6 green large lines, bridges or paths.. The black parts, the intergalactic Deep Black

Obfuscation seems to be the key word. And I wish we had six keys we were looking for to unlock Raxxla... instead of it being a mysterious planet with no bearing on the gameplay.
