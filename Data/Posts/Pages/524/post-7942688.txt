OK so this may seem off topic, but bear with.

I searched the archives for a 'Quest for Soontill' thread and found nothing (loads of references to S. Relics which dont even seem to be of Thargoid origin) . Soontill is in game as a system, but said system does not look like the real thing. Wrong star type, no planet at 998ls, its not near Grandmort, etc. and no planet matching the Soontill description either before or after pirate activity.

How is this relevant? We've all been looking for evidence of the Dark Wheel as a hook to Raxxla. The Soontill tale is linked to the Dark Wheel through a rift in the Ryder family that saw the inception of a splinter group, the CIEP - the UC Soontill has a tourist beacon about CIEP experiments on thargs there.

So this is a branch of DW lore that is also unsolved, just like the rest of the R mystery.

Now, if its near Grandmort, then I would have expected some on this thread to have already scrubbed the area...
