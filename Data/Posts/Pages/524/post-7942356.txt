I completely forgot about those! Reminds me of a time I found a surface site with some kind of terminal inside, it looked like it said "Single Thargs in your area!" and it had a video with a bunch of ships smashing into each other. The whole thing left me pretty confused.

Could be a clue to Raxxla?

I suspect the mating rituals of thargoids are unrelated to Raxxla
Unless it involves a particular phase, of a particular moon, around some unnamed planet...
