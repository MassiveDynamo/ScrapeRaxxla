Over the course of several days I followed every TDW ship I cam across in SD until they were no longer trackable. Nothing panned out, nothing even remotely out of the ordinary.
Same for me, tracked 6 ships so far. Thatâ€™s not a lot but I experienced same pattern myself. Followed Dark Wheel ships at most 4-5 system jumps then they just disappeared. Nothing out of ordinary in destination systems, such as 8th moon of unnamed gas giant, etc...
