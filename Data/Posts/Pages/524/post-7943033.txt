SPOILER: LATEST RAXXLA HYPOTHESIS




























There are other BHs with tourist beacons and many NPCs. I took a TDW famous explorer to one just this side of the galactic core and it was busier than Jameson Memorial!

Having said this....I am inclined to agree with it being close to the Formidine Rift. Mainly because of the data left at the Club sites. It talks, as you know, about whispers in witch space, deepest void, etc, all in almost exact same wording as TDW toast
