On the subject of symbols, how did anyone see anything that even remotely resemble human symbols on a Thargoid ship?

"In 2849, the first footage surfaced of one of these "encounters", with one blurry image appearing to show an alien ship with the word "THARG" on its hull. The media immediately coined the term "Thargoid" as a name for the aliens. However, no conclusive proof of the Thargoids' existence was obtained, and they faded into folklore."

As far as I know, these are what Thargoid symbols look like:
SPOILER

The only words I've found in english that have "tharg" in them are words relating to lethargy, and "litharge."

Litharge: "A yellowish or reddish, odorless, heavy, earthy, water-insoluble, poisonous solid, PbO, used chiefly in the manufacture of storage batteries, pottery, lead glass, paints, enamels, and inks."

Odorless. Has anyone got close enough to sniff a Thargoid?
The "yellowish or reddish... poisonous solid" parts seem to relate, though.
