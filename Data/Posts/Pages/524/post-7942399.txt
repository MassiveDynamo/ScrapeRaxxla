Ah,
So the goids were actually inviting humanity round for pizza (looks like ham & mushroom) and a few beers, but the invitation was mistaken...
That ammonia beer tastes like bathroom cleaner, unless chilled to -65Â°C. That gives me one hell of a brain freeze.
And the pizza? It's not ham and mushrooms.
Goids don't touch mushrooms or any form of mycota. They seem to hate it. If you're lucky you get some sub ice fish topping, but in most cases it's some nasty form of spider beef.
I don't even know what the cheese is made of, but even Frenchmen get pale and sweaty from the smell.

There is one good thing about goid parties though. They are all girls.
