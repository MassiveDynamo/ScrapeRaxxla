The problem, of course, is that it would be impossible to hide Soontil after the events of And Here the Wheel. The discrepancies between the in-game Soontil and the Soontil from the book are likely due to poor implementation on Frontier's part and not meant as an enigma. Could be wrong so it might still be worth investigating.
Isnt Elvira Martuuk constantly trying to prove the relics fake?
What happens in the book that would prevent a cover-up?
Forgetting cannon vs non-cannon, is there any possibility of "unreliable narrative"? Some of the best stories rely on this technique
