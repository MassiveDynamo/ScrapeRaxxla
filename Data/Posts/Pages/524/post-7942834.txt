Isnt Elvira Martuuk constantly trying to prove the relics fake?
What happens in the book that would prevent a cover-up?
Forgetting cannon vs non-cannon, is there any possibility of "unreliable narrative"? Some of the best stories rely on this technique
It would be a great twist to this story if Soonthil and Raxxla ended up being the same place. Again, allowing for unreliable narrative, the twisted man could be a certain Mr Ryder, who faked his own death to go and exploit what he found......ok, I know, too far!
