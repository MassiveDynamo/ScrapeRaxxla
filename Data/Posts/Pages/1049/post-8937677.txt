No worries - ya I remember when it was created. I think someone made it based off of a famous crop circle. Its a pretty cool logo but - player created, ya the children of raxxla adopted it . But still player created so not related to anything raxxla or dark wheel in game. The Codex one I think is the one to base proper tinfoil theories after

I'd like to also mention that the Raxxla-logo exists partially ingame.

The "Scientific Installation" has a dark rotating hexagon with 6 outer spokes, where the 6 spokes are between red light emitters; I assume those red light emitters might be heat dispensers/radiators. Unfortunately turning your light on, the hexagon has some weird rectangular metallic shapes which does not represent the inner part of the Raxxla-logo.
