Definitely, and I largely agree with everything you have outlined - as I, and many others here, have experienced them all. Did not mean to be (too) sarcastic, most of that was aimed at FD. What you are writing is very much deja vu, and not just for Raxxla sadly. It can be very frustrating, but at this point they have dug their hole(s), and I think every time they try to get out of them they just end up digging them deeper, unfortunately.

I added a tad bit at the end, why was the raxxla post move to Roleplay and Lore? this is the only thing from Fdev that is also vague but seems like it adds to the "not actually an in-game asset"

My first ever though was that raxxla is lucifer in sirius due to the "It has been exploited for years" reference and also due to the frameshift drive/military drive fuel being exploited since the mention of raxxla in lore, It fit the lore, it fit the region, the distance of our travels during the legends everything, prototypes of drives given to them by the alliance (maybe dark wheel/club affiliates yet...those coils wrapped around the planet dont even exist nevermind the rest
