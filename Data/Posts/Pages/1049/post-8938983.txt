Now I think the playerbase has currently discovered around 0.01% of the systems in the game universe (though come to think of it there might be another decimal place in there).
Surprisingly, I litterally just read the below statement from Fdev the other day, and can update your information on these stats...

If you find the Odyssey Q&A - First Footfall statement released about 2 days ago, the following is part of it and gives us the most accurate number I think we've had in a looong time......

Q: If I join after launch will I still be able to experience First Footfall?
Elite Dangerous is a huge and expansive galaxy containing more than 400 billion star systems. To date our players have traversed just 201 million of these systems which equates to around 0.05%. In the same way that new Commanders continue to join the world of Elite and make their own, personal discoveries, we have no doubt that commanders will have the opportunity to make their own discoveries for many years to come.

Add-On: 0.015303% of the galaxy has been discovered on EDSM
