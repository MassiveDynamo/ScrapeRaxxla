Considering the clues that have been given are mostly related to myths and stories...
True. There are so many possible connections to consider, pages upon pages to read but no actual usable clue, just data. It's fun though.

(Not the player created one )
i heard differing opinions on that. the raxxla symbol is depicted on the raxxla codex entry with no mention of the player faction children of raxxla. who was first, the player faction or the symbol? as i understood it the flat one is just a recreation from the tilted one in the codex, but i wouldnt know which was first since i wasnt playing ED when it was added.
