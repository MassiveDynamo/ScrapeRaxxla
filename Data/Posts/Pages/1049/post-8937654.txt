i heard differing opinions on that. the raxxla symbol is depicted on the raxxla codex entry with no mention of the player faction children of raxxla. who was first, the player faction or the symbol? as i understood it the flat one is just a recreation from the tilted one in the codex, but i wouldnt know which was first since i wasnt playing ED when it was added.

No worries - ya I remember when it was created. I think someone made it based off of a famous crop circle. Its a pretty cool logo but - player created, ya the children of raxxla adopted it . But still player created so not related to anything raxxla or dark wheel in game. The Codex one I think is the one to base proper tinfoil theories after
