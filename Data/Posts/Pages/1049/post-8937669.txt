The codex symbol was the first version of that symbol, the children of raxxla beforehand explicitly used some weird spiral dragon around the elite log beforehand.

No worries - ya I remember when it was created. I think someone made it based off of a famous crop circle. Its a pretty cool logo but - player created, ya the children of raxxla adopted it . But still player created so not related to anything raxxla or dark wheel in game. The Codex one I think is the one to base proper tinfoil theories after
thanks for setting this straight, was confused about the relevance of the symbol for a while now. bummer, the 6 pointer thing had me. Back to bottomless mythological refrences it is!
