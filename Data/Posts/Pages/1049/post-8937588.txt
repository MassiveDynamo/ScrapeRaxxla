I've spent the last few days considering all sorts of connections to the toast (persephone the lost daughter = parents grief, hades in love with persephone = lovers woe,etc etc) Lately i've considered the edges of the space map as indicator, namely the void, the abyss and lyra's song seem interesting to me, having connections to the toast (lyra and sirens are connected and the void seems like a obvious one) but even making these connections, what would you do with it? we don't know that we are searching for, or what a clue could even be. I've lined up multiple constellations with the emblem but with the scale of things its nearly impossible to determine a center or a point. Im not giving up quite yet but the lead is starting to dry out. Any tipps or ideas appreciated.

It has to be atleast a bit more obvious than scrolling pages and pages of mythology and 10+ year old ED lore for bits that lead into rabbithole after rabbithole... right?

Considering the clues that have been given are mostly related to myths and stories... ya id say get used to:
SPOILER: RABBIT HUNTING

But I tried something like what your are talking about a while back - using the "real" Dark wheel logo - (Not the player created one ). I like it as as symbol for Aquilas Halo - Gold circle surrounding a Bird.... Tried working up a path around the outer rim based on the toast and that...

Kept me busy for a while but nothing came of it.
