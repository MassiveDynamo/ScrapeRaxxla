Those are brain errors just. There are 3 main subsystems in brain, 3 big neural networks, and they're concurrent. I.e. if you watch cats (perception) then you cannot think (another one). Meditation just switch switches of priorities of those 3. And if you use rare "meditative" part in RL then that will be "great finding" for you.
Similar effect can be done with a lot of food. That will take blood to stomach, so most expensive thinking processes in brain will shutdown. That's why some ppl eat at stress.
