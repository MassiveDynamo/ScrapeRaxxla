As for mythology etc yes i do think it may have a part, the issue is without any sort of indication on where to start this would take much longer than just passing through and honking everything instead, We have storys, fables etc most player made, fan made and rumours however no actual confirmed status from Fdev so for now all I see is rabbit holes to bury into instead of actually going and looking which is a major task in itself and been done since launch, I mean Raxxla if real has to be close if not in the bubble, whatever was retconned/not retconned it would be a major kick in the teeth if it wasnt as there would be no possible way to tie it with current codex entrys current "clues" if they even are etc, from this the only way currently would be to scour the whole area until Fdev give more which looking at it are holding their breath.

To be honest most players who started searching have gotten tired by now, most come then go and each time I enter this forum i see new faces, different theorys but yet the same sort of style just written differently using different guidelines but unfortunately the same outcome. I personally believe Fdev are just carrying this Raxxla legend to keep players who have everything done already to keep searching, I dont think a literal Raxxla exists in game that is actually seeable and not just some background lore which makes it technically "in game"

Definitely, and I largely agree with everything you have outlined - as I, and many others here, have experienced them all. Did not mean to be (too) sarcastic, most of that was aimed at FD. What you are writing is very much deja vu, and not just for Raxxla sadly. It can be very frustrating, but at this point they have dug their hole(s), and I think every time they try to get out of them they just end up digging them deeper, unfortunately.
