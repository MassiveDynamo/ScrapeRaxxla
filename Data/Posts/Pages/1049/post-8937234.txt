I think no one has found raxxla yet to this date due to the fact everyone has dived way to deep into rabbit holes, the phraze it may be right under our noses may mean more simple meaning and thinking is required considering everyone has tried and tested multiple and mental approaches yet raxxla has been around far beyond most technological advances in the game itself if we are to beleive it is in the game that is

I have to disagree with you on this because of the nature of the Raxxla-mystery.

There are several problems:
everyone has their own lead or hint they are following, but nobody knows if it's the right one
the actual hints from FD are vague, misleading or speculative on purpose and thus open to wide interpretation
someone abandoning a theory does not mean the theory was wrong; perhaps only a single action was missing to unlock the secret
people tend to not follow abandoned theories; which makes this hunt more difficult if someone already had the correct idea, but nobody tries it again
people regularly notice weird stuff, but they don't draw connections
example 1: People noticed the "Two Ladies"-name, but it seems that I'm the first to write in public about the Wadjet-Nekhbet-connection (someone else might already have noticed it and discussed in a private forum)
example 2: People already noticed the weirdness of the Isis-system (in this forum); nobody tried to make something of it
if people notice weird stuff that might help the Raxxla-hunt, but don't report it, we're possibly missing important information; those people are just playing the game and don't care about Raxxla
bugs which are mistaken for hints or manifestations of the Raxxla-mystery
I agree with you that Raxxla might be right under our nose, but if you're missing hard facts where to search next, you need to speculate. It doesn't help that the wording in the Codex naturally leads into a rabbit hole.
