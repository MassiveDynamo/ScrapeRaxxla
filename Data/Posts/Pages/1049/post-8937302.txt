I have to disagree with you on this because of the nature of the Raxxla-mystery.
on the other hand, this is true too, if it were 100% obvious, we would have found it by now. im conflicted if we're in too deep or not deep enough

people tend to not follow abandoned theories; which makes this hunt more difficult if someone already had the correct idea, but nobody tries it again
i second that, i have seen a lot of promising theories out there but no actual follow up on how far they got. Maybe a problem of not combining efforts (except the people scouring the milky way for every 8th moon of a gas giant), maybe too much distracting leads.
Do we have confirmed dead ends?
