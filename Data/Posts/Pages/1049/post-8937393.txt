the actual hints from FD are vague, misleading or speculative on purpose and thus open to wide interpretation
someone abandoning a theory does not mean the theory was wrong; perhaps only a single action was missing to unlock the secret
people tend to not follow abandoned theories; which makes this hunt more difficult if someone already had the correct idea, but nobody tries it again
Pssst - wanna buy some Soontil Relics? Or Unknown Artefacts? Shurely persuading players to sell certain rares in certain places couldn't make a difference to the narrative? And when all else fails just try listening to them, with extensive out of game sound analysis software and skills that every player has, or spend months searching a route that was hinted at in Galnet (back when it was good) of thousands of LYs only to discover you missed the object by 7.4LY after someone else finds it. Great fun!!
