If Sol system in-game is modeled after 2021 then we have something to work with. If it's modeled after 3307 then it's a lottery. I've checked some Sol models and each has different positions for Ceres in 3307.
Mmm, downloaded Stelarium, investigated Ceres position for 2007 (nothing). Headed back to Earth & tried to match planet positions in-game for 9-7-2021 & 9-7-3307. Having difficulties for both. But not used Stellarium before so may be doing something wrong.
