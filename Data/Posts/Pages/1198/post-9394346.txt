The question should never be, is Raxxla in game, but rather is Raxxla currently accessible.

FD have confirmed it is in game on a number of occasions, and recently by the current CM. But no one has ever confirmed if it’s ‘accessible’.

Even better - and I am serious, it ought to be asked alongside an affirmation, e.g “on the 19 April 2021, your CM confirmed the existence of Raxxla and that is was present within the games galaxy, my question is, is said asset currently accessible”.

If one wants to be pedantic, you might try quoting UK law, although I suspect this does not fall under computer games, nor digital products, but you get the drift: ‘perceivable, operable, understandable and robust’.
