Just remember again guys, Raxxla was moved to Lore & Roleplay, it was moved away from sections that are regarded as ingame current content, I believe raxxla is story driven but isnt actually reachable in game and the fact they remove threads regarding it and get you to navigate to threads not to do with current content just says it all really.
