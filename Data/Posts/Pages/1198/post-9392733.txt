Hello
I played this game for a long time and never started main quests of The Dark Wheel and Raxxla.
Where do I go or what do I do to start ?? I went to Shinrarta Dezhra system but I don't see any missions there to start with...

Well you are about the same place with the rest of us . Maybe take a look at the first post on this thread to get an overview. Happy Hunting o7
