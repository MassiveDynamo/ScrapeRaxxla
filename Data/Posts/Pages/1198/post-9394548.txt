I asked if it was in game and accessible...
I think it’s accesible. I also think it’s practicaly impossible to find it, with the info we have now.
Space is big. Anything that is hidden from scanning is basically safe, if it’s on the outskirt of a system.

We need more hints, a Mars relic or dumb luck.
