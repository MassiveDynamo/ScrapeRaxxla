Well, spent an hour looking for Ceres but nothing found. Looked in both 3307 and 2021 positions according to Star Map Pro, just in case
If Sol system in-game is modeled after 2021 then we have something to work with. If it's modeled after 3307 then it's a lottery. I've checked some Sol models and each has different positions for Ceres in 3307.
