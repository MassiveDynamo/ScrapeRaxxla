I think this is best advice you could give. Thank you. I'm off to go enjoy the beauty of the Milky Way Galaxy (and work on that Haloween story). I think you are right, in that happiness is what we make of it and is a very personal thing.
No worries. We all do it a little. In the 1980s, I used to imagine all the ships in Elite were other players and that the game secretly connected to everyone else playing it via the power cables. I had no idea what was to come.

More recently, a couple of years back, I wrote a little article about the Dark Wheel in Sagittarius Eye. It linked together a variety of little in game assets to create a narrative, but it was exactly that, carefully, weaving together a few disparate strands in a bit of entertaining guess work, not with any additional insight on my part.

In our contemporary society, we have to be careful about how we create narrative to link together ideas. There is nothing wrong with it as an imaginative act, but filling the absence of information with absolutism that treats speculation as fact can be a live wire when discussing real events, unfiltered by escapism (not here, and not that anyone is doing this). It is surprising to see how the processes cross over at times and how mythologies are built.
