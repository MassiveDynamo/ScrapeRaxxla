In light of incoming Stargoids you could name it “So long & thanks for all the fish”?

Copawlots are rarely any help, especially with Trumbles. But they are cute!
Except when they distract you asking for a walk just as you exit hyperspace in front of a supergiant....

My current trip has been profitable, 62MCr to date for exploration data when I docked yesterday. Almost every system between Crab Pulsar and 6 Cassiopeia was undiscovered, apart from a couple of NS. I thought I’d check out some obvious candidates for “Jewel on the brow”- Crab Pulsar, 6 Cas & V509 Cas, checked the systems and for comets but nothing found. Was going to check Rho Cas but arbitrarily decided, in light of my wrist pain, that was too far & someone else can check there for “comets”.
