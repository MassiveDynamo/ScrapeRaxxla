Not a lot of point in going over it in more detail here as its a) off topic and b) not something I'm going to elaborate on.
Can I just ask the following: if the Elite series is deemed to be in the same universe across all the games, Can we supplement our knowledge with the older lore in the other games? We have a number of renamed systems and/or planets between the gazetteer of Frontiers and the journals of First Encounters. Are those then fair game? I believe Frontier Developments has gone on the record to state it should be findable via Elite Dangerous itself. But are the gazetteer, journals, and prior manuals valid insofar as supplementing what we are given in Elite Dangerous if we are dealing with a singular Elite Universe?

Unfortunately, with Elite Dangerous we were left questioning how much of the older lore is valid. I think I've made the case that most is valid provided statements which may include propaganda or half-truths have some level of validity. I ask mainly because if the mythical station for The Dark Wheel exists, it is buried via systems where history has been buried by changes. I believe we have found some of the important stations which are the so-called palm tree stations or white stations. But the station that proves the authenticity of The Dark Wheel is still very much missing in action. The mythical station's proof, though, may not be material goods so much as something else. After all, we are told:

Find The Dark Wheel, find Raxxla.
