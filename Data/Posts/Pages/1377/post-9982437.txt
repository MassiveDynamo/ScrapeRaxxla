Well ive gone and purchased a shiny - if slightly used Dolphin from a friendly fellow I met on Ackwada (he even threw in a dog)... currently getting it outfitted (as well as de-trumbled, the dog was no help...) and I will soon start looking for rubes to take for a ride... in the hopes that they will lead me to Raxxla... yup thats the plan...
