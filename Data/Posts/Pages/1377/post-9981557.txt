Glittering seems to have appeared

Okay, so bad lead or a misinterpretation. Got it. I do find it curious though using the text Ian Bell had posted to his site and the Google Groups, I cannot find any public record of the summons between Braben and Bell. I could find court records for GameTek vs Braben. You, though, certainly should be knowledgeable on that and I accept it. I just find it weird Bell never actually produced something that had like a court logo and could be conclusively linked to a public record of any sort. For sake of argument the case details are on Ian Bell's site at Elite Home Page - Archive but even the public statement supposedly ending the legal strife cannot be retrieved as a matter of public record. Now, I get this happened in 1995 and the Internet was a baby then but surely there would have been gaming press about the whole thing. The "public statement" text is referenced on Bell's site as is the text of the libel fight (on another site but again text only manually written) and Google Groups .
