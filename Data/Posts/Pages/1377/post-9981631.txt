The entire point of this exercise is to canonically prove beyond any shadow of a doubt a Sol origin for our hyperspace technology. Even using purely canonical in-game sources with no RPGs, no books, etc. there is no way our technology is Thargoid in origin without the reverse engineering occurring solely in Sol before we even leave the system for the first time. Thankfully, Sol is at least in the lore of every prior game all the way back to first game. Now, there are certainly expansions of this arc elsewhere in galaxy. That said, Raxxla as written by Holdstock depends on Earth and specifically Earth before we even get to the Moon itself during the earliest days of the space race.

The core lore for the Elite Universe only actually covers approximately 134 years of actual time because Frontier and First Encounters occur in parallel. The extended Elite Universe lore covers millions of years as I believe Alien World has events happening as far back as the Permian Era on Earth and very ancient Mars. Please quit overthinking on the game lore. The Holdstock stuff is present. Nothing was retconned. There were, however, a metric ton of propaganda, half-truths, and name changes. We merely misunderstood the story. The fact Earth ia present in Elite Dangerous is 100% absolutely intentional.
