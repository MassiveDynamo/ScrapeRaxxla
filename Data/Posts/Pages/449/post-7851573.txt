Probably a little bit more than a legend ... there are elements from The Dark Wheel that have been confirmed as canon. It may be good exercise to identify what those elements are. Some examples:

- The existence of The Dark Wheel as an organization: Confirmed in And Here the Wheel, the existence of a faction by that name in Shinrata Dezhra, Premonition and the Codex.
- The legend of The Dark Wheel being connected to one Jason Ryder: Confirmed in And Here the Wheel.
- The existence of Oresrians: Confirmed in Frontier: First Encounters

I think that there is enough to suggest that the basic story line of The Dark Wheel is valid but that specific details may not be.

Absolutely. Most places and people in TDW are historical. It’s more like a ‘based on a true story’ movie. Probably put to the pen by someone with an agenda.
