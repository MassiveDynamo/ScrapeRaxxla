Mmm, Zurara was the Formidine Rift mystery (actually the in-game poi that led to the Exodus plot by the Club which was the real mystery) and Zurara lies a fair few kylies beyond Heart & Soul nebulae so not exactly in the same place.....

True, but the Rift clues did point us to EAFOTS - both the Cobra transmission and the exploration CG - so there's enough overlap to make it unlikely that FDev would put Raxxla clues there.

Also, I like to disagree with CoR on principle
