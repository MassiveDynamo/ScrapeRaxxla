EAFOTS sector.
Next to Heart and Soul.
Part of the Formidine Rift storyline.

This is why I think CoR are wrong about Heart and Soul being related to Raxxla - it puts the two biggest mysteries of the game in exactly the same place. FDev wouldn't be THAT stupid.

CoR need to be looking at Niobe.

Mmm, Zurara was the Formidine Rift mystery (actually the in-game poi that led to the Exodus plot by the Club which was the real mystery) and Zurara lies a fair few kylies beyond Heart & Soul nebulae so not exactly in the same place.....
