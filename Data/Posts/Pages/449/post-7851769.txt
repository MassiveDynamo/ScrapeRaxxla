I don't recall cor saying raxxla is in the rift... Any rift related stuff was written by drew, so is at best, club / dark wheel related - the Zurara. We hit a few rift targets after the dark wheel toast was dropped, but linked to other research rather than raxxla. Everything is related though. The rift links directly to the club, who link to the thargoids and dark wheel, which links to raxxla. It's one big story.

There was a link a few pages back to CoR's investigation of Raxxla - they're looking at Heart and Soul (via Eros and Psyche) as the 'answer' to "Parent's grief, lover's woe".
