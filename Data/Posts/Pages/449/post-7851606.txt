Sorry, I quoted the wrong bit. I was referring to the Galnet article you posted.

This continued for a few minutes until a power failure silenced it. The message read "OTSEAFOTSEAF". The significance of the transmission, if any, is unclear.

the ship was identified as an antique Cobra Mk III with the unusual hull registry of 'Cor meum et animam'.

EAFOTS sector.
Next to Heart and Soul.
Part of the Formidine Rift storyline.

This is why I think CoR are wrong about Heart and Soul being related to Raxxla - it puts the two biggest mysteries of the game in exactly the same place. FDev wouldn't be THAT stupid.

CoR need to be looking at Niobe.
