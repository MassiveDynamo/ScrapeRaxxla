Jorki has taken over to give Tyko a holiday in Sol, just in case Combat Elite is required!
Tested Columbus (a serious vagabond!) Station & Jupiter's Red Spot. Also tried orbiting Jupiter, both poles, L1 of Jupiter-Io .... Nowt!
Back at Rhea, darned surface map is only showing a wireframe. Need the surface features if I'm looking for an Omphalos!!

Aha, I was in baseline game so no surface map available. Why then are the landable planets shown with a blue (landing permitted) circle???
