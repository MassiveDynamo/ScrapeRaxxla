Don’t forget the "Someone has been there, honked and passed on through" rumour is just hearsay. One person claims to have witnessed it, but there is no confirmation. Even if true it doesnt help us locate Raxxla at all since people were exploring the galaxy on long distance trips from the outset. So could be anywhere, from Sol to Beagle Point and all points in between. It could be in a locked system for which the player had a permit. It could be in one of those systems that were locked later. It could be in an unlocked system......

Brute forcing what? What are they looking for? How are they going to recognise it if they spot it somewhere?

Ive said it before but I dont think Raxxla is going to be obvious. I think its unlikely to be named as such on first glance. More likely the omphalos rift is in a normal system and is a hyperspace trigger to reach Raxxla which will be in its own instance (downloaded from the server). The omphalos will be disguised as something normal and commonplace (hence my search in/around Columbus station), the toast should be a set of clues, though I’m currently hoping it’s a black Star Gate monolith in Sol as per 2001 Space Odyssey.

Edit: to make it even harder it’s also possible that the Omphalos will only be triggered when you’re very close to it, as previously discussed.
