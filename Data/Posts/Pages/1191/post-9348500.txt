Have a look at the FD quotes thread (my signature). DB definitely said Raxxla has been in-game since the gamma but can’t remember if I found the source reference for that (see edit). As you say it is alleged that he said Raxxla will appear if you are in the right place and honk enough, and something about more likely to be found by a group of players. No source has been found for that either, and I only found one claimant. However it is the basis for my belief that you have to be very close to Raxxla/Omphalos and honk to make it appear. With a minimum speed of 30Km/sec in supercruise and a honk-honk time of 16 seconds (due to scanner charge and recovery time) it makes it very unlikely that a single player will find it if the detection distance is set to something like 10Km. You’d have to be sure of the location and honk in normal space to stand a reasonable chance. At max speed of 500 metres/sec in normal space a fast ship like a Phantom would then take an awful lot of honks to cover 0.1 light secs of positional uncertainty (I tried searching Jupiter-Io L1 position last weekend in case Raxxla is a tribute to 2001 Space Odyssey; the “personal journey” fits with “Odyssey” and its reuse for the latest title may be a another hint, as may be the use of the Blue Danube music to accompany station autodocking).

Edit: the nearest source ref I have is Drew Wagar:

I have the impression the 'more likely being found by a group of players" was regarding the formadine rift mysteries. I believe at some point in time this was confirmed by @drew but I'm not 100% sure. What with all the Mandela going around and all
