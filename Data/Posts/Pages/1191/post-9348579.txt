O7 and thank you cmdr. Much appreciated. And if what you're saying is true, that means that you need to know what you're looking for AND be nearly pinpoint accurate when looking for it, therefore chances of finding Raxxla are pretty close to nil. Unless knowing a priori where it is.
If that unsourced quote is true then chances of finding Raxxla are low even if you know a priori where it is!
