@Louis Calvert; I’ve since updated my Yggdrasil ramblings to incorporate a more balanced level of assessment, based on your feedback, it’s greatly appreciated.

This has relevance, because the point was always to draw a line through various presumptions so we can focus our resources in the correct location.

I’ve reached out to the dev team in the hope they can at least confirm a dead end, they’ve done so previously, however that’s doubtful.
Tagging on this comment: there is a related concept called Axis Mundi that is functionally pretty similar and both can be used with the whole concept of Omphalos (navel of the world or universe). See Axis Mundi on Wikipedia. Notable that in Elite Dangerous the coordinate system is explicitly geo-centric and uses Sol as the central reference point.
