that we hadnt met the thargoids yet is irrelevant 100%.
they could have planted a tech at raxxla they dont use often, and we stumbled upon it. they existed at the time so theres absolutely no reason to exclude that possibility. as a species, they play a LONG game.
yeah it could be something guardian too... no reason to exclude that assumption either.... but lemme ask you this-
if either had the tech that raxxla is rumored to contain, why are they wasting their time squabbling over little chunks of one finite galaxy?
no. you are wrong. we are looking for something that is nothing like anything we have seen so far.
and you are all wasting your time, i will find it.
I am honestly am more than a bit torn on origins of our hyperspace technology and have a hard time which case has better backing but regardless we found something early. From a strict interpretation the through-space drives of the Guardian codex better matches our tech. Our capital ships, fleet carriers, and ships seem to use wormholes. Then there is this damn thing that looks suspiciously like an active obelisk that appears everywhere on our stations and on various codex discoveries. Admittedly, there is some engineer items that sound like bio-mech hybrids. The attachment is named the way it is because BLIT fractals were very much a part of First Encounters lore. I am growing more accustomed to the ambiguity. Also, the octagonal early Thargoids look like a Thargoid Scout or UFO. I still need to get more logs on the species specific missions from Palin or Ram Tah and see if anything seems to fit better.
