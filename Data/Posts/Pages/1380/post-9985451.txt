Do you remember that Galnet about some accident involving Wreaken in Col 70 sector? Turns out that is linked to "And Here The Wheel.. " It may not be directly linked to Raxxla but I want to break into Col 70. I think we need to see if the route Gnosis took in the infamous hyperdiction is a hint. This also means whatever happened in Brohman (Villist) is important. One other thing, I think "dark systems" are non main sequence stars and/or non-inhabited systems as those can be shortcuts but they are risky. I have to check, but I believe default filter for GalMap is economy or government type of the system which would exclude certain systems.

From "And Here the Wheel..."

Maintain Secrecy.

Then a second memory surfaced, a recent one this time. ‘That was you that knocked over the Wreaken mining platform?’

Robert turned away. ‘You heard about that one, huh?’‘ They found it adrift with all three thousand workers dead, their bodies mutilated or dismembered.’
