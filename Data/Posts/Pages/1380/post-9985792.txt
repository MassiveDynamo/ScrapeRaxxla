@Louis Calvert; I’ve since updated my Yggdrasil ramblings to incorporate a more balanced level of assessment, based on your feedback, it’s greatly appreciated.

This has relevance, because the point was always to draw a line through various presumptions so we can focus our resources in the correct location.

I’ve reached out to the dev team in the hope they can at least confirm a dead end, they’ve done so previously, however that’s doubtful.
