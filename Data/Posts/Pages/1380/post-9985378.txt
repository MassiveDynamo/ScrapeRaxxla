Thanks I too wasn't expecting Raxxla to be linked to the Thargoids, and I'm a little sad that it might be, but equally I could (am probably) entirely wrong, so there's that!

I can't think of any way to take this further given just what's in the codex. I'm going to see if I have any further ideas specifically on the Dark Wheel, which may be a pathway to unlocking permit locks, maybe?!?!

Good luck in your PM's, I hope you get a result! keep us posted o7
Do yourself a favor and do the Ram Tah and Palin missions. There is lot more in-game about both species beyond what is in the Codex. They are time consuming but absolutely worth the effort. Note: some of these require corrosion resistant racks. Check Canonn Science for details about where to dock to get mission and what you need as far as outfitting requirements.
