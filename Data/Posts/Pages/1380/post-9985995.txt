@Rochester Thanks, I'll keep an eye out.

The Raxxla logo has been bugging me for ages, I'm sure someone has done this before, but I finally realised where I've been seeing that shape:

I'm sure this is just a result of geometry and apophenia and not actually connected... probably...

... but I'm going to keep an eye out when I dock to see if the central hub of the back wall has that dot and three lines - maybe lights? Who knows, maybe it's a marker to let you know you're in a station that's 'meaningful' to Raxxla.

This is sadly on damn near every large station type and exists on both ends. Go to camera suite and listen to the audio from the big antenna. People in IRH (Independent Raxxla Hunters discord) have tried analyzing the but have found limited results. There are similar broadcasting antenna on the outside of the station on the panel with the docking portal with rack at 4 spots separated by 90Â° angles. You can find similar antenna at outposts and surface ports (at surface ports these appear as large antenna that look like solar panels). I don't know if these are connected to current or former hyperspace technology or something connected to The Pilot's Federation.
