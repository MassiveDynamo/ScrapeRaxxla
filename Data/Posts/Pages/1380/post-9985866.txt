@Rochester looks good Do you have an idea of anything else to investigate? Feeding green relics to Guardian sites did nothing at all (which, in all honesty, is both surprising and not surprising at the same time, I'm assuming many people have tried it before). I'm up for investigating anything that might help you, let me know
