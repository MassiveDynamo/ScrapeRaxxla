TL;DR version of prior posting:

Raxxla is found before we ever met Thargoids by numerous centuries. Raxxla predates Faraway by centuries. We are looking for something Guardian. The hyperspace reverse-engineered story is a sham to keep you distracted. You as a CMDR have been given a Codex Map with rumors of locations for each species for each sector of the galaxy with specific system locations. Use that because the search does not have to be blind at all.

that we hadnt met the thargoids yet is irrelevant 100%.
they could have planted a tech at raxxla they dont use often, and we stumbled upon it. they existed at the time so theres absolutely no reason to exclude that possibility. as a species, they play a LONG game.
yeah it could be something guardian too... no reason to exclude that assumption either.... but lemme ask you this-
if either had the tech that raxxla is rumored to contain, why are they wasting their time squabbling over little chunks of one finite galaxy?
no. you are wrong. we are looking for something that is nothing like anything we have seen so far.
and you are all wasting your time, i will find it.
