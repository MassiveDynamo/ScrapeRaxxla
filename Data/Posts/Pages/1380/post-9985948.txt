@Rochester Thanks, I'll keep an eye out.

The Raxxla logo has been bugging me for ages, I'm sure someone has done this before, but I finally realised where I've been seeing that shape:



I'm sure this is just a result of geometry and apophenia and not actually connected... probably...

... but just in case I'm going to keep an eye out when I dock to see if the central hub of the back wall has that dot and three lines - maybe lights? Who knows, maybe it's a marker to let you know you're in a station that's 'meaningful' to Raxxla.
