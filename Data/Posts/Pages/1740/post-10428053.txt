Geometric shapes and symmetry are always effective ways to create striking imagery for the viewer.
So even if there are no connections between this comic and FDev / MB's design for Raxxla, it does highlight a logical extrapolation of the codex's description - Raxxla functioning as a central hub / nexus to access multiple passageways.

because it does tesselate very nicely . . .

SPOILER: P6M HEXAGONAL BRAVAIS LATTICE

That's really cool, never seen it tiled together like that before.

The "Omphalos Rift" is near the centre of our Galaxy (located near Stuemeae JM-W C1-5825). I hadn't really thought much about why it was there, but if we assume it's the remains of a very ancient transit network built by some ancient species (the same one I've been talking about seeing pictures of in the signal), then having the 'gateway' at the centre of each connected galaxy makes sense. You want your "Grand Central Station" to be centrally located for ease of access

Also - That general concept of "connected galaxies" does loop back to Elite 1984's galactic hyperdrive system, maybe Brookes and Braben wanted to leave that door open and Raxxla makes a nice way to fold all that lore together.

My only real point of investigation now is trying to figure out of it's actually reachable (as in, did Brookes intend us to reach it, or just to know it was there). Everything suggests it's not, since it's clearly in an instance between systems.
