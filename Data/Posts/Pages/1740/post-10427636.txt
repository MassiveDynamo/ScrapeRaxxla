With reference to the quotation about TDW in shindez..don't forget that drews book Reclamation was an official novel at game launch, but that Premonition, which contains the above quote came out rather later more around the codex time, so the quote can't refer to the original intent of TDW in the game in MBs Time.

I'm sure @drew can chime in here
