Just a quick one, a side quest I'm exploring in relation to the Dark Wheel and wondered if anyone had the answer.
System factions:
I wasn't here at the start of Elite Dangerous (i branched into Everquest after 'First Encounters') were Factions introduced from the very start?
I understand Player factions were introduced in 3301 (2015 in old money).
Just trying to establish what was effecting the new systems (Tau Ceti etc) at the start, if anything was.
