Geometric shapes and symmetry are always effective ways to create striking imagery for the viewer.
So even if there are no connections between this comic and FDev / MB's design for Raxxla, it does highlight a logical extrapolation of the codex's description - Raxxla functioning as a central hub / nexus to access multiple passageways.

because it does tesselate very nicely . . .

LOVE IT!!! - Finally we can start searching for the crimson hexagon!
