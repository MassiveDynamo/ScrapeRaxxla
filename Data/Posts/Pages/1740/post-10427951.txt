Something I ran across in the past but then forgot to mention.... In Earthwind by Holdstock - Aeran is a planet much like Kamelos from his Timewinds novel.
Everyone reverts to primal state so to speak - a major part of the code (paraphrasing) - in order to be respected is to be a warrior and have proof of your kill...

Also the people from outside the world had the iChing as their "oracle" while the people of Aeran had the Earthwind which is associated with the triple spiral symbol

anyway on pp39-43 - The outsiders consult the iChing about continuing their mission.I did a little googling - so im an iChing master now... Here is what i made of what was said...

they flipped coins until they got to the last line and the first hexagram could either be a 45 or a 12 - 45 being the good outcome but it was 12 The proclimation was "Stagnation" followed by a moving line of 6... "He hides in Shame" (so assuming a 6 in third place)

The captain told the iChing "oracle" named Ashka he was done
but Ashka went ahead and looked at the second number - it was a 33 withdrawl... an indication of favorable communication and success in the event of persistance..

"Ashka understood one possible implication only too well, but he remained silent and gathered up his equipment..[snip]..The tangible sense of awareness he gained from the book was very strong. Just a key, he knew - just a key, a gateway into the real oracle, and yet it was always strongest when the book was in his hands."
