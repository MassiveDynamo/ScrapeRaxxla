I believe the current Starter Systems in Elite are all named after magical weapons
"Weapons" might be too specific - Dromi (not that you can start there any more in 4.0) seems to have been the second (failed) chain used to attempt to bind Fenrir, and most of the others I can find references for don't seem to be weapons either. "Items created by the gods" seems a more accurate description


And of course of the places you can actually start in current 4.0, given that the starter zone has been bugged and inaccessible in Live for years, no, not at all
LHS 3447 is a catalogue identifier
Asellus Primus is the traditional name for Theta Bootis and means "first donkey colt"
HIP 97950 is another catalogue identifier
