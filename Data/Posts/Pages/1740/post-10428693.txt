Just a quick one, a side quest I'm exploring in relation to the Dark Wheel and wondered if anyone had the answer.
System factions:
I wasn't here at the start of Elite Dangerous (i branched into Everquest after 'First Encounters') were Factions introduced from the very start?
I understand Player factions were introduced in 3301 (2015 in old money).
Just trying to establish what was effecting the new systems (Tau Ceti etc) at the start, if anything was.

My guess is that Cmdr's did as we do now, via the BGS?
