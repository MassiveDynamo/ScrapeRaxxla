With reference to the quotation about TDW in shindez..don't forget that drews book Reclamation was an official novel at game launch, but that Premonition, which contains the above quote came out rather later more around the codex time, so the quote can't refer to the original intent of TDW in the game in MBs Time.

I'm sure @drew can chime in here
That's rather the point. Premonition came out later and made some specific references to The Club, TDW in SD, a couple of the engineers....and was copy proofed by MB who was apparently friendly with Drew. Coming out alongside the codex it has the implication of MB using it to clarify (or perhaps redirect after the original Raxxla storyline was changed/demoted) things for us.
Don't think Drew reads the ED fora any more so is unlikely to comment, even if he could do so within the NDA terms.
