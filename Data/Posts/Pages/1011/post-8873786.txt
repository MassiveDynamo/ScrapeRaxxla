We have been looking / trying for a long time (Kickstarter backers). My Cmdr is more cat oriented and cats get really easily distracted

Tell me about it. I have a cat and a chocolate labrador. The cat mithers me until I lie down on the carpet to fuss her, so then she walks off. The dog mithers me at least 45 minutes in advance of every mealtime; he’s doing it now, that stare, I can’t stand the pressure!!!
Especially since he had another fit this morning at 01:00. What with that, reading until midnight, and last night’s storm I had between 4 to 5 hours sleep & I’m a tad tired at the moment! Need more coffee!!!

edit: had two coffees, now where's that brandy? isshh Chrishmus!!!!
