While checking out Avalon I went into the orrery view and noticed the planet Grach seemed to have a different sound playing while hovered over it. It’s probably nothing but I’m not sure if other planets similar to it sound that way while in orrery view.

I went to go check it out but then my game crashed as I was entering orbital cruise. Anyone willing to give it a listen?
Not sure what to listen for, anyway here's a recording.
SPOILER: GRACH
