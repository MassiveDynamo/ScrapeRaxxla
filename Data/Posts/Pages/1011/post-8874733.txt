Ya what i was playing with is:
for Art Tornqvist
Arthur (Arthurs Burial is suggested to be in Glastonbury Abbey) Tornqvist ( Thorny Branch) There is/was a famous tree ... the Glastonbury Thorn which legend has was brought by Joseph of Arimathea ... a sprig of which has been given to British Monarchs every Christmas...

As to Cora/Kore.... I cant say anything definite but apparently there is a group that has a "Sacred space for the Goddess Hekate" in Glastonbury which celebrates Spring and Fall rites dealing with Persephone... sounds like a hoot!

I visited the system Glaston.... didnt find anything though

The name Art also appears to be derived from a Celtic word for 'Bear'.
