Persephone and Arthur you say? That might not be the first time Persephone and Arthur are used in the same article.

Remember ages ago when Kahina Loren went missing? The seven veils was discovered to have fake parts installed at The Avalon Ship Yards on Persephone station. It was also the location used in one of those Jefress treasure hunts and I may be mistaken here but I think Alex Ryders’ father’s ship was named Avalonia as well.

I don’t know anything about Tornqvists or thorny branches though.

Ya what i was playing with is:
for Art Tornqvist
Arthur (Arthurs Burial is suggested to be in Glastonbury Abbey) Tornqvist ( Thorny Branch) There is/was a famous tree ... the Glastonbury Thorn which legend has was brought by Joseph of Arimathea ... a sprig of which has been given to British Monarchs every Christmas...

As to Cora/Kore.... I cant say anything definite but apparently there is a group that has a "Sacred space for the Goddess Hekate" in Glastonbury which celebrates Spring and Fall rites dealing with Persephone... sounds like a hoot!

I visited the system Glaston.... didnt find anything though
