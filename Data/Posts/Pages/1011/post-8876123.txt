There may be something in what you say. It’s clear that FD expected us to play in a specific way (following the mission board) and were surprised when we didn't. Then they revamped the mission board, & the Elite SD missions surprisingly disappeared, though we have been told they’re still in-game. So maybe following the missions would take us through the storyline they intended ...

This is what we are doing around witch's reach. We've basically started at a different one of the 20 odd systems 15ly away from the target permit system and are taking missions from the.boards, including the boards of the stations the missions take us too. It's a bit of brute force exercise but I've already had a mission for a luyten (sic) prison colony permit so we'll see what happens.

My only concern is FDev are grind blind, they don't see it as grind at all. I remember EII and first encounters and the insane volume of military missions of the same type you had to do over and over again. Photograph this, bomb that , it went on for ever and my concern is that I'll simply give up before I pass the FDev threshold.

I do think that sooner or later they are going to have to drop a breadcrumb, we aren't there yet and the game is as alive now as it's ever been but there will come a time where they will have missed the opportunity to explore this arc whilst it's still a populated universe.
