Probabbly rehashing things... but just looking at the Art Tornquist story... Cora- Kore(Persephone).. Art (short for Arthur) and Tornquist... Thorny Branch....

Im getting a Glastonbury vibe
Persephone and Arthur you say? That might not be the first time Persephone and Arthur are used in the same article.

Remember ages ago when Kahina Loren went missing? The seven veils was discovered to have fake parts installed at The Avalon Ship Yards on Persephone station. It was also the location used in one of those Jefress treasure hunts and I may be mistaken here but I think Alex Ryders’ father’s ship was named Avalonia as well.

I don’t know anything about Tornqvists or thorny branches though.
