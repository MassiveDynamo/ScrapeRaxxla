Do you know if 300 BCE India had bears? I mean, going to the Proto Indo-European roots of the word bear, and comparing its meanings into Sanskrit literature I can only come up with this. This is an avatar of Vishnu that saved Earth from some ugly monster. It's all very interesting. You know, Celts and their Brahmin caste should have given up on the strict oral tradition at some point so that future people could do comparative religious studies. For Raxxla!
