Excellent vid CMDR!

It's a shame we can't sort the tourist beacon entries in the Codex into numerical order instead of just discovery date. I have a whole bunch with the same (bulk import?) date and it looks like visiting the same beacon a second time adds a duplicate instead of updating, appending a new date or just ignoring it.

Don't know if this helps, but there is a collated spreadsheet of tourist beacons

you can order as you please then. There are a number of missing beacons, so clearly more to be found..
