Was hanging around Lave2 last night, DSSing it and general snooping about - got interdicted by NPC 'Child' of all people - a 'navy interdiction'. Submitted, and an eagle appeared - I left it alone and instead of running away from my heavily armed much larger ship, it just ran constant circles over me at the edge of scanner range. Didn't foop out after several minutes, so I gave chase and followed it for a bit.

For some reason I thought to datalink scan it - never done that before - you can scan a ship at 150m range if you can keep it there - never noticed that before. Sadly no data of interest appeared, tho' he/she/it/they got twitchy and deployed HPs. Eventually got bored and let it go again - more circles - gave up and fooped off myself - nothing else to do..

Aside from strange NPC behaviour (like what is that all about?) - has anyone else tried data-link-scanning NPC ships in flight - is this another way to get information?
