Don't know if this helps, but there is a collated spreadsheet of tourist beacons

you can order as you please then. There are a number of missing beacons, so clearly more to be found..

Thanks for the link, it kinda does but I meant an interactive version within the game, like it has for the Stellar / Geo / Bio / Xeno discoveries and ultimately it would be awesome if it was populated into the galaxy map when checking passenger destinations, even if you didn't take the mission and fly out to confirm it.

Edit: With it's own icon in the galmap, as a reminder to go / visited.
