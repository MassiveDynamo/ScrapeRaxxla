Could it be this? or HIP 23759

That's a tourism centre. You can dock there and sell exploration data. The interesting thing about that location is that jet of red stars around it. The stars mostly have weird names, but peppered among them are 68 stars with scientist names (Aldrin, Bykovsky, Copernicus, Halley, Laplace, etc.), 8 stars with ownership names (Archer's Wish, Banks' Reach, Hawking's Reach, etc.), 3 unexpected names (The Veil, Legacy, Labyrinth), and quite a few numbered (PDM2009 13, PDM2009 32, 48, 50, 54, 61, etc etc., JW 392, JW 566, 285, 865 etc etc, MLLA 90, MLLA 151, etc.).

So, just like the Cupid's Arrow nebula, which has stars named S171 1, S171 2, etc. all the way to 46, but not sorted in order from one end of the "arrow" to the other, this area can also be some sort of cipher. There's a station near Cupid's Arrow, perhaps that's the "vantage point" from which the star numbers can be recorded in order, so you can get the key to some cipher (37 45 2 8 36 22 ...). And perhaps that PDM2009 station is the "vantage point" from which to observe and arrange the scientist name stars, and the PDM number stars, for a key to another cipher (Aldrin 32, Bykovsky 48, Laplace 61, etc.).

So, TL;DR, there's something there.

Is it related to Raxxla, though?

Because this is what's happening: Braben has placed little ciphers and mysteries all over the damn game, from the Greek mythology names of the stars, to that little Easter Egg with the movie Total Recall that CMDR Guru 951 has posted. It's fun, and if you're in the habit of thinking like that, you see these "coincidences" all over the game and find them fun. But are they related to RAXXLA?!
