Welcome to Insanity Central (Raxxla Department)!
I have hypothesised several times on this thread that that screen image may represent Raxxla. I think what you are looking for is:
Cmdr Lachann: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=7377491&viewfull=1#post7377491
i suspect, looking at the “three galaxies” in shot, possibilities (from drkaii’s in-game list) are: ngc 147 & 185, triangulum, WLM, ngc 3109, ngc 6946, ngc 6942, ngc 5985.

However the original annotations were apparently guesstimates & not proven, so I think it’s all up for grabs.

It may also be possible that this image may be a hint but not an accurate representation of Raxxla-I wouldn’t be surprised if Raxxla turns out to be an alien station (maybe Guardian, since that would fit with the game lore) or an early Galcop version of the Orbis which has apparently been around for centuries:

Aren't we treating that one as possibly the TDW station rather than Raxxla?

Anyway, I don't think there's multiple (if any) extra-galactic objects in the image. Did a full skybox scan where I am, and couldn't see the skybox objects in the image, which I should be able to do if they're EGOs. Also checked the galmap and couldn't see any matches in the EGOs there.
