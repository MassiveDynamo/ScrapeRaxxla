Aren't we treating that one as possibly the TDW station rather than Raxxla?

Anyway, I don't think there's multiple (if any) extra-galactic objects in the image. Did a full skybox scan where I am, and couldn't see the skybox objects in the image, which I should be able to do if they're EGOs. Also checked the galmap and couldn't see any matches in the EGOs there.

Could be TDW station indeed!
