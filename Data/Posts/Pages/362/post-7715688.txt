The Cete also fits into the mysterious whale theme that mysteries in ED tend to get little a dash of.

Prof. Palin's first name is Ishmael, same as the main character in Moby-****.

Tau Ceti is part of the Raxxla codex. Tau is a symbol for life and resurrection.

We need to find the space whale and bring it back to life.

It's splattered on the surface of Magrathea.

After the improbability drive on the Heart of Gold turned an approaching nuclear missile into a sperm whale it proceeded to plummet to it's death along with the other missile, which became a bowl of petunias. There's a fair bit of dialogue from the whale at this point, while the flowers only manage to come up with something along the lines of "Oh no, not again!"
