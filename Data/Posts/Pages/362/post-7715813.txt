Excellent vid CMDR!

It's a shame we can't sort the tourist beacon entries in the Codex into numerical order instead of just discovery date. I have a whole bunch with the same (bulk import?) date and it looks like visiting the same beacon a second time adds a duplicate instead of updating, appending a new date or just ignoring it.

I suppose a reported by CMDR "X" list is Beyond FDev's remit?
