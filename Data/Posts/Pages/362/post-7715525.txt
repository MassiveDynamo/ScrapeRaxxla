The Cete also fits into the mysterious whale theme that mysteries in ED tend to get little a dash of.

Prof. Palin's first name is Ishmael, same as the main character in Moby-****.

Tau Ceti is part of the Raxxla codex. Tau is a symbol for life and resurrection.

We need to find the space whale and bring it back to life.

Its wierd, there was a ship in Tau Ceti tonight called "Whale"
