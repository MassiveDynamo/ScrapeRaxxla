Aside from strange NPC behaviour (like what is that all about?) - has anyone else tried data-link-scanning NPC ships in flight - is this another way to get information?
I tend to have all scanners aboard any given ship (of ~33?) set to the same binding and fire group so, when up close using the KWS I often end up completing D-Link scans as well but I've never noticed anything special like engineering data or mission invites coming out of it.
