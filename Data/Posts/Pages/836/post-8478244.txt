ok i did some analysis on this image. and here's your final proof that it is fake. even though before i break it down, i must admit, after all the tests i did, the quality of editing here is quite good. i dont see how people say it's easily fake. because it's not. (from a visual analysis point of view). not "easily" at least. he completely covered his tracks as far as the image effects itself go, but he forgot to cover his tracks on his thought process. and i got him good.

the object in the screenshot looked like a dyson sphere to me. so i asked myself, if i wanted to fake a dyson sphere in my screenshot, what would i do?
ofcourse! i would google dyson sphere. here's what google search result brings up for dyson sphere.
SPOILER: DYSON SPHERE
at first glance it looked very supicious to me. so i played with it.
if you cut it perfectly in a circle and put it next to the screenshot, and change it's color tone to a slightly reddish tone. you get this:
i know. it's disappointing sigh...
if you look closely, the patterns are exactly the same. there is no shadow of a doubt that the image from google was used in the screenshot.

somehow i wanted to believe the screenshot was true, just to give me a tiny hope. maybe it was the original purpose of who ever uploaded it? but that seems like a definite proof it is fake. and the hope is shattered into pieces again. hopefully though we can put this at rest, and move on. there is a real totally not fake raxxla out there in the black. and it only wants to get found!

Great job. Maybe @Xaintly can put this debunk into his document for posterity. Occasionally it still pops up in discord or reddit.
