Definitely getting into the dossier. You see, it is my firm belief the community managers do weekly reports of the thread for Lord Braben, to make sense of it. So, the game development is being directly guided by such things as how community is doing with their gardening, and taking care of their pets. Occasionally Raxxla is being found too. Lots of jumping across the galaxy. Sometimes adoring comments of Will in anomalous context. They'd be foolish not to. That's why there are so many community managers these days.
