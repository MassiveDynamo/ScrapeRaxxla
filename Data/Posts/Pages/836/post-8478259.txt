he tried to make it look like the original dyson sphere image (hollow from the inside) but, because of the low resolution, the scaling down artifacts and the non-matching background stars, ended up looking more like a planet with markings on the surface. i also tried layering the google image on top of the holographic HUD part, and it blended and fit perfectly on top of it.

there was other noticable hints in there like some people pointed out, like the text not looking quite right, the font and other things, but those ultimately did not constitute a 100% proof for me. there could have been simply a possible unique font for it. aswell as for the numbers of arrival being affected by possible gravity anomalies messing with the numbers, etc. the google image though, i think it puts the nail in the coffin. hopefully we can safely cross it off the list.

good hunting Cmdrs o7
