ok i did some analysis on this image. and here's your final proof that it is fake. even though before i break it down, i must admit, after all the tests i did, the quality of editing here is quite good. i dont see how people say it's easily fake. because it's not. not "easily" at least. that much i can admit. he completely covered his tracks as far as the image effects itself go, but he forgot to cover his tracks on his thought process. and i got him good.

the object in the screenshot looked like a dyson sphere to me. so i asked myself, if i wanted to fake a dyson sphere in my screenshot, what would i do?
ofcourse! i would google dyson sphere. here's what google search result brings up for dyson sphere.
SPOILER: DYSON SPHERE
at first glance it looked very supicious to me. so i played with it.
if you cut it perfectly in a circle and put it next to the screenshot, and change it's color tone to a slightly reddish tone. you get this:
i know. it's disappointing sigh...
if you look closely, the patterns are exactly the same. there is no shadow of a doubt that the image from google was used in the screenshot.

somehow i wanted to believe the screenshot was true, just to give me a tiny hope. maybe it was the original purpose of who ever uploaded it? but that seems like a definite proof it is fake. and the hope is shattered into pieces again. hopefully though we can put this at rest, and move on. there is a real totally not fake raxxla out there in the black. and it only wants to get found!

It's a good fake, but the font on the text 'RAXXLA' is also a bit of. The letters are to fat. Easy to see when you compare the L in RAXXLA with the L in Ls.
The text also look to be a tad to far to the left.
