Also star class number matters.

M0 with C index has 2 giants + 2-3 moons.
M1 with C index has 5 giants with like 10 moons.
So difference in 1 in star class may mean double mass.

M0 + M9 with C index does not have any planets.

So M9 roughly equals 2 giants with 2-3 moons.

...damn, that was always there galaxy map has everything to plan routes without any edsm >:

Ok, theory works. Found 4 systems with rings in 30 mins. Random search I did before was like one/hour ... so conclusion is - all names reflect mass. Mass is main parameter to make Universe here. Assuming some range of mass you can predict what can be there.


P.S. So now we need expected mass of raxxla Is it star/giant/planet/station around?
