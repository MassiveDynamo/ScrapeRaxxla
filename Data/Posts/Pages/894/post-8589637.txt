Yeh, i tried. Worked once or 2. Usually forum says "oops". I would love just put images here.
I use imgur these days... just go to your image in imgur and get the direct link (copy) then go back to the image button in the forum post and choose the link option then paste... works pretty well.
edit... well actually ive had trouble doing this from the phone since they messed with the forum. pasting into the box for me just kills it. But i usually use my desktop.
