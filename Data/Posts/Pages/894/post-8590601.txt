CMDR's, if it hasn't been flagged already (old and slow here...), something has come to light that you may all find of interest. That persistent rumour someone had already entered and left the system containing "Raxxla" apparently has a primary source claiming they heard MB say it in a Q&A at Lavecon in 2017.

Check out this CMDR Ascorbius video on twitch from about 20 minutes in...

[Edit: Note: I've already contacted them to query their video and they're adamant they heard MB say it.]
This came to light about a month ago on the thread that started a drive to expand TDW towards Sol. MB was asked to confirm & responded “no comment”. Two others who were said to have been there and heard it apparently recanted.
It’s not really important. Even by that short time into the game people had gone on long-distance exploration trips so even if true it doesn't really tie down the location of Raxxla, it could be just about anywhere. But it would have been nice to get an authoritative source, and it does seem to confirm it is in-game and discoverable. As was pointed out at the time it could be that Raxxla is a permit-locked planet...though I suspect not.
