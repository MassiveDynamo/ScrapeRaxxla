Just figured method "how to find rings without edsm":

By mass.

We look on map for that market A-H. For example, typical for single M-dwarf is B index mass. If you see on map SINGLE M-dwarf and index C there, then it will have couple giants. Best target to check for rings.
Same applies for anything else, just different typical index. Same may mean a lot of boddies, like 50 too.
