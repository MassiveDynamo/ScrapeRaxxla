As an Englishman and in the interests of international fair play I feel I should point out that in English in
"To the Jewel that burns on the brow of the Mother of galaxies"
the word “brow” is more likely to indicate “forehead” rather then “eyebrow”.

happy hunting!
But I still don’t see how the DW toast is supposed to lead to Raxxla. Lore tells us that TDW lost the location of Raxxla (though I’m not sure they ever knew it); their toast is far more likely to lead (if not a wild goose chase) to the DW hidden station, which I suspect is depicted in the start menu of Horizons.

edit: and if the experiments with BL and Maia BH have triggered a change in Scavenger behaviour, then perhaps you’ve triggered the real Thargoid invasion, by the dreaded Klaxians...
