Please give us some time to properly and clearly clarify our interpretation of the riddle up to this point. Our interpretation's Not to be mistaken with Anything related to the Formadine Rift mystery or CMDR Stoyben's puzzle. Those are separate puzzles and mysteries and have no place or reference in the Codex Riddle which we are here to solve. Also worth mentioning is that our discoveries are Not based on RP, but are an actual analysis of the clues thus far and any attempts to solve it or discoveries made are believed to hold the potential to influence the state of things in the galaxy and the potential to influence the outcome of our efforts upon the apparent political scheme of it all. At this stage we can say this, we are under the impression that Raxxla is discoverable but inaccessible due to the control over its access. It seems that you can find Raxxla, but you cannot interact with it. Please await our more detailed response. o7
