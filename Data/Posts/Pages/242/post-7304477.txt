Well, if we do believe that CODEX articles can't give us wrong information, tha it's indeed some part of a real DW, but my guess would be that it's nowhere near "inner circle" (let's call it this way) which has access to DW-specific information.
And joining that DW-faction through usual means of quests given by them and reputation won't get you any closer to joining "inner circle" (and gainng access to that secret station? and Raxxla?).
In the same way CODEX gives us reason to believe that's it's at least partly real DW it says that joining real DarkWheel is through some secret quest, from which you will know that it was it only after you finished it.

Though, as well we might see that DW-faction dissappear in coming months...)

I suspect, partially, everything said in game, and certainly don’t necessarily trust anything said in the Codex articles unless corroborated. I think the only way to get into TDW is to start with the SD faction and work your way up; given their lore reputation that’s likely to invovle a lot off the murkier type of mission.

I also suspect the “Club” is the top level of DW...they just have access to too much information; Pilots Federation and Universal Cartographics are linked in there too.
