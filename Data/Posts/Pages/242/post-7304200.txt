No it’s not! Felicia Farseer said in a recent galnet article that Dark Wheel imitators only lasted a short time before they “disappeared”. DW faction in SD has been there quite a long time, therefore they are the real DW! (Or at least part of the real DW concentric circles).

As for the missions, the original missions disappeared a year or so ago, but I was recently offered a secondary lucrative assassination mission by them after just ferrying 10 passengers about 16ly (to a nearby tourist system), which was also very lucrative; it may be that was part of the recruitment test (I declined on RP grounds, so can’t confirm), maybe several such are required.

Well, if we do believe that CODEX articles can't give us wrong information, tha it's indeed some part of a real DW, but my guess would be that it's nowhere near "inner circle" (let's call it this way) which has access to DW-specific information.
And joining that DW-faction through usual means of quests given by them and reputation won't get you any closer to joining "inner circle" (and gainng access to that secret station? and Raxxla?).
In the same way CODEX gives us reason to believe that's it's at least partly real DW it says that joining real DarkWheel is through some secret quest, from which you will know that it was it only after you finished it.

Though, as well we might see that DW-faction dissappear in coming months...)
