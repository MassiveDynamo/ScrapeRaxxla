It is generally assumed that the Dark Wheel in Shinrata is a faction using the Dark Wheel's name for their own gain instead of being the real deal.

No it’s not! Felicia Farseer said in a recent galnet article that Dark Wheel imitators only lasted a short time before they “disappeared”. DW faction in SD has been there quite a long time, therefore they are the real DW! (Or at least part of the real DW concentric circles).

As for the missions, the original missions disappeared a year or so ago, but I was recently offered a secondary lucrative assassination mission by them after just ferrying 10 passengers about 16ly (to a nearby tourist system), which was also very lucrative; it may be that was part of the recruitment test (I declined on RP grounds, so can’t confirm), maybe several such are required.
