I would think you should meet any requirement to be reached out to by the Dark Wheel in any case. The only thing I could think of other than the pilots federation ranks would be your reputation with the navies.

I haven't played regularly in two or so years; wasn't there a small quest chain you could find by getting close with the Dark Wheel back in the day? I want to find those and see if there are any leads to follow up on with the FSS and the new hints we have now.

Assuming the Dark Wheel and Raxxla are related, and if Raxxla has been accessible all along, I don't see why the Dark Wheel content should be any different. It may be possible to locate the breadcrumbs there with our new tools.
