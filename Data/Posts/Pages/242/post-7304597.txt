I suspect, partially, everything said in game, and certainly don’t necessarily trust anything said in the Codex articles unless corroborated. I think the only way to get into TDW is to start with the SD faction and work your way up; given their lore reputation that’s likely to invovle a lot off the murkier type of mission.

I also suspect the “Club” is the top level of DW...they just have access to too much information; Pilots Federation and Universal Cartographics are linked in there too.

However, there is a quote here from Drew suggesting that TDW and The Club might be at odds...

Whilst that doesn't entirely rule out some connection, it might mean TDW aren't that aware of who the club are.
