Hmmmm..... they're all really good points on all sides.... sadly. Really then, "Dark Wheel probably haven't found Raxxla yet, but could have done".

I suppose @Virtual Yoda started me wondering if finding the Dark Wheel is even worth considering at all?

If the Dark Wheel hasn't found Raxxla, then the Toast doesn't actually mean anything useful, right? So it make sense to just ignore that entirely?
The toast can be useful. I think it is relatively likely that the Dark Wheel have 'a piece of the map' that we don't have access to. It would actually surprise me if the journey to Raxxla, does not require interaction with TDW.

A long time ago DB or MB said something along the lines of: 'It's out there. We know how to get there'.
I've never been able to retrace that quote. It was probably on a live stream or something.

I suspect that 'how to get there' as opposed to 'where it is', means that we are not just talking about a location. Finding Raxxla requires knowledge. Part of the required knowledge is likely available from TDW. The rest we have to figure out our self.
