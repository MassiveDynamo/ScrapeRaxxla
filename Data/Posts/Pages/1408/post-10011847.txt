Hmmmm..... they're all really good points on all sides.... sadly. Really then, "Dark Wheel probably haven't found Raxxla yet, but could have done".

I suppose @Virtual Yoda started me wondering if finding the Dark Wheel is even worth considering at all?

If the Dark Wheel hasn't found Raxxla, then the Toast doesn't actually mean anything useful, right? So it make sense to just ignore that entirely?
