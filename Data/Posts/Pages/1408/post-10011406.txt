There are potentially two DW here, ‘The Dark Wheel’ based in SD and discussed in the codex, as well as potentially confirmed as bogus and according to tourism beacons an offshoot of the PF, formed ‘after the fact’, from the Ryder family offspring, much later so not the ‘real DW’ and so logically not attributed to finding or searching for Raxxla.

The other is the postulated ‘Dark Wheel’ of which little or nothing is known, outside of potential reconned lore and maybe a little in the codex and it’s name originating from the DW station, so on this trajectory I’d say ‘no one knows’!
