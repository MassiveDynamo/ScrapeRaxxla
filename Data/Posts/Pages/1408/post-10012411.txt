See my FD Quotes thread, think I have the source reference there though the source quote may have been deleted over time. It was definitely reported by Drew Wagar, talking about what DB said at the BAFTA disclosure, but I think he only reported this phrasing once.

I like this interpretation! MB said its “a personal journey”; a “Raxxla storyline” would fit this exactly. it may be that FD have made the path to the appropriate knowledge different for each player. That really would be a good puzzle!

This reinforces what I said about it being a really simple solution but full of misdirection and interpretations. It's because there is no ''one solution'' but multiple, that would need multiple peoples skill to decode, like people who look into audio files encription, morse code, symbology, lore relations and such.

But it's a personal journey to connect the dots found by many people. This also explains why TDW quests were removed. They were not personal, and were having the opposite effect to what FD wanted.

I think FD treats this game's narrative like XCOM 2 campaing.
The other factors of the board are playing independent of the players actions, and only react to the player when it either moves against it or takes to long to act.

We found thargoids, maps, interactions but nothing more, we couldnt push that narrative foward and find their origin or anything more. But people still searched.
So the Thargoid narrative reacted comming to us.

Raxxla was chased too fervously, but it was probably for an end game narrative, so it was pushed into hidding even further, reacting to players actions.
Doesnt mean the narrative was necessarily removed, I just think it moved on and advanced.
