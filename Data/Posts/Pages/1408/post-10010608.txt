Though I think Allen Stroud, if I understood him correctly, recently advised us to ignore external books (even "official" ones) and just use in-game ED lore....

I really want to know more about Augustus Branquith!!!!!!
I'm not really sure I agree with your summary above, but thats irrelevant..

Also I aimed only to provide the reference sought for the quote about TDW and their having found Raxxla, or not - admitting sources as valid is a personal preference.

More importantly, and with all due respect to our esteemed Author, how could he claim to be an authority on the matter, given he has not had involvement in the in-game narrative for many years, certainly since before Beyond. Now I agree that there is a limit to the integrity of the lore. Allen is fully aware of the extent of the references as they were prior to launch. He is correct in saying that older lore may not be represented and to rely on the in-game data.

In the heirachy of data, in-game data comes at the top. But I don't think we can abandon all other data. Its my position that I give some weight to the 'official' novels, as they were scene setters for what is in-game. Lore from previous version is then lower in the schema - its validity is only a nod to consistency, but the game universe is a different one, so they aren't facts - more fairy tales.

If we rely only on what is known in-game, then the balance of the data says Raxxla doesn't exist, being purely a myth, compared with other famously absent mythical places, and all data given as being questionable. But this is at odds with the statements of Braben and Brookes, so we have to admit to their being more than is in the codex, or else several people are conspiring to deceive, which is unlikely.
