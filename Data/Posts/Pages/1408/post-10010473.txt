Can’t find a particular link, maybe it’s in Canon… any assistance?

Wondering if there is still a map of all the old DW mission locations.

It’s obvious these were removed and also probably bugged, due to a conflicting update, as they seemed to appear everywhere, but if there was a semblance of ‘real’ data in there, it might still correlate. Longshot. Grasping at straws.

I’m just firing off randomness, but Im wondering where such locations are, and if they are at relative to the imagined ‘John Milton model’!

Example do they all fall into the upper or lower hemisphere of the bubble?

Of course that’s not saying anything, neither here nor there. I’m siding that the locations were all arbitrary and it’s anomalous data. Again stretching..
