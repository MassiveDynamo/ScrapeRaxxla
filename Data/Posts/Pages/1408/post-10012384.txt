The toast can be useful. I think it is relatively likely that the Dark Wheel have 'a piece of the map' that we don't have access to. It would actually surprise me if the journey to Raxxla, does not require interaction with TDW.

A long time ago DB or MB said something along the lines of: 'It's out there. We know how to get there'.
I've never been able to retrace that quote. It was probably on a live stream or something.

I suspect that 'how to get there' as opposed to 'where it is', means that we are not just talking about a location. Finding Raxxla requires knowledge. Part of the required knowledge is likely available from TDW. The rest we have to figure out our self.

See my FD Quotes thread, think I have the source reference there though the source quote may have been deleted over time. It was definitely reported by Drew Wagar, talking about what DB said at the BAFTA disclosure, but I think he only reported this phrasing once.

I like this interpretation! MB said its “a personal journey”; a “Raxxla storyline” would fit this exactly. it may be that FD have made the path to the appropriate knowledge different for each player. That really would be a good puzzle!
