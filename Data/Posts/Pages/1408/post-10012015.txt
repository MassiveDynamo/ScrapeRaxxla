Though I think Allen Stroud, if I understood him correctly, recently advised us to ignore external books (even "official" ones) and just use in-game ED lore....

I really want to know more about Augustus Branquith!!!!!!
Not quite what I said.

The game is the primary lore text. Other texts can support that, but the game is primary.
