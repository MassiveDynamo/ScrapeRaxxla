They don't appear on left panel as "Comet x" but as an unknown signal source threat 0 with no icon (exploration, piracy, ...).
We see the name with logs.

And to clarify: the signals are present in game but when you drop in these signals, there is no implementation of any comet!
But i agree with you, they should have been implemented after such a long time...
Just re-reading previous messages about comets. They may not have visuals implemented, but they are in the code/stellarforge/universe as points (but presumably with no mass). IMHO I think that means they’re in-game, but that’s just semantics.

What puzzles me is that some people have seen them as a pop up notification on the nav panel (e.g. https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ormal-space-close-to-them.350586/post-5486213), but I cant seem to drop out of SC at it after targeting the USS and getting the drop-out message.
