Ah interesting. Is that in Odyssey? Because in Horizons Galmap I dont think the current system ever disappears...

I assumed the “overflow search” method worked with both Odyssey and Horizons.

Edit: ah, have tried it and now understand. You meant when the highlight on the current system in the right hand side map has disappeared, not the current system name in the left hand side.
I only have Horizons, glad you got it to work in the end. I wasn't at my main computer so was going from memory but yes the popup in the galmap on selected object rather than the sidebar.

Has anyone got Allied with the Institute? Looked yesterday & they only wanted assassinations, which are out for me with my current hand problems.
Yes I have been allied with them for a year or so to specifically see if any unusual quests appeared. I also went to Yuri Grom because of this faction, although I haven't done any BGS.

Sorry to hear your hands are still problematic. I switched from a single joystick (MS Sidewinder) to mouse and keyboard and almost gave up several times over a couple of weeks but find mouse and keyboard far less of a strain on fingers and wrists than the joystick. After 18 months I'd find it hard to go back to a joystick.
