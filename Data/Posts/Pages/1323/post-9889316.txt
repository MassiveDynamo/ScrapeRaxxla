I don't know how some CMDR's managed to drop into comets, they have much better timing or luck than me or they passed through it a lot whereas I found it very difficult to even go through. Once Pyroboros shared his knowledge I was able to drop into it when targeted just like a station or megaship.

I did consider getting a HOTAS as Sidewinder wasn't great with constant z axis rotation, switched to mouse while researching and saw many comments about wear, tear, repair or replacements. I figured the mouse was less likely to suffer from that.

Can you get allied by wing activity, if someone else helped you with their combat missions. I don't know much about wings.
