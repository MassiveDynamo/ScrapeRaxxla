Idk if this has been discussed before or anything but this and it’s associated work is literally the classic idea of “The Silent Song of the Spheres”.
Cue three-way discussion with @Rochester and @Han_Zen!

Personally I prefer a bit of Mozart, Vivaldi, or classical guitar...
Sorry, the heat and lack of sleep is getting to me!
Keeping the epileptic copawlot cool is a nightmare!
