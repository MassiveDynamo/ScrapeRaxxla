I tried the search in galmap but nothing seemed to be targeted. One time I dropped out of SC and one of the stations was targeted. I’ll try again, first selecting another system as you suggest. Might even try jumping out of Pareco before trying it. But probably not today-too hot to turn on PC!

I’m considering taking the door off the refrigerator and moving in!
But the copawlot is a fidget...
