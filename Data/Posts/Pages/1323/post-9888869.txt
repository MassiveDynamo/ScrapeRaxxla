FD have never implemented comet graphics, even though comets have been in-game since the beginning and FD have had appropriate technology for some time (e.g. the trails of the surface probes), so why not implement them unless it would give away something they want to keep secret - Raxxla...??
I see comet graphics once in a while - but only their tails, and I haven't been able to find the comets as objects themselves. The tails flare up for a few seconds, only to vanish again, so I couldn't even get closer. Haven't found the Pareco comet, either, at least not by trying to adjust my position to the center of the stations and I have never seen its tail.
