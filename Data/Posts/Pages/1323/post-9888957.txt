No, FD have not implemented comet graphics. What you’re seeing is either the trail of surface probes being launched down to map a planet, or the trails of ships in supercruise.

But either could easily form the basis for proper implementation of comet graphics. It would be pretty easy for FD. So I suspect there is a reason why they haven’t been implemented, and the obvious answer is that it could highlight the one “comet” they have hidden from us.
I have seen tails way out and in Solo mode where no human activity - player or NPC - should occur. Maybe I'll remember to take a screenshot the next time I see one.
