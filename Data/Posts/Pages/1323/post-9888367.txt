I tried the search in galmap but nothing seemed to be targeted.
I had similar issues to when I originally looked at this, the important part I found is the bold bit - does that help.

Open the galmap, then the search bar. Wait for the current system popup to disappear then paste in the search criteria and target the result once the popup reappears.
