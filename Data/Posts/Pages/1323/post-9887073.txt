Idk if this has been discussed before or anything but this and it’s associated work is literally the classic idea of “The Silent Song of the Spheres”.
This has popped up several times within this thread, the relationship is linked to the now redacted Dark Wheel missions.

The reference could either be literal or literary, like anything it’s subjective, it could still be relevant or as the DW were confirmed removed, it may no longer be.

My personal opinion is this is a reference link to John Milton and Paradise Lost, as JM alludes to it a number of times, and he was an exponent of said philosophy, he was also a musician, and lets not forget later blind (eyes to see?).

John Milton’s inclusion here, is because he was a favourite author of M Brookes, who has talked about Paradise Lost a number of times.

Personally the Song of the sphere’s and John Milton’s interpretation relates only to our solar system, the outer rim effectively is the entire universe, the outer shell according to JM is an encompassing spherical medium within a extra-dimensional area linked to heaven/hell and an intermediate realm of pure chaos. It doesn’t directly reference any other points in space other than certain planets in the Sol system.

However Paradise Lost does reference a number of astronomical locations, JM also attributed the spheres to both several Greek muses and Christian archangels.

If literal it could relate to a sphere of influence around Sol or it relates directly to Sol…

Anything else is open to interpretation.
