Mmm, got fed up of not doing anything to keep cool. Powered up ship in Horizons and am hunting comets. In Pareco, just left Crown Orbital. Entered “Wredguia PC-D d12-2097240” in galmap to select comet 2, nothing happens! No comet/USS selected! Entered SC & repeated, nothing happens! What am I doing wrong?
Also tried with Wredguia PC-D d12-1048664 for Comet 1. I’m obviously not doing something correctly!

Edit: where’s @Adel or @Pyroboros ?
