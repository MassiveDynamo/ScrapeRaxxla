I thought the faction had another name as Pareco science institute, just checked on EDSM
The home of the Pareco SCIEnCE Institute. The Pareco Scholarly Collective of Inquiry, Experimentation and Cosmic Exploration Institute - also known as the Pareco SCIEnCE Institute, or PSI - is a collective of Commanders that work to search out the mysteries of the universe no matter where it leads.

SCIEnCE. Take the capital letters. I tried using the n (14th letter of alphabet, ascii 110) as a key but no joy.
SCIECE. 6 letters. 1 S, 2 C, 1 I, 2 E
RAXXLA. 6 letters. 1 R, 2 A, 2 X, 1 L
I'm going to have to take another look. Pretty sure I did stop at the Pareco comet by using the @Pyroboros manoeuvre. I tried plenty in normal supercruise but never found it.
