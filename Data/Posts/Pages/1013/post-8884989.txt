the simpler ideas haven't been tried though, aside from getting allied to the pilots fed or the dark wheel factions and seeing if any missions show up. They've just been talked about and abandoned for more entertaining ideas.

where has the combing of all systems starting from the old worlds and expanding out for scanning inside asteroid clusters ? do we have a % covered number? no.

There's no database saying that we've scanned 100% of the systems within the bubble to a certain radius from sol, so there's no way to know if one of those systems doesn't have some text in the description of some moon or planet that would give it away (much less something visible from orbit on the surface that would).

That's just the brute force search methods. But those can be done and dont need any kind of clues and would put to rest a number of potential theories and ideas of not only where raxxla is, but what it is.

There's no effectual point in entertaining more complex theories that have no hard evidence until you've got the above two things done... except that it's more fun imagining a convoluted and rich mystery. Nobody is really doing anything specific except hoping raxxla jumps out at them while they do their normal travelling/gameplay. I know that's how i do it...but i'm out in the rift and dont expect anything being out here but pointless procedural systems that will never serve any purpose in the game. Yet, being out here is still more of a fun idea than visiting roid clusters in the bubble. But if the search for raxxla wants to get serious, the talk should stop and the actions should begin. From the coordination of combing campaigns to tracking progress in third party database (possible separate from public ones). But that's a lot of work for something such as this.
