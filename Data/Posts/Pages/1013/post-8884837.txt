obviously everything is just throwing ideas out because we have no idea what raxxla even is, much less how fdev decided to hide it and to what level they're willing to provide clues.

If there is 1 thing that is guaranteed. It's that we've put way more time into thinking about this than Fdev put into doing it (putting raxxla in the game). This is being overthought and we need some way to resetting ourselves to thinking about this thru the eyes of how fdev sees their players.

Most of the simpler ideas have been thoroughly analyzed and overthinking is a part of the process. I've read almost every page in this thread and the recurring theme is, ironically, recurrence. Going over old theories (simple or not) helps to solidify their validity or lack thereof and bring new hunters up to speed.

The real problem is the absence of any decisive leads, which mostly stems from FD's silence on the subject. We don't know how much effort or thought FD has put into Raxxla. This inherently means that even outlandish claims hold as much validity as basic theories, so we must treat them all with reverence.

With that in mind, no contribution is unwelcome.
