I still think it's more likely fdev is hiding raxxla in an asteroid belt in some otherwise uninteresting system. But if raxxla isn't a ship and is instead some stellar object, then i think making it accessible by jumping from some specific starting point with a specific destination is the next best way to hide it and would make for an interesting way to make it obvious yet still a puzzle.

to make it a little bit obvious for the jump idea, you'd focus on singular permit locked systems that can't be acquired of which there are more than 1 possible option somewhat near the bubble. LFT 509 or polaris ...both have leaked internal makeups despite being permit blocked that make them stand apart from any random permit locked system.

That is, unless the permits for these systems are acquirable via missions. Wouldn't be the first time fdev thought it was a good idea to hide clues in local news of certain stations at certain times and nobody saw them because fdev has given players no reason to think any given random station is special enough to check on them out of the thousands in the game.
