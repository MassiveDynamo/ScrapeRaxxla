Using the idea of having to do a set of jumps in sequence, the icon for Raxxla has 6 wedges surrounding a single spot. Im not really good with using edsm but is there any permit locked stars or stars in general surrounded by stars starting with R, A, X, X, L, A with the final jump to unlock everything being the central jump. That final jump could cause a misjump to raxxla or dropping of the veil. Just an idea.
