obviously everything is just throwing ideas out because we have no idea what raxxla even is, much less how fdev decided to hide it and to what level they're willing to provide clues.

If there is 1 thing that is guaranteed. It's that we've put way more time into thinking about this than Fdev put into doing it (putting raxxla in the game). This is being overthought and we need some way to resetting ourselves to thinking about this thru the eyes of how fdev sees their players.
