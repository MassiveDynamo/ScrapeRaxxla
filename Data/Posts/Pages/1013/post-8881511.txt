Hmm, this system shows to me as VISITED and NOT visited, both:
EDSM - Elite Dangerous Star Map
The Galactic Positioning System of Elite: Dangerous at your service.
www.edsm.net

depends on checkboxes in filter. Very weird bug. Could it be something hidden there?
Set filter to "not visited" and jumped in:
SPOILER: MAP
However remote view and edsm show there some blue star too.
