So no misjump but raxxla could still be in the central system. Also it may not be in a permit locked system just a needle hunt. I only noticed today that raxxla is 6 letters and there is 6 wedges surrounding a central point. The word Raxxla could be the key making up the frame of the door. A lead, small chance but worth exploring like everyone else's ideas.

Im not familiar enough with edsm or query searching outside Microsoft access to find a 6 system needle sitting in a cluster sitting in a galaxy of a haystack so would appreciate if anyone else could have a look into it if they have a moment.
