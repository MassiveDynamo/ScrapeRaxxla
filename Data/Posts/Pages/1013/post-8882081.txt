I should of delete rest and kept " There was a Door to which I found no Key" part the rest was just a copy pasted with it it has no relevance. Only thing I was pointing out is that if an philosopher can create a sentence in dualism. I was merely pointing out that "The Door that is also a key" is not just an objective to be found but has meaning to it as well case in point the idea of the sentence is also a monism
