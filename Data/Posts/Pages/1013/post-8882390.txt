a hyperspace jump is a door and also the key to reaching any system in the game.

so it would make the most sense if that riddle refers to jumping.

now what would make it worth referring to it like that since jumping is how you get to any system?

I'd suggest that it refers to needing to jump from a specific system to another specific system. it is likely that the destination system is permit locked, and that the key to entering it is by being in a specific system when making the jump attempt.
