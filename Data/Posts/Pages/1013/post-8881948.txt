Just for the hell of it I figure I look into the meaning of "The Door that is a key." and redefine the meaning so I looked in the symbolism of key and found an interesting site that had a quote from a philosopher Omar Khayyam that would represent the opposite.

There was a Door to which I found no Key:
There was a Veil through which I could not see:
Some little Talk awhile of Me and Thee
There seemed â€” and then no more of Thee and Me.

I continue to read the meaning of the quotes and it was basically the perception of dualism. So I figure well if that is dualism then for "The Door that is a Key" would represent monism.

So I googled Monism and got some searches some even name Monad. There is a lot of related links when you read through it some even come around into Greek among other things.

Monism - goes through the many ideology for many philosophers and religions.
Monad (philosophy) - there is a lot of related stuff to those like element particles, geometrics the link of cosmogony refers back to the world egg.
Pythagoreanism - the originators of monad which still did their rituals with Delphi Oracle at the Temple of Apollo.

Edit: Anyone ever go through the elements of the Hero's Journey, also refered to as the Monomyth?
