Some food for thought, but has anyone considered trying to work Dactylic Hexameters into the equation? The Oracle of Delphi supposedly delivered her prophecies and guidance through a dactylic hexameter, which was then interpreted by her assistants [9] and passed to the recipient. Unfortunately it's almost impossible to recreate one in English because of the pacing and I don't know enough about how it works to plug it into anything.

Aside from that, I think Darth Ender's comment about sequentially jumping to systems in order to unlock a "permit locked" zone might have some validity. A strong argument can be made for the Toast representing a map, and it's heavily debated about where that map should begin. I would argue that rather than being a large map, it's possibly quite "small" in relative terms. Perhaps the entire map is be contained within a very specific localized zone with minimal jumps, such as the Pleiades with their nearby permit-locked systems and Delphi location. In addition it contains a Thargoid structure with a galaxy map. For tinfoil points, the Omphalos stone that resides in Delphi is described as having a "floral pattern" complete with "buds", which Thargoid structures take the appearance of and contain.

So it's actually a route through a locked zone, like stepping stones over a river and the word "to" in each line of the riddle is actually an instruction to go to, not a toast. It would surely be easy to hide unlocked systems that threaded their way through a large locked region.
