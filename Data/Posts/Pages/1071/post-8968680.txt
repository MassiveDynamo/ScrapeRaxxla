So I have really put some thought into all this and done my research and spent hours reading and validating things and saying whether this or that is b.s. or not. My conclusion to everything is princess “astrophel and spiraling stars”... this is where the words-“you have to make it a bit obvious” come into play. But that was hard to figure out because there are so many things that could have been the obvious thing. So I went into detective mode with the astrophel and spiraling stars. What’s up with the name astrophel?! Well Astro obviously means Star and phel means Fail in English from a few other languages. So we have Star-Fail and spiraling stars. When you do a search on spiraling stars and really dig into it, you always come up with something about a WR star or Wolf Rayet. So In my theory we have converted astrophel and spiraling stars into Star-Fail and Spiraling Stars. But there’s one more step what’s a Star-Fail? Well a failed Star is a brown dwarf.. so I’m willing to bet that Raxxla is in a system with a brown dwarf and either one or multiple wolf rayets. I mean really!! Why even put something like that in the game if there’s no context to it. There is no book with that name anywhere in elite or in the real world. There’s one that’s similar but not enough to tie it into this game.
