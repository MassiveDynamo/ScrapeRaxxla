There’s too much thought put into a lot of theories. It has to be something we can use to gather info that they have already given us. Astrophel in real life is a name that in Greek means Star lover. But we’re I’m the here and now. Why wouldn’t FD just put the actual name of the book in there. Why would they change it to spiraling stars. It even says that clues were thought to be given within the book but nothing ever was found. It’s the name that has to mean something or they could have just said astrophel and Stella was the name of it were meant to give no hints or they could have just said nothing at all. Has to be a reason they mentioned it and a reason they changed the name.
