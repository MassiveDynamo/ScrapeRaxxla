What if, another thought, right so we know how we cannot currently land on planets? However they have shown planet tech to us 8 years and more ago, weather/cloud effects, storms etc before we could even land on non atmospherics...Im just thinking this may not help in finding Raxxla or it might as it may have never been checked..

What if the tech they showed us is in game currently, they have datamined storms, weather etc way back before which led to speculation on at the time of the dlc we are now getting, what if Raxxla is the one and only current planet that doesnt give the inclusion zone and actually lets you land on it, think about it, it would be very well hidden within the bubble even as most atmospherics would even have been attempted to land on while also their test bed since beta that they have shown us these pretty skys etc before while also explaining the datamines from eons ago as those people may very well have been local to the systems containing it....What if Raxxla is a planet we all scanned, but never tried to land on as the image in our head tells us "We cant do this right now"

Long shot I know but possible as the inclusion zone is just that a zone the game locks you from going further, this doesnt mean there is nothing there as many planets have textures that are real and not just image mappings like Earth, Achenar, Alioth and a few more I have personally flown into and looked at.

Further to this think of Jurassic world evolution, If any of you have it notice the ranger cars when you drive them, they handle like the srv on a 1g planet to a T, they use the same engine for this game, so they have the tech for these planets already developed for years just the pushing it out galaxy scale is the hold back, however One planet may hold the test work, one planet most likely does as they use ingame environments, what if Raxxla was one of these planets not with Dinosaurs (That would be cool however) but something else they have designed there.
