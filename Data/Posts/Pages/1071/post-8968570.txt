Anybody read Michael Brookes’ The Tau Ceti Mission? I remember him mentioning it in the old Canon threads somewhere & thought I’d treat myself to some Sci-fi light reading but can’t find a copy for sale anywhere.

I think it was a bit of a followup to the Sun Dragon book - he had a website for it but looks like its been taken over by . The wayback machine is your friend
Seems like it was the start up thoughts for a second book but never completed? Or maybe just completing - filling out the Sun Dragon book.
