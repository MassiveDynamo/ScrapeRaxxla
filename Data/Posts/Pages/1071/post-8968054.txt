Another slightly off topic mention.

Maybe a check on Saturn's belts, i remember briefly a thing Braben said that he beleives in the theory of a very large ice moon smashing into saturn created the belt..... Now in that stream/dev log i noticed he has that vague smirk on his face when he said it, that same vague smirk he gave about Raxxla, when probes where appearing, and when we first found the guardian surface sight. Wierd is saturn ingame only has the D ring... The other 3 are missing

May be going out on a whim here however worth checking, that dev log was about 8 years ago when the game was but a mere infant but still viewable
