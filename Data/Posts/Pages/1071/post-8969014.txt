Well, Γαλλια (Gallia?) is definitely something that's cropped up in the past on this thread. Something to do with some Greek text being scanned and read as Raxxla by the software. (I'll check the first post again in a minute, not sure if it made it on there).

Edit: I can't find it. Hopefully someone had older mentions of it bookmarked, or can search/ scan the thread better than me).
