Pretty much what I was saying yes, I was half asleep when I tried to explain it so thank you lol

As for the player faction, yeah that was more of a how are the linked to the Pilots fed real ingame name more than about their squadron, they are linked to the Pilot Feds in overlook as their hq minor faction which was odd because there was a time where you would have to have fd set this up for your members before inara would pick it up
No problem!
I was half asleep when I read your post, so between us we had 25% of brain cells working!
Edit: on second thoughts, with all the brandy I’ve been drinking during lockdown I probably had less than 50% brain cells working!
But at my age it’s difficult to tell.
