So ive been back in the bubble for a couple of days now and hung around Robigo looking for the 'True North Star' passenger mission.
No luck yet.
Ive outfitted a Dolphin with a Luxury cabin as my Orca passenger runner wont fit on the Mines outpost and of course the Python cant equip Luxury modules.
So my question is has anyone seen this mission before? Do we know what cabin it requires? I can flip the boards faster in the Python but that's First class max.
Was it given at the Mines outpost or Hauser's Reach? Obviously i will check both.

Trying to catch up on PP now im back in Utopian space as my rank has taken a nosedive over the past few months during exploration but ive been out to Beacon 541 which i believe is the destination for the mission, nothing found.

The hunt will continue.

Hauser's Reach

It has been awhile since I was out there so I don't off the top of my head remember cabin type. It was at least business class or first class but don't remember. Before I go back was going work Sirius Corporation reputation nearer Sol (and possibly unlock Marco Qwent).
