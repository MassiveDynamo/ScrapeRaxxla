The Beta 2 pill stretched from Eranin to Sol (almost). Achenar and Lave were way outside.
The Beta 1 bubble was only a few systems around Eranin.
Interesting. I didn't play until late 2016 IRL. Wonder why Eranin? Would be interesting to see if it used to be known by a different name (or something important nearby). Still the bigger question is, "What is Raxxla?"
