The Milky Way as it is now in-game did not exist until the procedural generation received its final modification to create what became the gamma build, which debuted a couple of weeks prior to the game's full release in December 2014. It was not until then that players could explore the Milky Way, having previously been confined to the beta 'pill' that excluded many key systems.
I think the "pill" was primarily encircling GalRoute G1. This essentially is a direct route from a Lave to Achenar (though original maps had a different name for Achenar). Vetitice was one jump off the route. This means the "pill" was not at all random. Also, see codex for Hengist Duval and tourist beacon "Tyrell Biggs Election" in Sol for why this would have been the case. A mutual agreement was reached between Federation and the Empire in 3008.
