I think the "pill" was primarily encircling GalRoute G1. This essentially is a direct route from a Lave to Achenar (though original maps had a different name for Achenar). Vetitice was one jump off the route. This means the "pill" was not at all random. Also, see codex for Hengist Duval and tourist beacon "Tyrell Biggs Election" in Sol for why this would have been the case. A mutual agreement was reached between Federation and the Empire in 3008.
The Beta 2 pill stretched from Eranin to Sol (almost). Achenar and Lave were way outside.
The Beta 1 bubble was only a few systems around Eranin.
