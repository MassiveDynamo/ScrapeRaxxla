On hand-placed, fictitious systems - a much better and clearer description! - the Old Worlds were described as such by FDev itself, but any others would be suspicious...
You may need to check GalMap here for verification. However, the "History of Lave" beacon says Lave was previously known as L-453. I suspect this may actually be a real system. GalMap should have any other designations for that system.
