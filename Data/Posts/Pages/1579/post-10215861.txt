Couple of thoughts...

While Legacy clearly isn't the book about a “young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon”, I think it is extremely likely that MB wrote it to provide clues to Raxxla questors. The description of Hammer just makes me think he was based on MB himself! One thing that nobody has suggested-perhaps Raxxla (or rather the Omphalos Rift device to take us there) is contained within a floating cargo container? That would make sense of the burial scene of Legacy and the description of Trinkets of Hidden Fortune-“these trinkets have a much more valuable prize hidden within”...but just one specific cargo container rather than them all!

Now the other thing we have is the extensive tattoo which MB had, which clearly depicts a journey through the Underworld to Paradise. He said it was for a forthcoming (but apparently never written) book “The Space Between” which IIRC would be loosely based on a mix of HP Lovecraft and John Milton mythology. The game codex clearly hints at mythological references and an Underworld and has identified many of those in-game. That tattoo must have been a painful experience, and it was done over several sessions, so it clearly meant a lot to him, yet that book was not written? I am sceptical of its existence. He had plenty of time to write and publish it....



I couldnt open the spoilers in your recent post for some reason (probably my ageing iPad).

@Jorki Rasalas I have now removed the spoilers completely. Personally I don’t like them either, I probably typed them in wrongly (on an IPhone), just thought it might help with reading a wall of text.
