If the were a trigger, to initiate any such elements in game, the primary trigger ought to be exploration, factions and ‘missions’. But I would imagine such a meguffin would have been triggered by now, unless it relates to a specific commodity; but I suspect it’s a navigational identifier - pointing us towards someplace in the lost realms!

Isinor is very prominently in TDW novella that came with the first game. This is notable for two reasons: it was close to the Ryder home world (controlling traffic for the region) and access is controlled by a particularly quirky theocratic faction. Curiously, Trinkets of Hidden Fortune are found here. I think the only reason this hasn't been triggered so far has more to do with commonly held assumptions by CMDRs. If this is a form of ancestor worship, we have the key and I might just have some ideas of how that gets used. I really think this idea might be viable especially given the difficulty in acquiring Trinkets of Hidden Fortune for oneself. Raxxla is inherently linked to pirates. This is likely the connection.
