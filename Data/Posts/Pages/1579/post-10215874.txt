@Jorki Rasalas I have now removed the spoilers completely. Personally I don’t like them either, I probably typed them in wrongly (on an IPhone), just thought it might help with reading a wall of text.

Thanks mate!
I like the use of spoilers to tidy appearance as well as obfuscate spoiler information, but yes, it was possibly your iphone...I like Apple products, always have, sound engineering and from the outset the 68000 was basically a more secure processor then the 8086 that Microsoft used. But I gave up on iPhones after my #4 implemented their battery saving procedure and didnt ring so I missed a medical emergency incoming call a couple of years ago....

Just plain stupid management practice!

The prices have gone stupid too, so when this ageing 2014 iPad finally goes to the great silicon mine in the sky I’ll replace it with a Windows tablet (shudders at thought of more Windows bloatware!)
