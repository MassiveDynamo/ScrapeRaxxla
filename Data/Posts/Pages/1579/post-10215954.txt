Hauser's Reach

It has been awhile since I was out there so I don't off the top of my head remember cabin type. It was at least business class or first class but don't remember. Before I go back was going work Sirius Corporation reputation nearer Sol (and possibly unlock Marco Qwent).
Thats good to know, thanks, will do some missions from there in the Orca which has Luxury/First cabins which i use for long distance.
