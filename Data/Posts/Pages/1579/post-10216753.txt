Lots of handcrafted systems are RL stars. Most of local systems around Sol are handcrafted to some degree.
Sol it self is probably the most manual system in the game.

There are also some overides in systems with generic names.
Mostly planet names or the adition of sation, but anything is possible.
The RL stars are what I meant by condition #1: "not in any IRL catalog". (it was nearly 4am here, hence the ambiguous wording)

On hand-placed, fictitious systems - a much better and clearer description! - the Old Worlds were described as such by FDev itself, but any others would be suspicious...

EDIT: oh no, seems like the simbad_ref column I was relying on for the EDDB dump was a late addition, and as such only ~10k systems have it set.
This means I have to filter out more naming patterns; luckily, PySpark is being a breeze to work with on that ~7gb mammoth.
