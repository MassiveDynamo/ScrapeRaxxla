There are two necessary, but perhaps not sufficient, conditions that handcrafted systems must follow:
They're not present in any real-life star catalog
Neither its current name, or any previous names it had (see: Colonia, Delphi), follow Stellar Forge conventions
The late EDDB was the only third-party database which allowed filtering by #1 - fortunately, there's a full dump available for those willing to trawl it.

Lots of handcrafted systems are RL stars. Most of local systems around Sol are handcrafted to some degree.
Sol it self is probably the most manual system in the game.

There are also some overides in systems with generic names.
Mostly planet names or the adition of sation, but anything is possible.
