Remember the Trinkets description via Support and Devs 1 year ago.

I suspect there was some mechanism linked to the lost missions and these might have taken us somewhere, or possibly made us aware of something.

What’s infuriating, is FD never ‘openly’ communicated this when they were pulled. So they effectively left an inactive element in game that led nowhere!

That’s telling of a degree of ignorance towards the previous narrative, likely from their perspective justifiably, because it’s their game, their workload; things happen. And as Arthur once said - certain historical elements built by previous employees might not be wholly known to others, it’s a big game… so I can accept things get over-looked.

So we have to be cautious when thinking about such historical elements. Their true purpose may be redundant. I did recently re-open this thread of Support following the introduction of the ‘tour’ - strangely it’s the first ticket I’ve had that’s ever been ignored.

The ticket below initially advised the trinkets and the missions still worked. Until I challenged it, and the Devs confirmed it removed.
