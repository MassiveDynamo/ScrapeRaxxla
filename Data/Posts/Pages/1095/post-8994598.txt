How long are the servers down on Thursday mornings? Canâ€™t do any DIY so may get back in cockpit
Usually around 20 mins sometimes a little longer.


The misjumps I discovered require a game crash to occur naturally but can be forced by closing the app. The repeatable result I've experienced is instead of ending your fsd jump at the main star as you would normally, you arrive in the destination system somewhere in deep space. I'm assuming it's random as I've not yet noticed a pattern.
