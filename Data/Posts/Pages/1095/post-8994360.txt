Yea I find the words we use misleading. Dwarf stars are stars so afaic dwarf planets are planets. Maybe call them something other than planets, right? Like massive asteroids maybe idk. All I'm saying is there would be less confusion if the words we used didn't seem to imply what they apparently don't mean.
There is still controversy among some astronomers about the decision to reclassify Pluto from planet to dwarf planet. I understand both sides of the argument, since there are larger bodies out in the Kuiper belt than Pluto so the number of planets would go up significantly. I don’t see why they shouldn’t!
So I still say Persephone is Planet X
