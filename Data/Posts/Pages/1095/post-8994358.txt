There are misjumps - Jacques was an obvious one. I remember MB coming on one of the iterations of the Mysteries thread when we were pfafing around with trying to cause misjumps and - I could have swore he said there was no way to do it. - of course I cant find this quote now.... And I took it to mean there was no Mechanism by which players could cause a Misjump... like in older games.... not that misjumps are now non-canon.
I think FD said misjumps were not implemented in the early design forum, or a vid related to that.

Edit: It was before I started play in late 2015, but I did see it when trying to catch up. Think the design forum is archived somewhere if someone wants to search.

I thought the “misjump” of Jaques was just a plot device by FD to ensure he ended up in Colonia to provide a second home to humanity for when the goids kicked us out of the bubble.
