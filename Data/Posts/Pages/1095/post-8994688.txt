I thought the “misjump” of Jaques was just a plot device by FD to ensure he ended up in Colonia to provide a second home to humanity for when the goids kicked us out of the bubble.
Nope, AFAIK, Jacques was originally intended to go to Beagle Point by FD. The misjump to Colonia happened as a result of the massive UA bombing of Jacques Station by various players in advance of the jump happening. It was still done by FD, as those kind of jumps were all server side things implemented by FD, and so still is a plot device of sorts, but a one which was responsive and adaptive to player action, rather than being a purely pre-planned plot device. It's been cited before by FD as an example of where player action changed the storyline.
