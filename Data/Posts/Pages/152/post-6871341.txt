Oh. :/

Well if it ever is I will be here to study every part of it.

Don't worry SecretDragon, we've all been down that rabbit hole at some point (I too postulated on the fan-made TDW symbol a few (dozen?) pages back before being similarly enlightened by the fine folk in this thread). Indeed I wasn't even the first, but I too also did a search through the thread to make sure I wasn't re-treading old ground (which I was). The search tools on this forum leave a lot to be desired!

It would be rude and hypocritical of me not to +1 you for the imagination and enthusiasm though; repped.
