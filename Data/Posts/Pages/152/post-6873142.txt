I was thinking of forming a group who's entire existence is dedicated to searching for Raxxla while logged in to Elite Dangrous. A long time ago King Arthur founded the Knights of Round Table to find Camelot, and then after that find the Holy Grail. Perhaps a similar group can be created. I know the Children of Raxxla exist already (and they do great work and are amazing roleplayers), but their recruitment tactics are very strict and they are highly secretive. I was thinking this other group could be more open and that way we gather more people to search for Raxxla.

We could pour over potential clues, as well as brute force trying to find it.

You realize the Dark Wheel exists right?
