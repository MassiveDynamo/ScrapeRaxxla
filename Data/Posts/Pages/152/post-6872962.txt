That is why I made the suggestion of Brothers of Braxxla. If the game lets you you could claim all the braxxla systems as an outpost. 8p

I was thinking something more along the lines of Knights of Raxxla. Space explorers on the hunt for Raxxla itself. We wouldn't have a home, except a fleet ship once those are implemented in Q4. We could then travel the galaxy looking for it. Basically a nomadic force. If we claim systems, then we get involved in politics. We saw how that worked out for Salome and the Children of Raxxla.
