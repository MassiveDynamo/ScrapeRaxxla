Not sure if this is of any interest, or even that relevant to this thread, but I spose it's Children of Raxxla related...

Drew Wagar has been doing weekly discussions on Twitch on the topic of writing.

Of course since he's written a number of ED books there's much talk around how Reclamation was put together.

I didn't catch all of the most recent one but here's a screenshot :




Not sure if this is specifically mentioned in Reclamation but this is the location of Octavia's outpost. (it likely is known I think this is discoverable in game).

I also asked about Rebecca, again this may or may not be common knowledge but it was news to me. Rebecca Tyley from the Oolite saga is the same Rebecca from Reclamation.


Full VOD is here : https://www.twitch.tv/videos/285440689 probably some other bits and pieces in there.

I think he does an hour every Monday.
