Was going to point out rOmiLaYu’s comment, but Scytale has beaten me to it.
however, reading rOmiLaYu’s text it might be that DBOBE was actually reminding Ed that he (Ed) doesn’t know anything about Raxxla; Guessing DBOBE & MB kept everyone else in FD out of the loop about Raxxla & placed it themselves. I haven’t seen the original livestream to have an opinion either way, but I suspect Raxxla as implemented in-game is in accordance with TDW lore.
I.e. it is not alien, it is a planet, but it is some form of ghost- could be a planet wandering between systems, could be hidden in an asteroid field or in the depths of a system well off the beaten track with no orbital marker line, might be in a USS (but were they in game from the outset?). The alternative is - it’s a planet of ghosts, maybe a graveyard of some form. In which case Tionisla??? Are there any other notable graveyards in the Elite lore?

I did watch the DBOBE chat and agree that when a question comes up about the existence of Raxxla in-game he says “silly question, yes of course”, then Ed says something like he could have forecast the four most popular questions in advance (i.e. Raxxla topic is at least one of them) and DB responds “yes, but you don’t know what it is”.

So, nothing much there, and confirmed Ed is unaware of the details of Raxxla (as expected, probably a close secret within FD) except “what it is” rather than “where it is”. So I interpret that as meaning it is not just a run-of-the-mill planet, but something special (as we would expect).

of course that won’t stop some people being disappointed when it is found. As we saw with the FRift storyline, expectations can run much larger than the solution, that’s human nature.
