Too risky I'm afraid. You'll be driven mad by the voices in hyperspace and I wouldn't want that on my conscience. I have to stop my ears with wax in order to survive.

Did you know that if you record the sound of the hyperspace transition then replay it backwards through Audacity, you can hear a voice saying "Stop messing about and just play the damn game".

And here I thought it said "we'll have content for you in game soon for normal players to find, in the meantime, please keep listening". Going deaf and the tinnitus kicking in again I guess. Old age kicking in while I wait for an atmospheric planet to land on before I die.
