Has has anyone checked the spirograph nebula in reference to either spiraling Stars or the brightly-lit places in Gan Romero's dream visions? Pictures I've seen of it look amazingly luminous feel like it would be worth the look just for the sight even if it's completely unconnected to anything.

I checked around there today. There’s a Science vessel out there, logs indicates it just stays in that system, but the ships that launch from it jump to a few nearby systems. Other than a Water World and some Notable Stellar Phenomena, I didn’t find anything.
Oh, it is absolutely beautiful though and worth a trip just to look.
It’s a fairly popular destination so it would have been surprising if there had been anything Raxxla related there.

Nevertheless, still worth checking - even if there’s nothing Raxxla related doesn’t mean there’s nothing which might be of personal interest. Plus of course thing might change.

The science vessel has been added since I last went. I do remember it being added though now it’s been mentioned - it’s was the result of a player group CG (so probably best not to read anything in to it).
