There used to be this pleasant zero-g bar for explorers in the Spirograph nebula that had Kongga ale on tap and a vending machine selling these things for tourists.

Genuine replicas of ancient Thargoid artefacts it said, that somehow ended up on Earth in the 20th century and were used as toys for children. Apparently if you played with these things too much or under influence of biologically fermented alcoholic drinks, you would begin to receive mysterious messages from heaven, pure western lands, Elysian Fields, and Tharsis, or that's what the regular patrons of this establishment told me. The story would go on for quite a while, but in the end they all seemed to agree this was why ancient humans decided to terraform Mars and settle their new capital in Olympus Mons. I later heard INRA had to shut that place down.
