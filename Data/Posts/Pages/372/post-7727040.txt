Used to be a thing if you took a mission with instructions to go somewhere to get further instructions but you had to read the fine print very carefully to pick up on it which became very frustrating out at Ceos / Sothis at times... As in, take a mission going next door, only to be forwarded another 400Ly to the bubble.
