I'm here to clear the air. My transgressions were big and what I did was sacrilege. I DID NOT FIND RAXXLA. I was mistaken. Maybe it was a part of it, maybe not. I now openly admit that I'm very sorry and hope I did not waste anyone's time or energy, or permanently lose respect as a CMDR and fellow explorer.
