I'm here to clear the air. My transgressions were big and what I did was sacrilege. I DID NOT FIND RAXXLA. I was mistaken. Maybe it was a part of it, maybe not. I now openly admit that I'm very sorry and hope I did not waste anyone's time or energy, or permanently lose respect as a CMDR and fellow explorer.

In a game that relies on self created content as much as dev created content your posts and enthusiasm were great reads.

Anything else forget about it mate, its ages ago and the hunts is still on. In a game of find the needle in a galaxy size haystack many bits of hay will look like needles
