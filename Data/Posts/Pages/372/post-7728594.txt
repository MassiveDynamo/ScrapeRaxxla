…TECH OFFICER’S LOG 1/4…
This signal is incredible. The behaviour is almost organic. We can’t isolate it, every time we think it’s gone it shifts to a new frequency band."


P.S Archambault Terminal still needs to go chicka chicka boom boom. There can not exist spiritual radiance without nuclear radiation. Those people are living in a lie, and need to be saved.

Ah, wrong signal, the one that the tech officer was talking about was coming from the Pleiades sector, this one is coming from exactly 10 ly away from Sagittarius A. Below you will find a map put together by one of the researchers showing the systems we have isolated it to. The colors showing the signal strength. The PDF contains the instructions to repeat this research as well as our raw data.If you are interested in helping out join in (link a the bottom).
