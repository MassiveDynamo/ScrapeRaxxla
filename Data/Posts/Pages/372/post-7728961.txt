Did you know there is a mysterious signal,viewable from everywhere in the galaxy located just 10 ly from Sag A that is sitting between six systems? Did you know that you don't need anything that has been added to the game since launch to hear and detect it?

Don't believe me?

Nice work.

I think sound analyzing is an interesting and often ignored part of this search. 'Silent song of the spheres', 'whisper in witchspace' and 'siren of the deepest void' quotes all hints to sound being part of the pusle.

There are quite a few sound Easter eggs in ED so filtering out the unrelated finds, may be a challenge.
