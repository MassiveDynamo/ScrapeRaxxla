Well, after a boozy afternoon and a nice dinner I’m on my second glass of red of the evening (so much for dry January!), watching Skyfall & searching Galnet for info on Jaques. There are some major gaps and a slight inconsistency:

Galnet references

13 June 3302 Several outposts throughout inhabited space have reported receiving messages over the past 24 hours, suggesting that the cyborg and his travelling starport survived the attempted journey to Beagle Point.

26 May 3302 despite setting off almost a week ago, no communications have been received from Jaques Station since it departed, and explorers at Beagle Point have reported no sign of the outpost.

~20 or 21 May 3302 departure for Beagle Point??

20 May 3302 Three individuals carrying pamphlets identifying them as members of ‘The Hands of the Architects’ have been apprehended at Jaques Station. Starport personnel discovered the individuals attempting to modify the station’s frame shift drive. The would-be saboteurs are currently being held in custody at Jaques Station while starport personnel discuss possible extradition with nearby systems.

12 May 3302 A spokesperson for The Fuel Rats named Mischief has announced that Jaques Station has received sufficient quantities of fuel to complete the proposed jump to Beagle Point.

5 May 3302 Jaques’ Orbis has been roaming the galaxy for over 40 years. Now, after more than four decades of travel, Jaques is about to embark on his most ambitious expedition yet – a long-distance jump from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point.

19 Feb 3301 After a week of wandering in HIP 110620 the Jaques Starport is now making its way through HIP 110079. GalNet is still no closer to learning the reason behind the station’s unexpected return, nor can we ascertain where the cyborg barman’s ultimate destination may be.

12 February 3301 It’s been some time since Jaques began his epic journey from orbit around the moon of Topaz into the mysterious places of the great unknown. A week ago we reported that Jacques Station was seen by an intrepid commander in HIP 110620.

07 February 3301 Some years ago Jaques’ Station left its orbit around the moon of Topaz. It’s mission? To discover new beverages, explore distant stars, and bravely go where no starport had been before. When the starport left on its journey the station was being captained by the toughest barman in all of occupied space, a part-Cyborg known only by the moniker of Jaques.



Systems visited by Jaques prior to the jump to Colonia:

?? Topaz moon-??

? Feb 3301 - 19 Feb 3301 wandering around HIP 110620

19 Feb 3301 Journeying through HIP 110079 - Unknown date

-16 months gap on Jaques’ activities!-

19 May 3302 Jaques jumped from Gliese 1269. Beagle Point was the intended destination, jump expected to take a week but he went missing

28 Jun 3302 Jaques found in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 (Colonia)

The inconsistency is regarding the actual jump date. Since the three saboteurs from ’The Hands of the Architects’ were arrested & held in custody at Jaques Station on 20 May 3302 the jump is highly unlikely to have been before that date; he may have jumped that day or the next, despite galnet report 26 May 3302 saying “despite setting off almost a week ago”, which sort of implies 20th. But seems strange that attempted sabotage of the fsd didn't delay the jump for a few days!

The major gaps are between from whenever he left Topaz to Feb 3301, and from 19 Feb 3301 to 19 May 3302 when Jaques seems to have gone missing. I thought there was more info available on his movements, so it may be in the Codex (haven’t checked TB!). Moreover we are told in the Wiki that he had to upgrade his original Coriolis to a more resilient Orbis, but that’s not discussed in galnet.

Yes that’s how I recall it now, the series of jumps were so few I recall I gave them not much credence.

I have since updated my little map to show Topez.

We know now the ‘Caretakers’ and the ‘Visions’ were part of the discarded Guardian narrative. We also know that the bombing of Jaques port was essentially a player initiative?

I do wonder how much of Jaques original narrative path was retained or did players throw a spanner in the works and FD decided to divert it?

I suspect the the bombing was a happy coincidence and FD just ran with it. Swapping one method of intervention with another… And that Jaques was just ‘supposed’ to have stayed lost for some considerable time whilst the Caretaker/Guardian narrative was played out…
