Yes, but my point wasn’t about the nature of the accident but where the visions happened.

Halsey wasn’t found in hyperspace, she was found in real space. (Taking what was reported in Galnet at face value anyway.)

Her visions seem to link to her time floating in her escape pod in real space.

“A reporter from the Alliance Tribune asked President Halsey what it was like to drift through space for so long:

"It was wonderful. Amazing. I saw the universe, and our galaxy within it, as I'd never seen it before, and I felt the presence of the real caretakers of our galaxy. The paradox of their existence – tiny yet gargantuan, fleeting yet eternal. They spoke to me as I drifted in the void. It was amazing. I must share their message."”

{Example shown of older lore playing a much larger role}.

Followed immediately by the existential dread.
