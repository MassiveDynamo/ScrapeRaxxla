I think MB’s concern about making things too easy was to do with the “infinite range” of the advanced scanner; well before release of the FSS - which is a real pain in practice! On this Gravitational Wave Hypothesis search just about every system that Jorki and Tyko have entered have been undiscovered. Found quite a few WW! Couple of AW and one ELW. Good for exploration data credits, but sure slows the journey!
