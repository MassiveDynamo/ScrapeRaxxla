Oh, Iâ€™m convinced that FD fully expected Jaques (& several other stations) to be UA bombed. You could see it coming!! They just timed it appropriately. Very soon thereafter it was (planned!) found that MetaAlloys repaired the damage!
I'd say this was expected and endorsed by FDev. I'd also be really hesitant to say they dropped the narrative. The fact no one has seen Jaques at his station is proof that may be the case. This may be a case of putting the narrative to the side while other plot lines develop further possibly. The Elite lore often has actions that happened earlier that prove consequential. Fortunately, most of the world's wisdom is deduced from consulting the oracular dead (as evidence never lies). Let's hope CMDRs start realizing they need to play the long game, too, with the lore. The past is after all, the lesson.
