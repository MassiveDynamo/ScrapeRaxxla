I find it infinitely amusing that the following keeps happening...

CMDRs:
We love the mysteries and stories connected to Elite. I wish we knew more of it was canonical...

Followed immediately by the existential dread.

I’m not sure if that was just a general observation or if it was about my posts.

If it’s the latter, then you are imagining and projecting something that isn’t actually there.

If it was the former, I’m not sure to what extent I would agree whether it happens generally or not.

FWIW, this is absolutely not something I have never said. I like the mysteries, the myths and the legends, and I like them because that’s what they are and what they bring to the game. What I don’t agree with is us as players having (or being given) what is effectively preternatural knowledge (or GM / god level knowledge).
