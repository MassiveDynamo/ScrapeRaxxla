Hypothetical question: When Horizons came out do you think FDev would have changed it to a POI on a landable moon? Does the Codex hint if we are dealing with something orbital (the "omphalos rift") or surface based? I doubt they would put Raxxla behind a low atmosphere body so all CMDRs would have a fair shot. With the addition of FSS, they could at least hide Raxxla by requiring the body be subjected to detailed surface scan.
