Hypothetical question: When Horizons came out do you think FDev would have changed it to a POI on a landable moon? Does the Codex hint if we are dealing with something orbital (the "omphalos rift") or surface based? I doubt they would put Raxxla behind a low atmosphere body so all CMDRs would have a fair shot. With the addition of FSS, they could at least hide Raxxla by requiring the body be subjected to detailed surface scan.
It would not surprise me if Raxxla or it's active part (Omphalos rift?) has been updated, as the game has expanded. As long as no one finds Raxxla FD can fiddle with it, as they like. It would at least be risky to assume it works in the same way as when the game was released.
