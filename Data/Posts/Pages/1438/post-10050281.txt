I just need to write this down, at least for myself.

Notes on 'un-discovered POI' mechanics
I just jumped to "DG Canum Venaticorum", it was already fully mapped by my flight computer. Nothing new to scan.
I did NOT see the "Iraxon Lane" INRA base as POI in my NAV while checking from 900LS. (As expected)
However it shows as 'Human (1)' in the FSS even before I have done a surface scan. Unexpected.
I had previously assumed I had to get close enough to do a Surface Scan (and generate the POIs by being close enough) before it would reveal any clues at all.

This is good news I guess - we can discover things even if it's quite far away.
I just need to make sure I was certain about the mechanics, how it would treat these kind of 'non-discovered POIs' for a pilot.
