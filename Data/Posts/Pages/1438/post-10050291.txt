Technically itâ€™s logical to assume FD would allow us to find it, so it ought to appear on the FSS!?
My guess is that it is an installation. If memory serves me correctly, installations are not detected unless you are within 1,000 lightseconds. Though, scanning a body with FSS will get nearby stations, fleet carriers, and installations so the 1,000 lightseconds may have changed.
