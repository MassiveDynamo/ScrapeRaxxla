Raxxla pre-2296 Discovery
What if one of the early Hyperspace test jumps went wrong but the pilot made it back alive to report what they saw as they bounced around in time and space, and that was whatever Raxxla is - exactly like Halsey and Jaques did.
Yeah, this and associated alternatives is something that’s been talked about before on the thread.

One point however is that Halsey and Jacques had different experiences.

Halsey, unless I’m much mistaken, had her visions while floating in real space. That and Gan Romero’s visions introduce the possibility that the rumour of Raxxla came from visions rather than from something physical - so no need for hyperspace misjumps.

Jacques’s experience was much more of a traditional misjump. As I understand it, there was considerable risk in early hyperspace transits, including misjumps. The question for me is just how far we take it. Do we just treat it as space displacement, or do we include time, and even more esoterically, displacement to other universes.

One thing I’d just like to add on Halsey and Romero is that it appears that those visions aren’t random, but are directed. A possibility that has to be considered is that the source of those isn’t the caretakers/architects but is actually from a human source.

Another thing to consider on the visions front is whether those visions are happening directly in the brain, or are being done via brain implants. If it’s via the brain implants, then there’s a dependency on that tech for any visions. I’m not aware of any dates for the introduction of that kind of tech however.
