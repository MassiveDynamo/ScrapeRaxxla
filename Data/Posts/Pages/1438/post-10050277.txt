Systems visited by Jaques prior to the jump to Colonia.

Facece (Topaz) date ? 64.28125 / -111.4375 / 25.1875
HIP 110620 - February 12, 3301 - February 19, 3301.
HIP 110079 - February 19, 3301 - Unknown
Gliese 1269 - Unknown - May 19, 3302

Can’t see any direct correlations, except a path away from the southern hemisphere of the bubble, his journey begins in Facece around the moon Topaz, then he disappears for some undisclosed time.

Jaques systems shown below in ‘green’ - all other points all relative to the Yggdrasil tree and Milton celestial pole, just for context. The red point close to them is aptly named system ‘Bridge’.
