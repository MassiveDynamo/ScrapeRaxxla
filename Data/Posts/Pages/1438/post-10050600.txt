All this talk of Jaques got me thinking...

This ^^ actually maybe totally explains how Raxxla could have been 'found' pre-2296 and then lost.

What if one of the early Hyperspace test jumps went wrong but the pilot made it back alive to report what they saw as they bounced around in time and space, and that was whatever Raxxla is - exactly like Halsey and Jaques did.

People then knew "Raxxla" existed, but not where it was! Exactly like when Halsey got everyone to go looking for what she saw in her visions. Only back in the 22nd/23rd Century hyperspace travel was limited, expensive, and hard so getting out across the galaxy just wasn't an option, but the myth of Raxxla being "out there somewhere" would have stuck around for Art Tornqvist to mention in 2296.
I kind of like how you're thinking with it, there's no issue with the narrative we're being told.
Regarding Sirius, I agree with the idea of it a player in the race for Raxxla. So many breadcrumbs being deployed in many of the stories. Not sure if they have found it though (and lost it as well).

--- purely sidekick notions ---
Anyway, I found it being a bit strange (quite a while ago) that Sirius wanted to push exploration & mankind in a very specific direction. (It could have been the Zurara narrative, most likely).
This was back in 3301, but I made some notes on the subject. https://panzertard.github.io/elitedangerous-notes/notes/Sirius-Colonisation
One of the remaining questions I had was why they never colonized one system - it's breaking the pattern.
Again, just notes - not sure if it has any bearing on our predicament.

SPOILER: SIRIUS
