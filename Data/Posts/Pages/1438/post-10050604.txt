Anyone know of any documented investigations into Sirius stuff to save me some time with this tinfoil-lined rabbit hole?
The single best document I know of is Children of Raxxla's Holdstock Report. Focus initially on the section on Finance. The whole thing is worth a read. I am having to share a link because file is too big for the forum. This was from the early days but they did tremendously good research. This is the version they circulated to the player base at the time.

Regarding Sirius Corporation, there are three sets of colonies linked to Sirius Corporation: those immediately near Sirius itself (about 30-35 LY region), those from "Launching the Colonies" GalNet, and those linked to "Sirius Corporation Announces New Programme" GalNet (Robigo region). Sirius Atmospherics was behind the CG that started Thargoid aggressions in Coalsack. The turn in location was the exact same system as the system later revealed to contain Azimuth Biotech's Geological Site 23B linked to the Adamastor.
