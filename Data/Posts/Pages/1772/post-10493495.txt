The following is the sentiment of FD a long time ago, not a direct quote:

Example: FD we don’t want this game to be about a set of Wikipedias (?)

Example: FD on the design of the galaxy map (prior updates), we could make it easier to navigate but we’ve intentionally made it difficult to make players think, and that is indicative of the whole game…
