yep , i hear ya everyone! o7 , i guess it just is what it is and we make the best of it here as a Community.

btw, i'm just now exploring this Nastrond system ( like probably 1000's of other players already have before ) and tbqh i don't see anything all that "special" about it yet ....well....unless you count 1 of the factions named: DRAGONS of Nastrond
There seems to be little rhyme or reason for most of the system permits. We may well be missing something here!!
"Dragons" crops up frequently in anarchy faction names...interesting that MB's novel Elite Legacy has the main character Julia
Who "grew up without toys with a single possession, a book about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon”.
