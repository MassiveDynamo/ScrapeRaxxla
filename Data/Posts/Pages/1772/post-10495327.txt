the titan is currently in qinganu. i am 615ly out and i can still detect the titan using fss mode. are you cmdrs that are in deep space able to detect the titan? we should do science on this, as the same mechanic may be used on raxxla, the dark wheel, the rift or rogue planets. although i suspect they are colder...

how far out does the titan signal go? do black holes amplify the signal? do different scanners amplify the signal?
