i was literally just about to EDIT my above post lol

So i ended up totally stumbling upon 'The Peoples Vigil' megaship cuz of another random mission and then after clicking mission-board a couple times , the Transportation tab finally led me to the PERMIT unlock mission. (which seems to just be a simply in-game MAIL telling me i now have the permit lol )

What i cannot understand though is: How are players supposed to know this stuff IN-GAME ? The GalMap info tab for Nastrond only says "unlocked from Defence Party of Nastrond" . Okay fine np , so i did that as i mentioned earlier. But then, like how the heck would i ever have known to immediately goto People's Vigil megaship in an entirely different system of Wonome?!?! ( sure, i got lucky and stumbled upon it , but nothing in the game itself ever told me to go there . ---Unless i missed something about it in Codex or somethin' ? )

In-game continuity??? I dont think FD give sufficient consideration to that.
But this thread is usually helpful.
