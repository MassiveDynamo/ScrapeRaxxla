What i cannot understand though is: How are players supposed to know this stuff IN-GAME ?

This is one of the biggest problems with FD and ED, there’s no real explanation and this goes way back to the launch of the game; namely - inconsistent communication.

Example: FD state in a public event what exploration will do, then omitted that model from game, no real explanation only vague promises, various scraps of information here or there, the (now) CEO giving out statements which inflate the importance of simplistic processes without clear explanation of difference.

Inconsistency.

In short I think such missions had a bigger part to play in FD early model of the game, which was far more stripped down and as they alluded - was to push players around the map, through missions and small factions.

That’s when they stated they got it wrong…

From that point in time FD began to change the game, making it easier and more about grind, because they were following player behaviour…

Originally this game was built for FD by FD to be their game, it was wonderfully idiosyncratic, but I suspect the need for market stability and catering to the mob, changed that, so such processes got nerfed…

I think such mechanisms are probably archeological…
