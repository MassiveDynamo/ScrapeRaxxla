Mmm, the general thinking seems to be the book is a nod to MB’s SunDragon book. Haven’t read it it, got diverted & didn’t buy it. Anyone comment? Any hints?
Think Simulacrae said something about it a few posts ago. It’s been a long day!
Well I dont think there are any real hints in the sundragon book... I do see some possible connections to the Tau Ceti Expedition... could also be why he wrote it as an open blog. And ya - It references a rogue planet originating from the LMC as the source of the sun dragons.
