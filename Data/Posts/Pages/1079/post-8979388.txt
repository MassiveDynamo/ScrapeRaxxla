Tl;Dr please?
Sure,

he/she tries to correlate some of the meanings of the TDW toast and a occultist book called Liber AL vel Legis

Burn upon their brows - "In complex, sort of occultist terms, that passage is referring to the world serpent of illumination that allows the magical initiate to perceive and understand the otherwise imperceptible." As he/she refers to the call to arms, and describe Salome's last words of opening of the eyes of the pilots from the corruption of the Club.

Yet that star is the Mother of galaxies - "The entirety of this book is one long summary in how to birth a cosmic ship to traverse galaxies." Basically describing that Raxxla is a Rift to the other galaxies like Andromeda. The person still mentions that he/she believe Raxxla is a Gateway.

Note: These are the more interesting highlights of the post, the rest kind of goes deep into The Dark Wheel and the "Turning of the Wheels" and it's correlation to the the Libra Book. Personally based on the description of " Yet that star is the Mother of Galaxies" I can based the fact the description would make Raxxla no a Gateway but a giant ship. Again which could create the idea why it's so hard to find in the first place a ship ain't going to stay in one system for long if it's still active but it will be programmed to be at a certain system for a certain amount of time. A bridge to far distance stars that no one can reach.
