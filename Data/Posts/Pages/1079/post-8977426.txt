Yeah ‘twin vipers’. Just checked, shame they weren’t ‘dragons’ or even ‘python’, always thought it a long shot and too obvious, but you never know, always worth a look, like how the book does make a point of a children’s book:

“I had no form of entertainment except for a book, a single book about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon. My father must have bought it on the black market. He couldn’t have got it from anywhere else.“I still have that book.”

Who knows maybe this is the book references in the codex! Any references to dragons at Freeholm in game or a black market in books!?

Mmm, the general thinking seems to be the book is a nod to MB’s SunDragon book. Haven’t read it it, got diverted & didn’t buy it. Anyone comment? Any hints?
Think Simulacrae said something about it a few posts ago. It’s been a long day!
