Thanks again Allen, that was interesting! I think FD missed a trick in not having a livestream about the novels, the process that was applied etc. It would have been an interesting insight into the game development. Or perhaps there was one that I missed.

No, I don't think Raxxla is connected to any of the fiction in any way, just that MB said “We did look at a story involving Raxxla, but felt that was a story that should be played out in game rather than as a novel.” So, there ought to be a storyline about Raxxla in-game, but as far as I can see the only thing in-game is the codex entry, a start point which doesn't lead anywhere; though actually, it is so ambiguous it can be interpreted as clues that lead almost everywhere! No storyline is evident! Which is why this thread is so long, with no end in sight...

Yes, I’m glad FD avoided the “Skywalker story”. I watched Star Wars VIII again last night....but only because there was nothing else on!

: I think we’re all convinced Raxxla is “currently accessible”, otherwise we wouldn't be participating in this thread! The doubt is is it, is it, & will we recognise it if we find it since we don’t know what it is...I’m assuming that once we find the “omphalos” then it will trigger a “hyperspace” transition to a secret system downloaded from the FD server that will be so obvious we’ve found Raxxla...I think my current hypothesis makes sense of all the clues, but with no specific location information so it leads to lots of possibilities that need to be checked, with even more testing since omphalos/Raxxla could be concealed as a “comet“. And my wrist is hurting!!

Edit: though I could be completely wrong, it wouldn’t be the first time!
P.S. thought this morning I’d found the planet hiding behind a blue cloud from the codex exploration page...turned out to be the Jellyfish Nebula seen through the local dust!
