Codex Fun;

Ok lets start with the Children's story of Princess Astrophel and the Spiraling Stars

Just looking at Elite Dangerous material... We have the return of a Classic Children's Show in Galnet.... The Andromedaries... a story about Camels in Space. I like to think its referring to the Andromeda constellation. - Andromeda also had a Camel at one point.

The Andromeda Myth - can be considered an archetype of the Damsel in Distress - or Princess and Dragon story.... which leads us to Michael Brookes story "Legacy" which I think just earlier in this thread it was mentioned that it had been expected to cover "Raxxla content" - what if it did?

There is a section in Legacy about a child and her book - "" (Im just ignoring the Sun Dragon book by Brookes to avoid that rabbit hole)

Currently we have Stargoids racing towards the bubble... Spiraling stars? and then there is Seo Jin-ae (Project Seraphs D-2) I half expected her to be the Far Gods new First Apostle... Imperial Accent ? Maybe she is a princess - we should tie her to a rock and feed her to the stargoids.... Just a thought.

Seo Jin-ae (Project Seraphs D-2).

Sep Jin-ae is a good fit. The name is of Korean origin, meaning truth, treasure and love. A Seraph is an angelic being.

Thargoids, have been described as female, potentially like bees so very likely there then ought to be a Queen, and it’s suspected they have a hive mind.

If Sep Jin-ae can control Thargoids then technically she can be called a Princess, and those goid stars, well they are spirals.

But how is her story related to a child’s story?
