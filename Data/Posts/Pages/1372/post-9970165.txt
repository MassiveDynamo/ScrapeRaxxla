That raises a point for discussion. If anyone found Raxxla should they disclose
a) that it has been found? &/or
b) its location? &/or
c) its nature?

I hasten to say that I haven’t found it...but so many people seem to be getting such a great deal of enjoyment in searching for it that I did wonder whether it would be fair to terminate that quest? I don't think we’ve ever discussed this point in this thread!
