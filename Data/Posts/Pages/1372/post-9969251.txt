Not what happened.

The Formidine Rift was Drew's idea. The original concept was to have it extend from one sector to another, with it widening (I believe). Lave Revolution was nearly finished and I think I put the reference in as one of the last tweaks to link it to the concept, which at the time, I thought was pretty cool.

I don't think it ever got mentioned in the guide material at all.

Any development of the rift as an in game concept came after that.

In many respects, there were ways in which fiction author(s) wanted Raxxla to be part of their particular vision. Similar with the location of the Thargoid homeworld, etc. Up until the point I stopped working on anything, there had (AFAIK) been no conversations about linking Raxxla to any specific authorised fiction.

There was an assumption that Michael Brookes' book as a 'spiritual successor to the Dark Wheel' would cover Raxxla content. When it didn't, I think some individuals saw an opportunity for their own work.

Reading the documentation that emerged after this, I'd say they indicate that Frontier's position didn't change with one of their 'crown jewels' despite attempts to publicly hint that it was connected with the Rift and/or other ideas introduced by official authors.

Ah, I stand corrected, thanks Allen!
But that’s also interesting. I had assumed the authors were independently working off the FD lore bible, but this means they were, though perhaps to a limited extent, cross-pollinating ideas?

Yes, it’s strange that the “Raxxla storyline” that MB mentioned, after failing to appear in his book, has also apparently failed to appear in-game. Unless I’ve missed something? I wouldnt say the Codex entry counts as a storyline; I consider it as an initial clue, but a storyline would require further clues, and they seem to be notable by their absence.
