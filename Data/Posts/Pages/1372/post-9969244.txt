The existence of supposedly hidden stars is not new, this likely is the same iteration attributed to ‘duplicated’ stars, caused by a secondary database overlapping another, then FD, for some unknown reason, hiding that duplication rather than deleting it; possibly because said issue is too numerous.

Said ‘bug’ is well documented and not IMPO an intended game feature; these stars cannot be visited nor seen mores the pity, another missed opportunity.

This particular naming brings up some interesting thoughts, in that it widens the probability of their use, in that it’s an historical afterthought which just shows an early footprint development of the galmap, likely it was too erroneous to delete.

I’m presuming it’s not relevant, unless said body could be visited, that would change everything.
