Ah, I stand corrected, thanks Allen!
But that’s also interesting. I had assumed the authors were independently working off the FD lore bible, but this means they were, though perhaps to a limited extent, cross-pollinating ideas?

Yes, it’s strange that the “Raxxla storyline” that MB mentioned, after failing to appear in his book, has also apparently failed to appear in-game. Unless I’ve missed something? I wouldnt say the Codex entry counts as a storyline; I consider it as an initial clue, but a storyline would require further clues, and they seem to be notable by their absence.
I would go further to presume historically the now removed (or rather archived) Dark Wheel missions were the said story conclusion proposed by MB, or at least the most ‘obvious’ link towards that journey.

It’s apparent something changed and it was put aside, doesn’t mean Raxxla itself was likewise archived (!) only the supposed narrative journey. IMPO it either was an Easter egg for early Elites or Founders; if it’s a key narrative element, like the Mars relic (which we know is narratively locked) then it too is narratively locked and part of something bigger.

I presume that the codex acts as a narrative alibi, retro-fitting historical lore whilst giving FD a new open chapter. However it’s inclusion and relative obfuscation lends a counter suspicion it’s an indication that ‘something’ is certainly in game, unless it’s simply foreshadowing.

The question remains: is Raxxla ‘currently accessible’.
