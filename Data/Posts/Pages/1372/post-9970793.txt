Codex Fun;

Ok lets start with the Children's story of Princess Astrophel and the Spiraling Stars

Just looking at Elite Dangerous material... We have the return of a Classic Children's Show in Galnet.... The Andromedaries... a story about Camels in Space. I like to think its referring to the Andromeda constellation. - Andromeda also had a Camel at one point.

The Andromeda Myth - can be considered an archetype of the Damsel in Distress - or Princess and Dragon story.... which leads us to Michael Brookes story "Legacy" which I think just earlier in this thread it was mentioned that it had been expected to cover "Raxxla content" - what if it did?

There is a section in Legacy about a child and her book - "" (Im just ignoring the Sun Dragon book by Brookes to avoid that rabbit hole)

Currently we have Stargoids racing towards the bubble... Spiraling stars? and then there is Seo Jin-ae (Project Seraphs D-2) I half expected her to be the Far Gods new First Apostle... Imperial Accent ? Maybe she is a princess - we should tie her to a rock and feed her to the stargoids.... Just a thought.

Well, it’s an interesting thought that there perhaps is a Raxxla-related storyline but it’s been going on in the background. I usually view that type of galnet item as pure filler, but maybe there’s something more to it....

And well done! Top marks for esoteric knowledge! I never heard of a camel constellation before. Every google search goes straight to Camelopardalis, the giraffe!
