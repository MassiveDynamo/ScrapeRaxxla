The existence of supposedly hidden stars is not new, this likely is the same iteration attributed to ‘duplicated’ stars, caused by a secondary database overlapping another, then FD, for some unknown reason, hiding that duplication rather than deleting it; possibly because said issue is too numerous.

Said ‘bug’ is well documented and not an intended game feature; these stars cannot be visited nor seen mores the pity, another missed opportunity.

This particular naming brings up some interesting thoughts, in that it widens the probability of their use, other than some bug, however I would still side with it being a bug, or more likely an historical afterthought which just shows an early footprint development of the galmap, likely it was too erroneous to delete.

I’m presuming it’s not relevant, unless said body could be visited, that would change everything.

And “duplicated systems” exist other than from the use of multiple astronomical databases containing different location data for stars. As I said the other day, a few years ago I found two systems out in IC 1805 with the same name but totally different astronomical body contents....come to think of it I ought to check my records, but I think the stars were of different types.

Yesterday, while working on my current Raxxla hypothesis I came across another instance of duplication not too far away. Got my hopes up briefly, but wasnt an inter-system gateway though!
