Well personally if I ever was so fortunate, it really depends on what it would resolve.

But ultimately I would aim not to advertise its location, but certainly only to verify it. So that Cmdrs at least knew it was discoverable, and could enjoy the journey for themselves.

Say if, it sent you to the Magellanic Clouds, I would ask some of you fine Cmdrs to friend request at a given time, then ask of you to view my location in the Galaxy map and post it, wouldn’t give the game away.

I certainly would first reach out to FD and ask them for verification, and post that, I’d like it to be in Gal news but doubt that would ever occur.

Obviously it wouldn’t take Cmdrs long to retrace the steps as my hypothesis would have been previously shared here, so depending upon what it resolved, I might look to redact all my historical hypothesis (!) then weave a new narrative to give the search some additional life…
