Codex Fun;

Ok lets start with the Children's story of Princess Astrophel and the Spiraling Stars

Just looking at Elite Dangerous material... We have the return of a Classic Children's Show in Galnet.... The Andromedaries... a story about Camels in Space. I like to think its referring to the Andromeda constellation. - Andromeda also had a Camel at one point.

The Andromeda Myth - can be considered an archetype of the Damsel in Distress - or Princess and Dragon story.... which leads us to Michael Brookes story "Legacy" which I think just earlier in this thread it was mentioned that it had been expected to cover "Raxxla content" - what if it did?

There is a section in Legacy about a child and her book - "I had no form of entertainment except for a book, a single book about a young man's quest to save a princess from an alien dragon." (Im just ignoring the Sun Dragon book by Brookes to avoid that rabbit hole)

Currently we have Stargoids racing towards the bubble... Spiraling stars? and then there is Seo Jin-ae (Project Seraphs D-2) I half expected her to be the Far Gods new First Apostle... Imperial Accent ? Maybe she is a princess - we should tie her to a rock and feed her to the stargoids.... Just a thought.
