Does Raxxla exist?
[...]what a silly question, of course. You don't know what it is though.

So we all seem to "know" (from the books) it's a planet, now DB says that in fact we don't know what it is? Have we been looking for the wrong... thing? Well of course we could be looking for a Station on another spaceborn building, but what if it is something completely different? Man we should stop asking questions about Raxxla, every answer makes it more difficult to assess.
