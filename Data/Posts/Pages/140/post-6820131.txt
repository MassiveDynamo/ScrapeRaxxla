don’t forget MB’s ‘location needs to be a little bit obvious” (or words to that effect)

Yep, not exactly 'location' but a tiny thread people can pull so they know what they are doing.
Easy to deduce what the 'tiny part a little bit obvious' MB was referring to. The thing is, both left ED since. And nobody no longer knows what he is doing. Imho.

So we all seem to "know" (from the books) it's a planet, now DB says that in fact we don't know what it is? Have we been looking for the wrong... thing? Well of course we could be looking for a Station on another spaceborn building, but what if it is something completely different? Man we should stop asking questions about Raxxla, every answer makes it more difficult to assess.

Already stated Raxxla is not really "a planet" in Oolite. Already confirmed it's a "celestial body" in ED.
* so much missing DW in ED....*

You don't know what it is though.

Geez...if it turns out to be something as 'exciting' as the Zurara, well... I wouldn't be surprised.
