While you are all busy creating new rumors for future commanders to consider as Facts, here have some real Facts

I've visited the last ra XX-L a Systems not scanned by rOmiLaYu:

Hypi Bra XX-L a21-0
Hypi Bra XX-L a117-0
Hypao Bra XX-L a76-0

Weird Thing, for first and last system EDSM has recorded the bodies scanned, but didn't credit first discovery to me (in fact, like "noone" travelled through those Systems...)

Now I decided to go and scan the other Systems rOmiLaYu scanned, just in case the "journey everyone has to travel for themselves" is the journey through all the Raxxla Systems and you get the Polaris Permit upon completion of that journey (improbable, but would fit into FD's grind scheme).

Then I will visit Sag A* and come back to the bubble. All upcoming 3.2 bug will hopefully be resolved or "temporary removed" until I get home
