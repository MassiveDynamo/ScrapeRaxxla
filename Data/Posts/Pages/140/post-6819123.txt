I'm done trying to fight it, so...

David Braben came to my apartment last night, with pizza (ham and pineapple) and told me...

1. Seven Cmdrs have scanned Raxxla, but you only get notified if you sell the data to the Dark Wheel who give you a permit for the Bovomit sector so you can uncover the real Rift mystery. One Cmdr made it to Shin but he got ganked and lost the data.

2. Harry Potter discovered Raxxla in 2016, but FDev wanted to keep it secret until atmospheric landings were ready, so they rigged the Salome event for him instead, to keep him quiet.


Feel free to add your own versions- whoever gets quoted as 'fact' in the future wins

I was having breakfast in bed with the POTUS when I saw the hidden camera footage on Fox News...so it must be true.

Braben went on to say that the secret is in the 'all seeing eye'. "We only have to look within ourselves to find Raxxla, this is the journey we all must take."

It turns out that Harry Potter is a major Autonomic Sensory Sensitive. He new where it was instinctively.
