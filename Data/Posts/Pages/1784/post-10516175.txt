Can you give any other examples where Frontier Developments have outright lied to the community?

They have said since Kickstarter that Raxxla would be in the game and have content behind it.

It's that there are not enough people looking.
Did they? The only couple of quotes I saw from them didn't really convince me, cryptic replies and in Braben's case he was almost upset by the question and seemed to just want to dismiss it, as if it he was uncfortable discussing it. As for lying to the community there's plenty of examples I could give you, but am too lazy to look and make a list. Consoles on Odyssey rings a bell? They outright lied about that, amongst many other things, many more if you include Braben's statements during the crowd funding.

Do you really believe that the reason noone found Raxxla in 10 years is because of lack of trying? Have you read this thread and many others about Raxxla and all the mass projects organized to search for it? There was plenty of people and effort put into this over the years. And really bright minds tried all sort of puzzle solving and found ZERO Raxxla content in the game, apart from the Codex article. If this is the case and we just need to brute force it I would be very disappointed.

But don't let this keep you from searching, just make sure you keep your expectations at bay.
