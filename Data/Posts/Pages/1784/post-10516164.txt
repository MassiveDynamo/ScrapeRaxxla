I personally think it would more likely for TDW to be ingame than Raxxla. In fact I don't believe Raxxla is in the game or has ever been, at all. Would be very hard for FDev to make Raxxla a reality (at least one that everyone would like), while making a secret society for you to join and look around for mysteries (including tips for Raxxla) would be more plausible. In fact at some point I was almost certain TDW had to be in the game and we were meant to get invited, go take a tour on that hidden station and then be given some leads on Raxxla or other mysteries for you to follow and investigate. Basically an explorer's endgame, even if we never actually found Raxxla.

It was my hope that with space legs being added in Odyssey that we would finally be able to walk around the TDW station, perhaps FDev was waiting in space legs to introduce TDW in the game? But no, that didn't happen unfortunately.
Can you give any other examples where Frontier Developments have outright lied to the community?

They have said since Kickstarter that Raxxla would be in the game and have content behind it.

It's that there are not enough people looking.
