My reading of that is that the Comet is shown as the Body you are closed to because that is true. None of the stations would count as a body and there's only 2 other ones in the system. The mythical Pareco Comet 1, and the main star.

Out of interest if you were to fly outside of a body's sphere of influence in another system and then drop into Supercruise, does the journal pick the nearest body?

Unfortunately our data gathering at the time seems to have been very lax. I didn't even think about anything beyond it being cool until the thread was necro'd to mention Raxxla a few years ago. One small thing to note is that if you look through the replies to the original thread you'll see Martin's post has this image, which shows the distance they were from the stations.

I tryed in Odysee again, and missed it got in Shipping lane but not in Comet 2 SOI game says SOI is Main Star and that is not the 12kls away. You don't get in SOI of Closest Body SOIs have a defined range whit the Main Star covering âˆž range. Comets had 50km SOI. and as per Journal i was in its SOI but for some reasson it is no longert Shown in Hud as Pareco Comet 2. FDEV really does not want us to mess whit Comets
