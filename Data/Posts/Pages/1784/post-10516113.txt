However while I personally believe Raxxla is hidden within the game, I'm not convinced TDW is anything other than narrative fluff (but I remain open to the possibility I could be wrong on this!), FD have never confirmed its existence, whereas both DB and MB did so for Raxxla.
I personally think it would more likely for TDW to be ingame than Raxxla. In fact I don't believe Raxxla is in the game or has ever been, at all. Would be very hard for FDev to make Raxxla a reality (at least one that everyone would like), while making a secret society for you to join and look around for mysteries (including tips for Raxxla) would be more plausible. In fact at some point I was almost certain TDW had to be in the game and we were meant to get invited, go take a tour on that hidden station and then be given some leads on Raxxla or other mysteries for you to follow and investigate. Basically an explorer's endgame, even if we never actually found Raxxla.

It was my hope that with space legs being added in Odyssey that we would finally be able to walk around the TDW station, perhaps FDev was waiting in space legs to introduce TDW in the game? But no, that didn't happen unfortunately.
