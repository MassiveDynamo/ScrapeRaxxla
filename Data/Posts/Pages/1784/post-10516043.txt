My reading of that is that the Comet is shown as the Body you are closed to because that is true. None of the stations would count as a body and there's only 2 other ones in the system. The mythical Pareco Comet 1, and the main star.

Out of interest if you were to fly outside of a body's sphere of influence in another system and then drop into Supercruise, does the journal pick the nearest body?

Unfortunately our data gathering at the time seems to have been very lax. I didn't even think about anything beyond it being cool until the thread was necro'd to mention Raxxla a few years ago. One small thing to note is that if you look through the replies to the original thread you'll see Martin's post has this image, which shows the distance they were from the stations.

It's not mythical, just invisible. It definitely exists as I dropped out at both Pareco comets when the galmap overflow method worked. I investigated a dozen or so systems and dropped out at all their comets, until I was reprimanded and the method was nerfed.

Mm, while the 6 stations highlight the existence of one comet, I wonder if the other one carries a secret? It would be extremely difficult to find without a location track to target as IIRC it's well separated from anything else in-system. But then there would have to be some other method of detecting their existence to be aware there was something else to look for...gravity wells????
