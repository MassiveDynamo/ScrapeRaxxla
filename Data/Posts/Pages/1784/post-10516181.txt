That's your issue with all due respect
Not just mine, plenty of people including Cannon Research have the same opinion, but obviously is just an opinion in the end, just as valid as yours. If you take Braben's words to the letter and really think Raxxla is in the game and can be found, then it's your prerogative. I really hope someone finds it.
