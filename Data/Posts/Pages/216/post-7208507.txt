Hmm, has "Shadow Chasers" any additional meaning in the English language apart from meaning literally "people who changes after shadows"? Sounds a little bit dull to me. For me "Formadine Rifters" or "Rifters" would be fine. After all, that's how this unorganized, loose bunch of independent commanders formed in the first place.

Well, chasing shadows certainly implies you are looking for something that might not exist.
