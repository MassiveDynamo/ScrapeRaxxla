Any list of non-real world nebula / dark regions in game?

Anyone seen nebula / dark regions not in galaxy map, but that do appear in sky box?

If I had the choice I'd place Raxxla in plain site, you can plot a course but it wont appear on the map until its discovered, lore maybe literal - obscured within a small of very ethereal dark region / possibly disk / wheel or spoke shaped; would fit the codex logo.

Dr Kaii published a list of RL nebulae in-game, two separate tables for within/outside bubble https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-List-of-(real)-Nebulae-and-Galaxies-in-Elite

Donâ€˜t know if the Galactic Mapping Project have a list of the procedural nebulae, never come across one & would be interested...
