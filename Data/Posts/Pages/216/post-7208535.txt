Hmm, has "Shadow Chasers" any additional meaning in the English language apart from meaning literally "people who changes after shadows"? Sounds a little bit dull to me. For me "Formadine Rifters" or "Rifters" would be fine. After all, that's how this unorganized, loose bunch of independent commanders formed in the first place.

I did suggest FRifters as a shortened version for that very reason, but it didn’t gather much support.

Nor did Questers, which is appropriate to the current thread & search for Raxxla, but also carries a hint of futile tilting at windmills/slaying of dragons/searching for things which may not be there/hunting without sufficient clues; that didn’t get any support either. Shadow Chasers has a hint of the same meaning- hunting for things which may not exist with insufficient clues etc; three of us like that. Seems like apathy rules, probably why we haven’t found Raxxla yet!
