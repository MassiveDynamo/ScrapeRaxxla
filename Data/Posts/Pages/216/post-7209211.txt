2 choices:

Ghost in the Machine, or

Meme.

The first is an Isaac Asimov reference, the second is William Gibson.

Personally, having read every word from the cyberpunk era I would go with Meme. Its right on so many levels. You have to think clones, misinformation, controlling families / dynastic, Yakuza, Government, Media and cerebral implant.

Now where is my emergency roll of bacofoil?
