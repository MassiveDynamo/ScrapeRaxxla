i've been doing missions for the Dark Wheel and have been bombarded with messages stating "...The Dark Wheel has a secondary contract available for you..." but i don't see anything on the mission board that appears to be a secondary contract, honestly not sure what i'm supposed to be looking for here but wondering if this aspect is restricted on Mac (no horizons)? can anyone shed light on this?
