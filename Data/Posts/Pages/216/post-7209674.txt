Yea, I was wondering why "shadow chasers" gets so "much" support and "FRifters" not, that's why I asked. I think the name is not a big deal, if something better comes up its possible to delete the old squadron and create a new one.

Well since I liked both I’m counted twice, so not much of a landslide for Shadow Chasers!

Doesn’t it cost 1000 Cr to form a squadron? Does the originator get reimbursed if the squadron is deleted later? Or is this another “Club” funding scheme?

Which gives me pause for thought, how about “Club” as a squadron name? It would have to be differentiated from the bad guys, so
Shadow Club
Quester’s Club
Explorer’s Club
Seeker’s Club
Sherlocks Club
