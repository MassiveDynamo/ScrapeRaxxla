In beta, last night, I couldn't find nav beacon in Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7. Perhaps I was too tired to notice. Orcus Crag is interesting name on a few levels. It had a short-lived, thematically interesting, community goal. Have you read your Dark Wheel carefully? Orcus itself relates to some underworld themed mythology, which by itself is not too rare.

Apparently, Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 is going to be called Delphi.

Merope 5 C is a navel of sorts.
