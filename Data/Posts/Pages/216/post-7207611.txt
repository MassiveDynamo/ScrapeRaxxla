Replies to several issues:

1. Shadow Chasers is fine by me.

2. If we want a more reclusive name I'd again suggest Widows Sons as in Freemasons, because chasing secrets (though of the inner self) is exactly what they are doing. Alternatively I'd suggest "Eleusis" as in Elysian Mysteries or the good old Arcanum from Vampire: The Masquerade.

3. The idea of an online data referrence where theories can be placed and results be posted is quite neat. As I play on PS4 I cannot install addons that collect data so I have to handcheck everything. An example could be for my avalonian theory: Avalon, Place that is no place / checked by commander XY / No results / Date.

4. Btw.: Yes I went to Avalon and did a bit of scanning with no result. I then decided to postpone my search till the Q4 update.
