To be honest, for a name I would personally much prefer something which is not a direct statement of what the group’s about and at most only vaguely alludes to it.

I do think that Shadow Chasers is a good description of what the group does though.

Being able to respond to a question of what the group does with “We’re shadow chasers” would be very good.

A few thoughts on the more allusive name front:

- The Avalonians
- The Shades of Avalonia
- The Delphic Eclipse

Or, for something which would need a bit more working out,

- The Blaze of Levith

Which is a distorted over time version of the original, which itself is pretty obscure and allusory. Which I was going to explain, but... is anyone feeling in need of trying to work out something obscure and cryptic?
