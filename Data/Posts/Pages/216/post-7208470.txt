Hmm, has "Shadow Chasers" any additional meaning in the English language apart from meaning literally "people who changes after shadows"? Sounds a little bit dull to me. For me "Formadine Rifters" or "Rifters" would be fine. After all, that's how this unorganized, loose bunch of independent commanders formed in the first place.
