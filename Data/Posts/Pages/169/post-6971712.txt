They'll be releasing Raxxla as a paid 'cosmetic' item in the Frontier store. No word yet on whether or not it will be free for Kickstarter backers or Lifetime Expansion Pass holders though ...
They already have. You can spell it out on your dashboard, in any colour you like. It's a personal journey though, everyone has to pay for it themselves at the store.
