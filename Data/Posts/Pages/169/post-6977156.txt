CMDR Flirbe Rasok may have found a penguin in space, not sure if it's our penguin, tho.

Ahh yes, that's one of mine.

Don't look behind the last icy planet though - that's where I dump the bodies.

So, assuming that someone manages to find this thing, what do you guys think happens afterwards? I understand that we'll probably not get anything of noteworthiness, but i think it'd be nice if, for instance, we'd get a mesage stating that we have the option to skip some massive grind, (rank, engineer, etc.) in exchange for selling the planet's data to the Dark Wheel (through this same message) instead of to universal cartographics.
