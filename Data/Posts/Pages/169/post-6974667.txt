I've spent hours searching for that spot in Sirius. I still haven't found it.

My wife isn't surprised. [where is it]

could a hidden comet account for the odd orbital behaviour in Sirius?
How does one go about finding a comet? (I presume its orbit isn’t marked)
Why do the stations in Pareco orbit that comet so closely? Isn’t this breaking Newtons law of gravity?
