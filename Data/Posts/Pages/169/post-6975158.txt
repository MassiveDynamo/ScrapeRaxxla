Another odd thing about Lucifer's orbit is that it is specifically called out in the Gazetteer. It seems odd that Frontier would botch the job implementing a planet's orbit that had been so clearly described in the accompanying media from Frontier: Elite II.

In Fe:2 and FFE Lucifer has an orbit period of 99 hours. This is very close to what it should have(according to Kepler) and matches the 4.9 days rotational period.

In ED the orbital period is 99 days. This looks like an error in translating the data from the old games.

It's not a typo in the system info though. Lucifer uses 99 days to orbit Sirius B.
