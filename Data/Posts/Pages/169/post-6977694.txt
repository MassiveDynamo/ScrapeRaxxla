So, assuming that someone manages to find this thing, what do you guys think happens afterwards? I understand that we'll probably not get anything of noteworthiness, but i think it'd be nice if, for instance, we'd get a mesage stating that we have the option to skip some massive grind, (rank, engineer, etc.) in exchange for selling the planet's data to the Dark Wheel (through this same message) instead of to universal cartographics.

FD game designers appear to have an unhealthy fixation on Random number generation, and confuse grind with rewarding gameplay, so that is highly unlikley.

since there is only one galaxy implemented in ED then Raxxla cannot hold ”alien construct that’s a gateway to other Universes, and all that’s in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life.” So I suspect it may hold a means to unlock some currently permit-locked area of this galaxy.
