Well you know there is this permit locked bubble in the Dryman. It's been like that for a while. I hear it's very mysterious area. Definitely worth going a little bit crazy about.
I'm crazy about "phenomenas"...1 more system with 2 again!! What the chances? Did 5 jumps using NS. 1st and 4th had phenomenas....what's going on? Did they changed something in last path and now all stars have it ?
