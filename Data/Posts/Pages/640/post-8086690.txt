Yea, I was wondering about those. Did anyone ever go over those thoroughly?


What is odd is that the earlier pictures make it look like it is between 12 and 22 then 6 and 10 and finally Sag A... then he says 22 and 23 which is the same type of L shape boarder. Unless the angle makes it look like it's above a farther back area this info is seemingly conflicting. I guess those could be out of order as it goes in that direction somewhat. NVM, that is what he was trying to clarify. Has anyone been there yet to look? A brown dwarf sector seperated by an empty void at the top of the galaxy at around 2500ly up? Doesn't seem to hard to find on the map. I would think people would have been there before. Sounds like a likely exploration area. Is this a known area in real life?

I think he meant this: PRA BYOEA KU-A A82-0 (scroll around this system)
....I was going to go there, but just recall swtor 6 is coming next week, will need time there too >:
