Had a thought about how we might eventually find Raxxla in the game...

We're currently flying around in what basically amounts to a building site, with most of the 'finishing touches' missing so, how do we know FDev won't one day add in a completely scripted and voice acted story line to go with the SOLO aspect of the game that includes content around the Tionisla graveyard?

That's where the main thrust of "The Dark Wheel" started, and it would be an awesome place to explore once we have access to space legs and EVA. While we might be able to visit the graveyard prior to being Elite we might not get a tip off about a specific vessel to go and search for clues until leveling up?

Could be an interesting precursor to starting a TDW membership path...
