I'm crazy about "phenomenas"...1 more system with 2 again!! What the chances? Did 5 jumps using NS. 1st and 4th had phenomenas....what's going on? Did they changed something in last path and now all stars have it ?
I think FD have seeded a bunch of spots around the galaxy. Sort of like the the Brain tree sector, in Guardian space. If you go about exploring all the close systems with phenomena, they probably form a bubble. Just like the UA bubble around Merope.

That seem to be the mechanic FD use for this kind of stuff.
