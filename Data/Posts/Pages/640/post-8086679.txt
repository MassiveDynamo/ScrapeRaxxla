Ya i parked myself at one of them the other night. Probably worth studying more. I sat around and stared at the rolling rochard inkblots for a bit. Mapping them might be fun.... Barcodes? hmmm dont know about them.
Yea, I was wondering about those. Did anyone ever go over those thoroughly?

He has deleted most of the screenshots on his instagram profile, but I have saved most of them. It just sounds too tempting to not find out for yourself...
I'll get on my way soon and find out if it's true or not

What is odd is that the earlier pictures make it look like it is between 12 and 22 then 6 and 10 and finally Sag A... then he says 22 and 23 which is the same type of L shape boarder. Unless the angle makes it look like it's above a farther back area this info is seemingly conflicting. I guess those could be out of order as it goes in that direction somewhat. NVM, that is what he was trying to clarify. Has anyone been there yet to look? A brown dwarf sector seperated by an empty void at the top of the galaxy at around 2500ly up? Doesn't seem to hard to find on the map. I would think people would have been there before. Sounds like a likely exploration area. Is this a known area in real life?
