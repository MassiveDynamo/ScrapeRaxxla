I think he meant this: PRA BYOEA KU-A A82-0 (scroll around this system)
....I was going to go there, but just recall swtor 6 is coming next week, will need time there too >:
yes I also thought this must be the brown dwarf cluster, but it is more than 41k ly away from the bubble... and he said it is only reachable from the top of the galaxy.
and on the 1 screenshot/video, he point on a region which is newton's vault, but strangly here the distance of 41k ly fit... xD
