Tinfoil hat? The Sagitta Constellation is located between the Cygnus and Aquila. There are two stars in the back side. Right [Arrow] star and Left [Arrow] star. RA and LA. No, it is not right... Ok... Parts of Aquila and Sagitta constellations are named as Right flag and Left flag in the Chinese astronomy. Not right again... So maybe it is The Great [Dark] rift that located in same region? Rift? Almost between two birds? No. I should go sleep again.
