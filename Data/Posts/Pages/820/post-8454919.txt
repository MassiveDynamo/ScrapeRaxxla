We could make some list, like 10 systems? Then start to dump there carriers until next one gets message "cannot go there", so system is full. Now compare how many signals FSS shows to max amount. If system has 1 signal not shown, then it is something hidden there from FSS.
Cant we do that without fleet carriers?
