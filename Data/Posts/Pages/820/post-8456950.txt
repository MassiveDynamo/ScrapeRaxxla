Hmm ...new discovery
https://www.edsm.net/en/system/bodies/id/16814302/name/HR+6819
This was known as double star till lately. Now we know it has blackhole there too. Whom to write to fix star system?

Btw, in beta funny things happen - people cannot catch up carriers - not enough of speed. I think because systems are heavy populated, carriers are on very low orbits where speed is big
Also scanning details:
once carrier arrives orbit you can see (1) human signal on map, AND (N) geological signals or whatever planet has even if u didn't DSS it yet. To be able to target need to do DSS.
So that could be good practice put carrier on 8th moon orbit if any. So you check for DW as well.
