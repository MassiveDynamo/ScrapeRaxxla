Ah right, I wondered if HexCube was just a secondary alias for you.
I'll have to find a way of contacting FDev that isn't just a generic support ticket, as I don't really want to waste their time.


The tesseract idea is interesting. I've remade your diagram and tilted it 30 degrees to make it easier to see the layers.

A quick thought on this, which is super tinfoil:
ED was released a month after the film Interstellar, in which a tesseract is entered by travelling into a black hole at a high speed
How long has this Raxxla logo been around? Could it perhaps be inspired by Interstellar?
