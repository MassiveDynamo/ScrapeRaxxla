Did DB say "Galnet" can lie or "characters can lie"? There's a difference! I thought it was the latter, but I cant find the original source...was it in an AMA?
Though for what it's worth, anything that is relevant and could plausibly be a lie is almost certainly either reported by Galnet as said by a character anyway, or reported as "reports are coming in of X in Y system" where it's the same essential issue: that Galnet is telling the literal truth doesn't matter.
