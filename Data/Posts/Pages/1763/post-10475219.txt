A quick thought on this, which is super tinfoil:
ED was released a month after the film Interstellar, in which a tesseract is entered by travelling into a black hole at a high speed
How long has this Raxxla logo been around? Could it perhaps be inspired by Interstellar?
The closest Black hole that would be a candidate is 27 Gamma Cassiopeia. I am not sure how you can jump from there to Sol though (without a neutron jump, which wasn't a thing for technology in the 22nd century). I also can't remember when they added black holes to the game, I dont think they were available on release.
