Ah, but the question to my mind is how much the codex can be trusted. Lyta Crane is an in-game codex character that hasnt IIRC been quoted/mentioned in Galnet.
I think largely the same as Galnet:

- there's no reason to doubt that Lyta Crane exists in-universe
- there's no reason to doubt that the Codex is accurately summarising the key points of one of her theories
- it is entirely possible that she's either lying or mistaken about that theory (though in this particular case it would be both narratively and puzzle-setting [1] odd for the one piece of semi-specific information given by the whole Codex entry to be wrong ... "Hah, got you, it was actually around the sixth planet of a B-class star" would be a weird reveal)

[1] There's really no need to add extra red herrings to the Raxxla search when players are quite capable of making up their own at a much faster rate anyway.
