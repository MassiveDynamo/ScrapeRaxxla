It wasn't me. As you see from the letter, it was Commander HexCube that contacted FD.
I don't remember exactly, but I'm fairly certain that he posted the question on one of FD's social media accounts.
Ah right, I wondered if HexCube was just a secondary alias for you.
I'll have to find a way of contacting FDev that isn't just a generic support ticket, as I don't really want to waste their time.

Some folks have messaged me about the "3d cube in side a 3d cube" and are having a hard time seeing it. Here is my crappy add:

View attachment 407391

dotted dark blue: the faces of the 3d cube closest to us

light blue dotted: The faces of the inner 3d cube furthest from us

Purple: The major faces of the outer 3d cube


It forms arrows that basically says "The Sun" . Raxxla only appears in 3 of the arrows here.

The tesseract idea is interesting. I've remade your diagram and tilted it 30 degrees to make it easier to see the layers.
