Though for what it's worth, anything that is relevant and could plausibly be a lie is almost certainly either reported by Galnet as said by a character anyway, or reported as "reports are coming in of X in Y system" where it's the same essential issue: that Galnet is telling the literal truth doesn't matter.

I suspect the issue around the sentiment was that in Galnet characters use falsehoods to promote a particular narrative. Not that ‘data’ is inherently and commonly false.

Eg FD have a narrative crossroads, they give us a couple of choices through a community goal (that’s they’re purpose), but FD heavily leans on a particular narrative thread focussed upon war or the development of weapons or faster drives etc, to push certain content over other content?
