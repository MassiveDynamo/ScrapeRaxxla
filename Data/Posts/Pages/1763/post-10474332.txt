Hey, sorry to jump backwards in this thread but how did you contact FDev in this way? I've been doing some research and I wanna try asking them if I'm actually on a path to an intended secret or if I'm just researching a dead end.
It wasn't me. As you see from the letter, it was Commander HexCube that contacted FD.
I don't remember exactly, but I'm fairly certain that he posted the question on one of FD's social media accounts.
