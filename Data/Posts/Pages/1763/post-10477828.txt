I was looking at the Raxxla logo, and both the "3d cube inside a 3d cube" and the point inside a circle may suggest (at least to me) that Raxxla may be an area at the center inside a planet. Looking at how the circle in the logo is drawn, it may be a planet with an atmosphere or a gas giant. So maybe Raxxla is really a place but, being inside a planet, that place may not be accessible, and there may be other hints or signals to verify its presence at the heart of the right planet.
