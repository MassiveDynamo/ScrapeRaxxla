It's also worth remembering that - as far as we know - the Dark Wheel never found Raxxla, so what's the point of looking for them? To get a masterclass in how to fail for a thousand years?

I've said before that I think we're the Dark Wheel as it pertains to the Raxxla hunt, or at least a major part of it. We were recruited into it by mysteriously being given a ship - something not unlike TDW novella where Rafe gives Alex a ship to get him started.

I think this is what was meant when Brookes said they'd discussed the idea that Elite Legacy was going to be a direct sequel to The Dark Wheel novella, and decided that story should be played out in-game. I think we're all basically Alex Ryders playing out variations of the general zero-to-hero plotline that's present in TDW novella - as is the obvious intention of the Novella back in 1984, and it's still true now.

TDW = dead end (at present).

Remember in the lore The Dark Wheel aren't just after Raxxla, they are a secret society of like-minded people - so anyone in the entire game could be a secret member which could be revealed at any moment without compromising anything else that's ever been presented about that person. They could easily say "Aha! Lori Jameson was always part of The Dark Wheel", or "Aha! Aden Tanner was always part of the Dark Wheel", or "AHA! Salvation was a member of the Dark Wheel", or "Aha! Meet Kelly Secretperson, she's never been mentioned before but she's a major person in the Dark wheel and she's come forward to blow the whistle!".

The Codex is simply setting up the narrative that at any time Fdev can introduce TDW in a more impactful way and people won't say "Eh, what? what's this? where did this come from?" they'll say "Oh this is part of that storyline that's been going on for years, how clever!"

By this very line of reasoning, it's pointless looking for them (we're literally told that in the Codex too).
