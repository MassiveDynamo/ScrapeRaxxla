Well that’s the issue. How much could we trust FD?

Those of us who were around during the pre-launch period, have experience of how bad FD were at communicating and promoting themselves.

Then we have the evidence that FD removed elements of narratives, without telling us certain processes were redundant.

Now it’s arguable, but FD has actively added doubt, by never being wholly affirmative and likewise always giving us enough information to advocate something is actually absent or false?

Thats infuriating because it’s not one way or the other…

Generally my suspicion is FD is just terrible at communication and this is not due to any one particular person but that FD has shifted their course over time, and very likely brought in other people, to take over certain narratives and then adding to them… or just dropping them entirely, it generally feels inconsistent. Or at least FD has allowed it to feel that way.

Personally I’m of the opinion that the codex is adding new information and it is factually accurate, but it does likewise reference historical information and affirms it is that which is redundant!

I suspect the reference in the codex of Lyta Crane is important, because she is a persistent NPC, in game I think that advocates she’s telling the truth, simply by being ‘reliable’ by inclusion, over other characters who are likely unreliable by being absent!
