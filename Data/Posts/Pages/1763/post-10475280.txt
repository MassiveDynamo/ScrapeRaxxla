I suspect the issue around the sentiment was that in Galnet characters use falsehoods to promote a particular narrative. Not that ‘data’ is inherently and commonly false.

Eg FD have a narrative crossroads, they give us a couple of choices through a community goal (that’s they’re purpose), but FD heavily leans on a particular narrative thread focussed upon war or the development of weapons or faster drives etc, to push certain Congo er other cont?
Agreed.

Salvation lied about a whole bunch of stuff, and was telling the truth but wrong about a lot more.
But there's no reason to believe that Galnet incorrectly reported "Salvation said ..."
