Well done! Did you manage to get a look at whatever was causing it??

insert the youtube link then delete the https//:
the forum will still allow its expansion but saves screen space! For examples see my FD Sources thread
FDev ED-relevant quotes/videos
Since much discussion is generated on the topic of DB said this, or MB said that, etc I posted my compilation of FDev source references on the Quest for Raxxla thread for others to use. It was suggested that it should be in its own thread for everyone to access & I’m happy to oblige. Please feel...

otherwise put it on e.g. Dropbox and post the url link here

I did not get a look unfortunately

I tried for a couple of hours last night and that was the only time I got it. Others in the Independent Raxxla Hunters were able to get it more consistently and start making guesses on locations. Interestingly they were getting it outside of the so called Sector 16 and slightly above the belt too, they tended towards the "North East" area, or 0-~75° clockwise.
