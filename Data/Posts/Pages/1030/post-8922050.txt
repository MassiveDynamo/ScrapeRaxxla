there's an update today?
wasn't expecting that. Now got to wait for EDDiscovery to finish downloads from EDSM before I can update, else EDDgets nickers in a twist & got to reload the whole database.
sigh, there goes today's "quick half hour" searching for the Veridian Pimpernel!
(it does have a ring to it! )
it says a 20 minute download for me.
