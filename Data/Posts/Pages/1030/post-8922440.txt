i would much sooner believe that green glow is a graphics artifact than something legit in the game to be discovered.

There are lots of times i leave the system map and the entire screen gets a white overlay momentarily as some shader switch artifact. Or instances when i'm in a twilight part of a ring and the roids are lit up "wrong" with shadowed parts of the roid being where they shouldn't be.

Chasing this is almost certainly just chasing "bugs" in the lighting/shader code.
