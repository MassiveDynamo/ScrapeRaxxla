In my videos (see my first post on this, https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8911441, the videos were all taken with the Phantom) youâ€™ll see varying levels of brightness, a couple were fairly weak with a hint of blue in the reflected light, but one was quite vivid which might be closer & the colour is also much greener in the vivid example.

Just a question, does this glowONLY appear when you open and then close the System Map? I believe that what I saw in your videos, that this is the only time you have recorded it happening....
Have you ever had the light appear in the cockpit WITHOUT going back and forth thru the system map?

If not, I have a sinking feeling that it a bug of some kind due to SOL being a hand crated system. Assuming the Stellar Forge'originally' created SOL as proceedural before being hand edited and crafted, Im wondering if its possible there was a Green Gas Giant or some other phenom that 'would' be generated if the Stellar Forge was creating the system, but since its been overlayed with a hand made system, we shouldnt see that color, but due to the back and forth of the map, youre getting a few moments of 'bleed thru' while it re-generates your view of the cockpit from the SF....

Idk, probably im wrong, but just a thought of consideration....

But i deff have no argument its very interesting that it can be replicated like that, consistantly....
