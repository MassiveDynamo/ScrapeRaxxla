Well, If it is not a random then it moves. Mine was in sector almost on line if you draw it through Mercury and Sol, so not that far. But I was near ~1300 ls from Sol.
Also quite interesting how this glow looks on different ships. On phantom it looks more bright.

Yes, it might move. If it is the Omphalos Rift and it is an alien artefact (as per the Codex) then it should have mass and hence orbit Sol if it’s following the rules. But that orbit should be fairly slow. On Sunday afternoon I got a weak example (no video captured) when Pluto was at 21,167 led distance, whereas previously it was at 21,255 ls, so something is moving, or there is a “detection range” to trigger it or some other RNG factor involved.

I have mostly seen it in my Phantom. Did try briefly an Eagle for better manoeuvrability to try and see the cause/origin, but didn’t get a sighting and have gone back to the Phantom. In my videos (see my first post on this, https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8911441, the videos were all taken with the Phantom) you’ll see varying levels of brightness, a couple were fairly weak with a hint of blue in the reflected light, but one was quite vivid which might be closer & the colour is also much greener in the vivid example.

Edit: a Clipper might be best. I only had one for a short while as I got really annoyed with the bright cockpit reflecting so much light-might be just the ticket for this job!?
