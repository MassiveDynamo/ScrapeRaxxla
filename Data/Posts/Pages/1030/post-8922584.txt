I have such frustration and annoyance with NVIDIA software that I won’t use it again. A shame since I got the NVIDIA card on the basis of ShadowPlay. But wait until they bring out another update and you spend 2 or 3 days trying to get it working again, then multiply by well over a dozen times; that’s why I won’t use it!!!

I made that shadowplay mistake too. If you are as lazy as me, you should give a chance to Fbx game recorder. So easy to use,record, not too many options, but not complicated either.
