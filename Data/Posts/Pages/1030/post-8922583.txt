Encountered the green glow twice today in Sol. The first was extremely strong (bright) and the second was very dim. Recorded both, will upload later today or tomorrow.

Edit: Because @Merlin StWahgwaan brought it up, I also noted that this glow only appears after exiting the system map. It dampens my expectations a bit, since that seemed to be a recurring theme in @Jorki Rasalas' videos as well. If the system map is a common trigger it's most likely a bug.
