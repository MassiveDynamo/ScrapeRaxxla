Back to Alphekka.

As most of you know Alphekka in Corona Borealis(the northern crown) has the alternative name, Gemma. Gemma is latin for jewel or gem.
According to greek myth Corona Borealis is the crown of Princess Ariadne.

In the basic myth Ariadne was in charge of the labyrinth where the dangerous Minotaur was kept. She helped Theseus beat the Minotaur, only to abandoned by him. Dionysus the god, found her and married her. The wedding crown was put in the sky. End of story.

There are however many historians that think that Ariadne had a much mor important role in Minoan religion, before the Greeks reduced her significance.
In this article she is likened to Persephone as a ruler of the underworld: https://www.ancient-origins.net/myt...e-minoan-queen-dead-mistress-labyrinth-009407

This would make Ariadne both a chthonic goddess and a the Mistress of the Labyrinth.

The Labyrinth is a symbol of the individual quest or journey everyone has to make for them self, if you like.

The Spiral represents the creative power of the universe, emanating from the navel center (omphalos) and shares the symbolism of the labyrinth.

We have a jewel, a mother goddess in charge of labyrinths/spirals, there is parents grief(sacrifice of children), lovers woe (abandoned by lover), there is a princess in charge of a labyrinth/spiral with an omphalos in the middle.

Alphekka in ED is a seriously dull place, with only a single star. Might be a good place to hide something or have as a starting point for a journey?

As a bonus, we have Ariadne's thread. A logic problem solving method: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne's_thread_(logic)
