Anyone know of a list of player named systems? The reason I ask is because I'm in a strange area - a globular cluster - dozens of F type stars here - but there is one hand named system called 'Gilthaven' - 34 bodies but nothing human or out of the ordinary here though..

All the other stars have 2mass names and Gxxx catalog names and HD 50 etc. - its the blanco 1 cluster, btw - well under the disk of the galaxy 800ly from Sol.

Why go to the trouble of hand altering that one star?
