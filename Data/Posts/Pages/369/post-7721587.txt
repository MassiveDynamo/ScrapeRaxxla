However it was quite interesting that if you look up Gamma Cassiopiea ingame it does not come up. However, typing in the old catalogue.. ie HIP 4427, it appears as 27 Gamma Cassiopeia. 27 as in Right Ascension. RA
27 is just the Bayer designation for the star, not the RA. Itâ€™s a serial number in the constelation.
