However it was quite interesting that if you look up Gamma Cassiopiea ingame it does not come up. However, typing in the old catalogue.. ie HIP 4427, it appears as 27 Gamma Cassiopeia. 27 as in Right Ascension. RA
HD 5394 takes you to the same place on the galmap, and this system should be the "brow" of Cassiopeia, chained to the naughty chair. According to eddb.io someone's been out there and registered a black hole, and a neutron star along with the primary but it's not showing any planets.

Only 550Ly from Sol and not all that far from Sothis.
