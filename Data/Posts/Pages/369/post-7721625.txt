I was always of the understanding that the noise from the galactic centre was essentially a simulation of the RL radio sources that exist in the galactic centre.

Will be interesting to see if it actually leads to something different.

The interesting part is it is not exactly at the galactic core. It is about 10 ly offset between three systems.
