Eventually you have to just knuckle down and read the lot. It's not so bad and you get to know who is who, and maybe Scytale will give you a t-shirt..

Then you can stand on the shoulders of giants - the view is great from up here

I still have an issue with Scytale’s t-shirt
As well as denoting the quest for Raxxla etc it also mentions Mothers-in-law, i.e. Monsters from the Id; don’t think Forbidden Planet is lore for ED, even though the title might apply to Raxxla!

P.S.
The bigger they come, the harder they fall!
