The interesting part is it is not exactly at the galactic core. It is about 10 ly offset between three systems.
Yeah, sorry, when I say centre, I don’t mean Sag A, I mean that area.

Sag A is one of the radio sources in the galactic centre but there’s others and it’s not yet known what they all are.

The signal could be intended to be one of those, for example N3, as something without a confirmed stellar origin couldn’t be tied into a specific system.
