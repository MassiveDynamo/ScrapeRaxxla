Hello everyone,

Researchers at the Independent Raxxla Hunters group have discovered a signal at the center of the galaxy that may have existed since the very beginning of the game. We have narrowed the source of the signal down to just a couple systems. Please find the post on this topic as well as information on how you can assist the investigation here:

I was always of the understanding that the noise from the galactic centre was essentially a simulation of the RL radio sources that exist in the galactic centre.

Will be interesting to see if it actually leads to something different.
