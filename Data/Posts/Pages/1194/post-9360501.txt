Well, it jumped out at me because it aligns with the hypothesis I’ve been testing. There may be other versions, try it and see!

Mind, I’ve been looking around here for a while now & not a sniff of an alien ship so far!
But it seems reassuring that I’m on the right lines.
Last night I was looking for combinations that had something to do with space and I found these phrases:

Alpha Site Stargate
Athosian in Stargate
Disappearing Earth
Dragons in the Stars
Generation starship
Interstellar grains
The Great Annihilator
Starships in Stargate

But using the combinations for the paragraph "Tothejewelthatburnsonthebrowofthemotherofgalaxies" I found four phrases that caught my attention, they probably don't mean anything but I kept thinking about it:

There’s Something Out There
For Him Who Has Ears To Hear
Out of All Them Bright Stars
Here, Beneath the North Star

None of the other paragraphs of the Dark Wheel toast show any interesting phrases.
