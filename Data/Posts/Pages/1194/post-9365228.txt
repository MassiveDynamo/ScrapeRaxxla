But the word Raxxla existed decades before the release of Elite dangerous. Any theory could be possible, but I think it has nothing to do with the Elite Dangerous release date, and technically you could already play in December 2013.
Totally agree with the first part. But Raxxla's location in E could only exist after the gamma release in 2014. I was thinking more on the lines of an interesting coincidence. Either way, Orion nebula is pretty cool and I haven't been there anyway.
