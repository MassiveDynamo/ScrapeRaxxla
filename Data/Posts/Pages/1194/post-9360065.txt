But can’t be “guardian”!
No “u” in “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars”!!

With “Alien Ship At Rhea in Sol”
I can also get “Alt press” & “Press start”
With “C pnd rg S” left over.

So yesterday afternoon I was flying around Rhea frantically pressing the Alt key and typing “start” into the Quick Comms text panel. Nothing happened so far!

Edit: just keeping “alien ship at Rhea in Sol” and rearranging “CpndrgSAltstart” I get:
Crap (slang) - perhaps need to repeat carrying some biowaste?
Sandtraps (maybe I need to take some golf clubs?)
Car parts (anybody seen that Tesla of late?)
Last gasp (maybe it appears if you turn off your life support?)
ALS scan (do we have an ALS in the ship? Been spamming the Discovery Scanner!)

I was cheating.

I did a check on the sentence. It produces 13259 separate English words. It can give a lot of different stuff.

I'm a bit sceptical to a solution that is locked to the English language, when the Codex is multilingual.
