I'd be suspicious of any article whose 1st senetence contains a mistruth - the screen play came first, then the books.
Well, not quite right, the original storyline was written in the 50’s & then expanded significantly to turn it into the screen play and the 2001SO book was concurrent with that. Then came two later books & films.

Wikipedia: “2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke. It was developed concurrently with Stanley Kubrick's film version and published after the release of the film. Clarke and Kubrick worked on the book together, but eventually only Clarke ended up as the official author. The story is based in part on various short stories by Clarke, including "The Sentinel" (written in 1948 for a BBC competition, but first published in 1951 under the title "Sentinel of Eternity")”
