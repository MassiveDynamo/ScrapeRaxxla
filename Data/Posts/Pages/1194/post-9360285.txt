I was cheating.

I did a check on the sentence. It produces 13259 separate English words. It can give a lot of different stuff.

I'm a bit sceptical to a solution that is locked to the English language, when the Codex is multilingual.
Good point!
But “Rhea” & “Sol” are fixed names so no change. “Alien”? “Ship”?
It’s supposed to be “cunningly concealed facts”, so probably wouldn't need “ship” for it to make sense as a clue!
Think Google Translate is playing me false; seems to continually treat “alien”as English...edit: ah yes, tried it in the reverse direction & “alien” changes significantly with language. But as per the previous argument just “Rhea+”Sol” makes for a significant clue. But there are then lots of letters so back to the basic idea...needs to be checked by people who are a) good with anagrams and b) astronomically knowledgeable!

What made me start thinking was the “hints for those with eyes to see” - possibly i i 2 c? i i c c?
Might try to add these into the anagram solver.

Yes, it produces a lot of English words, but for a valid clue they’ve got to make sense within the context of the game and location, which rules most of them out (I was only joking about Leeds station! ).
