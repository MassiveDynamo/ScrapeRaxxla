Ok, if this is true then we have the following possibilities:
1 - if that cmdr honked the basic or intermediate scanner (pre-3.4 ED had basic, intermediate and advanced, and only the advanced could scan the whole system), and if Raxxla was further than 500 or 1000 ls then it's still hidden. (I find this the most likely scenario)
2 - if said cmdr had the advanced scanner then he found the planet that holds Raxxla but didn't go there. It might mean it was not apparent at long distances and he had to visit each body and didn't - IMHO FDev were then giving us a hand here when they introduced the FSS, at least let's hope so.
2a - if an EDSM/EDDB/INARA E: D account link was present then that system is on their databases (incompletely scanned most likely)
2b - if the account wasn't linked then it's only present in Univ Cartographics (if the cmdr didn't blow the ship before selling the data) .... aaand we have nothing.
I don't know if you realise, but every system within about 300ly of Sol is in EDSM. No exceptions. Yes many are incompletely scanned, but that number too is decreasing.
