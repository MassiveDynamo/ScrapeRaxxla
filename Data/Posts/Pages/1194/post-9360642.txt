What I need is an anagram solver using astronomical terminology. All I can find is anagram solutions of the word “astronomy”!

Doing it manually anagramming the book title I can get: Sol Ship asteroid Earth Io Callisto Dione Rhea Titan Ariel Titania Triton Charon.
Ceres, pleiades, heart, sapphire, spica, planet, stealth, space, alpha, thargoid, astro, core, spindle, terra, declination, right ascension, distance, elite, pilot, sensor, spaceship, eagle, clone, sirens, north, astral.
