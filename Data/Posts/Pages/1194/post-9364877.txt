In the "tiny bit obvious" category, I got a funny idea last night: 1337 speech. I think many of you are familiar with it.
RAXXLA in 1337 speech is 12 4 10 10 1 4.
Now let's play a little: it can also be written 12 4 20 14. Or 12 4 2014.
12 april is International Day of Human Space Flight or Cosmonaut day (in Russia). On 12 april 1961 Yuri Gagarin was the first human to go to space, completing one orbit in the Vostok 3KA. It was also commemorated when NASA launched Columbia in the first shuttle mission (STS-1) in 1981.
2014 is the year ED launched.
There is a Gagarin star system (along with other astronaut-named star systems) in the Orion nebula. Going there to check them out.
