And if you prefer something liquid, you could go with: ship enters guardian portal stash pilsner
But can’t be “guardian”!
No “u” in “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars”!!

With “Alien Ship At Rhea in Sol”
I can also get “Alt press” & “Press start”
With “C pnd rg S” left over.

So yesterday afternoon I was flying around Rhea frantically pressing the Alt key and typing “start” into the Quick Comms text panel. Nothing happened so far!

Edit: just keeping “alien ship at Rhea in Sol” and rearranging “CpndrgSAltstart” I get:
Crap (slang) - perhaps need to repeat carrying some biowaste? (Keen galactic gardeners?)
Sandtraps (maybe I need to take some golf clubs?)
Car parts (anybody seen that Tesla of late?)
Last gasp (maybe it appears if you turn off your life support?)
ALS scan (do we have an ALS in the ship? Been spamming the Discovery Scanner!):
Advanced Life Support
Approach Light System
Auto/All Weather/Advanced Landing System (Advanced Docking computer for autodock?)
Airborne Laser Scanner
Assistive Listening System (listen for it?)
Active Light System (blink ship lights?)
