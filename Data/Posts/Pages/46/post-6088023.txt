I'll still stick to the tiny little bit ovious and the personal journey. MB's words.

So ? Obvious and personal:
The DW and gaining permits, ranks and rep. (Rank is obviously necessary to enter Shinrarta... first step in the quest. Rep with the DW, second step. Then? Well, just look at my signature [haha])

Except KS backers also got access to Shinrarta from the get-go - no Elite requirements necessary.

Also, if Elite and allied with The DW was all it took - someone would have found it in Beta
