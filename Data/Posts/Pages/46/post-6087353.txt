This universe is doomed. Dark energy will rip all conventional matter apart at the end of our time. We live in a dead end. Raxxla is not in this universe. Raxxla exists in a place where matter will endure.

That's all well and good except for the fact that FDev (Braben himself, actually) have said that Raxxla is, indeed, in the Milky Way.
