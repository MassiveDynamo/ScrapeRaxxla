Good idea!

Hey Jaitou, do you think Raxxla could be located at Cass A?
*runs and hides*

If it is ... I'm sure I'll find it. I still have hopes that Frontier will add it (Cas A, not Raxxla) into the game. They added Trappist 1 which is, to be honest, not a very remarkable system whereas Cassiopeia A, which is still one of the most visible objects in our galaxy in radio astronomy, remains absent.
