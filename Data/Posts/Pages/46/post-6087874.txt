Guess a black hole can be considered a place that isn't a place. The Dark Wheel (which isn't canon) says that people is living on Raxxla already, that would probably be hard to do in a black hole, unless of course they are cylons and have placed their base right next to the event horizon. And when is a door also a key?

I know of a few black holes on the outer rim, I'll be sure to check them out, fortunately CMDR Flirble Rasok is a triple.

The personal journey which have been mentioned by MB is puzzling, I can only think of rank as something personal in ED so that must unlock something.

[tinfoil] What if Raxxla is hidden in witchspace and access can be made using a Thargoid heart...nah, hearts are too recent [/tinfoil]
