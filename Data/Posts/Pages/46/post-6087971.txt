Tbh I've been working on various tinfoiled ideas about Raxxla since launch.

I have a horrible feeling it's a metaphor for our ships - a place that's not a place(because it's a ship) and which has an FSD that is both a door and key (to accessing witchspace) and is capable of taking us to anyplace in the galaxy.

I'm also currently putting a lot of time into figuring out if the place that's not a place is a reference to the "time" element of 4 dimensional space, as that's a coordinate value for a "place" that often goes overlooked.

And now I've written this, I'm wondering if it's a case of being in the right place and time, with a frame shift drive.

Seriously, raxxla is like some horrific theoretical fractal set - the closer you look the more and more infinite it becomes >.<
