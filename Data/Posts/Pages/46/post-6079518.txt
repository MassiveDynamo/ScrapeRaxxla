Not entirely correct but in the right direction. U.S. Navy officer ranks are abbreviated in all caps. The U.S. Army follows a similar rule while the Air Force and Marine Corps do not.

The reason why Elite uses the all-caps American version of the rank can be traced back to Ian Bell and David Braben writing the game while attending college. There's no telling what influenced them to use the Americanized version while coding the original game back in 1984 but I'd venture to guess that it was due to some familiarity with the Star Trek television and Motion Picture franchise which follows the same format.

As I already posted, just ask Jaiotu !
Thx !
