If it is ... I'm sure I'll find it. I still have hopes that Frontier will add it (Cas A, not Raxxla) into the game. They added Trappist 1 which is, to be honest, not a very remarkable system whereas Cassiopeia A, which is still one of the most visible objects in our galaxy in radio astronomy, remains absent.

Maybe the exploration improvements in Beyond will bring some form of radio astronomy to the game - then they'd definitely have a reason for adding Cass A.

Just for the record, I'm placing my bet (based on absolutely no logical thought or reasoning) on Raxxla being located in the NGC 3603 star forming region.
It's 20kLY from Sol and currently permit locked.
