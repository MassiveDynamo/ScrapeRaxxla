My tinfoil:

A place that isn't a place - this allows for Raxxla to be mobile. A place that isn't IN place, so to speak.

A door that is also a key - when coupled with the 'personal journey' concept, this could be referring to the Cmdr making some kind of jump/transition/evolution through a conceptual doorway, which then unlocks access to Raxxla. Unlocking could be permit-related or a code/cipher of some kind.
