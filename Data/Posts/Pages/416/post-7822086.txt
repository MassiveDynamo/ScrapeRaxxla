Think you’re getting yourself confused here. Project Dynasty was the mystery behind the Formidine Rift hunt and Salomé’s storyline, as told by Drew Wagar in the books Elite Reclamation and Elite Premonition. The story was that Dynasty was an project by a mysterious organisation called The Club to find Earthlike Worlds in three regions of space for the elite (Federation, Empire and Alliance) of humanity to escape to in the event of the Thargoid invasion, leaving the rest of humanity behind to act as a “meat shield” to distract the goids. The in-game evidence came through the Teorge listening post logs of Salomé’s messages.

The quote you refer to is from one of the books which I believe is not canon for ED. This was discussed in the Formidine Rift threads.

Don’t see how you conclude Raxxla is related to Thargoids from the above. They may, they may not; there seems no evidence either way. Though there is some information that they are more interested in Soonthill than Raxxla,but I can’t remember the source reference. Thargoids aren’t mentioned in either Codex entries for Dark Wheel or Raxxla, which seem to be the only information on Raxxla given out by FD, other than “it is in game and has been since the gamma”. All the relevant evidence is mentioned on the first page of this thread.

Project dynasty was happening in 3 nebulae locations, the same three out of 6 which if you’ve read my earlier posts are where crossovers from the Thargoid map and is where Raxxla flag cross over lines (drawn from each point) meet. Let’s not forget Salomé relayed a message TO the children of Raxxla suggesting that these locations be HEAVILY investigated. Why the children of Raxxla? Why not a different faction?
The ‘club’ also commissioned these expeditions and we know they are responsible for a long chain of events that myths of Raxxla have been woven into.
