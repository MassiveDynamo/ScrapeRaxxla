That log isn't from one of the "sites." It's from the megaship Zurara, found in the Formidine Rift....which Wagar has said, repeatedly, has nothing to do with Raxxla. If anything, the drug "Hexedit" is probably a little easter egg.
Exactly? It’s from the rift? Where project dynasty was launched? Which is a mega ship ‘site’ and this is what lead me to believe project dynasty and Raxxla are interwoven somehow and Wagar isn’t maintaining his sites anymore and is also a known collaborator in the lore behind the Thargoids and Raxxla.
