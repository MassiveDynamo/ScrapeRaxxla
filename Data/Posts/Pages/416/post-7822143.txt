Ah I thought it was the other way around, thought merope was on the right hand side and yes the rumours because after all isn’t everything here just rumours?
And I don’t believe the purpose is known. This came from the cannon research group ‘It is still highly debated and theorized of it’s true meaning, but as like the TP’s spectrogram, it is still unknown on what its true meaning may be’
Forgive me for being somewhat gauche, but, I get the impression that you're new here. A lot of the information that you've googled up for yourself was actually discovered, uncovered, and figured out by the very people in this thread that you've questioned. Listen to Thatch. He's knows what he's on about.
