Well as I’ve said most of the areas where I found that the Thargoid star map thing overlapped is permit restricted so i bet its impossible to actually get to Raxxla in this moment in time. I’ve just been posting about how the Thargoid structures and maps seem to overlap with the Raxxla one and was theorising about how the Thargoids could be the missing piece. After all in the original elite game where Thargoids where first introduced that was when Raxxla was too introduced. Most of what I’ve started could have already been thought of but I don’t think anyone’s really compared Raxxla and Thargoids together. The fact that there star map is one of the andromeda galaxy is enough to suggest they aren’t from the Milky Way and Raxxla is described as being a gateway. I’m simply posturing ideas that could help in some sort of discoveries with the discoveries I have made to potentially speed up the location of Raxxla
Frontier are also known for using past stories in the past frontier games in this new one so using any information on Raxxla is in my opinion relevant. We just simply don’t have enough evidence to locate Raxxla as of the moment so anything that could be used to formulate an idea is helpful so I am simply stating things I have found so we create a ‘platform’ to stand on
We know Raxxla exists, as far as I’m aware frontier has stated that is is out there and the dev team know where it is. They have also stated to my knowledge that no in game CLUES will be given
Also the fact you assume I’m ‘new’ and for this reason unknowingly ‘stupid’ as you are suggesting and don’t know what I’m on about is insulting to say the least, I’m simply working with what I have found and working on the ideas and developments of others the formulate areas on the galmap that could be interesting to search at and I’d like to remind you that Raxxla theory’s are basically impossible to disprove as so little is known about it, myths aren't truths and the dark wheel try’s to steer people away from Raxxla. However myths is all we have to work from so
