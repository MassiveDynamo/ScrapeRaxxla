Before this turns into the next "A CMDR has already flown into the system and honked it, but didn't scan Raxxla. FDev have confirmed" rumour, I just want to point out, as others have already, that this is grossly conflating two completely separate story lines. Project Dynasty was a three pronged project that was sent to seek out viable Earth like worlds in the case that humanity had to flee due to Thargoid destruction/invasion of human inhabited space. Three sites were picked, one in the Formidine Rift, one in Hawking's Gap, and the other in the Conflux. This had nothing to do with the Raxxla. And the quote you mentioned is not in-game and, for whatever it's worth, is not considered cannon for the the game, despite what you assert.
No i agree they didn’t have anything to do with them at first but the Arthur of that book is officially licensed by frontier a wrote that in ‘and here’s the wheel’ it may not be confirmed cannon as what I had originally thought but it’s still viable. The workers on these sites where killed with a poison and this log can be found when scanning one of the sites


And I don’t think THAT is a coincidence
