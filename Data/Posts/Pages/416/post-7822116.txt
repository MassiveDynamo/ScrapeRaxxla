Think you've got the wrong end of the stick with some stuff here. I'll tackle it.

On the left in the image is Merope. On the right is Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3 (though it's Permit Locked so it can't be 100% confirmed, but it's pretty certain).

The line on the planets denotes a ring.

All the bodies in Merope are there in the diagram, there's not one missing. Compare it if needs be: https://www.edsm.net/en_GB/system/bodies/id/25355/name/Merope

What this is for known. It symbolises how to use the Thargoid Device at one site, along with the Probe, Sensor and Link to determine the location of other sites.


Not really sure what you're referring to when you say we know from Soontill that Thargoids have a part in the Raxxla mystery. There's no connection. (Unless counting the rumour I mentioned that Soontil was to the Thargoids what Raxxla is to us.)

Ah I thought it was the other way around, thought merope was on the right hand side and yes the rumours because after all isn’t everything here just rumours?
And I don’t believe the purpose is known. This came from the cannon research group ‘It is still highly debated and theorized of it’s true meaning, but as like the TP’s spectrogram, it is still unknown on what its true meaning may be’
