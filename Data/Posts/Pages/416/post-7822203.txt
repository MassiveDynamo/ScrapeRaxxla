I'm not sure how to make this any more plain. The author who created the Formidine Rift and it's mysteries has said, many times, that it has nothing to do with Raxxla. I'll take his word for it.

Have you actually been to the Zurara in some other form than through your web browser? Get out there and explore, you get a feel for it that your search history just can't compensate for.
Yes in-fact I have but, not for Raxxla purposes. And I have to search things up as my iPad doesn’t allow me to upload pictures taken with the camera so I have to use a online file transfer to show visual evidence. Trust me I’d love to post more in depth things about what I have found but alas apple like to shove there collaboration attempts with the rest of technology up there consumers a-holes
