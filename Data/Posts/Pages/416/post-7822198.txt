Exactly? It’s from the rift? Where project dynasty was launched? Which is a mega ship ‘site’ and this is what lead me to believe project dynasty and Raxxla are interwoven somehow
I'm not sure how to make this any more plain. The author who created the Formidine Rift and it's mysteries has said, many times, that it has nothing to do with Raxxla. I'll take his word for it.

Have you actually been to the Zurara in some other form than through your web browser? Get out there and explore, you get a feel for it that your search history just can't compensate for.
