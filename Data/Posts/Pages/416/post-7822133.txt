I agree
I also found this about the Thargoids and the project dynasty (don’t worry it’s cannon)
"You don't know what I've seen. I've sailed beyond the Formidine Rift, seen the fleets of Octagonal ships blocking out the stars. I've stood on lost worlds, sterilised clean by the Thargoids and erased from humanity's maps. I've seen the graves from the Thargoid wars, countless headstones stretching beyond the curvature of the horizon, little spots of reflected light dottering the abandoned continent ..."
This is pretty much proof Thargoids have a part to play in Raxxla, the dynasty project was to find new life but was actually used to try and find Raxxla. This can’t be a coincidence with the overlays and restricted areas but as of now I’m unable to travel cause I need to get my cutter
Before this turns into the next "A CMDR has already flown into the system and honked it, but didn't scan Raxxla. FDev have confirmed" rumour, I just want to point out, as others have already, that this is grossly conflating two completely separate story lines. Project Dynasty was a three pronged project that was sent to seek out viable Earth like worlds in the case that humanity had to flee due to Thargoid destruction/invasion of human inhabited space. Three sites were picked, one in the Formidine Rift, one in Hawking's Gap, and the other in the Conflux. This had nothing to do with the Raxxla. And the quote you mentioned is not in-game and, for whatever it's worth, is not considered cannon for the the game, despite what you assert.
