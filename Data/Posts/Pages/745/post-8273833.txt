I have a reasonable question for everyone!
You think you can just stumble upon a dark wheel at the station? think you can just find raksla? Why do you turn to ancient mythology, think there are clues? This secret is already 39 years old, and you still hope that the clues will be hidden in mythology .... What is the point of solving a toast if all this gives absolutely nothing? Someone wrote that you need to scan and send data to the station, what kind of nonsense?
Who said that the picture in the codex is genuine?
... in the orbit of the eighth moon of an unnamed gas giant, too obvious a clue to ignore it ....
Sorry boiling ....
Fair questions really, it's a nuthouse around here.
1. No
2. No
3. I believe you have to activate access to it, through some ingame sequence / event / action. Hence knowledge is power.
4. Clues and general knowledge, later when put in a context you may suddenly understand why there is a strong link. However if you don't possess the knowledge, you will never be able to provide a strong link.
5. Someone thinks that? I don't.
6. Image, codex. It's a image as cloud be treated as possible clue or hint, but also could possibly mean nothing except providing an illustration. If we chose to ignore it we will be no wiser. Treat it like what it is, an image, possibly just an illustration or even a clue.

Anyway. I sincerely believe MB and DB has given us enough clues that it's a journey for us, whatever that means in terms of meta.
Hence I do not believe you can just stumble upon it.
