Fair questions really, it's a nuthouse around here.
1. No
2. No
3. I believe you have to activate access to it, through some ingame sequence / event / action. Hence knowledge is power.
4. Clues and general knowledge, later when put in a context you may suddenly understand why there is a strong link. However if you don't possess the knowledge, you will never be able to provide a strong link.
5. Someone thinks that? I don't.
6. Image, codex. It's a image as cloud be treated as possible clue or hint, but also could possibly mean nothing except providing an illustration. If we chose to ignore it we will be no wiser. Treat it like what it is, an image, possibly just an illustration or even a clue.

Anyway. I sincerely believe MB and DB has given us enough clues that it's a for us, whatever that means in terms of meta.
Hence I do not believe you can just stumble upon it.
