Since raxxla was known at the latest around 2296, this limits the ftl to what is known to have existed around that time. Given the distance to tau ceti and how long it took from the first manned missions to the colonization...10 years for 10ly... And similar times for other missions in the same period... It would make the most sense to be in a pretty small bubble around sol.

Whether it was found again later in more advanced ships doesn't change that the only way it could be known in 2296 is if someone had found it then with the ships of the time.

Note..raxxla was known before Jason Ryder was born. So while he is credited... He must not have been the first discoverer
