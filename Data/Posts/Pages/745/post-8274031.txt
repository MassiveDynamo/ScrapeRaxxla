There is no third party at this time. There's just Sol and the new colony on tau ceti.

edit: the only way your theory would work is if raxxla was entirely fabricated ...and then something was discovered later and adopted the name. Which is unlikely ...but i suppose if you widen your net of plausibility to infinity...anything is possible. Of course when it comes to what is actually going on in this game, retcons retcons retcons will spontaneously appear wherever fdev has contridicted themselves if it turns out that raxxla isn't within 300ly of earth.
