And the Martian Fossils and the Martian Relic...who knows if that was a 'light cube map' like we see in sci-fi all the time - PURE SPECULATION but nothing is black and white all the time when the story can go in any direction. Interestingly in that latest posted video I think I was, MB says they had a totally different long term plan for Jacques Station but players moved the storyline. Martian Relic discovered 2280, 18 years to decode and analyse and some people hear about its 'legendary' map to Raxxla, 'May as well go find Raxxla while we're at it!'.

Before ED that 2296 wasn't in lore I don't think though, we just knew Alex father had gone looking for it and returned to kit out an explo ship, maybe it is significant for some reason. Don't think there were dates included (may be now with retconned lore and books).

the martian relic, if it was of any importance information wise, would have been kept secret ...otherwise it would be common knowledge as it's not like the discoverers would have released news that "we found a relic" and not ever include the full details of that relic to the rest of Sol. So since everyone didn't have details about this map ...it stands to reason that it wasn't one.

edit: i see that it was kept secret in the current official timeline for ED. so ...interesting ... Also the note of raxxla being known in 2296 was retconned. In fact, all mention of raxxla in the official timeline seems to be retconned out.
