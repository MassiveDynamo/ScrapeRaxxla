The amount of times I've followed a low wake NPC at an H moon just in case theyre going somewhere, sheesh! Just RNG 'life' appears in different forms and appears to have significance but usually doesn't. Incidentally that Search N Rescue that chats about 'If youre low on fuel, follow my wake, Im outfitted to provide fuel' or similar. They don't, or at least they haven't offered me any fuel at any point. I try and carry a manifest scanner for these RNG ones though, to see if they are carrying anything but nothing so far (at least one storyline has started with NPCs carrying stuff so I keep trying just in case)



More likely considering that in lore they don't actually know where Raxxla is, and its in a separate Codex entry, linked but separate.

Ive had a new line of thought on 'eyes to see' so I shall be chasing that goose for a while.

Incidentally, has anyone found any human settlement that opens a door of some kind when scanning the Settlement Beacon or similar? I haven't done many planet recon/destroy mission so don't have much experience.

Yeah I found a few like that actually. during disable the power supply on med security or better. It opened a gate to a high walled 'courtyard' where the power supply is located on the ones ive had that happen.
