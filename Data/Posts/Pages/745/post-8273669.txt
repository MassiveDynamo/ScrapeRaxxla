I have a reasonable question for everyone!
You think you can just stumble upon a dark wheel at the station? think you can just find raksla? Why do you turn to ancient mythology, think there are clues? This secret is already 39 years old, and you still hope that the clues will be hidden in mythology .... What is the point of solving a toast if all this gives absolutely nothing? Someone wrote that you need to scan and send data to the station, what kind of nonsense?
Who said that the picture in the codex is genuine?
... in the orbit of the eighth moon of an unnamed gas giant, too obvious a clue to ignore it ....
Sorry boiling ....
I don't think anyone thinks anything in particular or expects to find anything. It's just about having an idea and testing it out, in the game.

To quote Wane Gretzky: " You miss 100% of the shots you don't take".
