Lyta is not really a name.. that may be good or bad. My 1st guess was LYTA are all star classes, but I've not got anywhere wit that either. Astrophil not really related to Lyta crane - one is TDW , the other is Raxxla - it may be a mistake to join the codex entries in this way, but link Astophil with Astro-physics in general may be helpful..

Spiralling stars might point to merger events for detecting gravity waves, but unfortunately these events are all outside the milky way.

There's a lot to be gleaned from etymology in every name and how it relates to their role in the play. This is not only common to the ED universe but to many pop culture references.

Hippolyta: horse + let loose
Crane: to cry hoarsely or to stretch or be stretched out

Seems to fit Lyta Crane's profession
