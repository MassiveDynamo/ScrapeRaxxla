And the Martian Fossils and the Martian Relic...who knows if that was a 'light cube map' like we see in sci-fi all the time - PURE SPECULATION but nothing is black and white all the time when the story can go in any direction. Interestingly in that latest posted video I think I was, MB says they had a totally different long term plan for Jacques Station but players moved the storyline. Martian Relic discovered 2280, 18 years to decode and analyse and some people hear about its 'legendary' map to Raxxla, 'May as well go find Raxxla while we're at it!'.

Before ED that 2296 wasn't in lore I don't think though, we just knew Alex father had gone looking for it and returned to kit out an explo ship, maybe it is significant for some reason. Don't think there were dates included (may be now with retconned lore and books).
