EDSM has a few things to say about this (these are all near Sol and the primary body). All are reachable via a standard hyperspace jump with no extra prep work to get there.

Anything under 13 Jupiter Masses (Mj) cannot even fuse deuterium. These are all technically sub-stellar gas giants so yes rogue planets are a thing and they are accessible. They just aren't codified as such.

Rogue planets as a unit type exist, but none have been identified in the game.
Comets also exist as a unit type, and 1 has been found, but it has no mesh.

historically, raxxla was a station of sorts and a planet in another galaxy. I think in terms of elite lore, it makes the most sense to make raxxla a mobile station (basically a mega ship). Which is why after it's initial discovery, it was lost ...because it moved. This also benefits frontier the most, because even if raxxla is eventually discovered by a player, it wouldn't be a 1 time thing, and it probably wouldn't stick around long enough to do anything interesting. Then the next step would be trying to figure out where it will appear next in order to do any kind of tests or attempt to acquire any items/etc. something that may take additional years. This also lets them hide it from the system map and BGS, and position it in places like asteroid clusters and rings and such. If it's in normal space and not supercruise, it would be effectively impossible to find unless it jumps periodically to a known place of interest ... determining the time it can be found there would be the deciding factor on it's first discovery.

Or they could go with the whole magic "jump to these locations in this order and a magic jump will occur that takes you to raxxla" method they've used in the past. But i highly doubt they'll go with a means of discovery that is only effective 1 time for something like raxxla in a multiplayer shared game.
