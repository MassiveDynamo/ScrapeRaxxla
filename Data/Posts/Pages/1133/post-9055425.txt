iirc the Club was specifically a Braben idea and certain authors were asked to include it or reference it to introduce it, so almost certain to be in the story I would hope, Drew said something along the lines of thinking at the time 'Another cabal, DB does like his cabals' which made me laugh. I know what he meant, seems like theres cabals everywhere sometimes...DW, AEGIS, INRA, Black Flight, The Club, Sirius, CIEP, even the PF and EPF, and now Jupiter Rochester (linked to a mysterious overarching cabal in GalNet), NMLA (and their mysterious backers infiltrating everywhere and pulling strings) and possibly even ACT now etc and yet none of them clear about what they are or where they fit in or what they stand for or are aiming at....or preparing for. Just mysterious groups operating in the background and up to something and we get little pieces of the jigsaw every so often.

The only one that might have been cleared up and dismissed was the Starship One saboteurs cabal....if the trial was the end of that and putting it to rest....but Halsey is back so who knows?

Speculation - I'm hoping that the end of this 2 year story is the outing of the Club somehow, it would make sense to finally reveal them at that stage or link them officially and move the story on to the next major stage, preferably with a DW v The Club endeavour. About time they stopped making new cabals and tied them all together. Could equally be the Thargoid Invasion but Id prefer the DW v Club and no Thargs. Dunno what that means for Raxxla though.

But we still donâ€™t know why Halsey diverted Starship One to have an emergency meeting with Mahon. I suspect when we know that then other things may fall into place.
