All - remember DW wrote the whole Zuara mystery and doesnt know where Raxxla is, but almost certainly added some tinfoil to mean it could be read as linked to Raxxla somehow, misdirection or just good writing to create mystery. It was more about the Club's previous solution to the Thargoid Invasion before FSD iirc and to build into the bigger plot about the next Thargoid Invasion which may have been postponed (out of his control, it was written in good faith at the time).

Just a thought on this - Drew has also come out and said that "The Club" was from FD. Not his. How much of the Clubs actions were decided by who is moot at this point. Its whether FD decides to continue the story and in what way.
