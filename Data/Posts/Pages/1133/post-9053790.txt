Raxxla - How it used to be...
I have started to remember some things I had forgot in time. I recall that Andromeda was also called the Galaxy 9. Ben Ryders original portal to Galaxy 9 was in next system from Tionisla. I can’t recall exactly what system, because the names have been changed. This has been done to hide the...

Dude thats in the Lore & ROLEPLAY section, good story though

PS: The first pilot to fly through Ben's portal was one of the Russian pilots who wrote the game story into a computer magazine released in 1989 in Finland. This magazine has all the missions to unlock the path to Raxxla.
Interestingly refers to this old myth that I never tracked down, obviously no proof provided at all, but very similar to the conclusions I made that it became lore behind the Iron Curtain. All we know for sure is it wasnt in the official game release, I still dont know if hackers put it in later or if its pure myth.

Found it (in part of a Q/A), Sounds like he is saying it was true at time of writing .... however......
Thanks, thats quite an interesting post he makes, some quotes below.

What about the other CIEP bases? There were between 4-7 because the project endure message went to seven people, four were base commanders. Are these other bases now abandoned, waiting to be found?

THOSE BASES WOULD STILL BE THERE.

Implies that they should be out there somewhere, possibly in-game, possibly in the sequel for the book which never happened.

Achenar, Fort Donalds is where the alliance stopped a rebel imperial plot. Fort Donalds is missing… where would a space station go?!

IT WAS THERE IN THE PREVIOUS GAME, WHICH WAS THE INFORMATION USED AT THE TIME OF WRITING AS THE GAME WASN'T FINISHED WHEN THE STORY WAS WRITTEN, GUESS THE NAME GOT CHANGED OR THE STATION WAS REMOVED FOR THE NEW GAME.

More evidence that Frontier ret-conned after the fact or during the fact, so nothing can be taken for granted.

Olcanze is where Robert and Jordan were prisoners once. Apparently some sort of Imperial mining location. Unfortunately it seems to be missing from the game.

AGAIN THIS WAS IN THE PREVIOUS GAME, OBVIOUSLY IT WAS DECIDED TO REMOVE THIS SYSTEM FROM THE UNIVERSE FOR THE CURRENT GAME

Dammit! Wish theyd decided what they were doing before they told the authors.

Delta Phoenecis is there as well as the planets Anka, Kerkes and Garuda (the latter where they find the Imperial fleet), but planet Benu is missing.

I USED THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO ME BY FD FOR THIS SYSTEM

And again, either its bugged or Frontier changed the system. With all the other bits of info and other authors it seems most likely that it just got changed afterwards and nobody told the Authors or it was too big a plot change to re-write so they just left them high and dry.

So basically to sum up, Trust No One! As even those who were officially told facts found those facts changed afterwards. Obfuscation indeed. Which leaves the Codex, with its non-hints and mythological status and plausible deniability as the only source that may now be current and up to date.....unless it changed afterwards again.
