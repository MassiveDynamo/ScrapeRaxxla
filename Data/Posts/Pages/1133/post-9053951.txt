Dude, so are we. ;-)

I know that lol which is why most stuff posted here is taken as a theory and we can have multiple theories going on at once, until proven one way or the other, but not taken as fact or presented as such. We also have stories and that one is quite clearly a roleplay fiction story, a good one, but still a story. But when first cited above it was treated as fact or lore that this had been done by Frontier in the past, which is proven false as it was never in any previous game so its not lore. It can be a bit confusing as Lore and Roleplay are similar but not the same, one is established official story or history and one is pure fiction based in this official lore. Especially if translated from English the nuance can be lost.
