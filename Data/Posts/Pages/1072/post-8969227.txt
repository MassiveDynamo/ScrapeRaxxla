Did a forum search on it. It looks like you using it in your post is the only usage of it....

Search results for query: Γαλλια

I've found the Γαλλια / Gallia translation in several old, scanned and OCR'ed documents. I is translated to raXXla or raXXLa (always capital XX and small r).

It's just a result of the OCR software, misinterpreting the Greek letters. It would be very cunning by FD, if they used it in the mystery.

Some older mentions of this:
