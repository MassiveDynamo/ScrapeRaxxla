Personally I dont think its Astrophil and Stella that is being referred to. I think that was just a coincidence (but its open to argument and is a popular angle for many). But the Name "Astrophel" means "star lover" regardless of that just based on its construction. You cant turn phel into fail arbitrarily because its suits you.

According to google :
Translations of fail
verb

αποτυγχάνω
fail, fizzle, come to nothing, flunk

αποτυχαίνω
emboss, fail, fall down, wash up, drop through, fall through

παραλείπω
skip, fail, miss out, omit, miss, leave out

εκπίπτω
deduct, fail, ebb, rebate

απορρίπτω
reject, refuse, discard, cast, turn down, fail

χρεωκοπώ
bankrupt, fail, go bankrupt

χρεοκοπώ
crash, fail, go bankrupt, go under

The children's book of the codex is likely something quite different - I think there are only a couple of such references in the lore to children's books. Until we work out what they're getting t it anyone's guess - it'll make sense once its cracked, I'm sure.
