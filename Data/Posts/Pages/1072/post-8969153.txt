I have tried to follow this thread from the beginning, but with nearly 1100 pages I can't be sure I've seen everything. I say that because this seems so obvious that it seems like it should have been suggested before, but I don't recall ever seeing it. Apologies in advance if it is old (and/or fake) news.

The method used to generate names in the original Elite is well understood, and cannot produce "raxxla" because the syllable "xx" does not appear in its list. But "ra" and "la" do. What if the "xx" were a simple substitution? The guys who were searching for Raxxla had some information about it. What if what they had were a partial name?

TL;DR I'm not saying it has to be one of the 31 planets Ralela, Raxela (too obvious?), Ragela, Razala, Racela, Rabila, Rasola, Rausla, Raesla, Raarla, Ramala, Rainla, Radila, Rarela, Raala, Raerla, Raatla, Raenla, Rabela, Rarala, Ralala, Ravela, Ratila, Raedla, Raorla, Raqula, Raanla, Ratela, Raisla, Rarila or Raonla. But I'm not not saying that either.
