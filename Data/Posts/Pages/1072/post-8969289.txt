I've found the Γαλλια / Gallia translation in several old, scanned and OCR'ed documents. I is translated to raXXla or raXXLa (always capital XX and small r).

It's just a result of the OCR software, misinterpreting the Greek letters. It would be very cunning by FD, if they used it in the mystery.

Some older mentions of this:

Thanks. I was absolutely certain I hadn't just imagined that. I'm not always certain about such things, but this time I was.
