RAXXLA Locations :: Elite Dangerous General Discussions
I submit that RAXXLA is located in the Cassiopeiae constellation. It is most likely in the Alpha/Schedar system. I do not have the time to investigate in game. I barely had the time to table-top investigate. I owe my wife & kids already big time. Being snowed in saved me a little. So who is out...

This is interesting too. He mentions several systems with beacons in them. Maybe we have to get the beacons find the systems and then triangulate them. He three. Maia, cupids arrow and one other system. What is in the middle of them?!

Chi Orionis and to our surprise it has a Tourism Beacon

Maia, ngc 7822, chi Orionis. All have beacons. What is dead center?!

Those are exact locations with coordinates too. So, that should be relatively easy to do.

Chi orionis: 4.3125 / -1.0625 / -27.90625
Maia: -81.78125 / -149.4375 / -343.375
S171 34: -2,426.84375 / 295.03125 / -1,323.625

I forget how to do this. But I think there was a simple formula I figured out to figure out distance between two or three positions using ED coordinates. It was a simple modification of A^2+B^2=C^2.

Edit: It's SquareRoot(A^2+B^2+C^2) That is the distance between two coordiantes. Have to figure out three then how to find the middle spot. Actually it's The distance between the two coordiantes. SquareRoot(|A1-A2|^2 + |B1-B2|^2 + |C1-C2|^2). So, negative and positive number increase distance.

So distance between stars are as follows:

Maia to Chi Orionis: 86.09375 /148.375/315.46875=SR(128947.8066)= 359.0930334Ly
Maia to S171 34: 2,345.0625/444.46875/980.25=SR(6657760.617)= 2,580.263672Ly
Chi Orionis to S171 34: 2,431.15625/296.09375/1,295.71875=SR(7677079.3)= 2,770.754284Ly

If that is the right info I have to figure out how to find the middle of that triangle. Not sure how to do that. Not even sure if this is a right triangle or not.

How do you find the center of this?!

NVM, me stupid. Just need to find the correct coordinate after that. Which shouldn't be too hard.

Does that only work with a triangle with a right angle?!

Edit: If it's 1/3 from the bottom it's approx 890ly from the base between Mia to Chi Orionis at an approx 90 degree angle. don't know how to figure it out exactly so I treated both sides with both longer distances as a right angle with 180ly distance and took the median between them to get the center line length. Then divided by three.

So, approximately 908ly from both Chi Orionis and Maia where the intersect on their given plane.
