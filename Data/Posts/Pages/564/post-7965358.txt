California Nebula is inside that triangle too, right?

That would be ironic if the one spot I stopped exploreing thoroughly had raxxla!! 8\ I was exploring NGC1333 completely when I died and gave up. I was going to do california next.

It's probably in there. I'm still trying to figure out the exact middle. I could use help on that. I'm not sure yet how to figure that out.
