It's not a system sadly. It's only a general location. still not sure how to find the exact coordinate because of lack of math skills. I have all the info needed though to figure it out.

If you want too. it's about 450ly towards NGC7822 from the LBN 623 headed away from the ceterline between Maia and Chi Orionis. But it's based on someones viewpoint of certain systems with tourist beacons. So, who knows if it's correct.

I think it's in the wredguia sector. And there is an interesting small cluster in the general vacinity there. Wredguia CV-G C10-#. I don't think it's exactly center though.

I call that the regeo parmeseano sector.
