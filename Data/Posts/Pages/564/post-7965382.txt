There are three elements to the Dark Wheel toast:
The jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies
The whisperer in witch- space, the siren of the deepest void
The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts
To find anything located in 3 dimensional space you need three coordinates. X, Y and Z axis. I think that if we can figure out which systems are referred to in The Dark Wheel's toast then we'll potentially have the coordinates for The Dark Wheel's home system. Something along the lines of: X coordinate from System A plus Y coordinate from System B plus Z coordinate from System C equals the X, Y and Z coordinates to find the One True Dark Wheel™.

If I follow you, Doc, I see one, two and three elements. Nothing which makes me think that the whisperer and the siren are the same thing (Never heard that the sirens whisper). Even less the grief, woe and yearning seem being the same thing to me.
But, watching them all together makes a poetic descriptions of Raxxla.

That jewel (TDW's lost preciouss) which whispers you can hear when you travel in witchspace, is like the siren's song that calls the Explorer to the deepest space and causes grief and woe among his family, but nevertheless he must set the sails to satisfy that yearning.

Sad poem. Raxxla really is the essence of TDW ambitions. Its raison d'être. They are Explorers and they don't care about politics and so. Never involved in the Bubble affairs.
Imho.
