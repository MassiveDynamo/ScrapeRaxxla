Maybe it's like the 1984 missions, but more advanced, with set conditions to trigger. Which could allow a personal journey, as the generation of the missions could be different per player.
eg: on triggering condition A, have X combat rank and Y credits, it generates TDW mission 1 on your next system jump. Which could clearly be a different system for another player.

yeah, that's also what I think. Additionally we probably need an elite rank in combat or triple elite + allied with the Pilots Federation
