The Horizon main menu background shows an Orbis Starport in a system with an A class star (or O class, it is very bright) and 2 or more bodies, 2 of which are very close. Eddb.io lists 3,964 systems with an Orbis Starport.

However, doing this

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(SystemName)) from [dbo].[tblEDStations]WHERE [Type] = 'Orbis Starport'

on my local copy I get 1,991 systems. Better than 3,964, but still too many systems to search.


I've found no easy way using edsm or eddb to narrow it further down using this guess for a matching system.

Other than importing the edsm nightly dumps for Celestial Bodies and doing a local custom search.

I suspect this is TDW stealth station & it can’t be found this way because it won’t be in EDSM etc until it’s been found.

I’m no programmer, is that an Excel command line?
