The Horizon's main menu image looks like a composite. If it was a real place the moons would need to be practically on top of each other or have a massive radius (Which is precluded by the massive ridges). The station in the images does admittedly look like an orbis gone dark.

There is a system near Sol, CM Draconis, that has a special system description, a white star, but no planets. The system description mentions it being populated ( albeit a low population anarchy with an economy) so that seems kinda strange.
