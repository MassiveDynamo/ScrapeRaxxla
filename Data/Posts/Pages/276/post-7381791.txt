Just going to throw this back into the mix:

Now its broadly believed DB meant to say 'number stations' instead of 'numbered stations'.

I'm still half of the opinion his intention was 'numbered' its an easy mistake to make I suppose but if you're going to leak something you'd tend to do it right....

Plus its the context in which its discussed. For instance DB is referencing another game where a clue was scattered throughout the game.

Now I wouldn't say 'number stations' correlate to that, their content that points to other content, not something hidden. 'Numbered stations' fits more into the context of a bigger mystery.

On this same note somewhere there's a FD post saying these number's on station entrances represent systems, as in where those stations are, but there was no diffinitive explanation on how those numbers related to planets etc, all I know is their all in Fed space. Probably nothing but like to get it resolved one way or the other.

I think Braben was referring to the unregistered Comms beacons and their seemingly random codes that they broadcasted.
