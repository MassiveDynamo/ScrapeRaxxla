Are you familiar with the Frontier Elite comic, by Dave Jones? Whoa great stuff.

Timeline in the comic says there were fossils found on Mars in the 2100's, and the first non-human relic in space was found in 2280's. Dates match with the timeline presented at remlok-industries.fr, compiled by the venerable Nicou, from various sources. However, his timeline goes even further stating that entire sources of fossil fuel were found. This means hyperspace was discovered at the same time it was learned that Mars used to be, what it once must have been: a habitable world. The non-human relic, found in space, Nicou subtly hints of being Thargoid in origin, but forgets to mention it was found on Mars too, as stated in tourist beacon 0175. Tourist beacon tells us nothing about fossils however. It's all very curious...

The old and mostly intact timeline was part of the Gazetteer, that came with Frontier Elite 2.

The fossils found Mars are probably just an indication that the planet had an ecosystem in the early days of the solar system. I don't think they were directly linked to the discovery of hyperspace.

The relic was found 2280, between the first and second terra-forming attempt of Mars. It's not unlikely that the relic enabled successful terra-forming, by providing alien knowledge.
