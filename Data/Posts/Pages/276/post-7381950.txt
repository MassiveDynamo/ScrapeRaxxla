Are you familiar with the Frontier Elite comic, by Dave Jones? Whoa great stuff.
http://www.frontierastro.co.uk/Comic/comic.html

Timeline in the comic says there were fossils found on Mars in the 2100's, and the first non-human relic in space was found in 2280's. Dates match with the timeline presented at remlok-industries.fr, compiled by the venerable Nicou, from various sources. However, his timeline goes even further stating that entire sources of fossil fuel were found. This means hyperspace was discovered at the same time it was learned that Mars used to be, what it once must have been: a habitable world. The non-human relic, found in space, Nicou subtly hints of being Thargoid in origin, but forgets to mention it was found on Mars too, as stated in tourist beacon 0175. Tourist beacon tells us nothing about fossils however. It's all very curious...
