I can't/won't read 368 pages of speculation, but surely the only way right now is to brute force systems with a Gas Giant with 8+ moons. I would also start at Sol and head in the direction of the Pleiades.

I imagine, if TDW coriolis is in game, it will appear as a USS when loitering long enough around the right moon. Or a string of missions, given via unidentified message sources when in the right place. But unless you find any relevance in the Astrophel and Stella stuff, brute force is the only way.

Also, as I have been away from the game for some time, did anyone find any info on the projected starmap from the Thargoid structures? Or are we going with "not in our galaxy"?
