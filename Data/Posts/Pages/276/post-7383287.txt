I suspect this is TDW stealth station & it can’t be found this way because it won’t be in EDSM etc until it’s been found.

I’m no programmer, is that an Excel command line?

I think you are right. The TDW station will not be in EDSM.

I also doubt the Coriolis station in the standard start up video is significant. That one has blinking nav. lights and seem fully powered.
