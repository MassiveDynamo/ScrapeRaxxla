Apparently some /later versions of the first Elite had a mission where you had to fight against a Coriolis station, taken by Thargoids. This would grant player the esteemed title of Archangel. I think it might be worth the effort to attack all Coriolis stations out there, while shouting:

WHY DID THE GROIGAN DANCE? / WHY WAS THE KANGAROO HAPPY?
