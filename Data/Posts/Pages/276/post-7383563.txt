This may be obvious. I'm not sure on previous speculation, but I think some of those stars are not stars. They are clusters of stars in the form of 2mass stars or similar. But from a slight distance.



Or are those something else. It seems like a strange arrangement to start with regardless. Or is that glare from the sun?!

And I'm with the above poster. I think our best bet is to figure out where that part of the galactic arm dust is from.

Are you sure that is not a wolf star or one of those really bright white stars. The white coloring is very thick.
