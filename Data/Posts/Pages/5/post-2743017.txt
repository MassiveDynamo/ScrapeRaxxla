Great finding, Macros!
This looks like a major breakthrough, congratz and rep for you!
Unfortunately, I'm not in the bubble, but i think here are more than enough good CMDR's to deal with it.

Question: Are there any hints of nebulae in the near of Raxxla? (I have arrived at my first nebula in the north-western quadrant)

EDIT: And here is my finding: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=116450&page=27&p=2736156&viewfull=1#post2736156

Good looking nebulae, Cmdr

I've found no references to Raxxla in context of a nebulae.
