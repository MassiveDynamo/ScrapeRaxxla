Hey, don't worry too much. FD might be highly seceretive and solving their puzzles can be a real nightmare at times, but there is always some logic behind it, no matter how twisted.

Just keep in mind some things:

1) The game isn't going anywhere. Take a break if its getting to you. You and others are on the forefront of this, and chances of someone else beating you few to the answer... well, its possible, and its not a bad thing anyway, but if you keep half an ear to the ground i'm sure you won't be left behind.

2) Whatever FD have planned might not be there in its entirity yet. You may have got as far as its possible to get at this time. It may be, for example, that Horizons will be required to move forward.

3) I doubt it will lead to a second galaxy regardless of what the lore indicates. We have a very big galaxy with many sealed off areas. Whatever the missions are leading up to, its probably something fairly local.

4) Good luck! Rooting for you to solve this.

PS: Once again, FD have stated people are overthinking things in relation to the alien artifact. Simplify. Don't get caught up in grand theories.

Hey, thanks for your positiveness folk. I Typically I'm a quiet one, so for me to start getting miffed, things must be bad lol.

So in the end I headed back to the Bub, and started boosting my dark wheel standing. First task is to get some audio samples off the BBs; but, if the folk are available to give me audio for the UA, I'll try that too.

I suppose I'd like to get involved in the storylines; and last weekend I tried (finding a UA), and like many other frustrated CMDRs, got nowhere.

I did get to trailblazer though.

Right! Can't play for a few days now, but when I see you again I'll have some audio for you... I have done SO many of those black box missions, didn't realise they had audio!
