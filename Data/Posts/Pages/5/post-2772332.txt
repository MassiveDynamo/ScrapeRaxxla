Hello CMDR's!

The last surveyed nebula in the north-west quadrant so far.
Here to find: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=116450&page=28&p=2772237&viewfull=1#post2772237

After 3 weeks of exploring (with about 10 hours per day) I am exhausted now.
And so I am on the way back home.
I have 'only' about 17,000 LY before me.
SPOILER

See you soon, CMDR's!
