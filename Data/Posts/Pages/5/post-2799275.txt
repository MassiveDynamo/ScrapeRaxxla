Guys, can I help if I am not Elite?

I am a Founder; not sure if any missions will be available.

My job is a problem solving job in real life, I'll take a look at the black boxes later. Didn't realise there were voices!

Essentially, this CMDR has broken himself through burning time in the UA storyline to absolutely no avail and a bit of chissling off of the game's enjoyment. Kind of stumbling around blind and without hope at the moment, trying to find excitment and purpose in an ENTIRE GALAXY. I need to leave the Pleiades before this all gets to me.

Let me know if I can help, CMDRs.

PS I can't find it now - did someone post a thread with a picture of Raxxla on the galaxy map?

PS Hi Dommaarraa

PPS Please help with advice guys I am REALLY struggling with this game at the moment

Absolutely you can help. Every single post a CMDR makes on the forums, and every single bit of keeping eyes peeled, every bit of random just before sleep thought, or random crazy idea helps. Some CMDR's are good at diligently looking at data for clues, others are great at exploring, some excel at crazy tinfoil thinking, some are all about the pew pew and lend their support to operations. In short, whatever you enjoy doing in the game, make that how you contribute your efforts, and if you're into RP weave it into your story.

So if you've gotta get out of the Pleiades, go. Go have some fun, do your thing. Your mind will still be ticking over and then at some moment you'll see something in game and make a connection, or wake up in the night and rush to the forums.

I hope that helps in some way CMDR.
