If you are looking for piles of Elite Missions, try the Canonn's proposed home system of Varati. I took 4 Obfuscating missions in 1 hit yesterday, all to another station in the same system. There are always many Sap 8 missions available to those with the rank.
The system is also the closest to Polaris.

Thanks, Cmdr. Will definitely check Varati out, heard that a bunch of Gr8Minds is hanging out at Varati, perhaps some of it will rub off?

Edit: Btw, can you remember if the missions were for different factions?
Edit: You're right Dommarraa, had 3 "Obfuscated In..." missions tonight at Bond Hub, Varati. Missions from Varati, Bond Hub to Varati, Forsskal Hub, this is a bit unusual for so many missions to go into the same system. This could be interesting.
