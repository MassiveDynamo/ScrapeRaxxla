I'm quite convinced atm that the missions are a big player in the search for Raxxla.
There are Elite missions that are connected to factions but not listed under their faction name too.

Convoys and pirates are being seen further out from the bubble, 600ly the last report I seen by explorers.
Might be an idea to get them to notice and plot where they are finding signals, the info could be useful in later patches.

Good find on the black boxes. I think I enquired about this earlier in the thread.
It could lend some clues but I doubt we will ever get a 'Raxxla is here' message.
Defo worth trying this tho but I'm no audio expert.
I think stuff is being added or unlocked atm and alot more will come with horizons.
