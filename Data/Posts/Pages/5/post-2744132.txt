Convoys and pirates are being seen further out from the bubble, 600ly the last report I seen by explorers.
Might be an idea to get them to notice and plot where they are finding signals, the info could be useful in later patches.

Yeah, I heard so, too. I make sure to investigate, if a signal appears. But until today I have never seen such a signal out here.
Perhaps it is only an expanding of the area in which they appear. But if Raxxla is somewhere far out, I doubt you can find such signals where I am at the moment (38,500 LY from Sol).

I and I Redeye said:
It could lend some clues but I doubt we will ever get a 'Raxxla is here' message.

And that would be a good thing. I only want clues, no "here it is"-messages. A statement from a dev however, that Raxxla is still somewhere out there, would be very desirable!
