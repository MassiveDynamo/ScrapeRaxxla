If you are looking for piles of Elite Missions, try the Canonn's proposed home system of Varati. I took 4 Obfuscating missions in 1 hit yesterday, all to another station in the same system. There are always many Sap 8 missions available to those with the rank.
The system is also the closest to Polaris.
