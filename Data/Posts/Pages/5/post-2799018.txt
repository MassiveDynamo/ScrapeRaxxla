Guys, can I help if I am not Elite?

I am a Founder; not sure if any missions will be available.

My job is a problem solving job in real life, I'll take a look at the black boxes later. Didn't realise there were voices!

Essentially, this CMDR has broken himself through burning time in the UA storyline to absolutely no avail and a bit of chissling off of the game's enjoyment. Kind of stumbling around blind and without hope at the moment, trying to find excitment and purpose in an ENTIRE GALAXY. I need to leave the Pleiades before this all gets to me.

Let me know if I can help, CMDRs.

PS I can't find it now - did someone post a thread with a picture of Raxxla on the galaxy map?

PS Hi Dommaarraa

PPS Please help with advice guys I am REALLY struggling with this game at the moment

Hi Cmdr, you can absolutely help, although I must admit that clues are scarce and far between. Getting the voice fragments from the black boxes (Founder or Elite, so you should be good) will absolutely be a big help. Best clues right now, and has been for some time, are the missions mentioned first in this thread. Please forgive my presumptuousness when saying that the best advice I have for you and by reading your post, is to search within yourself to find new strength by whatever means you can find. It could by taking a break from the hunt, whether that be the UA quest (which seems at an end for you) or this very hunt for Raxxla which is even more intangible and illusive than the UA quest, or go into the black to find the Abyss and win the staring contest to cleanse yourself. Perhaps even give yourself a vacation from Elite Dangerous (I know, it's crazy).

When I feel like getting an Elite boost, the image below is one of my favorites that I keep coming back too

I hope this was helpful in some small way, Cmdr.
