Hey guys, I'm new to the exploration of Raxxla, but I couldn't help but notice just now that a Coriolis station's shape, when view to show a hexagon, does not have equal sides, much like a recent post here mentioned with the "closer look at the Raxxla symbol". I think this may ward you guys away from looking into the 4D super cube you are spending so much time on. I'll post a couple ratchet screenshots from my phone (I can't get the images to upload from my phone, but you can find a Coriolis Starport near you and see for yourself), which are taken from an interesting diagonal-like angle. This was also taken of Auld Market in Cheng Den system.
