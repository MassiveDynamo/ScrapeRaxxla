A pass on from my previous post, the location from the Thargoid light show thing doesnâ€™t overlap with a single area and in fact after rotating it covers many areas in space where there are star systems. This is a little annoying as galaxys on the edge of ours move faster than the spiral arms of the galaxy that I am relating this two. I believe the gateways may only be used at certain points in time and the I am working out the last exact time where the areas could co exist, however relating to the tesseract idea I can confirm that the points overlap in the same kind of shape with the star systems IF the star systems where not moving but due to galatical rotation are not aligned as of right now
