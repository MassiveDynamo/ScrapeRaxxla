Did you take any pics? Maybe it looks like one of the videos with the station in it from the movies in the game file.

No I didn't - my main PC is running win7 which is incapable of taking screenshots. Somewhat irritating...

Maybe the Thargoids are the key to the mystery, there surface sites a map of there host galaxy and or a different dimensional version of ours.

Not much has been explored about Thargoid connections here - there has been some examination of the Thargoid portal that ships leave through, and the 'spiralling stars' have been likened to the display you discuss. However, 'Princess Astrophel' and the 'children's story' don't fit here.

Thargs weren't in the Gamma, so that goes against the 'Raxxla was in game since the Gamma' quotation, though we don't know exactly when the thargoid stuff was seeded in.

Our current hyperdrive technology is based, I beleive, on Thargoid tech which is where we get 'witchspace' from. So whisper in witch-space etc. is relevant.

I was always curious why it was that they took such exception to us invading the Pleiades and why the super-powers were so very keen to protect our expansion there and to begin a war with the Thargs. Could just be power and the promise of meta-alloys, I guess. Maia is an interesting place and the recent changes to the names in that area including Delphi is curious given the codex entries at the same time.

I suspect this is worth pursuing as an avenue of investigation. To make it work you need to tie in the other elements of the codex.
