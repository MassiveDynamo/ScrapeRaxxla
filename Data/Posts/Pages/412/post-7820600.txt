lets get Sirius here for a moment....

I know its been brought up many times before cough HZ.. cough

Sirius the dog star ... Hecates favorite animal. Also its been so long I had forgotten about The Grand Sirius Interstellar Expedition back in 3301.... which had us turning in exploration data and ended up in the wonders of Robigo Sothis and Ceos. Both Robigo and Sothis are gods similar to Hecate and related to Sirius. Ceos was a greek Island where they worshiped the star Sirius.

Anywayy thats where Im headed next. Working on the theory that Sirius itself was possibly settled with a purpose (possibly raxxalan) and this new set of systems was deliberately chosen for similar purposes... also randomly mapping places in the hopes it makes sense ...

Ah, that reminds me - whatever became of all those unmanned probes that Sirius sent out into the galaxy?!
