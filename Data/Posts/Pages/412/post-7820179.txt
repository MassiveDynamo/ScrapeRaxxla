I'm pretty sure that Vega existed in Frontier: Elite 2 and Frontier First Encounters so that its planets would have been named prior to Elite Dangerous. Since I doubt that the development of either of those two games gave any consideration to Raxxla I doubt the name has any significance INRE to our quest.

Vega was in FE:2 / FFE. Many of the old systems have different planets and planet names in ED though.
I can check FFE later, to see if the name exists.

In prinsipal there in nothing that hinders the use of old names in new hints. FD would have been free to adapt Raxxla clues to anything from the old games, even if Raxxla was not considered at the time of production.
