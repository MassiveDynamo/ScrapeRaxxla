Not much to report from Vega yet, but it has a planet called Trikora. Might be something?
I'm pretty sure that Vega existed in Frontier: Elite 2 and Frontier First Encounters so that its planets would have been named prior to Elite Dangerous. Since I doubt that the development of either of those two games gave any consideration to Raxxla I doubt the name has any significance INRE to our quest.
