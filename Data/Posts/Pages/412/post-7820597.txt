Neither F10 or PrinScreen work for me. Maybe FRAPs is what I need... thanks. Not sure I could bear win10 for the sake of screenshots

Try Alt and F10 should work, either you have something else mapped or its being saved to a folder you haven't located?

Not sure if Open /private still affects this but hi-res F10 will create some lag.

I'm still on Win7 and it its still working as intended.

Don't upgrade. Keep at it...
