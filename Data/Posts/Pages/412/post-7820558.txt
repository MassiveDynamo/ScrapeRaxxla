Not much has been explored about Thargoid connections here - there has been some examination of the Thargoid portal that ships leave through, and the 'spiralling stars' have been likened to the display you discuss. However, 'Princess Astrophel' and the 'children's story' don't fit here.

Would you mind telling me the basics of these?

I’m pretty good at puzzle solving due to my ridiculously high IQ and have only started thinking about Raxxla this morning. But here’s something interesting about the Thargoids, they are currently having a civil war according to sources and I believe there was something stolen in the myths surrounding Raxxla or something like that? Like a child or something? We don’t know why the Thargoids have an internal brawl at this moment in time but a reason for this may relate to this myth as this internal brawl has been occurring for longer than humans existence according to elite?
