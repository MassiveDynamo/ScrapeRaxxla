Thargs weren't in the Gamma, so that goes against the 'Raxxla was in game since the Gamma' quotation, though we don't know exactly when the thargoid stuff was seeded in.

Funny you should say gamma, there are a few star systems with the first name gamma E.G gamma leporis and gamma doradus and are two systems that CURRENTLY overlap with my areas I have identified but there are 33 areas in the entire Milky Way galaxy that also fit so I’m not so sure. Funny thing about both these systems, they are the brightest out of both there constellations and both relate to Greek mythology and Chinese alike, in these ‘burning jewels’ you speak of in a latter post perhaps bright stars?
