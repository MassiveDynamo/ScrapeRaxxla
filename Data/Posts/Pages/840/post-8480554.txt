Well before the FC came out in beta, someone showed the system map for Cygni X-3 on reddit claiming something to do with Raxxla. I won't guess at the method and mechanism (FDev assisted or not) or whether its a LARP. Regardless, its interesting. And you can try now using the FC in beta, its just slightly over 400 ly.


I think you and @Jorki Rasalas might be onto somthing!!!

I was looking at Cygni X-3 on EDSM and it hit me. WHY is it showing stars and black holes, ect in the system if no one has been there or can travel there? I thought EDSM could only show things that had been scanned by players? Or am I wrong there?

Either way, Freight Carriers! that might be the way to get there! Gives the oportunity too take a group of people all at one time, like members of TDW could likely travel together using a Capitol Ship for example..... Or how do FCs even work?, i havent really looked into them yet lol....
