Yep.
Imagine playing Elder Scrolls online and there being large swathes of the map that you can travel to.
Despite galaxy is huge, you cannot just add stars there unlike ESO. Because this Galaxy pretends to be true Milky Way. Sooo ... there is 1 thing u can do - find never visited (or minimal visited yet, like 1-2 ppl been there) and lock it out for the future story. So we cannot say next time "we were there and it was nothing".
