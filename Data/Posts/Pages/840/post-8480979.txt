Well, thats a loaded question....

First, there are some places like Titan? in SOL that are indeed permit locked for the Devs use.
We can infer from that there is most likely at least one full system that would be locked for the same reason, for allowing testing of things like FCs and Thargoid ships ect before releaseing them into the environment.
