I think you and @Jorki Rasalas might be onto somthing!!!

I was looking at Cygni X-3 on EDSM and it hit me. WHY is it showing stars and black holes, ect in the system if no one has been there or can travel there? I thought EDSM could only show things that had been scanned by players? Or am I wrong there?

Either way, Freight Carriers! that might be the way to get there! Gives the oportunity too take a group of people all at one time, like members of TDW could likely travel together using a Capitol Ship for example..... Or how do FCs even work?, i havent really looked into them yet lol....
I have no idea how it was scanned, but it was done by someone called Star Trader.
Maybe otâ€™s possible to find him and ask?
