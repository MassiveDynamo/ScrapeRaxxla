While we are on the subject, what is the actual purpose of having locked systems? I hear this whisper that they are placeholders for future development but that doesn't seem likely. Are they, like, secret development areas where devs can tinker with things while the servers are still up so as not to have to take them down? It all seems odd to me...and then you have the two that are at opposite ends of the bubble, equally far apart out in the black, middle of nowhere type deals and it just gets even stranger.
