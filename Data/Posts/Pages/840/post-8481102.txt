Has anyone setup or tried to setup an FC as like a starport, like with fuel and repair services?
I was thinking its a cool idea to get residual income from explorers in between Colonia and SOL as well as other places.... But I heard you yourself have to collect the resources that others use? im a bit hazy on the deets....
