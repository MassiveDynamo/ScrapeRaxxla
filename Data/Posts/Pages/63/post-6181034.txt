It's not uncommon to talk about the outer rim of a system, like in this article about the discovery of Sedna: http://www.spacedaily.com/news/kuiper-04b.html

Wow ! I love this (these) thread where so excellent (and patient) fellow-threaders help me to improve my teribble Anglich !
Thanks Han ! [yesnod]

Thanks Doc ! [yesnod]
