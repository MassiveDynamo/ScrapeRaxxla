So in your opinion " a certain celestial body, the key which is also the door, a place which isn't a place, the myth" is not "obfuscated in the outer rim " ?
These are the only things we know for sure in E: D about Raxxla. And they come all together in the same "clue". (I would add the " tiny little bit obvious" thing being the connection with TDW )

Actually ... it is a complete assumption that the the "obfuscated in the outer rim" missions were references to Raxxla. We don't know that as a fact. It could have been smoke and mirrors to put us off the trail ... or a reference to something different altogether.
