It seems to me that if we are talking about "rims" in the context of "The Dark Wheel" we might very well be talking about the outer rim of the Wheel and not the rim of a galaxy or a star system at all.

Yeah ..well..
"Answering the call of adventure"
"Obfuscated in the outer rim"
If this is not clearly an Elite Exploration mission .. I give up.
Others two are Elite Trade and Elite Combat.
But again.. being an E: D storyline, why not ? [haha]

Outer rim could mean the outer limits of a system, e.g. Shinrarta Dezhra. Obfuscated would then fit very nicely into that.

The mission-giver was not in Shinrarta. So if he means "outer rim" of a system he would mean of HIS system, otherwise he would have precised what system outer rim... IMHO
