Well.. THE outer rim is what is written. But, of course, due to the well-known far-fetched minds of our FDevs could be any "outer rim" of any possible "thing"...but I never heard speaking about "outer rims" of systems.
Never. Besides the Milky Way, I can imagine the outer rim of a Nebula, even of a cluster, even of the bubble ... but outer rim of a system ?...never heard. Did you ?
Besides, "outer rim" means there would be an "inner rim" imho not very adequate for a system.. but again, who is in the minds of our FDevs ?

It seems to me that if we are talking about "rims" in the context of "The Dark Wheel" we might very well be talking about the outer rim of the Wheel and not the rim of a galaxy or a star system at all.
