Sounds good, anything else?

There are so many possibilities. What we actually know about Raxxla is very minimal ... most of it comes from Holdstock's The Dark Wheel. There is a brief mention of Raxxla in John Harper's And Here The Wheel but nothing concrete to suggest it is anything more than a myth.

We who hunt Raxxla are little Don Quixotes ... each of us chasing our own windmills. Nobody can tell you that your particular windmill is any less of a giant than his or her own.

For me, personally, the quest has taken me into the writings of Robert Holdstock. He, by and large, created much of the mythology of the Elite universe in authoring the original 1984 game's user manual and the accompanying novella. He went on to write the critically acclaimed Mythago Wood series of novels but before then, even before Elite, Holdstock wrote many other works including The Alien World under the pen-name of Steven Eisler. It is there in The Alien World that many of the words and phrases familiar to Elite: Dangerous players find their origin. This includes Raxxla, The Dark Wheel, Thruspace and much else. It is my hope that Raxxla exists somewhere in the galaxy as an homage to Holdstock and somewhere among his literary works is the key to discovering the hidden location.

My notion could be completely wrong and so I encourage each of you brave Knights to dig in, imagine what is possible and go out tilting your own windmills. Nobody can really tell you "where to start" because ... you've already begun.
