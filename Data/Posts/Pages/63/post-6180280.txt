I found my calling

Started playing about a month ago, a couple weeks ago I was starting to doubt there was any ultimate goal for explorers. Then I stumbled across the name of a planet and a legend browsing the wiki. I've dropped everything and have put all efforts towards finding raxxla. My asp stands ready, where do I need to start?
