I have a couple of things on my todo list:
Map the orbits of Castellan Belt Cluster 2 & 4 in Lave
Obtain a permit for Lave 2
Create a star map of every star as seen from Shinrarta Dezhra
Then travel in-system in SC towards all unknown stars

What we actually know about Raxxla is very minimal ... most of it comes from Holdstock's The Dark Wheel.

So in your opinion " a certain celestial body, the key which is also the door, a place which isn't a place, the myth" is not "obfuscated in the outer rim " ?
These are the only things we know for sure in E: D about Raxxla. And they come all together in the same "clue". (I would add the " tiny little bit obvious" thing being the connection with TDW )
