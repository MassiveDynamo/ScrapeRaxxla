I thought i'd check Shinrarta Dezhra properly for POIs and tourist beacon logs. Nothing too exciting, but a bit more background info on the Pilot's Federation, and one passing mention of the Dark Wheel.
Also kinda interesting is Shinrarta Dezhra B3 (off star LTT 4550) is perpendicular to the plane. Do gas giants form like that, or maybe it's been captured?

Also did some deep space sweeps, in case there's a clue "hidden" much like Voyager 1 is in-game but obscured by distance and direction.

Shinrarta Dezhra to Sol, nope:

Shinrarta Dezhra to Sirius, nope:

Shinrarta Dezhra to Lave, nope:
