Well.. THE outer rim is what is written. But, of course, due to the well-known far-fetched minds of our FDevs could be any "outer rim" of any possible "thing"...but I never heard speaking about "outer rims" of systems.
Never. Besides the Milky Way, I can imagine the outer rim of a Nebula, even of a cluster, even of the bubble ... but outer rim of a system ?...never heard. Did you ?
Besides, "outer rim" means there would be an "inner rim" imho not very adequate for a system.. but again, who is in the minds of our FDevs ?

It's not uncommon to talk about the outer rim of a system, like in this article about the discovery of Sedna: http://www.spacedaily.com/news/kuiper-04b.html
