Nope, I was unprepared and shocked a bit
Tried to do two full laps around Sun in belt line at low speed - no luck Also there are SAR patrols in belt if you drop from SC.

Yes, there are SAR patrols throughout Sol.

I know what you mean, it doesn’t last long at all & I’ve only managed to capture 4 or 5 videos of around the 13 examples that I experienced. Which just adds to the frustration since the glows are fairly rare. If you’re on PC then I recommend Windows Xbox gaming bar software-allows screenshot, toggle video recording & save last X minutes of video (I use 5 minutes) using a keyboard combination, though I’ve now got it working from hotas button press using Voice Attack, though Joystick Gremlin or AutoHotKey or similar will also allow control from hotas.
