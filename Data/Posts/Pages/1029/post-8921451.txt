I was actually going to recommend Shadowplay if you're using NVIDIA, it's the primary way that I retroactively record videos and encounters. Very helpful since you can adjust settings to save your last x minutes of gameplay. I've also had issues with mine in the past but it appears to be working fine now, even if it does sometimes take a minute to render the clip.

I have such frustration and annoyance with NVIDIA software that I won’t use it again. A shame since I got the NVIDIA card on the basis of ShadowPlay. But wait until they bring out another update and you spend 2 or 3 days trying to get it working again, then multiply by well over a dozen times; that’s why I won’t use it!!!
