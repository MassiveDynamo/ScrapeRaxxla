Thought about using Voice attack? - you can set up a macro to do the recording for you without having to let go of the HOTAS. Pretty sure it has a trial license so you could try it with no risk.

Couple it with a HCS Voicepack and you can give the hands more of a rest all of the time with one of the Elite profiles....

I bought them when I was playing with VR and carried on using it when I use the HOTAS, can't recommend it enough.
Much more constructive And ya something ive been meaning to get... Voice attack would have come in handy for me this weekend... I dusted off the VR and tried looping around the astroid belt in sol ... no green flashes... but first time i got a look at the full Krait cockpit... Roomy
