I can confirm green light in belt too. Spotted it today. It's very hard to be in line with asteroid belt. I was slightly under it. Maybe you need to drop off SC when you are exactly in belt?

Did you manage to get video of the event? The more videos we have for analysis the more we may find out about this phenomenon.
