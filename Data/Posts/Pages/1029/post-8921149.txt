No new CG this week, instead lore-related content will drop from the Pilot's Federation for us to puzzle out via our receivers - something to 'find'...

Whilst it might not be directly Raxxla related, but could be a step on the journey we all have to take?!

SPOILER: SUPERCRUISE NEWS #20 - SNIPPET @ 21:00 MINUTE MARK

Happy with this path FDev, bring on more lore content.

Fly Dangerously,
Ra.
