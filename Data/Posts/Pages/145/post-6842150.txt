So, confirmed we have a NPC "Cmdr Rob Holdstock" and a real player "Cmdr Holdstock" ingame. What else ?[haha] Well.. as " we don't know what it is, though", seems that Raxxla is no longer " a planet with a portal which leads to.." nor a "certain celestial body"... Typical FD inconsistencies... We are looking for something we don't know "what" nor "where" it is and "the tiny part a little bit obvious" seems no longer to be relevant. And "there will be no clues".
Seems the "Raxxla concept" has "evolved" since the original novel and 2.4 (and MB exit). For better?
