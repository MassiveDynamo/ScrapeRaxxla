Just Tested: The Sap 8 Cores on the Guardian Structure site. No reaction. Just free-floated away. Same as at the Thargoid sites. Wasn't sure if someone tried it with the Guardians. It is now my theory that the Sap 8s don't have anything to do with Thargoids or Guardians, and are now most likely of Other-extraterrestrial origin. Soontill Relics as well.
