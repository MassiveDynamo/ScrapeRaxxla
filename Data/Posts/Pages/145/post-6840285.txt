Guys let's not forget David Braben's latest comment in the Beyond 3.1 QA session. It's kind of a big "what not to look for" clue, which affirmed some recent ideas I had on what to look for.

"Q: Does Raxxla exist?
There's an interesting one, what a silly question, of course. You don't know what it is though."


As I had mentioned in an earlier post. This isn't going to be an object that we see by Jumping, honking, and looking at the map. We're not necessarily looking for it as being a celestial object, but more like a hidden station...or probably more accurately a gateway to Raxxla. This can be hidden by a signla source, in an asteroid cluster (which nobody scans by the way).


So this means we're looking the wrong way. We need to start approaching this differently. With less than 1% of this game explored, at this rate, we can be at it several thousands of years and never find it (what it would take to fully explore the game). What we are going to be looking for is more of a puzzle. I think it ties into Sirius, personally. The Waypoint planet. The old way to access Raxxla used to involved flying around the Lave system, clockwise, twice and then jumping to Tionisia in no less than 7-9 jumps (back when jump ranges were very poor).

We need to find the gateway, or at least how to activate it and then maybe then we'll get some indication of a hidden system on a map.

Has it been considered that it may be part of a belt cluster? Out of all of the systems in the bubble I would think the majority of these remain unexplored due to their lack of financial reward.
