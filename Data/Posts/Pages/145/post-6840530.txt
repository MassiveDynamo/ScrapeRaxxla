Actually, now you mention it, it's a bit odd that there's no value to asteroid belts. You would think some would be pretty rich in minerals.

That's bothered me since day one when I spent an untold number of hours scanning belts. My thought process was, rings are the only place you can mine, creating revenue and raw resources, so these remote systems with rings inside them must be even more valuable in that they are not just planterary rings, but system rings...they must be teeming with resources!

But no, worth absolutely nothing. Go figure.
