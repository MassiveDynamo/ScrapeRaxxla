The only way I can think of to disprove this is to search every single one of them though. I have a feeling that, just "Looking" wont be enough. Just like a generation ship, you'd have to be damn lucky to find it without knowing which direction to travel in the system.
Yeah, it'd be a big task.

Also thouse "Obsefucated in the Outer Rim" I think applies to the Outer Rim of the bubble. Obsefucated meaning to make something difficult or to hide it.
It could be the outer rim of the wheel of course.

I have a hunch that The portal TO raxxla is in the outer rim of the bubble but its hidden really well.
What's this portal to Raxxla stuff? Not that it's strictly canon, but surely the only real stuff we have to go off is that there's a portal to another universe(s) on Raxxla.

Otherwise we would of found it. Look at how fast people find the Guardian and Thargoid sites.
As someone who was involved with the search for Guardian sites, I can assure you that they weren't discovered fast. The first site was found via triangulation of an image from a trailer. For a long time it wasn't known if there were other sites. Even when the lore came out to say there were others, we didn't find any. They were only found after Galnet articles told us which systems to look in. That was with a lot of people searching for weeks. Finding them independently only really became viable after the first completion of the Ram Tah mission, after which scanners were adjusted to show the Guardian sites. The other things that has made it easier to find them since then has been the establishment of a correlation with Braintrees and the other conditions for Braintrees being narrowed down as more of them were found.

In terms of the Thargoid structures, there were in-game things to direct to them, and the Thargoid structures all give directions to other structures, so that was just a case of decyphering it all and following directions. Despite all that, previously undiscovered sites around the Pleiades (structures and barnacles) have been found via the Eagle Eye pointers.

The known INRA bases were discovered partially via a trailer, but other than that, all fair and square and via in-game pointers.

Compare all that to the Raxxla situation...

(Btw, still lots Guardian sites to be found, judging from current maps, if you (or anyone else) wants to do a bit of searching! )

Someone just HAPPEN to stumble on Jaques Station from Frontier messing up.
Yep, and all legit there as well from what I've seen.

Histarium said:
With that said, maybe finding Raxxla is so obvious that you wouldnt think it'd be there.
Could be.

The best way to hide something is in plain sight.
Not sure that necessarily applies to things which can be very well hidden by other means!

We should be looking for anomalies ( and Im not talking game mechanics anomalies) visually or with our scanners when going through these places. If my hunch is correct, then physically finding it with your own eyes will be hard, but it'll be in a weirdly obvious place. "Why didnt I think of that before!?" type scenario.
Best of luck! Mk1 eyeball searching is a tough thing.
