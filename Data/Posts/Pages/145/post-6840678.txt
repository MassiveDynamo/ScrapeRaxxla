That's bothered me since day one when I spent an untold number of hours scanning belts. My thought process was, rings are the only place you can mine, creating revenue and raw resources, so these remote systems with rings inside them must be even more valuable in that they are not just planterary rings, but system rings...they must be teeming with resources!

But no, worth absolutely nothing. Go figure.

Yeah, its odd.

Difficult to say whether how odd though. It could just be that for where things are in 3304 asteroid belt mining is not a very worthwhile endeavour. Even extremely mineral rich bodies aren't worth very much, all told.
