Actually, now you mention it, it's a bit odd that there's no value to asteroid belts. You would think some would be pretty rich in minerals.

The only way I can think of to disprove this is to search every single one of them though. I have a feeling that, just "Looking" wont be enough. Just like a generation ship, you'd have to be damn lucky to find it without knowing which direction to travel in the system.

Also thouse "Obsefucated in the Outer Rim" I think applies to the Outer Rim of the bubble. Obsefucated meaning to make something difficult or to hide it. I have a hunch that The portal TO raxxla is in the outer rim of the bubble but its hidden really well. Otherwise we would of found it. Look at how fast people find the Guardian and Thargoid sites. Someone just HAPPEN to stumble on Jaques Station from Frontier messing up. With that said, maybe finding Raxxla is so obvious that you wouldnt think it'd be there.

The best way to hide something is in plain sight. We should be looking for anomalies ( and Im not talking game mechanics anomalies) visually or with our scanners when going through these places. If my hunch is correct, then physically finding it with your own eyes will be hard, but it'll be in a weirdly obvious place. "Why didnt I think of that before!?" type scenario.
