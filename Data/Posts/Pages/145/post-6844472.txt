Interestingly, the asteroid belt clusters in Lave are very difficult to drop into. Makes a good hiding spot lol. They orbit at speeds comparable to Mitterand Hollow, but it is much more difficult since you cannot see the physical object, and thus the projected trajectory of the drop zone.

I quit at cluster #4/5. I did the first three though (only one of the first three is like this. #4 is like this too).

Raxxla is giving you some skills you wont get anywhere else!
