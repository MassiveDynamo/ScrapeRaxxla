Just Tested: The Sap 8 Cores on the Guardian Structure site. No reaction. Just free-floated away. Same as at the Thargoid sites. Wasn't sure if someone tried it with the Guardians. It is now my theory that the Sap 8s don't have anything to do with Thargoids or Guardians, and are now most likely of Other-extraterrestrial origin. Soontill Relics as well.

If we're talking Soontill Relics, I did a big piece recently on lots of things, including Soontill and Soontill Relics, and current evidence for how it all ties in with the Thargoids, Guardians, and other things:

No Raxxla related stuff in there btw!
