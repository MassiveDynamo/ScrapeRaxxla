I'll be trying to stream my hunt from now on. If anyone cares to watch. XD Im thinking about doing a Youtube Series in the same format as Expedition Unknown or other History Channel like shows.

EDIT: Iv decided to search the area between the bubble and the LBN Nebula. A neat little purple nebula. There has to be a reason Sirius Corporation decided to build that direction. Sirius Corporation ties into "The League" as I call them, and is responsible for mining and construction projects in the Col 70 region. I know all of that is the Formidine Rift mystery, but perhaps they tied a bit of it in for simplicity sake. Who knows, its worth a shot and the LBN sector is barely ever talked about. Being the second closest nebula to the bubble.
