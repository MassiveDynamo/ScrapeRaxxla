Just Tested: The Sap 8 Cores on the Guardian Structure site. No reaction. Just free-floated away. Same as at the Thargoid sites. Wasn't sure if someone tried it with the Guardians. It is now my theory that the Sap 8s don't have anything to do with Thargoids or Guardians, and are now most likely of Other-extraterrestrial origin. Soontill Relics as well.

It was a possibility that SAP8 contained Guardian data crystals, which would logically be decoded by the Guardian Data Terminal. However this has now been disproved, so the likelihood is that they are Sirius Antimatter Propulsion -related (canâ€™t remember where that hypothesis came from, possibly Han_Zen; they might then be linked to the Metadrive storyline?).

Interestingly, the asteroid belt clusters in Lave are very difficult to drop into. Makes a good hiding spot lol. They orbit at speeds comparable to Mitterand Hollow, but it is much more difficult since you cannot see the physical object, and thus the projected trajectory of the drop zone.

I quit at cluster #4/5. I did the first three though (only one of the first three is like this. #4 is like this too).
i thought that disappearing asteroid behaviour had been confirmed a while ago by FD as a bug?
