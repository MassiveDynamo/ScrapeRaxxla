Not sure how long ago it was being discussed but the screen shot that was posted of the titlescreen is definitely Orion (the star in the middle of the logo is the last of the 3 in its "belt") ive been looking for years and inmho its there somewhere! I spent alot of time investigating Orion especially the belt regions the large part if that being spent at the middle star but as stated if this is a clue (and my original research /theory is correct ) then it would have been better spent at the third (cant remember the names atm but one reason i thought it was the center star of the 3 was becouse in game its the only one of the 3 named as its moden scientific allocation and not as its ancient astrological name! Also not sure if it relates but all 3 have black holes in their systems (unlike in reality)

Hope this helps as ive moved on now anyway
