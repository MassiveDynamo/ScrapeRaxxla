And if mulitplied totals: 0

And if divided, well: cannae do it, Captain.
I would guess that it's references to things.

So for example, 1-19 is the 19th letter of line 1. Or some similar thing. Pages and Words. Chapters and Pages. Verses.

It could be references to the text that was given, or more likely it's a 2 stage thing and the answer to the riddle gives what then need to be used with the references.

That's my guess for the moment anyway.
