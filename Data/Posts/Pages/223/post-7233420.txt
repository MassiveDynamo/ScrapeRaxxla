Sounds like a seasonal puzzle put together by someone with too much time on their hands. If it’s in-game then the source should be known and published, otherwise it’s just a distraction from the Quest for Raxxla .

Indeed, particularity as the image the riddle is in looks nothing like text that would be seen in game.
