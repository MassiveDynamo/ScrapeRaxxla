Has anyone noticed that when you fly out near the Horsehead Nebula and/or Col 70, the hyperspace tunnel starts spiraling rapidly around you? Spiraling stars?

Plotted a course towards Col 70 Sector now.
Before anyone gets too excited on this one...

It’s definitely not something that’s specific to just the Col 70 area.

It just happened to me and I’m about 15kly from there.

It’s happened many a time before though. Only reason I’m mentioning it is because of the post.

Also, have spent a lot of time in/around Col 70 and have never seen a noticeable pattern - though that’s not to say there couldn’t be one now, obviously.

Unless you’re talking about something different to the normal spinning hyperspace that happens occasionally @CMDR Woland92 ?
