RE: A few previous posts...

Indeed... I followed a link in the Thargoids and Guardians forum to this thread, and while I did call out Tacitus' first DBX discovery as "discovered back in September 2018", which is still true, it's led to me revisiting Tip-Offs, and creating a subsequent thread... tl;dr I think we need to start looking at tip-offs closer.
I wonder if more will become of the 'Mysterious Stranger' missions as well. Last time I had one of those was last year on an alt-account. Annoyingly it came while I was in the middle of a load of stuff and it had expired when I spotted it.
