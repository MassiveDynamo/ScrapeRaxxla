Has anyone noticed that when you fly out near the Horsehead Nebula and/or Col 70, the hyperspace tunnel starts spiraling rapidly around you? Spiraling stars?

Plotted a course towards Col 70 Sector now.

Edit: I saw some spinning, you can judge for yourself if witchspace was spinning rapidly.
Also I could jump straight through the Horsehead Nebula, halfway expected to be interdicted by Thargoids.
