None of my three accounts have yet to reach "Elite" in combat so I guess there's still some untapped gameplay to be had in that. Though, given the recent revelations about how easy cheating is in the game, it's become hard for me to look at a player's combat rank without questioning how they got it.
Meh*, ranks have been meaningless for a long time anyway. I'd warrant that the number of people who've got rank via cheating is absolutely dwarfed by the number of people who've got it via googling (or directly asking) 'what's the quickest / easiest way to get Combat/Exploration/Trade rank?''

The cheating thing is OT for this thread, so disregarding that...

It genuinely is very easy to legitimately get Elite in everything except CQC these days if someone chooses to go down that route. And some of it's been that way for ages.

Road to Riches. Passenger Missions. Even the Ram Tah mission at one point could be done following a guide in a matter of hours per run, and would pay out 201 MCr towards Trade Rank (at one point) or Exploration Rank (at another).

On it's own, the rank's not really much of a signifier of anything anymore. - Got to wonder how that's effected things like the Elite/Founder missions.

*With the meh being towards the situation, not your post, just for clarity!
