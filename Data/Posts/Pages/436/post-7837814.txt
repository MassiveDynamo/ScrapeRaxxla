Yeah.. Well... I just can't stomach the FSS. Hardcore exploration and sensible, exciting story lines were my only interests.
Explo had become a chore and about story lines... Just waiting for a real story teller comes again at FD.
But it's me and I'd love to be proved wrong. That's why I keep reading this thread even when I have ED shelved for months.
