Yeah.. Well... I just can't stomach the FSS. Hardcore exploration and sensible, exciting story lines were my only interests.
Explo had become a chore and about story lines... Just waiting for a real story teller comes again at FD.
But it's me and I'd love to be proved wrong.

Have you tried parallax exploration? It's the only reason I'm still playing the game.
