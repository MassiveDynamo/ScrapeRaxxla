None of my three accounts have yet to reach "Elite" in combat so I guess there's still some untapped gameplay to be had in that. Though, given the recent revelations about how easy cheating is in the game, it's become hard for me to look at a player's combat rank without questioning how they got it.

Come oooon, Doc !

Are you sure you always are doing all what it is needed ? Mmmmh ?
