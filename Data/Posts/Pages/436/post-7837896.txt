No, I didn't since the "early days of ED". Could be a way to do some outer rim explo, as hurry is not a point there.

I'm never in a rush, so it suits me - and it means I barely need to use the FSS.

Here's how I use it:

1. Honk
2. Open FSS
3. Examine spectrum to determine if there are bodies I may want to scan
4. Close FSS
5. Fly around identifying system bodies using parallax observations
6. Perform close fly-by of bodies to auto-resolve
6a. I may occasionally stop to check the FSS spectrum to see if I've located everything of interest

Depending on the system, I may also do the following after auto-resolving all bodies:

7. Open FSS
8. Zoom into landable bodies to check for biological/geological sites
9. Fly to identified sites and map the body

This process keeps the time I spend in the FSS to an absolute minimum and removes the necessity to play 'hunt the blob' and 'tune n zoom'. In addition, I feel a sense of achievement for every body I find by parallax, especially those off the orbital plane or long distances from the drop-in point.
