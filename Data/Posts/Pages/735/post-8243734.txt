Its the ghost in the machine.... the background simulation... randomius factoria!

randomius factoria is the key. remember that the procedural nature of Elite was its great feature since the start, and the great innovation from the original team. RAXXLA, whatever it is will be generated on spot under certain circumstances (and maybe some random factors: exact location?). That's why no one can find it by chance. Now think of the rules, and the amount of code needed to get them there. It should be easter egg sized as it most probably isn't gameplay related. No point of coding something huge no one will see.
