I'm sure what I'm discussing below in relation to the diagram has probably already been covered, so apologies in advance if it has!
(please drop a link to any previous posts about it if you have one.)

I dredged up my screenshot of a Thargoid Sensor and checke the Wiki, and comparing with the line drawing circled in yellow below it certainly appears to match right down to the number of >. Therefore I assume therefore the flower-like objects are actually Thargoid Interceptors, since they also appear to match.

This leads me to an interpretation of the visual below, which to me appears to be the top cross-hatched section might represent 'normal hyperspace' which you could be interdicted by an interceptor from (and personally have been), but if you're using the 'correct' Thargoid object and perhaps a gateway (Raxxla?) you can enter and exit safely to the alternate location(s).

So, have the other two objects that I haven't been circled below been clarified yet or are they perhaps Thargoid stuff we haven't yet seen/discovered, and are they covered in a distortion field because they're partially in the other dimension all the time?
