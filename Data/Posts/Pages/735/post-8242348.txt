It's a VA from what I found on EDDB. Maybe it's the picture, but it's very red.

No, Maia A5 & A5A:

don't match the codex TDW station pic (colour adjusted to corredtly show the station lights versus those of Aulin Enterprise:

The station pic shows an M subdwarf from what I can tell.

Edit: the likeness gets better if you match the distance so the star & planet sizes match the codex pic; this pic is an old one from Jorki’s records, I forgot to take one as Tyko when investigating my Eden-Ygdrasil hypothesis (a few pages ago!!)....

And Witch’s Reach star is a red subdwarf

Ah, perhaps it’s not!
