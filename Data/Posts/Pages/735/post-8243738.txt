Makes me wonder if it's related to not having done anything against the faction. If so that could by why there is a reset commander thing. Which gets into the concept of being reborn potentially to do some things.. Or at least potentially.
I hadn't thought about that angle. Interesting.

It was probably the first specific instance I can think of where I did something explicitly against TDW as a faction. I'd done missions for non-allies of TDW, which would have a negative impact on their influence, but not a specific targeted attack against them.

I think I'll go about re-doing some missions first before I trigger a reset though. ;-)
