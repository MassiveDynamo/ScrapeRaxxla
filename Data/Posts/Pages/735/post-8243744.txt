To clarify for Noobilite & Macros, the 'Legendary' I mentioned was noted within the TDW Aide Charlotte Reynolds' comment section that you see when you go into the Mission section.

The image below is what I have now after performing the assassination mission and losing status, and then ramping back up to 100% (or more?) Allied status which no longer mentions that.

Prior to performing the mission I specifically was looking at the comment and it mentioned something along the lines of "Your legendary reputation proceeds you, Commander RaNaketh." (or something close to that). It's why I commented I wish I'd taken a screen shot of it before I did the assassination mission as it's the only time I've noted that word used.

So I'll be re-doing/continuing my operation less than three missions which I've been keeping track of in my spreadsheet to see if I can re-obtain that statement from the Aide.

Hmm, I just added up the missions I'd been doing and had 90+ recorded, which means I'd probably done just over 100 of the specific Founder / Elite missions for allies of TDW before I noted that comment. I hope I haven't reversed 100 missions worth of effort with that single mission, but I fear that might have occurred!



Fingers crossed I get the comment again, and hopefully that helps clarify my previous statement a bit.
