Ooo, I can't say definitively the same as I didn't get a screen shot, but looks about right.
So the real question is, does that appear in any other NPC 'Aide' text, or is it specific to TDW in SD?

Well I've been refreshing and the Aide for Future of Arro Naga in SD gives me the same text after a while.

Edit: So does the Aide for Sol Constitution Party in Sol.
