Got unbanned finaly ...took less then 4months. Will see if for long as they still "investigate". So back to topic and driving home. Sooo ...same weird results. Once you pass from Mare Somnia to Karina Arms - it is flooded by life. I stopped to count phenomenas tonights after 10th system.
Here a bit: https://inara.cz/cmdr-logbook/184758/42872/

Also sectors near Earth have a lot of bio signals. While top-map sectors have it near zero. Example, met 1 only in Mare Somnia and it was couple hops to Karina left.
So concentration of life is different assuming I do same jumps pattern (and I do).
Why ?
RAXXLA is a seed?
