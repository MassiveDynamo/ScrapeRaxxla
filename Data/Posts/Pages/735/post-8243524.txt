Ok So ran across this today. ( I know its not a hexagon... but stilll)

I was watching Numberphile(subscribe if you haven't) on youtube and there was an interesting video about trajectories along dodecahedrons today... And he mentioned the Double Pentagon ... had a cool tat for it too. So I looked that up and found this:


From a paper "Periodic paths on the pentagon, double pentagon and golden L " by Diana Davis and Samuel Leli`evre

1/3/33 ...
Also from this paper (below) is a pattern created from a tree word of 303n1. It avoids the center... and creates a familiar pattern.




Currently has me looking into Veech Surfaces...
