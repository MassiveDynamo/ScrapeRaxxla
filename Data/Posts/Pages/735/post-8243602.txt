Anyone try to correlate permit locked systems/regions to descriptions in the toasts?

Jewel that burns on the brow => Polaris (locked)
Whisperer in witchspace => col 70 sector fy-n c21-3 (locked)

If they correlate, perhaps one of the matches isn't locked.
Mother of Galaxies?
Yearning of our Vagabond Hearts?
Lover's Woe?
Parent's Grief?
Siren of the Deepest Void?

I can't think of any permit-locked systems off the top of my head that would match any of these.
"Siren of the Deepest Void" sounds like it could refer to the Formidine Rift, where (I seem to remember) people in Project Dynasty ships heard something in witchspace.
Salome also said that something was in the Rift that was much more dangerous than the thargoids. I can't help thinking that Raxxla and the Formidine Rift are connected, even though they probably aren't.
