No I'm on ps4, I made the mistake 20+ years ago and bought a Sega saturn instead of the first Playstation and been dedicated Sony customer ever since. There are actually a few filthymicks on ps4. I'm sad I had to put numbers in my name since I'm probably the oldest of them (guessing)
Jamesons and red bull is a popular drink!
