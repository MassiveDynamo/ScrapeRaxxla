Yeah I agree. I felt the Ram Tah missions might be linked to the mystery to. But then I thought how unfair it would be to link that sort of mystery to such a high level of combat play. Essentially, you get to a point where you start requiring Thargoid hearts, if I recall. That's fine, for me, but to some others that means having a Corvette, or Cutter...until you get good enough to do it in smaller ships...and even then it's still damn hard. I am personally not that good and have to be in my Cutter to take down Interceptors. But, still...worth a try. I re-attempted the first Tah mission, recently. It still seems bugged. Can't finish it. But I got a nice 94 million payout...plus the exploration data payouts.
I cant take down an interceptor in ANYTHING! So your one up on me.
