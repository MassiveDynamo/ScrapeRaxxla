It does look very similar to NGC 7822 nebula that i have been known to mention every now and then. I just happen to have some pics on hand from a few varying angles and distances...

I've never seen it from the formadine rift region to compare but thanks for giving me the opportunity to share these again
The NGC neb is nice I’ve been there myself too. I thought at first that that was what it was at a distance and I was seeing the stars prior to seeing the gases but no. I made sure I found the cluster in question before posting. It is not part of a nebula.
I have to look at another post here tho seems maybe it’s already been discussed and perhaps it’s simply a stellar forge anomaly or a misplaced thing. But it’s Deff a string of stars like you’d find in a neb, but Deff is not in a nebula.
