Another thing that caught my eye was a post about something I had totally forgotten. About. The weird “deep space signal”. There’s a signal audible to your ears anywhere in the galaxy if you point your ship close to Sag A*. It repeats regularly and nobody has found the source yet. First thing I thought of when I heard that was, well there’s really only one weird signal from the Direction of Sag that I can think of and that’s the “WOW!” Signal.
people have run the Game signal through audacity to get a spectrograph and they get this “mountain” looking image. Plus another that looks like a curly tail and another that looks like a sideways A.
Attached is the “mountain” and what it suspiciously looks like. It looks a heck of a lot like the Sag Constellation. Where the Wow signal came from. And a star map showing the origin of the wow signal, near as we can get it. The map also has the “curly tail” people talk about.
Might be an Easter egg. Might be a hint.
