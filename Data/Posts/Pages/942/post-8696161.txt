regarding start clusters from Spitzer, I cant remember exactly, but there are a number of clusters like NGC - was a couple of years ago

The landscape signal has had a lot of attention in other fora, such as the IRH discord, and some effort was made to triangulate its source, ultimately concluding that it was somewhere between systems near Sag A*.

I'd personally say its an attempt to represent the microwave background as ear candy, but I'm happy to be proved wrong.

Previous pictures encoded in spectrograms like the Thargoid sensor/probe stuff were much more definitively interesting.
