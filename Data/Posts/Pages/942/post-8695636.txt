Got a tad of an anomaly idk if anyone has checked out before. I’m currently in GLUDGOE NC-B C27-31 and out my left window is the bubble nebula. Out my right and behind me is the heart and soul. However, ahead of the heart and soul by a bit is a string of dense luminous stars like the kind of string you see coming through certain nebula like the Orion Neb. However, search as I may there is no nebula there.

You may have missed this that I posted previously:
