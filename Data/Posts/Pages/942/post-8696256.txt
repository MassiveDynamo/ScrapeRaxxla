I'm sort of heading towards that thinking, and have the fire-power to handle the intercepts.
I just paid off a 3M bounty on my Vette after my last berserk gaming session from a while back, and cashed in 30M of bounties across varied groups at the same time.

First thing will be to ally with NBC, and others directly opposed to TDW in SD. Sort of reverse Operation Less Than Three.

I'm also thinking as a personal journey to complete the Ram Tah Guardian missions, as I suspect there might be soft triggers for getting an invite to qualifying as a 'legendary explorer, adventurer etc'.

Yeah I agree. I felt the Ram Tah missions might be linked to the mystery to. But then I thought how unfair it would be to link that sort of mystery to such a high level of combat play. Essentially, you get to a point where you start requiring Thargoid hearts, if I recall. That's fine, for me, but to some others that means having a Corvette, or Cutter...until you get good enough to do it in smaller ships...and even then it's still damn hard. I am personally not that good and have to be in my Cutter to take down Interceptors. But, still...worth a try. I re-attempted the first Tah mission, recently. It still seems bugged. Can't finish it. But I got a nice 94 million payout...plus the exploration data payouts.
