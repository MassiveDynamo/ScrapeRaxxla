Hey, all.
I don't know if this has been brought up, but has anyone tried allying with Sirius - Hyperspace? And Sirius - Drive? They are subsidiaries of Sirius Corp and non-player minor factions at that. They seem quite obvious, so I'd be surprised if nobody has.

It's not uncommon to hear theories speculating that certain drives may be required for permit sectors, Guardian/ Thargoid homeworlds, dark systems (rogue planets)...or even RAXXLA. Yes, I know, "dark systems were removed from the game..." or were they?
I am one of those who believes that either some sort of wormhole drive, MetaDrive (Sirius) may be required...whether this is an off-grid engineer/ modification, completely different drive, specialized fuel, or item you carry.
