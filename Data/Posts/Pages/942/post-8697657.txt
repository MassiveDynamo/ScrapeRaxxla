Just finished Holdstock’s Eye of The Blind. Not terribly impressed, & no clues that I could see
I read “and here the wheel” as well as DW’s books. All of them were good I thought. I managed to get ahold of Harper on FB some time back to ask about discrepancies between the book and the game like why Soontil doesn’t match the books description and why the trash world is mentioned in game and claimed to be in the system but isn’t there at all. And if he was of the opinion that Ryders secret station, kept at low power hidden in an asteroid belt” was in game or not. He said he doesn’t know why there are discrepancies but that the main points of the stories and name places etc were given to him by FDEV and had to be included. DW, if I remember right, said that he thinks everything from his first book has been figured out but there remains some things from the second which haven’t. Harper was of the same opinion, that there were things from his book that were in there by request of FDEV which hadn’t been found or done yet but was either not at liberty to say what or wasn’t privy enough about them to say how.
