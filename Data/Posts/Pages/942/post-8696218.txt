regarding start clusters from Spitzer, I cant remember exactly, but there are a number of clusters like NGC - was a couple of years ago

The landscape signal has had a lot of attention in other fora, such as the IRH discord, and some effort was made to triangulate its source, ultimately concluding that it was somewhere between systems near Sag A*.

I'd personally say its an attempt to represent the microwave background as ear candy, but I'm happy to be proved wrong.

Previous pictures encoded in spectrograms like the Thargoid sensor/probe stuff were much more definitively interesting.

The CMB is more or less omnidirectional. It has features but they’re essentially on the surface of a sphere 13billion light years in radius (with us at the centrepoint of the sphere). Would be very odd for them to represent that as originating from near Sag A.

To the best of my knowledge it represents real life radio sources.

(As I always say though, I can’t remember where I heard that and don’t have a source. The story does however check out. That doesn’t mean that FD aren’t doing something more with it however, especially as what all the radio sources are is not known IRL. For example, see: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01310 )
