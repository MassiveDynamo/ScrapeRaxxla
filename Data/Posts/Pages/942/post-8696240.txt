The CMB is more or less omnidirectional. It has features but they’re essentially on the surface of a sphere 13billion light years in radius (with us at the centrepoint of the sphere). Would be very odd for them to represent that as originating from near Sag A.

To the best of my knowledge it represents real life radio sources.

(As I always say though, I can’t remember where I heard that and don’t have a source. The story does however check out. That doesn’t mean that FD aren’t doing something more with it however, especially as what all the radio sources are is not known IRL. For example, see: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01310 )

Forgive my imprecision, I meant radio sources rather than CMB - I agree. CMB is omnidirectional and essentially contant to 1 part in 10^5
