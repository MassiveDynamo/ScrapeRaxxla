Personally, I would look for it in the galmap or find systems in that direction and go check it out (the latter being much slower than the former unfortunately). That's how I found ngc 7822 in the first place.
Did do that I have a pic for ya. Comes out wicked dark for some reason but I circled the cluster and made sure a name was highlighted.
Edit: itâ€™s not letting me attach the picture to the post ugh. I did post one of the stars names earlier tho.
