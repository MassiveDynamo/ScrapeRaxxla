I Deff missed it. It could be just a stellar forge “oops” I do suppose. We may be talking about the same cluster here. It’s Deff not the NGC neb. I’ve been there a bunch of times and I made sure to actually locate the cluster on the map before posting and it’s not within a neb. It’s also nowhere near Barnards Loop so it’s not the misplaced cluster. they were discussing either. What was it you were saying about a lighthouse?”
