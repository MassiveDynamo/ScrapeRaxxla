There are some interesting named planets in those two systems- of course trikora in vega and lowings rock in altair

Lowings rock possibly referencing cows rock … eye of ra? Awwwww nevermind - its Lowlings rock - bummer

For those who dont believe in Gan … please continue to do so
Not sure about the planet names, but I did smile when I spotted the faction 'Vega Bridge Interstellar'.

A Vega interstellar bridge, would be nice to find.
