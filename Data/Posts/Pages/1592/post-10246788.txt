Not sure about the planet names, but I did smile when I spotted the faction 'Vega Bridge Interstellar'.

A Vega interstellar bridge, would be nice to find.

Ya if we are looking at the path of souls -

Crossing the milky way (river) is probably an important part - and vega /altair make for a good crossing point. I remember earlier thinking the point would be where the ecliptic and the milky way crossed…
I have been thinking it had to do with the two circles metaphor…. But ya maybe a fresh look is in order.
