Remember that FD confirmed the Polaris permit was not accessible. It’s effectively narratively locked. Although granted we don’t know ‘when’ it will be or has been unlocked!

‘If you require a permit for a system, the system that issues the permit is likely the controlling faction. This and further information can be viewed in the Galaxy Map.

Not all permitted systems have a permit that is able to be acquired in the game. Polaris is one of these systems, and it is currently not accessible by CMDR's at this time.’
