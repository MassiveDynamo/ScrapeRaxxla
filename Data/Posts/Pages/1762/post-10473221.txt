The Ouroboros from the Darkwheel
Just to clarify, are you referring to the Ouroboros logo on the wiki? or is there another source for the ouroboros motif or mythology?

Wasn't this a fan creation and not official?

Unless you are implying the codex logo is a heavily abstracted ouroboros, which is certainly valid. Similarly with the wheel symbolism -> eternity / cyclical, world serpent surrounding the cosmos etc. The bar symbolising an axis mundi and four 'pillars' holding up the world.
