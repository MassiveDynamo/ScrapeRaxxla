DB did state Galnet lies, like many forms of press, ruling parties do interfere and polarise news to manipulate the narrative.

But I would hope this doesn’t apply to the Codex, which is not strictly Galnet; although it is all run by the same group of powerful people!

One of the saddening aspects of FD was this factor, that FD can and will utilise Galnet to direct players down particularly paths, by obfuscating narratives.

It’s saddening because we as consumers can’t actually rely on it for factual information; which works for FD as they can be non committed over various promotions, but I suspect its more likely one of FD failures - communication; players don’t do X because it’s obfuscated; players do Y because it’s easier. So FD decides to opt for path of least resistance, how much of that is by design?

Pessimism aside, I’d like to assume that the Codex, as static, as so is technically ‘new data’ and as such is reliable. The existence of Lyta Crane as a persistent character in game, might lend this more credence.
