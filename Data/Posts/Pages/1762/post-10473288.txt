Just to clarify, are you referring to the Ouroboros logo on the wiki? or is there another source for the ouroboros motif or mythology?

Wasn't this a fan creation and not official?

Unless you are implying the codex logo is a heavily abstracted ouroboros, which is certainly valid. Similarly with the wheel symbolism -> eternity / cyclical, world serpent surrounding the cosmos etc. The bar symbolising an axis mundi and four 'pillars' holding up the world.

Wheel symbolism might also suggest orbital motion, however I've always felt that it is a stylised toroidal station. Now whether that station actually exists in-game, or is just a storyline motif is a different question.

The only sources we have for a stealthy station related to ED are the codex (Lyta Crane paragraph- and the phrasing of that leaves lots of doubt over her veracity) and the novel And Here The Wheel, where the CEIP had one. Did FD decide to expand on the theme of Holdstock's novella with a play on the TDW name, or is it just marketing/obfuscation? One suspect paragraph in the codex has given rise to much gameplay... I'd feel a little more confident about its existence if there were any other in-game references.

DB did say game characters can lie....implying they have and do, but we dont seem to have analysed that.
