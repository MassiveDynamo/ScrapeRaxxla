Thats the "stars", from when you select a system with multiple stars. Any system with multiple stars, if you're zoomed in like that, will show the secondary star. It wont be selectable.
Thought that before but the first system has 3 stars and two showed and then one disappeared...

Probably a bug... Will go back and check at some point...
