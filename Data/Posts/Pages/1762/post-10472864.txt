Alright Folks, Here is my part two, of my 365 days of investigating Raxxla.

In the last post I broke down why I think the Quote in the codex entry is in reference to Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Perseus.

I have made one small change at this time in my research (about Day ~150). I found some star charts that reference Caph, or Schedar as the "brow" of Cassiopeia.

So lets start following that trail, because its interesting, and all with in the scale that the foundation lies: Raxxla is likely within a few hundred, maybe thousand LYRs of sol/original systems.


So if we start at sol, and target schedar, we get the "Jewel that burns" (see last post)
And if we go to Schedar, we see the binary system. But interestingly, there are two stars, almost identical in every stat, a few thousand light seconds away.
If you go out to them, ( I flew a little further to show the stars that I saw easier) and then point back at the jewel that burns, you see:




What do those stars around Schedar look like?

The Ouroboros from the Darkwheel




Interestingly, even though this star is in the bubble, there are very little named stars around it.

One of those systems, in the direction of Delphi, is "Adhil"

Adhil is a real star, part of Andromeda. It means her "tail" (ouroboros...), and is very close to Schedar, the brow of cassiopeai



So if you jump there, its unremarkable. But if you target Delphi....



it is 229 Light years away, and pleiades is giving a nice tail to Delphi.
