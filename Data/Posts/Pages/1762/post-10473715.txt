Well, I'm currently 1970ly (hence my previous "off-topic" discussion on engineering the Mandalay) from Sol; admiring Alnilam (Epsilon Orionis) from within the B star- a black hole, having tested my latest hypothesis.

I've often thought that a BH would be a good in-game implementation of the Omphalos Rift. And I've previously (2018) mooted that the start screen Elite "Griffin's" horns/ears might be pointing a hint at something (to me the "Griffin" is more reminiscent of Horus) . Someone long ago said those three aligned stars just above its head are Orion's Belt. I'm prepared to believe it if we accept the rest of the constellation is rather squashed.. On this trip I've visited all three Belt stars (Alnilam, Alnitak, Mintaka, the latter is the brightest & between the "ears"), two have BH ... I've dived both honking like mad but not found the Omphalos. Now for a long trip home!


Edit
Compare the curvature of Barnard's Loop against my earlier pic of the other start screen Coriolis station (TDW??)
