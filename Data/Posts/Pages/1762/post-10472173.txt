Personally, I think Raxxla is a body with a ring.

what station is this?

is that an Earth like with a moon, a water (water gas) with rings and 4 moons, and a gas giant (with a a little water, a lot of hydrogen, and a little helium) with 1 moon?

I also see a repeating pattern of exactly 6 and 4 trees. 4 on the big moon, 6 on the second big moon, and 6 on the earth like. And then 6 encompassing it. And 6 benches as well, 2 around the big gas, 2 around the 1st moon, and 2 on the path to the water with rings
