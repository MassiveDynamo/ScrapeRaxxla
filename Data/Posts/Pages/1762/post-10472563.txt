To my mind the left panel of the garden design is so strongly representative of Milton's cosmology that it cannot be coincidental...
But that could also be intentional obfuscation to guide us down a mythological yellow brick road.

I agree, but I think if intentional its intent is far more likely literal. X marks the spot.

The only other alternative is it could be an example of group pattern bias. Where we are interpreting random data and through group consciousness we are willing it to fit the hypothesis?
