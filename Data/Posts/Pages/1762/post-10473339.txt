Wheel symbolism might also suggest orbital motion, however I've always felt that it is a stylised toroidal station. Now whether that station actually exists in-game, or is just a storyline motif is a different question.

The only sources we have for a stealthy station related to ED are the codex (Lyta Crane paragraph- and the phrasing of that leaves lots of doubt over her veracity) and the novel And Here The Wheel, where the CEIP had one. Did FD decide to expand on the theme of Holdstock's novella with a play on the TDW name, or is it just marketing/obfuscation? One suspect paragraph in the codex has given rise to much gameplay... I'd feel a little more confident about its existence if there were any other in-game references.

DB did say game characters can lie....implying they have and do, but we dont seem to have analysed that.

Logos can be (and well-made ones usually are) multilayered - so it can be the stylised silhouette of a toroidal station structure, as well as the ideological wheels of mythology representing the nature of TDW.

I don't see why FDev would avoid the opportunity to leave a honeypot of clues waiting for players to find. Like Beng mentions, TDWs hidden station would form the perfect door and key for us to unlock the path to Raxxla's whereabouts. As always it's speculation of course which is frustratingly where these threads of inquiry keep leading to with no satisfying morsels to chew on.

Onward the wheel turns....
