Just to clarify, are you referring to the Ouroboros logo on the wiki? or is there another source for the ouroboros motif or mythology?

Wasn't this a fan creation and not official?

Unless you are implying the codex logo is a heavily abstracted ouroboros, which is certainly valid. Similarly with the wheel symbolism -> eternity / cyclical, world serpent surrounding the cosmos etc. The bar symbolising an axis mundi and four 'pillars' holding up the world.

I was thinking the spiralling stars is connected to the dark wheel with the Omphalos Rift, since they would be the one that knows, or once knew, where it was. spiralling stars from the side will like triangles.

I believe Raxxla and the Dark wheel are separate and intertwined. Like we can find Raxxla, but getting the dark wheel gives us the story.

This is only part 2 and about halfway through the full year I spent researching it.
