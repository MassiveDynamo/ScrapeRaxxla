what station is this?
The Tourism Station archetype appears in any system that meets the right type, economy, and population factors.

Some good discussion on these garden designs earlier in the thread. Possibly a double meaning as both a reference to Milton's prose and an in-game system map.

Emperor's idea is a good fit with the Dark Wheel's hidden station, and your pattern of trees and benches brings up a good point.


A pattern could indicate a code:
The 2-2-2 seat relationship could be showing the body "within" the largest shape is included in the group of moons - ie. The symbolic 'pendent world' also forms part of the moon system.
Similarly the largest body has 2 pine trees, with another 2 pairs either side of #4 - possibly distinguishing it from #4?.
#1 is 'unique' in having 4 pine trees.
#5 and #7 bodies share the 6 pine trees.
#5 has a variation with 4 bench seats which could be a symbolic variation of #1 with the properties of #5 and #7.
#7 and #4 both have what I assume is water (or also ammonia?).
#4 has 10 lights surrounding it
#8 appears to be in orbit of #7 due to the line 'surrounding' #7.
#2, #3, #5, #6 & #8 all have the plain crazy paving pattern - indicating they may be something common or 'unremarkable' such as ICY and ROCKY bodies

So therefore, some possible results could be determined:
If #1 is an earth-like world (meeting the parameters of Eden / Paradise), then, with the symbolic '4' relationship one could say #5 is an ammonia world.
Then if we say ammonia worlds are habitable by Thargoids, then this means #7 could be a Water World (ie habitable by humans) - based on the chosen element denoted by the pond, and by the fact that #1 eliminates ELW.
If #7 is water-based, then this means #4 could be a Water Giant.
Similarly, if the largest body is a Gas Giant, then it has a composition which includes Water - or maybe Hydrogen + Oxygen and two other elements (Chaos and Empyrean). Maybe it is one of the rare Green Giants?

An alternate interpretation could be that this is not a DW "8th moon" system, and the circle with lights is actually a Star - which has a compositional element that matches #7 and the Gas Giant such as Hydrogen, Helium, or Carbon.
One possible indicator of it being a star is the 10 lights. This is only a theory based on the way the wiki categorizes stars, but conveniently there are 10 types of stars in ED.
Main Sequence,
Giants & Supergiants
Proto Stars
Carbon Stars
Wolf-Rayet Stars
Black Holes
Neutron Stars
White Dwarfs
Brown Dwarfs, and
Undiscovered types (according to the Journal documentation)
One could then filter down the star type based on matching properties with the Gas Giant and body #7. (Possibly even further if this star has a ring - or more likely the ring symbolizes an asteroid belt).

You could even go as far as relating the trees and benches to atomic molecules.
This is a clumsy off-the-cuff idea, and I have no memory of my school chemistry, but:
#4 has 4 pines - Carbon has 4 bonds.
If #5 is related to #4, then what if it matches Benzene for example?

I know that makes #4 invalid, and #5 only has 4 'carbon' seats, but hopefully you can see where this idea is going. Maybe the pines are Helium? the seats Chlorine?
