ok...got close as I could to exact same distance to 3 star systems I posted some above. Mapped all stars to edsm around, best to calculated point is
Pro Eurl DP-A c15; 3.81 (ly)
Distances at that virtual point:
9638.91; 9638.85; 9638.85
....I assumed Y coord be same though for initial calc. It was almost same, +/- 100ly.

Maybe should try all combinations of each 4 sites of each 3 expeditions and see what happens. But then need some exact algo to get initial center.
