Ok ... I see u're skeptical about idea dynasty sites are related to raxxla...
How about another my idea "Mother of Galaxies is Gravity" ?
I'm not! I still think it's a totally plausible theory.

I know Raxxla doesnt tie in directly with rift mystery, but I got the impression codex told us "you missed something". As @simulacrae said...there is a good possibility they were lazy and linked all the mysteries. They could have easily done this without telling DW, so no reason why he would know about it necessarily.

Edit: the wording is too much of a coincidence. To the point where the codex would be a big mistake or deliberate misleading on fdevs part
