Yes, together with log 4/4, but I’m not saying your premise is wrong, just that these logs are only suggestive of Thargoids. We don't know whether other aliens have the same hyperdiction technology. Possibly even The Club, who seem to have been pretty clued in with INRA, AEGIS etc (reading between the lines, except now we don’t even have the lines!)

As I said it seemed that FD originally planned goids to come from Bovomit but then changed their minds and locked Col70 (& possibly some other areas, can’t remember the timeline). Of course there might be different subspecies/nests of goids scattered around the galaxy.....or other things.

Wonder if Ricardo Bentonio’s “lizard people” was a nod to OISIR-RAXXLA?
