No way!!!!
one of the reason's I played elite on the Beeb during the summer as I couldn't go out and my mother (a teacher) borrowed one from school so I could do some programming.... needless to say I got to "Deadly" instead.... ;-)

Never quite made Elite on the beeb or C64 (Dangerous) which is why I was determined to get Combat Elite in this version... then when I got that I got distracted with the various stories and BGS and then forced myself to get the other Elite rankings.... one thing that won't go away is Raxxla, even when I can't bring myself to play the game still read this thread... ;-)
