I'm not! I still think it's a totally plausible theory.

I know Raxxla doesnt tie in directly with rift mystery, but I got the impression codex told us "you missed something". As @simulacrae said...there is a good possibility they were lazy and linked all the mysteries. They could have easily done this without telling DW, so no reason why he would know about it necessarily.

Edit: the wording is too much of a coincidence. To the point where the codex would be a big mistake or deliberate misleading on fdevs part

Im a bit of a lumper... reason why i liked the old mysteries thread was because we werent sure what was thargoid or raxxlan or soontil or guardian... it was all a mystery and to be honest id expect there to be some overlap. I still assume both guardians and thargoids have some info about raxxla and wouldnt be surprised if the clubs efforts had some bearing on it as well. I guess my "lazyness" comment was me being snide about FDs general actions toward Lore these days. But ya would be nice if some mysteries were all their own.
