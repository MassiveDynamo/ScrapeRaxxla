Im a bit of a lumper... reason why i liked the old mysteries thread was because we werent sure what was thargoid or raxxlan or soontil or guardian... it was all a mystery and to be honest id expect there to be some overlap. I still assume both guardians and thargoids have some info about raxxla and wouldnt be surprised if the clubs efforts had some bearing on it as well. I guess my "lazyness" comment was me being snide about FDs general actions toward Lore these days. But ya would be nice if some mysteries were all their own.
Yeh ...and equal remote points to dynasty sites are in guardian space.
