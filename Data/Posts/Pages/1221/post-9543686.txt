And from that reference Tara...”In the early Sanskrit tradition, she was also known as Dhruva, the Pole Star,” which is reminiscent of Axis Mundi & omphalos...

So is Shintara typical FD misspelling, or is it a clue disguised as a spelling mistake?

Edit: both Tara and Dhruva are in-game systems!
Mmm, continued reading that wiki on axis mundi & there are some interesting examples.
in-game systems are Kunlun (“The Middle Kingdom, China, had a central mountain, Kunlun, known in Taoist literature as "the mountain at the middle of the world."”), Sumeru and there was also Mount Meru (from Hindu, Jain & Buddhist cosmology)-there is a Meru Kwarid in-game.
