And from that reference Tara...”In the early Sanskrit tradition, she was also known as Dhruva, the Pole Star,” which is reminiscent of Axis Mundi & omphalos...

So is Shintara typical FD misspelling, or is it a clue disguised as a spelling mistake?

Edit: both Tara and Dhruva are in-game systems!
have checked out kunlun, axis mundi, tara & dhruva
nothing to report!
