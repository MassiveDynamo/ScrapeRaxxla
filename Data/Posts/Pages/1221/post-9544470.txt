What about lover’s woe & parent’s grief? (Still suspect Broken Heart is a good answer here).
I did read about Astrophel and Stella which was written by Phillip Sidney. And his life contains all about the lovers woe and parents grief.

"No one since 1935 has seriously doubted that Sidney intended the first readers of Astropil and Stella, whoever they may have been, to link "Stella" with Lady Rich. The exact nature of Sidney's relationship with the famous beauty is another and much more ticklish matter ..."[11]

I made extensive search in their names and children but nothing come up as intresting. But I can have made an error somewhere down the way.
