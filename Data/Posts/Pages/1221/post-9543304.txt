you mentioned earlier the waters of shintara and why the name change/difference? Was wondering about that … tara (indoeuropean) star… also related to mother goddess /sea goddess

Tara
'Tara' published in 'Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'
link.springer.com

the is also princess… interesting

If we look at the explanation of shinrarta dezhra name… the shin is supposed to mean life. So possibly we have “water of life star” …. Or “water of life mother” ?

just spitballing…

And from that reference Tara...”In the early Sanskrit tradition, she was also known as Dhruva, the Pole Star,” which is reminiscent of Axis Mundi & omphalos...

So is Shintara typical FD misspelling, or is it a clue disguised as a spelling mistake?

Edit: both Tara and Dhruva are in-game systems!
