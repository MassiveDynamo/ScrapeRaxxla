The reason I’ve been spending some time in Shinrarta is because it seems to be an obvious major step in the “personal journey” , and it’s where TDW is based. It occured to me that if I were to try hiding a TDW station I would hide it in permit-locked Shinrarta, in an asteroid belt. I investigated the main AA belt, all clusters. I found that when I entered the clusters I found an expanding cloud of debris; tried this several times and it happened every time, which I think reduces the probability of a mining commander in another instance causing the cloud. So is this a clue?? I mapped all the planets and belts. AB1, 2 & 3 have belts with mineral hot spots, so not good places for hiding something-there would be too much interest from miners. But AB2J has an icy ring, so less mining interest likely. Ive spent all afternoon fruitlessly flying around in SC trying to spot something in/near that ring by parallax, Ive dropped into the ring and got hull damage, Ive also dropped into a couple of Convoy USS, I spotted a couple of ships dropping out at AB2C but didnt get there before the wake disappeared....
Didn't they say that TDW station would be around the 8th moon of a gas giant?
