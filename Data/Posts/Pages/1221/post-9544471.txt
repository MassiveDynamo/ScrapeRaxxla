Just a passing thought, while pondering on axis mundi etc, but Polaris might answer “Jewel on the brow of the mother of galaxies”, since Earth is at the human-centric centre of the Milky Way, and brow is overhead, & it’s (currently) the Pole Star. Bit far-fetched perhaps, but not sure if anyone has raised that possibility.
So now you got me thinking about Polaris again.... it does have a few other names...

Stella Polaris - link to Philip Sidney's "Astrophil and Stella" theories on "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" (P.S. Polaris does spiral!)
Lodestar - A journey everyone has to make for themselves....
Etymology
From Middle English lode (“journey, course”) + star, where lode is an archaic noun from the verb lithe (“to go, journey”), related to lead. Other Middle English spellings include: 14th century loode sterre, lood-sterre, lade-sterne; and 15th century lode sterre. Cognate with Old Norse leiðarstjarna, Dutch leidster, German Leitstern, Danish ledestjerne, Swedish ledstjärna.
Edit...

Almost forgot... In Norse mythology the Pole Star is the jewel on the end of the spike that the gods stuck through the universe and around which the sky revolves.....
