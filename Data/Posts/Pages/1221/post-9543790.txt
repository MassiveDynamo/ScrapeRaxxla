Just a passing thought, while pondering on axis mundi etc, but Polaris might answer “Jewel on the brow of the mother of galaxies”, since Earth is at the human-centric centre of the Milky Way, and brow is overhead, & it’s (currently) the Pole Star. Bit far-fetched perhaps, but not sure if anyone has raised that possibility.
