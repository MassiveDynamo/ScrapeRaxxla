Didn't they say that TDW station would be around the 8th moon of a gas giant?
The Codex attributes that to “self-professed Dark Wheel expert Lyta Crane”.....”however, rival experts have accused Crane of forging her evidence in order to maintain the revenue from her billions of followers”

So there is quite a bit of doubt hanging over what she says. It may be true, it may be lies, it may be obfuscated half-truth. I think the latter is more likely. I suspect that the TDW station does exist but is not at the 8th moon of a gas giant, but is nearby. ShinDez AB2j is the tenth moon of a GG, sufficiently close to the 8th moon to be valid, sufficiently far and uninteresting to be valid as obfuscation. TDW arent going to make it easy to find their hidden station! It’s also the last moon of AB2, so could fit the old mission’s “obfuscated on the outer rim”

Someone once said dont believe everything you’re told in ED, some characters are lying!

Edit:
Which leads to another thought- the old (possibly deleted) Elite/Founder missions at Shinrarta might have been clues to finding the TDW hidden station instead of Raxxla. Apparently the data crystals in the black box retrieval mission did not appear to be Guardian crystals. In 3307 humanity uses crystals to store data...
And I wonder if that’s what the TDW toast is about?

Edit2:
and AB2c, where a couple of NPCs dropped out of SC is a non-landable moon, which would be another good place to hide TDW station.
