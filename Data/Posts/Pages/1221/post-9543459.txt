A few points that might suggest that the Axis Mundi system isn't completely useless.

Axis Mundi is located at: Right ascension: 1h 28m 3.483s / Declination: -47° 37'24.235''. This is in the southern hemisphere.
If we look in the opposite direction on the same axis from Sol, we get Right ascension: 13h 28m 3.483s / Declination: 47° 37'24.235''. This is in the Canes Venatici constellation.

Canes Venatici - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org
Canes Venatici contains a few interesting characteristics, that can be linked to the Codex on Raxxla:

Cor Caroli (Charles's Heart) is the brightest star. The Cor, Cora, Core mentions have been reoccurring in ED since the start.
Cor Caroli is also the top star of the Great Diamond asterism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Diamond . This asterism completely encapsulates the Coma Berenices constellation, that contains the Galactic North pole. This could well be considered a jewel burning on the brow of the Milky Way.
The Giant Void, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Void . The Giant Void in Canes Venatici is the largest galactic void in the northern hemisphere. Don't know if there is a siren in there, but it could be worth checking.
The closest major object to the Right ascension: 13h 28m 3.483s / Declination: 47° 37'24.235'', is the Whirlpool Galaxy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy. It is the first discovered spiral galaxy. The first spiralling stars.
