A few points that might suggest that the Axis Mundi system isn't completely useless.

Axis Mundi is located at: Right ascension: 1h 28m 3.483s / Declination: -47° 37'24.235''. This is in the southern hemisphere.
If we look in the opposite direction on the same axis from Sol, we get Right ascension: 13h 28m 3.483s / Declination: 47° 37'24.235''. This is in the Canes Venatici constellation.
