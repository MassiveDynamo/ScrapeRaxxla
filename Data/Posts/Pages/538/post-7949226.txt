Page one of this thread; Under "Public FD Raxxla Statements"
#4 - "Raxxla exists, we know where it is, and why people haven't been able to find it..."

In that thread, if scroll a little down, Drew mentions
"Perhaps something for the "Second Great Expedition"

It's probably not much of a reveal to ...er... reveal that the official writers have been specifically asked to avoid 'Raxxla'. My money is on some clues being revealed in Michael Brooke's upcoming novel. We'll see."

This was back in 2014; anyone read Elite: Legacy?
