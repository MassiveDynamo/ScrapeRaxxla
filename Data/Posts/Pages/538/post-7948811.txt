I feel super vindicated because DW told me i was mistaken when i questioned this in his lore thread.

Edit: @Macros Black, i suspect an edit of the OP is in order

Maybe we should have Macros plaster this to the first page AND his signature so we can stop getting new arguments about it every dozen or so pages, lmao. I really do love reading this thread, but sometimes it feels like it’s page after page of exactly the same “fact” restated by someone else interspersed with awesome stories and wild theories. Not that I’m complaining about those last two...
