That quote is actually not substantiated. It is a paraphrase of the original quote, made almost a year after DB and DW's 2014 discussion. I have the links to prove this, but the first instance of this paraphrase is from a now deleted lore thread from DW's website.

Yes that's what I was saying, the quote attributed to DB is from someone else, in law that's hearsay, its a legal useage by me not a judgemental one.

it is still live on DW livestream on YT where he recounts the story, not saying when it was recorded or how close to the conversation or whether it was the first time or the original time, just that its there and in that it is substantiated as that is what DW has said, nothing else implied.
