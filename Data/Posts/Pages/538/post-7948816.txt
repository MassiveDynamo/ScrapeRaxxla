agreed.

the whole 'honked' and 'but not found' bits I have found zero substantiation for, just loose lips on oddball streams misquoting or making up myths, Cobra jump range etc all contexts added by players and then repeated as facts.

the substantiated quote is

DW - Does Raxxla exist in the game?
DB - It exists and we know where it is

THATS IT in its entirety.

Whether DB was metaphorically speaking (Raxxla is a state of mind) is a different matter entirely and open to speculation. Who 'we' are has been speculated and morphed into fact as well.

I personally think the Dark Wheel story is something that may play out in game, but the DW don't know where Raxxla is so it can still be kept hidden. I think it will be a future DLC that opens up the DW. but I could be 100% wrong.

Another one is DJTruthSayer interview with Michael Brookes: (Edit@ this one is person to person so you can see and hear MB respond directly)

DJ - Is it right that there will be no clues?
MB - (hesitating / thinking throughout answer) - yes but at the same time you have to make some things a tiny bit obvious so players know what they are doing

What the hell that means I don't know, I do know MB responded to 'no clues' and didn't offer it so don't know where the original quote is from.

That quote is actually not substantiated. It is a paraphrase of the original quote, made almost a year after DB and DW's 2014 discussion. I have the links to prove this, but the first instance of this paraphrase is from a now deleted lore thread from DW's website.

Edit: the deleted article still exists on Canonn (link in op), which is what we currently use as proof for the quote, despite the fact that it is several degrees removed from the original quote.
