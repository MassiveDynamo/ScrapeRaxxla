Mate.... Drew's one of the most factually accurate and non-misrepresentative people on the forums.
Whilst a certain Penguin and I disagree on almost everything, I absolutely enjoy and value his contributions in equal measure. I have complete respect for yourself, Drew & all of the other "old guard" who challenge my wild theories and keep me in check. In fact, you are two of the many people I was referring to yesterday when I mentioned great contributions from the usual suspects. Having said this, however, I feel it is important to make two specific points.....

1) Stating assumptions as facts, when those assumptions are in the "no its not column" is no more accurate than stating assumptions as facts when they are in the "it could be over here" column, its just a little less obvious.
2) A member of the old guard stating an assumption as a fact is WORSE than other people doing it, as others tend to just accept that it must be true.
