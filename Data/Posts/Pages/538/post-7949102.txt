Not sure if this helps, CMDR Mayor, but when I tried that 7-9 (I did 8 before jumping to Zaonce; left of Tionisla) jump theory, I was jumping while scooping every jump.

Since I'm in a DBX, and they struggle to gas up quickly in between jumps, I always make a spin or two before making the next jump when you exploring.

If you press the jump key when your scooping drops under 200/s and start to pull away, you can jump to the next system without rising your heat about 90%ish.
