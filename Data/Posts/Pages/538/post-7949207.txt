Yes that's what I was saying, the quote attributed to DB is from someone else, in law that's hearsay, its a legal useage by me not a judgemental one.

it is still live on DW livestream on YT where he recounts the story, not saying when it was recorded or how close to the conversation or whether it was the first time or the original time, just that its there and in that it is substantiated as that is what DW has said, nothing else implied.
Cool. Could you post the link please? I would love to see it
