Yes. I said this exact thing about 5-15 pages ago.

It's funny how when YOU say fdev didn't confirm or sent something you seem to think it should be taken as fact. You're real quick to cut down anyone else saying this though. Why is that?

I wouldn't at all be surprised if you did find Raxxla and are intentionally misrepresenting facts and misleading people. As I'm pretty sure I stated about 100 pages ago.
