Oh, and while rereading some IRH posts I came across my post about the station ad showing an old station by Brewer orbiting above a planet, the ad says “looking down on worlds since 3100”. A station is expensive so would only be put in a system being colonised. By 3100 the colonised worlds were Sol, Tau Ceti, Delta Pavonis, Altair, Beta Hydri & Eotienses, and maybe Achenar & Arcturus.

Edit: mmm, can’t see anything that says when Tionisla was colonised, just that it’s one of the old worlds...
Edit2: ah...the Old Worlds were established in the early 2400's. The first four colonies, Lave, Leesti, Diso, and Zaonce, were established between 2412 and 2422. They established trade routes and created their own colonies in Reorte, Riedquat, Tionisla, and Orerve.
Edit3: that Brewer station ad seems to be from pre-release artwork. Might be the basis for TDW station?

I have updated my Yggdrasil ramblings to include the old worlds. Not much to report. Still open to assessment.
