I think you are missing out on some of the pre-history of the DW squadron. It wasnt originally created by Scolio.
Possibly, as I wasnt interested in joining I didnt pay much attention. On Inara Scolio is detailed as the Squadron Commander & base as Tionisla; from the posts I read I assumed it was his initiative. Searching IRH for “squadron” shows a mention by Scolio in #news announcing the formation of a DW squadron dated 11/7/22, but I thought it was older than that (Inara is showing squadron date as 912 days) as I joined the server because several people were very helpful in checking out the “green glow” observations (proven to be a graphics glitch) I spotted while asteroid hunting in Sol, and that was around December 2020 to Feb 2021. I thought the squadron idea was floated around then, but memory is hazy. I eventually got fed up with all the lore trolling and pareidolia B_S I was reading and dropped out of the server a while ago, until last week when I thought I’d check it out again.

Edit: @yelboc do you want to clarify the DW Squadron history for us?
