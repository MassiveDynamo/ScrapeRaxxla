Even if it was a FDev group, I feel it still is a red herring. Regardless of who runs it, it still is a player squadron and anyone in it most likely would be spreadimg false information especially as I don't believe FDev would be willing to give something more the what bragging rights (go down in history as person to discover..)) could give.

To throw a number... 100k, a Cobra III skin and sign an nda would be my thought.
