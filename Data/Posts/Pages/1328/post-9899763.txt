Oh, and while rereading some IRH posts I came across my post about the station ad showing an old station by Brewer orbiting above a planet, the ad says “looking down on worlds since 3100”. A station is expensive so would only be put in a system being colonised. By 3100 the colonised worlds were Sol, Tau Ceti, Delta Pavonis, Altair, Beta Hydri & Eotienses, and maybe Achenar & Arcturus.

Edit: mmm, can’t see anything that says when Tionisla was colonised, just that it’s one of the old worlds...
Edit2: ah...the Old Worlds were established in the early 2400's. The first four colonies, Lave, Leesti, Diso, and Zaonce, were established between 2412 and 2422. They established trade routes and created their own colonies in Reorte, Riedquat, Tionisla, and Orerve.
I need to re-evaluate my Yggdrasil sphere of influence, I unintentionally omitted all of those systems, probably due to a mental block against pre-Dangerous lore (that’s bias for you sometimes it’s subconscious).

*edited;
Never the less, including these old systems may identify something, so I’ll update the Yggdrasil analysis.
