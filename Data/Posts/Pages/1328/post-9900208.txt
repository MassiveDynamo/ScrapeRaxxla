Even if it was a FDev group, I feel it still is a red herring. Regardless of who runs it, it still is a player squadron and anyone in it most likely would be spreadimg false information especially as I don't believe FDev would be willing to give something more the what bragging rights (go down in history as person to discover..)) could give.

To throw a number... 100k, a Cobra III skin and sign an nda would be my thought.
It could have been relevant. Allen Stroud, who was contracted to write a lot of the ED lore had this to say

However a player group setting up a Dark Wheel Squadron is IMHO opening the gates to potential misinformation, delusion and trolling. Iâ€™d hope FD would be more careful about how they implemented TDW. However the response that @Rochester got from them IIRC seemed to indicate TDW may be mere fluff, or may be a storyline that they haven't switched on at present.

Edit: if the latter, then maybe nobody has as yet excelled sufficiently to earn their invitation!
