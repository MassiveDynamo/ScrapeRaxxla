Well, I did that this morning, then travelled out to the comet uss in normal cruise. Nothing appeared, still in a shipping lane!

So then went to Hathor (in-game system) who was for the ancient Egyptians the mother/consort to Horus the Sky (mother of galaxies?). Her most common depiction was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk (jewel on the brow?). Nothing found!

So then went out to visit Holloway Bioscience Research Facility 15 in Snake Sector GW-W c1-1...creepy.

Now back in Sol to hunt Halleyâ€™s comet to see if that will show in nav panel...

Is this really a game? Do I really enjoy this activity? Hand is hurting!!
