However a player group setting up a Dark Wheel Squadron is IMHO opening the gates to potential misinformation, delusion and trolling. Iâ€™d hope FD would be more careful about how they implemented TDW. However the response that @Rochester got from them IIRC seemed to indicate TDW may be mere fluff, or may be a storyline that they haven't switched on at present.

Edit: if the latter, then maybe nobody has as yet excelled sufficiently to earn their invitation!
Ironically, the requested page can not be found... will try another way to view it.
