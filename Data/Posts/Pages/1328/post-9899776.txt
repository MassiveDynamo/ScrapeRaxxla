I need to re-evaluate my Yggdrasil sphere of influence, I unintentionally omitted all of those systems, probably due to a mental block against pre-Dangerous lore (that’s bias for you sometimes it’s subconscious).

*edited: nope disregard - ‘‘twas correct as date parameters was 2296. Ignore me, I’ve been up since 5am and have since associated myself with the kettle.
Old worlds also included Quator, Orrere (base of The Code pirate group), Uszaa.
