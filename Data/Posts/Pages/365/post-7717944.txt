Research Agreement for Independent Raxxla Scientists [RAIRS]

☐ I, [CMDR _ your name _ ], hereby state that I have reviewed the best parts of LMS worst practices video below.
SPOILER




I hereby state that I shall provide both positive and negative findings as part of my thesis, reports and posts.
My thesis shall always :
* include references with direct links or represented in a sufficient provable manner, easily available for inspection by peers.
* include both positive and negative findings, and if upon request, the findings I didn't find.
* provide references to movies or literature with a full (properly licensed) copy of the reference at no additional cost to any peers requesting it. For any material requiring more than 4 hours of study it may be required to cover the cost of board and lodging. Exception if you're an author named Drew Wagar may request to be properly compensated for time and cost of authoring the material for the reference(s).
* include pictures, diagrams or similar graphical content to aid understanding the hypothesis. Temporary media placeholders may be used where graphics or scientific charts is not readily available.
The thesis shall never :
* be a repeat of anything between post #1 to #999999 in this thread. Excemption to the rule is made when post 999999 has been reached.
* lack proper references. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy travel-guide page-numbers are perfectly valid.
* leave out any findings or references needed to understand the relation between the thesis and the real world. (With the exception of references for Arnold Schwarzenegger movie titles as it's required as part of training)

☐ If I fail to comply with the above regulations I willingly subject my reports and credibility to peer mockery and comments.
☐ If I fail to comply the previous compliance regarding peer comments I shall provide at least two different flavors of smoothie (vanilla is void as choice) to the Original Poster or sufficiently hungry peers when the OP is not available.
