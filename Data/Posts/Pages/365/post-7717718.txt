Post-weekly-shopping brain death
Had forgotten that, while the town streets are quieter on a friday morning, it’s because all the wrinklies (at 66 I’m a youngster!) are congregated four-abreast in the supermarket two-person-wide aisles trying to remember why they went there in the first place and decide which direction they should point their trolley,
They all seem to compromise at 90 degrees to the direction of traffic, aaaagh!
