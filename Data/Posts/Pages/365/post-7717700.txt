Just checked my LP/UCB sheet (link in my signature) & there should be two LPs in Maia.

Nice thought that they could be using BH gravitational lensing, but don’t think there’s any evidence of that happening.
Yeah, I’m just saying that the LPs don’t say anything about gravitational lensing, not that there aren’t any LPs.
