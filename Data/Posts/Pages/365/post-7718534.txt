I'm still working on the suggestion made by the r/askastronomy mods -- trying to see if I can get the Magellanic clouds to line up with the smudges at the bottom.

Meanwhile I haven't composed the question for r/askastronomy yet. Do you guys think we should provide them with the (apparently incorrect) red labels? Or should we give them a clean slate to start from?
Send them a cropped version of the star field in an unmarked, plain envelope.

Edit: (Include a pair of random, four digit numbers and, "There is a target.")

See what they come up with in total isolation from the tin foil hattery in here...
