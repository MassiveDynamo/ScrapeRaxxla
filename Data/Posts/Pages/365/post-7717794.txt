Ok, whoâ€™s going to analyse that name for a clue to Raxxla?????
Spiral cypher anyone?
Oh that one's easy!

It's a warning about a threat from aliens, for reasons unknown.

Alf - ALF - Alien Life Form
red - Red alert

Jeffress - Jeffreys, but the y is missing. The 'why' is missing.

All I can say is that based on that info, everyone should guard their ship's cats carefully!!!
