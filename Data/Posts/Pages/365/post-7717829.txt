Just checked my LP/UCB sheet (link in my signature) & there should be two LPs in Maia.

Nice thought that they could be using BH gravitational lensing, but don’t think there’s any evidence of that happening.
TB0061 Maia Black Hole
Maia B... the infamous Black Hole in Maia. According to Commander VampyreGTX it puts on a great show when observing the gravitational lensing effect on the surrounding nebula and stars.
Or at least that's what the list says.
