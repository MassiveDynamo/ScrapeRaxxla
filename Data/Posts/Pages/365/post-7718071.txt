Unusual Markers

A heads up for being observant re 'hidden in plain sight'. I just realized another variant to look for:
* NPC lo-wakes near gas-giant locations (only for those we suspect fit the pattern from the codex).


Also, just the standard checklist mentioned several times already:
Waiting for (specific) random-mission in a system.
Waiting for (specific) USS giving a special event.
Non-inhabitated systems having unusual traffic / USS or other markers.
FSS location-hints on (re)scanning. Make sure they are represented just as locations.
