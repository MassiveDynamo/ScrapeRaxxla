I thought the Thargoids were named because Braben and / or Bell put them in there because they liked Kenny Everett’s Captain Kremmen...

I thought it was because they were 2000AD fans!





Edit - and without wanting to throw petrol onto the general fire of the thread, especially having just re-brought up the subject of language distortion...

Tharg is from a planet orbiting Betelgeuse called Quaxxann.

The thing on his forehead is called the Rosette of Sirius.

Edit 2 - just for clarity, I don’t actually know what the out of game inspiration for the name Thargoids was. Wouldn’t be surprised if it was either or both. Anyone got a definitive source? And was it DB or IB? Or was it one of the things Holdstock contributed?
