They (Thargoids) are mentioned in "The Dark Wheel" , by RH. Presumably he was given a preview of the game though, so would have know what they were called in game, and also they are in the 1984 elite player manual.

Finding it very difficult to overlook the somewhat tongue in cheek sarcasm that appears to meander *Mostly Aimless through the entire Elite franchise while exhibiting a faint yet persistent aroma of decomposing sperm whale, petunias, hamster droppings and elderberry...

And then there's DB's propensity to giggle like a school girl whenever infinite improbability conspires to mention Raxxla while he's simultaneously target locked by a livestream camera. Something, probably the oddest thing in the Universe, is immensely funny, at least to DB! Are we taking all this way too Sirius~Ly?

Edit: Wait, maybe it's...
[Ra] Right ascension [XXL] 30 [A] Um, Anarchy? No? How about...
[Ra] System [XXL] Supergiant [A] Um, random straw-grab A-word?
