Pretty sure there’s not a Listening Post in Maia of that nature. Sounds like a bit of a mix up with the Tourist Beacon. Very different things I’m afraid.

Nice idea in principle with the Einstein cross, but in practice I don’t think there’s anything there which can be used in practical terms for narrowing down the location. Best of luck to anyone who wants to try though!

Just checked my LP/UCB sheet (link in my signature) & there should be two LPs in Maia.

Nice thought that they could be using BH gravitational lensing, but don’t think there’s any evidence of that happening.
