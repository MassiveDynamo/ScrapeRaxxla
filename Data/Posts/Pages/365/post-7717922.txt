Ok, whoâ€™s going to analyse that name for a clue to Raxxla?????
Spiral cypher anyone?

It's an anagram of Federals Jerffs. As we all know, a Jerff is otherwise known as a Gulon, which is obviously some sort of mythical fox-type thing. And we've all agreed that this galaxy map smudge looks very much like a fox (or Federal Jerff) running towards us.
