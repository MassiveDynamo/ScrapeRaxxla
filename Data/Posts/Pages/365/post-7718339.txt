Going back briefly to the screen shot image - having spent some time going over the galaxy in stellarium, I think I've concluded that there is no clean fit to the image, which most likely says that if it is a screen shot, its not near Sol..

I'm still working on the suggestion made by the r/askastronomy mods -- trying to see if I can get the Magellanic clouds to line up with the smudges at the bottom.

Meanwhile I haven't composed the question for r/askastronomy yet. Do you guys think we should provide them with the (apparently incorrect) red labels? Or should we give them a clean slate to start from?
