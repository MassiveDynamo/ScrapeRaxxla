A sudden raw thought: is it possible to hijack a landed ship by boarding it with your SRV? I saw it done in a GhostGiraffe video, but i don't know if it was real or just a montage for fun.

If it's indeed possible, then maybe there's a way to hijack some landed Dark Wheel ship. For example in the landbase they own in Shinrarta Dezhra.
