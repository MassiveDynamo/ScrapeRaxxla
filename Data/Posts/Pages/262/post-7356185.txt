Should I ever find Raxxla, I'm not sure whether to make it public or not.
It would just be too sad to see this thread, with all those nice tinfoiley ideas, come to a halt (like the Formidine Rift thread eg.)

So for now I leave just this here and want to give you the opportunity to learn something new, some german words in this case... so don't expect a translation from my side
This is from one of those Tip Offs I received, is quite funny and also leaves some space for new speculation.

More importantly then these nice tinfoil ideas, it would be sad to see 'Raxxla' become nothing more then eye candy for touristâ€¦just think about it, Raxxla becoming a side show attraction for simpletons. So say if one us do find it first, do us a favour and divert our eyes elsewhere, if another discovers the truth, likewise. In an in-universe setting, the dark wheel would simply kill those who are closing in on the truth, but as for players, it's just a simple respawn. Recruit them into the fold, keep it from the public.
