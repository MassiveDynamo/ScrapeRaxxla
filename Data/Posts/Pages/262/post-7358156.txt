First real post on here. I've followed the route from Zeta Casseopia to NGC /(Cupid's arrow) nebula all the way to the Zurara and found nothing.
I don't know whether this has been mentioned before re Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars but if you Google "spiralling stars" it takes you to sites about Wolf-Rayet stars.
If TRDW/The Club are controlling Raxxla could we be looking for a system with a Wolf Rayet star and a gas giant with 8 moons? It would also probably be within or close to the Bubble because you can't control events in the Bubble from the Formidine Rift. Remember, according to DW these guys like their comfort.
