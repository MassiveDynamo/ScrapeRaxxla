I see there is a few mentions of the Cat's Eye Nebula as a clue in this thread. I'm currently at BD+66 1066 which is the closest star system to the nebula and contains an O class star and a black hole. I happened to notice this blue object in the deep black of empty space which I've never seen before (seen here: https://imgur.com/oT383xs). It looks too blue to be a star, so I thought it might have been a planetary nebula. I can't find anything like it on the galaxy map though.

The only thing I did manage to find at all in that general direction was the star HIP 88036 which is almost 150 LY away. Here is a picture of the direction of the blue object relative to HIP 88036: https://imgur.com/k5fu2UD. Any ideas on what this might be?

EDIT: Here's a couple images of it being distorted by the black hole: https://imgur.com/a/u2fzwwF
I'm going in!
