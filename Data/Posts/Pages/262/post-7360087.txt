Guess I’m the only one that thinks Astrophel and Stella has nothing to do with Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars.

Edit: the only thing I think that would be possible with that book is, its one or two chapters could be in the game.
If I was a FDev, I would put a crash site, like JJ’s crashed Cobra, and there would be scannable objects that give related chapters of the book. A Raxxla hunter’s destroyed ship perhaps? Who got too close and shot down.
