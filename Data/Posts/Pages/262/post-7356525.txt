People are getting depressed about finding it. Does that mean someone found it?

And about the jewel on casipeas head. what bout a star from a certain perspective looking like jewel from a direction. Like in this pic. I don't know what nebula this is but it gave me the idea. From the Farsight base it looks exactly like a jewel on the head of this nebula. This pic is not from the farsight base near heart and sole. It's on the way back going towards that big star formation.



It's the little round nebula near the middle left of the screen above and to the right of the 23% heat indicator. Maybe it can only be found by following a path of clues like a breadcrumb trail where certain things are only visible from certain locations. A path of sorts. A journey.
