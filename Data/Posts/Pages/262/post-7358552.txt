"Mother of galaxies" is perfectly appropriate in English for Cassiopeia being the mother of Andromeda, maybe you are not a native speaker?

If Danarys in Game of a Thrones had only hatched one dragon, her title would still correctly be "mother of dragons".

Andromeda is also the only galaxy directly visible in Elite's skybox background so any reference to galaxies in game will logically be referring to Andromeda.

Gaia didn't create galaxies in Greek mythology, we didn't know galaxies existed until the 20th Century. She just created "the world".

It might not be zeta Cass, but the first clue in the codex is obviously about Cassiopeia and Andromeda. It also makes sense for that first clue to be the easiest to solve from a gameplay design perspective.
