I would just like to mention Plato's 'Myth of Er'. It's a story of a guy that dies and is sent to the afterlife, but he wakes up again and is able to tell his story.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_Er

On his journey he comes to: 'After four days they reached a place where they could see a shaft of rainbow light brighter than any they had seen before. After another day's travel they reached it. This was the Spindle of Necessity. Several women, including Lady Necessity, her daughters, and the Sirens were present.'

Lady Necessity is the primordial goddess Ananke, the mother of cosmos. She holds the Spindle of Necessity.


Her daughters, the Fates spins the spindle and on each rim there is a singing Siren.

The spindle represents the classical heavens, with earth at the senter and the planets, Luna, the Sun and the stars placed on different orbs.

The planets and stars are described as jewels set in orbs. Unfortunately the outer rim contains all the stars, so this doesn't limit the search area much.



Ananke is a system in ED.

In regards to these ladies I scanned and triangulated their constellation recently - nothing out of the ordinary (unless I missed something obvious).

'Ananke - Nyx - Themis
Lakhesis - Lachesis - Decima
Klotho - Clotho - Nona
Atropos - Atropus - Aisa - Morta'

Except oddly they encompassed the star LP 855-10 which has that listening post directed at generation ship Venusian.

Coincidence maybe yet still a fruitful dalliance.
