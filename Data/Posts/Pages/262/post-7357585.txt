People are getting depressed about finding it. Does that mean someone found it?

And about the jewel on casipeas head. what bout a star from a certain perspective looking like jewel from a direction. Like in this pic. I don't know what nebula this is but it gave me the idea. From the Farsight base it looks exactly like a jewel on the head of this nebula. This pic is not from the farsight base near heart and sole. It's on the way back going towards that big star formation.



It's the little round nebula near the middle left of the screen above and to the right of the 23% heat indicator. Maybe it can only be found by following a path of clues like a breadcrumb trail where certain things are only visible from certain locations. A path of sorts. A journey.

Not sure why everyone seems to be so stuck on Cassiopeia. She's not the mother of galaxies. Assuming this is referring to Greek mythology (which I'm not entirely convinced of), we have two choices, there's Gaia who is said to have created everything, OR if we want to look at just the creation of the Milky Way (the origin of the word Galaxy is Greek, Galaxia, which is derived from the greek word for milk) we have the story of Hera and Heracles (aka Hercules). The milky way was created when Hera pulled Hercules from her breast, spewing milk out and creating the milky way.

My personal opinion, Cassiopeia has nothing to do with this. The link doesn't seem very strong to me. I'm going to do some more reading on this, but I think we should be looking in another constellation.
