Not sure why everyone seems to be so stuck on Cassiopeia. She's not the mother of galaxies. Assuming this is referring to Greek mythology (which I'm not entirely convinced of), we have two choices, there's Gaia who is said to have created everything, OR if we want to look at just the creation of the Milky Way (the origin of the word Galaxy is Greek, Galaxia, which is derived from the greek word for milk) we have the story of Hera and Heracles (aka Hercules). The milky way was created when Hera pulled Hercules from her breast, spewing milk out and creating the milky way.

My personal opinion, Cassiopeia has nothing to do with this. The link doesn't seem very strong to me. I'm going to do some more reading on this, but I think we should be looking in another constellation.

Cassiopeia could at a stretch be called the mother of one galaxy. The codex uses the plural for, galaxies. This makes it even less likely.

Virgo is a more plausible location. Most of the different creator goddesses in mythology are virgin mothers. Virgo constellation is also located at a crossing point between the ecliptic and equatorial circles at 12h Right ascension and 0° declination.
This point and the opposite point at 0h 0° are almost always marked with an X.

Put two big circles on a ball and you get two Xs. Raxxla has to Xs and the logo has a big fat Sol or Monad symbol in the middle. It's all very omphalos like.
