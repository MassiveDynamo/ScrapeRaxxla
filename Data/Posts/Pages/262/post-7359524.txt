I came across something today when doing some random research on Raxxla. In the Codex there are several hints/clues I think I may have picked up on.

1) First, they make mention of something called Omphalos Rift. Omphalos was a religious stone artifact in Ancient Greek. So i am going to look around greek named systems around the bubble near sol. There is a system called Delphi that was named something else in the beginning but was changed in Beyond.

2) This is the most important thing i have discovered today in my research. The Codex talks about a story called "Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" or Astrophel and Stella, this is an acutal sonnet worte in the 1580's. When you read the sonnet you will see there is a pattern in the words rhymed at the end of each line. Sonnets were wrote in a rhyme scheme. And if you asign a letter for each of the words that rhymn you will start to see a pattern you can read the sonnet here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophel_and_Stella
i have broken down each part of the sonnet as follows. 1) ABABABABCACADD 9) ABCABCCADEDEFGG 19) ABBCCDAEFEGG 20) ABABABABCDCDEE. Maybe the code can be translated to binary and can be used for something.

Hopefully this will help progress the discover in some way.
