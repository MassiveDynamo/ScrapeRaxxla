May I ask a my noobish question? It is good mystery, so I started to read this topic. Was there some investigation of the picture from DW Codex title? I mean that star, planet and part of station. May be someone checked sizes and proportions for star and planet? Star class? Distances?

If it is old picture, sorry. I think people still looking for the true DW station as a trail to Raxxla.
So... I want to share my own minds about it. In that picture... Station. Definitely Orbis type with two rings. Common construction. I viewed same in some systems. No any original details.

Planet. Unfortunately I haven't minds about it. It may be moon or planet itself. Gas giant? Ice body? Stone? I don't know. Very close orbit to star. It is one detail. But which star is? Arrival or not?..

Star. Definitely not the white or yellow one. Red color points us to K or M class. More questions is about size. If it's the dwarf, planet should be at a very very close orbit. If it's giant, then orbit should be not so close. I prefer to think it is giant but who know.

Probably there is a way to calculate sizes for both stellar bodies, but I haven't enough knowledge in astronomy and geometry for it.
In other time it all may be generic picture without any back story.

Thanks for reading.

P.s Raxxla itself? I'm sorry. I haven't any ideas. Too young for this mystery
