I used to believe fervently in the existence of Raxxla. But now I'm not so sure. Maybe DW2 could unintentionally reveal something. But I just returned to the bubble in time to join DW2 after spending 6 months slowly traveling to Colonia. And all I found was emptiness. The few earth like worlds I found had no hints of civilization. So far it seems that there's only us, the thargoids, a bunch of dead Guardians, and the voices in witchspace.

Raxxla is either a myth or is extremely well hidden. Even if it exists, I doubt it has portals to another universe. Nobody would be able to keep their mouth shut about it with all this hype surrounding it. If it exists, it's likely just the headquarters of a bunch of old fools who think they're special.
