In German game, same thing. Note it also appears between " ".
Wikip: from fern (“far”) + Weh (“pain”).Can be literally translated as farsickness or longing for far-off places, as contrasted with Heimweh (“homesickness, longing for home”. It's quite common to keep the original language when using words related to very specific concepts which otherwise could lose some subtile meaning. Often German.
