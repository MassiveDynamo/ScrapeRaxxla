I've got a fellow player, who works on the Canonn R&D team, potentially making a tool to show a list of systems within a set number of ly that fits the parameters of a Gas Giant with 8 moons (Based off of EDSM data of course). He's a busy guy and may not get around to it straight away. But would definitely be a useful if we believe the station is in game.
