Why "fernweh", and not "wanderlust"? I mean, kudos for using a language other than English, but ... why? "Planet" is taken from the Greek word for wanderer, but no planet "Lust" is in GalMap. Perhaps too literal. There are inclusions on the Codex entry for Raxxla that seem out of context, but only just so.
