I have really no idea what 8 is.
MB was/is a fan of Lovecraft & Co. (8: Hastur the Unspeakable jumping out of Carcosa, his home in Aldebaran, with his Byakhees-servants)
Also fan of Viking lore (The Yggdrasil tree, Odin and a few other Nordse characters, Gnà, Niöhöggr...)
The Underworld, (Hades, Charon, Styx,) looks pretty obvious, indeed. As does... The Myth, which access/gate is guarded by Arch. St Michael
Can't find who that bat winged "stars-eater/puker" in 5 is, though...
Crux and Polaris (Sirius ?) are my guesses for the stars by The Gate. (Now, Berenice's hair...wow ! Good sight !)

Would love to know what MB thinks about his tattoo being used as a cipher/map for Raxxla
All this material has been published by himself on Facebook, Tweeter, etc... Public domain ?
