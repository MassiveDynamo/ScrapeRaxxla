Since others seem to be going down the path of "Princess Astrophel and the Spiraling Stars" refers to the sonnets "Astrophel and Stella" I decided to look for any other possibilities. The conclusion I came to is that "The children's story Princess Astrophel and the spiraling stars" could be in reference to the female scientist "Jocelyn Bell Burnell" who discovered Pulsars (a spiraling star), who has 13 locations named after her in elite within 110 ly from SOL, and has a real world children's book written about her "Jocelyn Bell Burnett Discovering Pulsars". I'll admit the one weakness in this is that the codex refers to the author as male, but this is still fewer weaknesses than using Astrophel and Stella as a source.

as an update I pulled the locations in the galaxy of each Burnell named object and tried to see if there was a centroid location that corresponded, and there wasn't. below that is the cover of the book I found, I will give that a thorough read through to see if anything pops out.
