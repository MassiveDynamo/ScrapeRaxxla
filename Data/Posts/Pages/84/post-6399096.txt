Stuff I was thinking about driving to work....the two x's in Raxxla intrigue me.

is the "L" in Raxxla definitely an "L"? What if it was a number 1?
If so then what if the two x's represented a binary star system. One star with a Rocky world and an Ammonia world orbiting, the other with a Class 1 Gas Giant, and an Ammonia World orbiting. I've no idea how to search for specific system layouts.

What if the word Raxxla represented a journey Ra --> mysterious "xx" --> La. This one I'm less sure about. Not sure what they could mean.

I'm going to come across as a naysayer again but wasn't Raxxla first mentioned in Robert Holdstock's "Alien World" illustrated guide (produced under the pseudonym Steven Eisler), which pre-dates even TDW? I don't think the name is tied to Elite in and of itself...
