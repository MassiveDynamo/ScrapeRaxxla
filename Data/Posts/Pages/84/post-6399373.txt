Pardon my complete ignorance, but this all sounds very interesting and lovecraftian.

Is there some way that I can do this? Where do these missions come from?

Hi CMDR, the missions listed in the OP are no longer available. AndyJ gave a great account here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=5869706&viewfull=1#post5869706

We've tried to get information from FD about the reason why the missions was removed, but nothing concrete so far. And I wouldn't hold my breath for a reply.

There's no significant leads as to the location, only very vague hints.
