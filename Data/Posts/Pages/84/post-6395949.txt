There's also the Mars artefact, which I forgot to mention. It may or may not be Guardian, but it's unlikely to be Thargoid. That might represent another Sentient race.

Non-Human Relic
In 2280, the first non-human relic was found in space. The object was found buried on Mars; it was no bigger than a child's hand and is still surrounded in secrecy, even in 3300. No information has ever been circulated as to the properties of this item or its origin, other than it is non-human.

IIRC, there was a hint from Allen Stroud on one of the livestreams waaaaaay back that, depending on how you interpret what he said, may have indicated that the Mars Artifact was a UA or UA-related. Discussion about this is buried waaaaay back on the UA threadnought somewhere, and there may (or may not) be a footnote to this effect with a link to the original stream on the UA wiki (if it still exists). Neither of which I can honestly be bothered to look for right now.

There was also quasi-related supposition around this and Kahina/Salome's visit to Mars at one point too I think.
