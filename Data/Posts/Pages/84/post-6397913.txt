Stuff I was thinking about driving to work....the two x's in Raxxla intrigue me.

is the "L" in Raxxla definitely an "L"? What if it was a number 1?
If so then what if the two x's represented a binary star system. One star with a Rocky world and an Ammonia world orbiting, the other with a Class 1 Gas Giant, and an Ammonia World orbiting. I've no idea how to search for specific system layouts.

What if the word Raxxla represented a journey Ra --> mysterious "xx" --> La. This one I'm less sure about. Not sure what they could mean.

Many possible interpretations of the mysterious double X.

In Egyptian mythology Ra would be the sun and La(Lah) would be the Moon. Putting the XX between them.

Not that it would help us much.
