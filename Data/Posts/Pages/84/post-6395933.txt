Why TRIPLE Elite, if true ?
You only need Elite to interact with TDW. So ... (tinfoiling) if true, you need the other two Elite status in order to get the trade and combat Elite (assuming you started Elite as Explorer) missions from the factions involved. Then ... unlocks...something?
(If someone wants to try a little experiment: get allied with TDW, then go to Mariyacoch and look closely at you status with the factions there and the first welcome speech. Anything special ?
Repeat in Ticushpakhi.)

Just a theory

@Han_Zen: wow !

As per page 1, the three TDW missions for Elites (Obfuscated in the Outer Rim, etc.) were setup as one for each category of Elite - Explorer, Trader, and Combat. Might explain DJSoothsayer's supposition.
