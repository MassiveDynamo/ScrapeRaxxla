Stuff I was thinking about driving to work....the two x's in Raxxla intrigue me.

is the "L" in Raxxla definitely an "L"? What if it was a number 1?
If so then what if the two x's represented a binary star system. One star with a Rocky world and an Ammonia world orbiting, the other with a Class 1 Gas Giant, and an Ammonia World orbiting. I've no idea how to search for specific system layouts.

What if the word Raxxla represented a journey Ra --> mysterious "xx" --> La. This one I'm less sure about. Not sure what they could mean.

This is quite thought provoking. I must say it does very much feel like we're no closer to finding Raxxla than before ED was released. Like, it's all well and good saying Raxxla is in the game but without any legitimate leads it's basically useless info.

But if Raxxla isn't it's name, but it's location, now that's interesting.

I swear I read recently there is a way to query EDDB to find systems with specific bodies i.e. ammonia worlds that are within x LS of the main star etc.. can't for the life of me remember where I found it though :S!
