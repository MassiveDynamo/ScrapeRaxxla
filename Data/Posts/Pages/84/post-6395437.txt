The only (known) sentient life in ED currently are the Thargoids and the now extinct Guardians and Acherons. There's likely to be others in the future (permit locked areas are permit locked for a reason!).

Yes, that's entirely possible.

Forgive my ignorance Louis but "Acherons"? This is the first I've heard mention of them and a (admittedly quick) Google search didn't reveal anything obvious...
