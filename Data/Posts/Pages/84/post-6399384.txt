Look a few pages back, Jaiotu already found the original use of the name in some literary work from the first half of the 20th century.

Yes, that was kind of my point (by way of reminder). Thinking further though, it's not inconceivable that the star Jaitou is theorising about was encoded into the name Raxxla by Robert Holdstock in a manner similar to the one Evoflash describes...

...does that qualify me to have my own tin-foil hat too?
