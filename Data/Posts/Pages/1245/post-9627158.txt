Hands not quite so painful, so risked flying a little yesterday & this morning...
Got blown up yesterday trying to find Raxxla/Omphalos at Elvira’s base (“Long Sight”since sight/seer/eyes to see seems to be a clue)) in Khun. This morning got blown up trying to find it inside Li Qin Jao station in Sol (could be said to be “in plain sight” & matches the Raxxla logo, if it’s a stylised system map, since there is an in-system engineer, an asteroid belt, the docking light cluster matches the 6 “belts”/lines and there is even some hexagonal theming on the exterior. It also matches “whisperer in witchspace”, since Li Qin invented the fsd! “Siren of the deepest void” could also apply there since that’s where explorers head once they've got a decent fsd! Otherwise I also tried Burnell station since Jocelyn Bell Burnell discovered pulsars (the NS that have been described as sirens!), but I didn’t find anything there either!

@David Braben : SO David,
since we dont know it is, the heck will we be able to recognise it when/if we find it?

I think Raxxla in the game predates engineers' bases in the game though, they only came in with Horizons.
