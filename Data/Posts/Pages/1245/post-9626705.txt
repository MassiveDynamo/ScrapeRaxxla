3 objects are thought to exist just before the Oort cloud, Sedna confirmed in real life, Planet 9/Persephone theorized in real life confirmed in game, what's the 3rd? We have 3 markers around the sol symbol on the raxxla logo and the dots could be the representation of the Oort cloud or Kuiper belt, We have the Theorized planet 9 in game but not the above proven, if you look up orbital lines of propesed Plant 9 you will also see it matches the raxxla logo locations of the 3 towards the doted outline

Or 2007 TG422 Which actually is supposed to have a strange blueish colour that shouldnt be so unless around a gas giaint
