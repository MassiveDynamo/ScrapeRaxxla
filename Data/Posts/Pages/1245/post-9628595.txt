Did too!
Many a Black Hole dived with a hold of Guardian Relics, over several months, and also dropped them between dual BH to see if anything happened. Also tried dropping them inside the BH!

what about the Targoid relics from their base? were they also transported and dumped? ) pilots of them use them on the base for the sake of opening a map of the galaxy, so maybe they open a gate in space
