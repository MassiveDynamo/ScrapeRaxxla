I think Raxxla in the game predates engineers' bases in the game though, they only came in with Horizons.
You are correct, but Raxxla might have been retconned! Since nobody has (apparently) found Raxxla it might now be on/in/disguised as anything; FD have never said it currently is the same as the original implementation in the gamma.

Plus the codex logo is much later than engineer bases, so IFF the logo is a map then the dotted hexagon with central dot might indicate an engineer’s base in the system containing Raxxla (edit2: on the other hand since the line is dotted, which is an engineering drawing convention for something which is hidden/missing, perhaps there is no engineer base in the system! )

My investigation of Elvia and Felicity’s bases came out of the apparent similarity of the ‘sight theme’ in-game between “long sight base”, Farseer, Farseer Inc, the literal translation of “ferweh” which is “far sore” which sounds like “far saw”, and the Codex clue “for those with eyes to see”. So seems like “vision”/“sight” might be a possible clue. Couple that with Allen Stroud’s recent “I don't think Frontier design things that way, but if they did, the search for Raxxla would lead to somewhere in plain sight”, and Michael Brookes “ you have to make things a little bit obvious” (which is another way of saying “in plain sight”)....

Just one of many possible hypotheses I am considering.

Edit: including checking through names of the 10,000 systems within 140ly of Sol (about 60% done!)
Mmm, there’s a Tetrian- bet you get a square deal on gaming there!
And an Arrakis - source of Old Spice? Wonder if they have Sand Worms??
And a Velux- guess the atmosphere is very clear!
