The way Orion Cluster is positioned in the game, measurements would be impossible, most stars at the end of that trail would be obscured by other stars. That is why it is obviously done on purpose.
It sounds a bit like you're treating stars as being much bigger than they are.

If we consider a disc whose radius is the distance to Proxima Centauri, then our Sun would take up 0.00000000000003% of it.

Or to put it another way the area of the disc is 3,334,000,000,000,000 times the area which would be taken up by the sun.
