Even 3D modeling wouldn't make that mistake because the way it is in the game you wouldn't see most of the stars at the end of that star cluster trail. Must have being done on purpose.
It’s not on purpose. It’s the raw data in the catalouges that are inaccurate when it comes to distance from Sol.
what probably should have been a more or less spherical star cluster, becomes a stretched out shape.
