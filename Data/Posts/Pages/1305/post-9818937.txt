Then you should know by now that it is incorrect and no 3D models would put "2MASS sausage" and only certain clusters like that. With all that being obvious, logic dictates accidental placing a clusters like that is very unlikely and for that reason there is only one possibility left, these clusters were placed like that on purpose.
I will leave you to your own conclusions.
The reason is literally what @Han_Zen and I have already said. They used the real life data for those particular stars, and just imported it into the game. The real life distance measurements for those stars have significantly less accuracy than their position measurements.

I'm not sure if we're misunderstanding something you're saying or vice versa, but what we've said is the genuine reason.

To check, when you're talking about 3D models, are you thinking the star clusters in question are being generated by the ED galaxy generation model? If so, that's not quite the case. The galaxy generation in ED takes a bunch of real world info (including data from a number of star catalogues) and then procedurally generates the rest of the galaxy from and around that real life data.

If the stars in question were procedurally generated ones, then I would be saying something very different.
