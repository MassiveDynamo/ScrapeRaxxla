Your missing the point of only these clusters are this way, not any others but... Thank You for your input.
I think you have missed many clusters that are this way, just within 600ly of the bubble you can find over 30 of these, adleast 20+ towards and past the veil nebulas, the same towards carinea, many towards Sag A* (Some this way are very hard to find due to the star population growing dramatically), just roaming the galaxy map towards the HOAG systems at the edge of the galactic arm towards crab pulsar I have just counter 17 of said clusters.

Technically these clusters and systems where made first with the real world data, the Stellar Forge then created many more in and around them either proceedualy named or added to the NGC formats within the sector (Hence many NCG **** Sector etc etc), alot even exactly ontop and even duplicated others as some data was input twice by mistake (alot of these have been removed or rectified however there are few that remain for instance some PSR systems have a double that is only seen when in or close to the system through the nav panel)

A few streams with Kay if you look them up she actually explains how this was all done and would answer your questions in a more technical sense

P.S NGC 188 is one of the furthest of these clusters practically outside of the galaxy that you can visit via Fleet carrier and the views are great from NGC 188 SMV 9327
