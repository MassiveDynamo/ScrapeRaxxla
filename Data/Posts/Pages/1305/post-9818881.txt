Yes, you asserted that most of the stars towards the end of a 2MASS 'sausage' would be obscured by other stars. I'm pointing out that they wouldn't be, and giving a first approximation physical explanation of why.
Then you should know by now that it is incorrect and no 3D models would put "2MASS sausage" and only certain clusters like that. With all that being obvious, logic dictates accidental placing a clusters like that is very unlikely and for that reason there is only one possibility left, these clusters were placed like that on purpose.
I will leave you to your own conclusions.
