The orientation towards Sol is because the measurements were done from Sol, and so the more inaccurate distance data is always in a radial direction from Sol.
The way Orion Cluster is positioned in the game, measurements would be impossible, most stars at the end of that trail would be obscured by other stars. That is why it is obviously done on purpose.
