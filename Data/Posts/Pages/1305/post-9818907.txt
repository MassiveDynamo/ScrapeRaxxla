So, I think it is the Guardians but I am still putting the loose ends together. I think this is part of why Jacques Station makes a huge jump to get as far away from the Bubble as possible. That being, said to make a station jump that far it had to have been highly modified. I have a lot more I am working on about why the story is the way it is because we found Raxxla. Though, I am thinking of making a trip out to Colonia after research in the Bubble to confirm if Jacques station has any kind of artifacts that proves The Dark Wheel's authenticity. As it stands, this is one of the very few truly abandoned and sold stations in the game. If this bit about Jacques being a moniker to hide him being Peter Jameson is even remotely accurate it means we need to know what motivated the jump to get as far from the Bubble as possible. Also, I am still not certain jumping to Colonia wasn't the actual intended destination. If this is Peter Jameson, we need need to know what they knew and when. Raxxla may not be the central portion of the Elite lore but if Raxxla actually was found close to 2296 it fundamentally would have impacted lots of the rest of the lore.
there must be something simple, something at the level of the release of the game, even before additional software was required to solve the puzzles. something within reach at an early stage
