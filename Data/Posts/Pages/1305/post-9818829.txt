It sounds a bit like you're treating stars as being much bigger than they are.

If we consider a disc whose radius is the distance to Proxima Centauri, then our Sun would take up 0.00000000000003% of it.

Or to put it another way the area of the disc is 3,334,000,000,000,000 times the area which would be taken up by the sun.
wow...sorry but this is embarrassing.
Did you even took a look at what I'm talking about before posting this replay ?
