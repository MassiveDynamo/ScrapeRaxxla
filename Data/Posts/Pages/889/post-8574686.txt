I think Thargoid Sensors are legal now. You should be able to sell on the commodities market, even if there's no interest?

just not showing on the Commodities Market list of items. Logged out, walked copawlot, relogged & still not showing. Inara says there's a FC 90ly away that's buying. Will try there!
(may be another bug!)

edit: yep, could sell them there. Unfrtunately being chased by a pirate & didnt want to go silent so got a big fine!!
