Off topic but sort of relevant- I signed up yesterday afternoon to Aisling Duval so I can fit prismatic shields to my exploration ship and passenger liners. So do I move the propaganda 3 weeks today ready for the following Thursday BGS tick? Or 4 weeks? Iâ€™m confusing myself since I signed up on a Thursday afternoon (never done any PP before, is there a timer on her PP page?)
From my notes below (cos I always forget) I think it might be the former. Then the tick happens. Then after a few hours (or the tick the next day?) you'll have waited 4 weeks so then be able to buy the shields. I might be wrong though.

My notes:
