Asterism Virgin has a lot of galaxies. Maybe it says about Virgin?

Indeed, the Virgo Cluster is a well known group of galaxies, but not the only one. Wikipedia (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_galaxy_groups_and_clusters) lists several that relate to constellation and visible objects:
Local Group (wikipedia says “two clusters of galaxies in a "dumbbell" shape: the Milky Way and its satellites form one lobe, and the Andromeda Galaxy and its satellites constitute the other”)
Leo triplet
Centaurus group
M81 group
Sculptor group
Canes Venatici group
Draco group
Ursa Major group
Gemini cluster
Pegasus group
Cetus group (space whales! )
Cancer cluster (though just a visual alignment, not a real cluster)
etc

There’s also a protocluster named BoRG-58, but wouldnt advise exploring that-you might be assimilated!

To quote Sky&Telescope (https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/get-to-know-the-ghostly-galaxies-of-sagittarius/) “We often think of Sagittarius as home to only one galaxy — the Milky Way. But two members of the Local Group and a smattering of fainter galaxies reside here, too.” And of course there’s the mythological link of Queen Cassiopeia and her daughter Andromeda.

To get “mother of galaxies” from Virgo would be a bit of a philosophical leap of faith (parthenogenesis). Seems to me Cassiopeia and Milky Way are the best candidates, but any of the others (leo, Sagittarius, Ursa Major etc) could be thought of as female and described as a mother...
