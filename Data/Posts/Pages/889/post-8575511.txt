Was just passing through LZ Ursa Majoris 7 when i heard the little noise that something was there... so i looked - and found a mega-ship... oooh cool!
So i check it out - 10 Canum Venaticorum... odd name... hunting dogs? .... Just as im scanning the ship log, I get a fleet of vipers.. and me in my asp held together with tinfoil....
ya I lasted about 2 seconds. Reminded me of the time I found those canisters of gold just floating out there...
