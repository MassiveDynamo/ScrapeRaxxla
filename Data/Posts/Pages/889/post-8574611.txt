Has the bottom fallen out of the Thargoid Sensor market? or is this a consequence of having signed up with Aisling for Prismatic Shields and I'm now in a Hostile Power station?
EDDB is telling me I can sell UA/TS at Smith Hanger in HIP 70269 for 302K, but there seems to be no option to sell these- there's no blackmarket & no Commodities Market interest
