Eye of Ra is femmine counterpart of the sun god Ra. That goddess (Hathor) is often represented by a cobra (and some other animals). Hathor was some time named as sky goddess (mother of galaxies?). The symbol of Uraeus is the feature on many royal headgears and crowns in Ancient Egypt (the jewel on the brow?). It often appers as a cobra. And again. Cobra is the name of the game engine (am I right?). I start to think that Raxxla is a part of the game engine too.

I'm so crazy today...

We're all Raxxla.
BOOM. You win!
