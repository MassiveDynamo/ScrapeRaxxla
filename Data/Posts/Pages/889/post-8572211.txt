Hi all, first post but long time lurker. Trying to make sense of it as an amateur astronomer. I know it was maybe mentioned so far. But I believe the only clue is the first sentence of the toast.

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!

jewel = star, star system, something

mother of galaxies = Cassiopeia

= the summit of a hill or pass

= The starâ€™s name, Schedar, derives from the Arabic word for breast.



So am I crazy or is it something? The system is empty and after scanning all the signals only those two were interesting but I think they are generated the same around the galaxy.

Put on some tinfoil and a cup of coffee. My old notes on the same subject, however I did not follow it through in the end. Too many open ends.
But perhaps you can pick something up, I don't mind sharing.

Cassiopeia
Notes Cassiopeia (?) SN_1572? Carthage
