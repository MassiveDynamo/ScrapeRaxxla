Off topic but sort of relevant- I signed up yesterday afternoon to Aisling Duval so I can fit prismatic shields to my exploration ship and passenger liners. So do I move the propaganda 3 weeks today ready for the following Thursday BGS tick? Or 4 weeks? Iâ€™m confusing myself since I signed up on a Thursday afternoon (never done any PP before, is there a timer on her PP page?)
