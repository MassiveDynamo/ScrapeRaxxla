So far I only have the 1st galaxy in the 1984 elite matched against EDSM. The in game systems are:

QUBE
LAVE
LEGEES
QUATOR
AREXE
REORTE
RIEDQUAT
LEESTI
RA
ENSOREUS
LEONED
ERLAZA
TIONISLA
ZAONCE
TEVERI
EDEDLEEN
DISO
AONA
ISINOR
USZAA
LARAIS
ZARECE
TIBIONIS
ORRERE
QUCERERE
RITILA
ORESQU
TEORGE
QUTIRI
TIANVE
ORERVE


Of these there are a few oddities that have no planets: QUTIRI,QUCERERE,TIBIONIS,AONA,ERLAZA,LEONED,QUBE - of these AONA is in the DW novella
Scanning these systems with FSS would seem to be a good idea in case we have missed something.

Only ISINOR is permit locked and can be obtained

USZAA have a world far out named 'Jameson's Pride'

None have an 8th moon of a gas giant, though there are eight bodies around a gas giant in Tionisla (but every man and his dog and its fleas have been there!)

If you count Y brown dwarves as gas giants (as EDSM seems to) then RA is a possibility - and given its name , I'd go there too and have a scratch around

Bizarrely Leesti data is either corrupt or incomplete on EDSM :S

Happy hunting ,

If you search for Beor, you will be led to CD-64 139, so it might be ingame, too.
Thirty of the systems build kind of a cluster - two are more off the path: Ra and Beor. Ra is kind of interesting: it has an Unauthorized Installation called "Steelhook Hold", orbiting the 8. moon of a brown dwarf - which is kind of a slightly bigger gas giant ;-). You normally will be immediately attacked by pirates, if you enter the site.
