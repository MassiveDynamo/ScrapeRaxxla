Interestingly there is only 1 system in galaxy 2 that is in the EDSM list

Atius:

21 bodies with no GG's with 8.
2 outposts and a planetary outpost

Atius is an American Indian deity:

'The creator deity of the Pawnees. He is said to have ordered the courses of the sun, moon, and stars. The Pawnee tribes were so named because the warriors dressed their hair like ‘a horn’. The conception of Atius Tirawa may owe something to European settlers, whom the Pawnees encountered on the Great Plains, but astral worship was always a feature of their belief.'

So might be a coincidence, but no sign of this name in RW astronomy at least not in SIMBAD..

Shame I'm 000s of lY away ..
