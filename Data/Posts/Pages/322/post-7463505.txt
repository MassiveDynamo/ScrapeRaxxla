A bunch of requests about Raxxla came up on my twitch stream last night, so I sort of went into it a bit. I've uploaded it to youtube for reference. You may find it interesting.



Cheers,

Fine stream, thx for clarifying some concepts and lore.
But you didn't even mention a few important things:

_ (no clues) ' Mmmh, that's true but I think you have to make part of it a tiny bit obvious, so people know what they are doing.' (MB)
_ A certain celestial body. The Myth. Obfuscated in the outer rim. (E/F missions.)

No thoughts about these ?
