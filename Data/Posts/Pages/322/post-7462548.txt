A bunch of requests about Raxxla came up on my twitch stream last night, so I sort of went into it a bit. I've uploaded it to youtube for reference. You may find it interesting.



Cheers,

Interesting point about specific systems from the original Elite being chosen for inclusion in ED. There is a complete list of all the systems in the 8 galaxies in Oolite at http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Category:Oolite_planet_list
Do the systems in Oolite exactly match the original Elite? This would seem to be a good starting point to find places of interest that may have some relevance to the lore of both The Dark Wheel and Raxxla.
