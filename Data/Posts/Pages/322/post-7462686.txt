A bunch of requests about Raxxla came up on my twitch stream last night, so I sort of went into it a bit. I've uploaded it to youtube for reference. You may find it interesting.



Cheers,

Just finished watching the stream. Tyvm for that 07.
The one thing that irks me (not about your exposee but in general) is that Raxxla hasn't been found in the 1984 Elite. I mean what's the point of hyping it up... shipping a whole book about it with the game... and then NOT putting it in the game.

I don't like my own theory about the above.. which is to dangle a carrot to give people a purpose. A purpose that never vanishes because it can't be found.

Regarding the 'other universe' / 'other galaxy' in the sense of Elite 1984 -> i read that to simply be: 'not on chart 1'.
