So far I only have the 1st galaxy in the 1984 elite matched against EDSM. The in game systems are:

QUBE
LAVE
LEGEES
QUATOR
AREXE
REORTE
RIEDQUAT
LEESTI
RA
ENSOREUS
LEONED
ERLAZA
TIONISLA
ZAONCE
TEVERI
EDEDLEEN
DISO
AONA
ISINOR
USZAA
LARAIS
ZARECE
TIBIONIS
ORRERE
QUCERERE
RITILA
ORESQU
TEORGE
QUTIRI
TIANE
ORERVE

Of these there are a few oddities that have no planets: QUTIRI,QUCERERE,TIBIONIS,AONA,ERLAZA,LEONED,QUBE - of these AONA is in the DW novella
Scanning these systems with FSS would seem to be a good idea in case we have missed something.

Only ISINOR is permit locked and can be obtained

USZAA have a world far out named 'Jameson's Pride'

None have an 8th moon of a gas giant, though there are eight bodies around a gas giant in Tionisla (but every man and his dog and its fleas have been there!)

If you count Y brown dwarves as gas giants (as EDSM seems to) then RA is a possibility - and given its name , I'd go there too and have a scratch around

Bizarrely Leesti data is either corrupt or incomplete on EDSM :S

Happy hunting ,

Qutiri is also mentioned indirectly in The Dark Wheel novella, as Alex is given Qutirian SynCognac by a rescue robot whilst in his Remlok waiting for a ship to recover him (page 14). I also see Xezaor, a system in the original Elite mentioned in TDW novella (where Alex has his first solo combat) is not in EDSM. I'll have a look for it in the Galaxy Map - EDSM entries imply a previous visit by someone running EDDiscovery or similar so it could still be there.
I think the systems you list above will make a good set to scan this weekend
