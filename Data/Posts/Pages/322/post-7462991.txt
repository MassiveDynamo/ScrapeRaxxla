This is not what it means for a body to be tidally locked. The Moon, for instance, is tidally locked to the Earth. The same side always faces Earth as it completes an orbit.

What you're talking about is Lagrange Points which (I may be wrong) I don't believe are supported by the physics of the Elite Dangerous game engine. An object orbiting at L[SUB]2[/SUB] would remain eclipsed from the star by the planet that it is orbiting:

Yep this is exactly what I was conceptualizing, thanks for the info! Im learning new stuff about our skies, constellations, and astrophysics stuff every day from this game. Kind of cool to be honest.
