1) there are no clues 1a). (Codex entries for Dark Wheel & Raxxla appear to be more fd misdirection, but some have faith that they are clues) 2) there is much speculation 2a) (there is also much mythology) 3) there are as many hypotheses as players 4) actually there are probably more hypotheses than players 5) there is no concensus on any hypothesis or set thereof Good luck in your Quest. Let us know if you find anything! PS. We are always happy to discuss hypotheses! PPS. We are even happier when someone presents some evidence!
Thanks mate. Sums it up perfectly for me, so I can keep doing what I'm doing in game, and catch up on the Raxxla theory in thread over time
