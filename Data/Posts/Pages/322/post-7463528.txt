Heya, I read this whole thread (twice!), and asking new peeps who are starting out on their Raxxla journey to go through it is a bit... daunting. It took me several days to get through it each time. I tried to compile everyone's theories, guesses, speculations into a google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xWZ-USAMhcpMIeNECsUd_pOChwxI_-J_pfqj0RGWul0/edit?usp=sharing I linked back to the specific post that suggested looking in a certain place, and I only included guesses/theories that seemed to point in specific directions/narrow down the search area. I'm going to go through the doc over the next few days and clean it up, add commander names for credit. Maybe make it look nicer, add a spreadsheet, etc
Great link, thanks!
