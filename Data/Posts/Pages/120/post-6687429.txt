Okay, lets assume for a second that "The Dark Wheel" is canon. It doesn't change anything, because Raxxla is a myth even within the canon lore. It's entirely possible and furthermore likely that the in-lore characters are absolutely wrong about this. I brought up Odysseas and the dwarf elephant skulls (it could've also been a blacksmith guild according to wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclops). It spiraled up over thousands of years to giant cyclops. This is by far not the only example. It is not uncommon to stumble over myths, that originated from true events, people or facts, but were twisted tremendously. Turning Raxxla from a person, or an asteroid, or a moon to planet, seems pretty likely to me.


Yeah that's a good point, but does that mean that Braben and Brooks couldn't have morphed the whole Raxxla idea?


awww :3

I'm not disagreeing. Raxxla is a myth but it is a myth about a planet. Whatever Raxxla actually is the starting point is a search for a planet. That search can obviously evolve into something else as more information is gathered over time but the best guess right now is that we are looking for a planet.

...and sure. Braben and Brooks could have completely changed Raxxla into something completely out of character with Holdstock's intentions. It is my sincere hope that they haven't been so crass though. I'm sure they are aware of the importance that Raxxla has to a certain generation of gamers.
