Honestly, who thinks there is a large enough part of players interested in this quest (journey) to make the FDevs feel concerned ? They spend dozens of hours in Q&A debating on a lot of things ... nothing about R. It's an easter egg, I bet. And only the Cmdr who discovers it will get some benefice of it.
