Be aware : in Elite: Dangerous "...a certain celestial body. The Myth.
Why didn't say simply "a certain planet. The Myth" ?
Because it may not be.
I wouldn't focus on the Rafe Zetter's planet... It's passed out lore. I stick to the game.

Thats what I was trying to say. Rafe has never been to Raxxla. Alex hasn't been, The Dark Wheel hasn't been, no one in lore we know of knows where Raxxla is. The only people I can think of that might know, are the members of the club, but we might as well assume that Chuck Norris knows, it wouldn't give us any further information.

The celestial bodies thang, well, the following things are considered as celestial bodies:
- gas: stars, star hulls, gas giants, gas nebulae, interstellar matter, molecule clouds, halos
- solid: planets, moons, asteroids, comets, meteorites
- dust: dark clouds, planetary rings, interplanetary dust
- compound systems: star clusters, galaxies, galaxy clusters
- voids: star voids, galactic voids
- unknown: black holes, dark matter

Pick your favourite. Of course we can eliminate some of those options but there are still too many possibilities.
