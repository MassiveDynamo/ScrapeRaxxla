Strictly speaking you are correct. The Dark Wheel is not 'canon'. There are however plenty of clues that point to the core elements of The Dark Wheel story line being a part of this version of Elite's history.

John Harper's And Here the Wheel reveals that The Dark Wheel exists as an organization and cements the Ryder family's role in that organization. It also reveals that the quest for Raxxla became a primary goal of The Dark Wheel. Drew Wagar's Premonition contains a character who appears in every way to be Elyssia Fields from Holdstock's original novella.
Okay, lets assume for a second that "The Dark Wheel" is canon. It doesn't change anything, because Raxxla is a myth even within the canon lore. It's entirely possible and furthermore likely that the in-lore characters are absolutely wrong about this. I brought up Odysseas and the dwarf elephant skulls (it could've also been a blacksmith guild according to wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclops). It spiraled up over thousands of years to giant cyclops. This is by far not the only example. It is not uncommon to stumble over myths, that originated from true events, people or facts, but were twisted tremendously. Turning Raxxla from a person, or an asteroid, or a moon to planet, seems pretty likely to me.

It's important to remember that Raxxla is entirely the creation of Robert Holdstock and not either David Braben or Ian Bell. [...]
Yeah that's a good point, but does that mean that Braben and Brooks couldn't have morphed the whole Raxxla idea?
