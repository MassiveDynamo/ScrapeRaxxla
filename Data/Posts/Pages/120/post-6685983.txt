Could be. I like to think at Raxxla like a kind of easter egg with nothing to do with others storylines and destined to the small part of players who are fans of the original Elite. It's somewhere there from the beginnig, even if it may have technically evolved like the Rift mYsTeRy did. (The portal passing from orbit in pre-horizons to the surface, for example. But we can imagine dozens of game mechanics to allow access to the portal..)
I hope FDevs think like me.

Yeah, the non-cynic in me agrees. It clearly could have evolved and it's not like they *have* to put a big flashing POI sign saying 'this way to Raxxla'. If it's only visually visible and it's a portal say twice the size of a corvette it could be sitting on the surface of a landable planet 200LY from Sol and there's an excellent chance nobody's seen it even if it's bloody obvious if you did.

From an implementation perspective it could just be a special jump animation and you just fly through. Maybe there are multiple already set up to handle long term planed expansion, so the bubble, Colonia etc. The plan being to 'find' them in a few years. The funny thing is I can already see the howls of unfair by folks who've trek'd to Colonia and back if a recently discovered Raxxla Gate allows a simply jump by flying to a spot in the bubble first.

edit: come to think of it, it'll probably be a year after squadrons once folks are sick and tired of lugging massive carriers around.
