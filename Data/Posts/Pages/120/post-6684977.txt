I'll just quote Rafe Zetter from The Dark Wheel on this one: 'Raxxla's no alien, Alex. It's a ghost world. A planet. A legend . . .'

I'll just quote Canonn from Canonn on this one: 'Alas, the Dark Wheel is not considered ‘canon’ for Elite Dangerous so we cannot rely on this description of Raxxla, [...].' (Source: https://canonn.science/lore/drewwagar-raxxla/)
Assuming that Raxxla is not what we think it is, is justified.

EDIT: By the way, because you explicitly highlighted "A planet": "Planet" is greek and means wanderer, which could technically refer to a person.
