I'm still of the opinion there is a planetary base out there on some lowly, forgotten world, FAR from the bubble, that contains a long abandoned, dilapidated base. A base once visited (and perhaps inhabited briefly) by Jason Ryder. Here there contains, something, proofing Raxxla exists. But perhaps no coordinates....

If Raxxla is really accessible since launch, then this wouldn't be true, because there was no planetary landing back then. Therefore the whole landing on a planet thing shouldn't be a thing.
