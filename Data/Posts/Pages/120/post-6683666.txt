From my understanding so far The dark wheel never found Raxxla. In the Dark wheel nouvelle Jason Ryder found proofs of its existence and paid with his life for it.

content from The Dark Wheel

'Jason Ryder was convinced that Raxxla existed. That's why he trained for, and became a part of,
the Dark Wheel, the legend-seekers. I hadn't heard much from him or about him for some time until
just before he died, when he told me he'd found evidence for the real existence of Raxxla. He came

back from
Deep Space to get a proper team together . . . '

I haven't get my hands on Elite:And Here the Wheel, but only thing i can find is that there was a fall out within the organization as too wether they search for Raxxla or Soontill. They split up and the Dark wheel stills search for Raxxla while the new off shot corp known as Circle of Elite pilots or Circle of Independent Elite Pilots (CIEP) searched for Soontill and found it till it was turned into volcanic mess by pirates.

The only thing they found out is Soontill. No more mention on Raxxla?...Only people with full knowledge of the lore can be more specific.

I'm still of the opinion there is a planetary base out there on some lowly, forgotten world, FAR from the bubble, that contains a long abandoned, dilapidated base. A base once visited (and perhaps inhabited briefly) by Jason Ryder. Here there contains, something, proofing Raxxla exists. But perhaps no coordinates....
