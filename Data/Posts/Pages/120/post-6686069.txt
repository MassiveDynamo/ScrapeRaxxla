If Raxxla is really accessible since launch, then this wouldn't be true, because there was no planetary landing back then. Therefore the whole landing on a planet thing shouldn't be a thing.

Be aware : in Elite: Dangerous "...a certain celestial body. The Myth.
Why didn't say simply "a certain planet. The Myth" ?
Because it may not be.
I wouldn't focus on the Rafe Zetter's planet... It's passed out lore. I stick to the game.
