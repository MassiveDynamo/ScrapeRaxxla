The only mentions in the "new lore" that I'm aware of are in And Here the Wheel where we learn of CIEP's connection to TDW and the Ryders and in Elite: Legacy where it is mentioned that Julia had dreamed of being the first to find Raxxla. Of course the Children of Raxxla are mentioned in Drew Wagar's Premonition but I don't think Raxxla itself is discussed. This is all strictly from memory though and I may have missed something.

I'm not a real doctor. I only play one on the forums

Might ask Liz, she might know what her cousins Oberon and Neptune were up to. I figure she got really good at explosive by reverse engineering Soontill bits so maybe she's on the wrong branch of the family to worry about Raxxla.

I brought her 1000 tons of fish to try and get her to talk but she just said thanks and so long.
