I'll just quote Canonn from Canonn on this one: 'Alas, the Dark Wheel is not considered ‘canon’ for Elite Dangerous so we cannot rely on this description of Raxxla, [...].' (Source: https://canonn.science/lore/drewwagar-raxxla/)
Assuming that Raxxla is not what we think it is, is justified.

EDIT: By the way, because you explicitly highlighted "A planet": "Planet" is greek and means wanderer, which could technically refer to a person.

You kind of deftly left out a bit of Drew's quote. The ellipsis bit is: "though my suspicion is that it remains fairly accurate"

You also left out this bit: "Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there’s an alien construct that’s a gateway to other Universes, and all that’s in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life . . ."

So either the only reference to Raxxla in all Elite lore is complete bollucks in which case why would it be in ED at all or it's some form of gateway. So if it's a person they better pucker up when somebody flies a cutter through them to Andromeda.

The cynic in me (based on a few years of experience with FD) says that Raxxla doesn't exist and if/when it does there will be a teaser, some incredibly obtuse puzzle which will be solved when somebody playing on XBOX randomly flies into it at which point we'll all fly out and honk at.

Where's the penguin, ask him he know.s.
