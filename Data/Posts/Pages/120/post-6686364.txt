Yeah that's not evidence of Drew lying (your claim) that's evidence of that person being butthurt (a lot of us were). Drew always claimed it was bloody unlikely anybody would find it or understand what they found until the clues were all in. That was true because originally it was just some Annies floating in the black, later it became the ships which were found and the clues were added.

Was it a monumental cluster ? My vote is yes but that was on FDEV and to some extent us for fooling ourselves that our interest and excitement would translate directly to the quality of reality. In no way shape or form does that mean Drew lied.

edit: I'm going to leave that up but I'm moderately at myself for replying and even getting dragged into this conversation. This kind of crap is why I left.
