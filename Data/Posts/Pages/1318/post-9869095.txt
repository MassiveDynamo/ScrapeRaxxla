Ah, that’s my way of thinking!
Has anyone gone into the nearest Aldi to FD’s HQ in Cambridge and asked for the Raxxla shelf?
Alternatively could be in the nearest pizza shop or off-licence!

(those are straws that I’m grasping at!!)
Im actually stupid enough to try that next time im down that way, except theres no way my truck will fit in an Aldi car park
I once drove past the HQ (had a delivery down the road) and yes i saluted and yes i felt a right muppet.
Funny old day that, i actually discovered Cambridge had an Airport.
