He also did mermaids/sirens but with fish heads....


Magritte also had a painting called La Toile de Penelope.... Some may say that 'la toile' is just cloth or a canvas... but could it be a play on l'etoile?.... Stella! We all know that the real Stella was Lady Penelope Devereux... Is this a painting of Stella and why is her nose red? Maybe she is telling us the answer is right under our nose? Because underneath the painting of Penelope was L’évidence éternelle .... maybe not a brow... but something is definitely afoot.
