what you are talking about is a siren, or a dark siren depending on the source.

From Wikipedia: Standard Siren: "Gravitational waves originating from the inspiral phase of compact binary systems, such as neutron stars or black holes, have the useful property that energy emitted as gravitational radiation comes exclusively from the orbital energy of the pair, and the resultant shrinking of their orbits is directly observable as an increase in the frequency of the emitted gravitational waves. "

now there is also a dark siren which is the collision of two neutron stars and/or black holes. Also from Wikipedia: "A dark siren is a gravitational wave event which is being used by astronomers to establish the Hubble constant.[1] It is caused by the merger of two black holes or two neutron stars. The collision of two such objects creates distortions in space-time which propagate as waves through space. These events are fairly rare in the universe, and must be detected by multiple gravitational wave telescopes in order to be valuable for scientists. A dark siren is an alternate form of a , an interstellar measurement of "loudness" of gravitational waves (analogous to sound waves). In 2019 the neutron star merger GW170817 resulted in a dark siren"

Interesting, the siren again... and 3 posts above is a list with containing a star system with 2 black holes... not quite what I had in mind, but I'll pay it a visit.
