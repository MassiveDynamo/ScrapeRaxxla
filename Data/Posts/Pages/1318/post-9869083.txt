Popping in for no particular reason, recently caught the Raxxla bug again so I've been reading over material and formulating stupid theories.

Source 2 has undoubtably been considered before as a possible link in the search. At the risk of tossing more fuel on that fire, has anyone played around with the idea that it's abnormal Kepler Orbit reflects the reasoning behind it's real-world behavior?



S2 is the only star orbiting Sag A that is represented in Elite's universe (as a system, at least), despite there actually being quite a few. An illustration of the star's orbit pattern is visualized in this article from 2020, but it's eccentricity had been noted in 2012 (via the Journal of Astronomy & Astrophysics[][]). ED would have been in development at this time and anyone reading peer-reviewed astronomical journals would likely have been aware of this information.

I'm might be grasping for straws, but it doesn't seem far-fetched to imagine a scenario where Source 2's orbit is somehow a guide for locating objects in supercruise. The very inclusion of S2 implies the existence of S1, S8, S12, S13 and S14 as . At the very least I feel like it's incorporation into the game is meant to hold some significance, regardless of whether it's Raxxlan in nature.

Thoughts?

There is already an S1 its in the bubble in a CD system owned by the empire with 0 population and has been a head scratcher system since gamma
