ED would have been in development at this time and anyone reading peer-reviewed astronomical journals would likely have been aware of this information.

Thoughts?
I've searched for astronomical discoveries around the time and tried to link them to Raxxla over the years and keep going back to that theory every so often.... Every time I try another theory I always check for any discoveries that might be linked, share a name with a system, planet, etc... On the basis it might have influenced their decision on where to put it...

Cambridge based discoveries, recordings, investigations, etc I always Google...
