Is there any indication of where the guardians originated?
Gamma Velorum (or near to it) seems to be the core of what was Guardian space.

Or where their AI creation fled too? I would venture to guess that it's nigh story time to unravel the missing guardian civilization and speculate on where the AI has taken up residence...
What makes you think they fled?

also is there any creedence to Halperts comment about "...octagonal ships blotting out the stars..." reference in the kickstarter?
Someone else can probably answer this one.
