Not sure if it is relevant but the symbol for raxxla has an eye and a circle around it, PLUS 42 broken or segmented bits around the circle. Did FDEV not just divide the galaxy into 42 sectors. Everyone thought it was a reference to hitchhiker but maybe it ties into the symbol.

32 Dotted Lines not 42... over at the Hunt for Raxxla Forums we have done a rough overlay of the Emblem over the new Galactic Sectors. It all lined up fairly smooth. Look at investigation #7.
