Curious if you bookmark the systems where Guardian Beacons have been found, they form any sort of shape, or better yet, can see if 6 of them intersect to an area where a search can begin. I believe there are 19 documented Beacons, at the moment.

I have tried to fit a DBX inside the area where the Ancient Key pops out, but was either too big, or not quick enough to force my way in there.

Now that I look back at the Raxxla Codex icon, the curved lines are in the way of those "bridges" almost like they indicate the pylons that have to be popped a few times for the beacon to actually "open".
