or
5 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 6
Note that the 6's are lined up with the "belt" symbol.

Thanks. Need to check some old pictures to compare coincidence.

Reasons behind my speculation: there is an object ("key to unlock bunker door") with 2 doors (lets imagine 1 enter and 1 exit) with a lock right in-front of Guardian "bunker" at some Guardian structure sites. Orientation looks like one need to pass through the both doors with small ramps (see picture above for the lock) to step right in-front of the "bunker" door with a triangle on it. Will dig out the picture of the scene.
