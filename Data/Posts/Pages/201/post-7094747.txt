Is there any indication of where the guardians originated? Or where their AI creation fled too? I would venture to guess that it's nigh story time to unravel the missing guardian civilization and speculate on where the AI has taken up residence...
also is there any creedence to Halperts comment about "...octagonal ships blotting out the stars..." reference in the kickstarter?
