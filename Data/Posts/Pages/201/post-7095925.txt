Interesting. The veteran Rifters are used to more... stimulating and psychedelic aids than coffee and Arcanonn's biscuits... Perhaps that's why we actually never discovered a single thing... [haha]

They dont come much more veteran than me, but the sun aint over the yardarm yet!
coffee + couple of hobnobs must suffice until my sundowner of Lavian brandy (while watching Dr Who, perhaps she’ll lead us there)

And those hobnobs are not Dr Arcanonn’s; they’re all mine!!!


& I think the lack of progress equates to the lack of clues rather than stimulation; we have had many hypotheses but nothing concrete to go on other than “it’s in the Milky Way” which is basically no use whatsoever. I want to see if “place that is not a place. Door that is also the key” acquires some in-game legitimacy by appearing in this codex thingy. Those are the only real clues we have & it’s very suspicious that TDW missions that gave us those disappeared ages ago.
