I hate to say it, but I think we'll have to wait for at least the Beta before that symbol makes any sense. For one, we might have to wait that long to get a detailed look at it, and if some of these theories are accurate, details are going to matter. An inaccurate recreation could have us looking at the wrong end of the galaxy. Think "Raiders of the Lost Ark"; we could be missing the other side of the coin.
