Why thank you very much! Scorprox long time no eat cabbage soup! Mmmmmmmmlll [heart]
Unfortunately I have not seen the movie that you mentioned, but I´ve a weird sensation about that actor.

Okay enough! One day it has to be! I have to make a confession.

Scorprox not proud about it, but this needs to stop. Now!
Listen, that´s what really happened:
