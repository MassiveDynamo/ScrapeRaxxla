As folks are tin-foiling on the Guardian stuff, I'm just going to throw this little morsel out for everyone's delectation.

Prior to their exile in the first civil war, the Guardians who had adopted brain implants had achieved a partial mind-machine singularity. They and the Guardian AI had a shared thought space.

A shared thought space is virtual. It is a place that is not a place.



Ok... may as well go full out on this one.

The shared thought space was in it's infancy at the time of the exile, circa 2 Million years ago. A more developed version could very conceivably be a whole new universe, and full of riches for anyone that could access it.

Some people have known about the Guardians for hundreds of years. This is not the first time humanity is encountering them. Knowledge of them has certainly been obfuscated.

Slightly more clutching at straws now:

The term construct suddenly started appearing in the newest set of Guardian logs.

Melville talked about finding the key.

There is literally now a Guardian Key.

There's a parallels between the Guardian tech and SAP 8 Cores (or their contents at least).

That's all just off the top of my head, there's probably more.

The Guardian exciles/constructs are my no.1 candidate for Raxxla builders to. Everything time they add some new stuff there, something has a little Raxxla ring to it
