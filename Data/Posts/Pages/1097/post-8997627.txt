Mmm, some interesting observations there. I’ve never spotted dotted circles on my galmap, will look later today.

The Thargoid “brand”/skin marking has been the subject of speculation for several years. The most credible idea I read was that it is supposed to represent Barnard’s Loop. But there is Olivia Vespera's Thargoid Marking Identification Table and a thread (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/thargoid-data-gathering-effort-we-need-your-help.381230/) about Thargoid data gathering which you should investigate; this is the Quest for Raxxla thread: we know much, speculate about even more, but don’t know everything.

Be careful! Since people rapidly solved some puzzles based on star matching etc FD now frequently manipulate the images they release. The one of the red star with planet and Orbis station (supposedly TDW’s, but it may be fluff) is clearly manipulated. You can check this for yourself as that type of station occurs in the bubble (I used Aulin Enterprise) & clearly the colour balance has been altered. You can change the colour balance back to reality yourself so the lights on the rear of the station match the colour of Aulin Enterprise. The star then becomes not so red, and I think is an M type subdwarf ( M VI). Somewhere in this thread I posted my colour-corrected version. FD also manipulate the perspective and I strongly suspect they have done so here, so the apparent distances are likely to be incorrect. Those orbital distances and size of the moon/planet look suspicious

edit: here's my colour-corrected version

it seems my space madness is reaching new heights, but what if the station is not a station at all, but a robot...
