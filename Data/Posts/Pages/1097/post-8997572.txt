Not sure ... But reminds me FD has put some effort into their Divine Feminine Mothergoddess stuff...

The system Anahit has two bodies Ikralla and Nergal

Anahit being the Armenian version of Anahita - an Indo-Iranian goddess of the Waters ... think Saraswati

was married to rulers of the underworld .
