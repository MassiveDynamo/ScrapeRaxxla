I took a closer look at the pictures in the Codex yesterday. And I have questions:
SPOILER
1. I can't understand what the emblem of the Targoids means ?
SPOILER
2. What are those dots in this picture and in the Raxxla icon in the picture above ? Why are there 3 rings on the galaxy map? (I could be wrong, but I seem to be able to distinguish the usual numbers on the middle row of dots. )
Could this sign just mean a galaxy, like somewhere out there and not a specific place?
SPOILER
3. Why is the picture of the Dark Wheel on the right exactly like that? This is a particular star with a particular distance to the star and a planet still visible. Can we roughly determine the distance to the star?
