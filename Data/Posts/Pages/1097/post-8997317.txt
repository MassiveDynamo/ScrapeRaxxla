As you probably all are aware of, there is some resemblance between the inner part of Raxxla logo and the Hecate's Wheel.

SPOILER

Hecate as a goddess of crossroads, may give meaning to the rest of the logo symbolism. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecate#Functions

All this has been discussed before, in this thread. I just found a poem about Hecate that includes a lot of the words used in relation with Raxxla.

Have a read. See if you can make anything of it, or if it leads somewhere interesting.

Hecate is a system in ED and 100 Hekate is an asteroid in Sol.

Interesting. And who was recently in the solar system, is there a texture of Anahata on Saturn ?
