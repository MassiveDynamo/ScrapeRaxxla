Side note on Hekate's Wheel
As far as I can tell it is a modern wiccan creation - probably based off of the hindu yantra
In the yantra the square that surrounds it is supposed to symbolize a temple with the little platform like things (for want of a better description) that stick out are supposed to be the entrances.
SPOILER: YANTRA

Hekate's top is described by Psellus in his commentaries on the Chaldean Oracles.

SPOILER: HEKATES TOP

I suspect this image of a triangular bronse base(?) from pergamon is closer to what Hekate's top looked like.

SPOILER: AMIBOUSA
