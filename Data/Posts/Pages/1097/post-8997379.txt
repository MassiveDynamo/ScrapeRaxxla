Interesting. And who was recently in the solar system, is there a texture of Anahata on Saturn ?

Not sure ... But reminds me FD has put some effort into their Divine Feminine Mothergoddess stuff...

The system Anahit has two bodies Ikralla and Nergal

Anahit being the Armenian version of Anahita - an Indo-Iranian goddess of the Waters ... think Saraswati

Ikralla is the mesopotamian underworld

Nergal was married to Ershkigal rulers of the underworld .

Im seeing a tying in of the rivers as a conduits (crossroads) leading to the underworld .... or the space in between if you prefer
