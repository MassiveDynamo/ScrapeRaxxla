At least the Star of David or the 4th chakra is mostly painted green.

Ya I think the Green and Black is from this:

"Markings are unfamiliar . . .' Alex said. There had been black and green flags with bright sunbursts on them, and non-terrestrial ideographs on the sides."
- The Dark Wheel, Holdstock

Its kind of a sunburst - not bright of course. The Ideograms make me think of the Thargoid marks.... But ya no idea about what the colors relate to.
