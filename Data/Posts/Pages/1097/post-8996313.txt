Is it regarding Raxxla, I hope by Zeus’s beard it isn’t but experience teaches if something seems too good to be true, it probably is, so it works in reverse here.

Odyssey ... something something, personal journey something .... I do think our friend Theta 7 is a bit of an Odysseus figure ... "I no longer have a name. Nor a family. Nor a future.." - he became Outis. He has now taken on Theta 7... I get the impression he is going to take his followers on a horrible journey and get everyone killed. Something about the importance of names?

As far as Raxxla goes - ya I have come to accept that It is probably directly tied into the Thargoid and Guardian stories... But so far Im liking what they have done with it
