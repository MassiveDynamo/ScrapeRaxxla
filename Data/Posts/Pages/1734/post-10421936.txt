You have a point. Let me toy with this for a bit. There is one angle that I am kind of curious as to its impact. Presuming some level of connection between Thargoids and Guardians, we know Guardians were especially fond of using specific geometric shapes to relay information. Perhaps the odd shape is a flight path vector through 3D space. That actually isn't entirely crazy conceptually given the need to translate 2D images to 3D space. I say that because especially if this involves Orion Molecular Cloud you need know what hazards to avoid.
I believe these structures to be some sort of thargoid highway, there are trails left behind presumably by the previous incarnation of titans.
