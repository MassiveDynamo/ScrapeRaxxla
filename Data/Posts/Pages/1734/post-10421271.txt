There may be justification for utilizing Polaris since according to FFE journals Polaris is Thargoid occupied (as well as the missions). In that sense, both species have the same Northstar especially when you factor Egypt in from "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide". That's the only part I am torn on is which one.

Thoughts? In other words, how much do you trust the old lore?
