I do believe Jacques is linked…

Very much so - Jacques and Salvation so far …. Im sure there are probably more.

I feel strongly that the stories from FE2 were an attempt to continue the idea of the dark wheel and the bringing of characters from those stories into Elite is furthering that connection. Notice that when Jacques moved to Colonia there are now several systems that are related to axis… heavens and hells and lost worlds - in Colonia.

Was it Jacques who they were pointing to all the time? If so… is it also pointing back to the Stories from the Frontier?

I mentioned Salvation - he isnt obviously in FE2 - but there is a Imperial Guard working for… Sirius? Named- Wycherly in FFE - “A Business Proposal”

If that is the same Wycherly- then he was working for Sirius before Azimuth and INRA - or was Azimuth always a front for Sirius? The Club?

Wonder if there are other characters from FE that have kept around…
