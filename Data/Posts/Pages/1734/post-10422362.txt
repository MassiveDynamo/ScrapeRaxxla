There are a lot of Norse themed systems within the bubble. These I speculated fall upon the Axi Mundi.

The position of Odin's Wisdom is very peculiar because it is so far removed from these systems. Technically it ought to be much higher up if it were to fit with the existing cosmology. I can only speculate that it, like other similar systems (Delphi) are directional markers potentially created to highlight certain relationships!? Or itâ€™s an error.
