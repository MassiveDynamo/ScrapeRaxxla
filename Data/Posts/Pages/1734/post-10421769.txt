The idea needs some fine tuning: specifically this results in a weird shape in 3-D. I think we need a Thargoid one and human one (given Thargoids or Guardians may be builders of Raxxla). The concept at least is decent but understanding what to map where is trickier.

Human:
Sol, Polaris, PMD2009 48
Sol, Sol's True North Star, PMD2009 48

Thargoid:
Delphi, Polaris, PMD2009 48

Guardian would require knowing their home. Not impossible but may require more work.

Though knowing Thargoid "home" would be nice. Sadly, there are doubts that is a thing.

You think you find a genius way to shortcut the process and this game provides you a monkeywrench (prior examples Capella and fuel scoops). Fun times.

People doubt many things on the hunt, unjustifiably so. People need to trust the Creative process and their eye, their gut tells them to give up and go home, the yearning of a vagabond's soul.
