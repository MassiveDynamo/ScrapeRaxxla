IIRC the codex symbol/logo for Jacques bears a resemblance to TDW....

Could Jacques station be that of TDW which he commandeered?

However I've visited it several times & not seen a hint of anything out of the ordinary...TOHF perhaps to trigger something?

I am working on the idea that Jacques is a Holdstock Character - and has had life changing events… Im not sure if he is directly linked to the darkwheel or not. Looking at his story i see two obvious events- One is when he is “changed” from a human into a cyborg as part of joining the army. The other is the battle of Hellsgate… after which he works his way into becoming Jacques the barkeep we know.

I am of course drawn to Hellsgate for various reasons. I see Salvation as going through similar story arch and i believe the Proteus wave event has “changed” him into something else. Since FD worked on Premonition with Drew - i am fairly confident that they would have signed off on whether the dark wheel had been associated with the Tionisla orbital graveyard. So i think its safe to say that it was. I suspect the darkwheel has a graveyard fetish - or atleast a entrance to the underworld one…. Hence my interest in finding the Hellsgate battle site. Twisted men?

Of course there are other contenders such as Jameson or the more recent Titan Graveyards…. But i lean towards the battle in the empire due to the history there and all the interestingly named systems in that vicinity….
