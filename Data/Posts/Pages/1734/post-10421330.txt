Excellent work.
Thank you! I have a tonne more on the pc ready to show at any time, but I think it's best I do a writeup or video detailing just how insanely silly this gets.

If I'd have shown all 52 of my cards, it may just look like space madness.

I will say this though, the imagery puzzle extends even into the logography of the dredger clans - the Scriveners seem obvious here, but blue viper is the one that screams to me the most, bearing it's teeth and disjointed tongue, as if to say "here lies the center of Raxxla"
