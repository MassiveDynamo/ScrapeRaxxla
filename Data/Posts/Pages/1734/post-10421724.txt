The idea needs some fine tuning: specifically this results in a weird shape in 3-D. I think we need a Thargoid one and human one (given Thargoids or Guardians may be builders of Raxxla). The concept at least is decent but understanding what to map where is trickier.

Human:
Sol, Polaris, PMD2009 48
Sol, Sol's True North Star, PMD2009 48

Thargoid:
Delphi, Polaris, PMD2009 48

Guardian would require knowing their home. Not impossible but may require more work.

Though knowing Thargoid "home" would be nice. Sadly, there are doubts that is a thing.

You think you find a genius way to shortcut the process and this game provides you a monkeywrench (prior examples Capella and fuel scoops). Fun times.
