I don't remember who created the Axis Mundi theory, but I've something to add unless it's been seen already. At the bottom of the galaxy underneath Sol is another straight line of catalogged stars. In the middle at the very bottom... a system named Odin's Wisdom. Odin got his wisdom from the Well of Urd, at the roots of Ygdrassil. It is here Mimir let him drink for the cost of one eye.
