I rarely post here as I already run Independent Raxxla Hunters, but I thought it worth sharing what I've been spending the last 2 or so years on.

This top image serves as a key:

Blue dots - Guardian systems
Red dots - Permit locked regions
Green dots - Asteroid bases
Black in red dot - Sag A
Orange line - Colonia bridge

The green lines are purely observations about the structure of the game's galactic mystery.

Ask away if need be.

Oh, and the asteroid bases, yeah I'm pretty sure they're all the club.
