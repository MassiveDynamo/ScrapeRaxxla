If it isn't an exact right triangle there are other formulas that will work. That was a guess at what type it would be. Equilateral seems to be unlikely. This may also be restructured because of relative positions of Sol, Delphi, and Trapezium (causing a bent shape in 3D). Trapezium Cluster has star lovers. Perhaps we need several:

Human:
Sol, Polaris, PMD2009 48
Sol, Sol's True North Star, PMD2009 48

Thargoid (Thargoid or Guardians are likely the initial builders)
Delphi, Polaris, PMD2009 48

Though knowing the Thargoid "home" would be nice. Sadly, there are doubts that is a thing. 3-D space unfortunately has a knack for complicating any idea similar because differing distances for stars (and position relative to the disk).
