If the honk story is tru, that system is fully scanned and mapped by now. That story is old.

Even if the story is false, itâ€™s more and more likely that Raxxla is in a fully mapped system.
Agreed and i'm sure about 2 things:
either Raxxla is in an asteroid belt (how many people really visited them?, Now with the Great Raxxla Potato Hunt, nothing can go through radars but there are a lot of systems to scan).
Raxxla is not implemented in game. I mean either fdev lied to us or we need to first contact TDW and the missions are broken => so Raxxla is unaccessible.

We just need to wait players to fully scan all the asteroid belts.

While i'm writing this i just remember: the pulse wave analizer was at original state used for scan asteroids AND anomalies. But the release of the PWA were at same time as the Codex?
