If the honk story is tru, that system is fully scanned and mapped by now. That story is old.

Even if the story is false, itâ€™s more and more likely that Raxxla is in a fully mapped system.
Based on the 2296 start of the rumor, based on the Tau Ceti tourist beacon discovery happened sometime between 2159 (Tau Ceti self-sufficiency) and 2296. Now this was the slow expansion period (generation ships and the beginning of megaships from large corporations and governments with the very first "slow hyperspace" drives (hours to weeks between systems). So, it is near Sol and there are few options that allow for much else. Even hyperspace probes would get so far they couldn't retransmit in time for the rumor to get going by 2296 unless you invoke faster than light communications. We didn't Faraway until 2800 (which is centuries after Raxxla myth goes mainstream).
