Are you talking about the Zurara?
Yes, according to Drew the Zurara was originally a derelict Anaconda but when FD brought in megaships they upgraded Zurara to be a megaship. Just improved the visuals, didn't change the storyline.

I think if FD had upgraded Raxxla it would be done similarly, so basically what we’re looking for should be compatible with a planet/star/moon/BH/station/outpost/ship. The visuals may have changed but not the functionality. (Edit: still think Raxxla might be a Guardian arkship, so a spherical ship... possibly moon-sized)

Currently working on a new hypothesis. If it works out I’ll send a postcard, though inter-galactic mail is likely to be slow if it’s anything like local Royal Mail, who seem to have cut deliveries to about twice a week, IF they have sufficient post for an area to justify getting out of their nice warm sorting office...
