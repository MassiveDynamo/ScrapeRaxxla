It would be strange if Raxxla was based on any type of human built object. There could of course be a human installation on or in orbit around Raxxla, where the wicked Elites hang out.
Things like that may well have been updated with better assets, over time.
I am still not sure it is safe to say the installations are human-made. Here me out with this..

-There are no landing pads ANYWHERE on these things.
-There is ZERO EVIDENCE of human habitation.
-Installations are, however, strategically important.
-We are only assuming given the names they are human.

Remember my idea about the Talmor Lens network from the Alien World being at least part of the whole mystery. Well, these installations have a habit of really only appearing historically significant and especially mythologically named systems. The human lore only mentions explicitly: Orbis, Coriolis, Ocellus, outposts, planetary ports, and planetary settlements. Anything outside of that should be treated with high degree of skepticism.

For all we know, we stumbled on these things in the black and repurposed them or at least put enough decorations to make people think they are human designed (though they look like nothing human built). May I remind you, with the installations in Sol, they are way the hell in the black (as in Pluto or much further even).
