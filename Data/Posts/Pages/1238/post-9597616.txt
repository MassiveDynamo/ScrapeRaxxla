I was thinking more along the lines that a human agency might have built a human installation around the Omphalos, so unless you entered the right tunnel then nothing would happen- one possible explanation of why it hasnt been found, and also why (if true) a pilot might have entered the system, honked and left
If the honk story is tru, that system is fully scanned and mapped by now. That story is old.

Even if the story is false, itâ€™s more and more likely that Raxxla is in a fully mapped system.
