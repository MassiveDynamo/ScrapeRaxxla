I was thinking more along the lines that a human agency might have built a human installation around the Omphalos, so unless you entered the right tunnel then nothing would happen- one possible explanation of why it hasnt been found, and also why (if true) a pilot might have entered the system, honked and left
The only things we could honked at ED's earlier days was:
Stars
Planets
Rings
Stations

Now if you think it can be hidden in installation tunnels, look for military ones. They have a warning zone if you enter it.
