When did space installations come into game? I’m assuming “in the beginning” it was just astronomical bodies, ships and stations/outposts, then with Horizons we got surface outposts etc. Or am I wrong? Were installations in-game from the outset??
It would be strange if Raxxla was based on any type of human built object. There could of course be a human installation on or in orbit around Raxxla, where the wicked Elites hang out.
Things like that may well have been updated with better assets, over time.
