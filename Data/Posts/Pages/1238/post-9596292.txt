That’s what I thought, but need confirmation from people with better memory and longer experience than me!

Was thinking- the codex Raxxla entry implies “an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described as a gatewayor tunnel” may be the way to Raxxla. And the “evil men who are exploiting Raxxla” may have disguised the tunnel in an installation, since stations dont have tunnels. Space installations are riddled with tunnels-I’ve spent a few days flying through some. Still not found it.

The question then becomes would FD have changed the implementation so it was only accessible in Horizons? I lean against that possibility.
Also they changed the Salome Anaconda to a egaship whos not to say Raxxla was also a placeholder until now (or may infact still be)
