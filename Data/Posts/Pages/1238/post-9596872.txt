We have had the various types of "Outposts" from the beginning as well - but I think the "Installations" came about after CQC was introduced? ...I think.... Outgrowth of that specialized Installation they created for it - at least that is what the cobwebs are whispering to me. Its when I think i first noticed them. - So ya Id guess sometime at or after 1.4

It was the other way around... "Installations" came on the later half of Horizons and they brought these CQC assets to the main game.
