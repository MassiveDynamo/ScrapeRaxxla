When did space installations come into game? I’m assuming “in the beginning” it was just astronomical bodies, ships and stations/outposts, then with Horizons we got surface outposts etc. Or am I wrong? Were installations in-game from the outset??
IF Raxxla was in game since the beginning, neither space installations nor surface outposts were presents.
AFAIK, there were the 3 types of stations already present (coriolis, orbis and ocellus).
