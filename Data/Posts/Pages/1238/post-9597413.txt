It would be strange if Raxxla was based on any type of human built object. There could of course be a human installation on or in orbit around Raxxla, where the wicked Elites hang out.
Things like that may well have been updated with better assets, over time.
I was thinking more along the lines that a human agency might have built a human installation around the Omphalos, so unless you entered the right tunnel then nothing would happen- one possible explanation of why it hasnt been found, and also why (if true) a pilot might have entered the system, honked and left
