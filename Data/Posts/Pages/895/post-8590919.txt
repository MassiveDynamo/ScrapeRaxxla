This came to light about a month ago on the thread that started a drive to move TDW towards Sol. MB was asked to confirm & responded “no comment”. Two others who were said to have been there and heard it apparently recanted.
It’s not really important. Even by that short time into the game people had gone on long-distance exploration trips so even if true it doesn't really tie down the location of Raxxla, it could be just about anywhere. But it would have been nice to get an authoritative source, and it does seem to confirm it is in-game and discoverable. As was pointed out at the time it could be that Raxxla is a permit-locked planet...though I suspect not.
Or a permit locked asteroid
