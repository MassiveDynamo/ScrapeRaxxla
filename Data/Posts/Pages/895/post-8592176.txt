That's the old Pilot's Federation, before FDev updated it and replaced it so it couldn't be tampered with if I recall it correctly.
The old PF was prone to manipulation, expansion and like. I guess they just did a replacement and locked down the new version of it. I think this happened 3-4 years ago.
The old PF was then removed from all the other systems.
