Mind to share your findings?
According to EDSM: https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/3984/name/Nuenets
"The Pilot's Federation" was once in Nuenets, but now are no longer here.

However, after a bit of digging into this rabbit hole, I found something interesting. This isn't the Pilot's Federation Local Branch, as you see in Shinrarta, LHS 3447 and the rookie systems, where they still have an actual presence within the system's occupying minor factions. https://www.edsm.net/en/faction/id/81923/name/Pilots'+Federation+Local+Branch

Looking even more into this, when I first began, I noticed something odd. Pilot's Federation Local Branch is nowhere at all in this system, yet they still control Betancourt Enterprise: https://www.edsm.net/en/system/stat...details/idS/11944/nameS/Betancourt+Enterprise


You can find this same information on eddb.io and INARA too:

INARA

The same can be seen in the in-game system map, if you've been here before.
