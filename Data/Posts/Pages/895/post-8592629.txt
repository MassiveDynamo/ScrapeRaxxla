Pretty sure frontier said elite dangerous is the first game to contain it
I'm not sure FDev said that (I might be wrong). I think that view is based on people decompilling the .exe of previous games. Although that guy on here who was claiming he had found it in previous version and it wasnt in the .exe because it was a memory swap was mildly compelling
