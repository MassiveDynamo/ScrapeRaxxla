Right idea.

But also XD ....

It could be read a few ways, it's all about this line;
"The Link is All; no above, no bellow, we are One"

Does the "path" start with the oddly capitalized A?
or does it start after the semicolon, with the odd capital O?
Or as I suggested, after that entire 'statement' and begin with the "From G"...?

It could be read a few different ways....

Also noteworthy, every single capitalized letter in the entire description, is also a Star Class letter, even D if it's a White Dwarf.... so the path could be even longer and use every single capital letter...

Just saying, XD a few different options to try routing along... see what leads where and how difficult...
