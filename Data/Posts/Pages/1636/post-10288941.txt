lol... and perhaps not space madness as such...

Raxxla the "Rogue Planet"
Rogue planet - Wikipedia

Are they in game... apparently so.... along with the comets you can't see...


"Stable orbits are then determined for objects formed from the materials in the disc clumping together. are also thrown into the mix, to disrupt the orbits and create fledgling planets and moons."

Cool articles Brookes explained something similar in his interview with DJ (about modelling systems by starting with a dust cloud and ageing them up).

Personally I'd suspect that the "passing comets and rogue planets" are mathematically modelled into the data, rather than physically modelled into the game.

I suspect that's why there's the entry in the planet bodies list for Rogue Planets but no-one's found one. Necessary for Stellar Forge, not actually part of the game.

That might also explain why there are comets in there and they've never had physical representation in-game, it might simply be an artefact of the Stellar Forge process we were never meant to see. If there hadn't been the strange oddities with some things ending up orbiting comets - and players using the Journal files to make out-of-game-plugin systems - then we'd never know they were there.
