Interesting system description.

It's not marked as a PMF in Inara but - see below - they could be wrong. It feels like a PMF to me - the description is a bit weird (i.e. it's more interesting than 90% of PMF descriptions), but it's the sort of weird that the sort of player who starts a Theocracy PMF might write.

Interesting.... I'm not sure I've read PMF system descriptions (or perhaps not noticed them...)

When I registered a PMF there was no option to add a system description, you could request a home system and FD would endeavour to put you in it, I requested Run (as my CMDR name is Logan 5) but got Tabaldak as understandably it was the system they were found in and supposedly destroyed permanently and being Emperor's Dawn it was a bit weird like Mikunn as it was already adopted by players and in game/lore...



Where as significant FD systems seemed to have system descriptions for more information pre-codex.... e.g.


When did they introduce the PMF System descriptions? have any examples? (I did a quick random search from Inara listed PMF's, checked most/all the colonia systems and some random ones in the bubble but couldn't find one)
