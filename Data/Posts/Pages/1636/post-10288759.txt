just curious, what if you started from the O or G star, instead of A...?
Then it means I wasted an hour of my life ;-)

you other question/suggestion is a good one...

"The Link is All; no above, no bellow, we are One"

We are "One" - If we are "One" in this context we can ignore it as it's us and try and pick out directional instructions?
We could also ignore "The Link" and "All" possibly too...

"The home of The Link. The Link is All; no above, no bellow, we are One. From the Gate, the Conduit leads One to All. They are Many, but there is One Link. Those who are Not, will Never Be. Down below, the followers of the Link care not of politics, or puny power struggle. The One explores the All from the Conduit. They will open their eyes to Others to trade. But close their fists to Who is Not"

So something like this:
From the G, the C leads to A.
They are M.
Those who are N, N B.
Down below L.
The (One) explores C.
They will open their eyes to O.
But close to W is N

intriguing...
