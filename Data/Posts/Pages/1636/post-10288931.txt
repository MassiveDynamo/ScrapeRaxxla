So is there any record of non-PMF/FD descriptions being added to the game over the years.... if not it could point to The Link being more likely to be a PMF....
Tricky, since the descriptions aren't sent to the journal at all, so there's no real way to tell how long one has been there for, or if it has ever been edited. (Some clearly have been edited, as there's a first paragraph talking about the system, then a second paragraph of PMF description appended)

System descriptions (still!) needing a client patch to update means that they probably didn't use them as often as they might have, too.
