When did they introduce the PMF System descriptions?
Relatively early, but probably after the very early additions where they realised letting people add PMFs to systems which already had descriptions was a mistake.

The Colonia systems are a bit of a special case - Valac is the only one with a description, and that was added retrospectively in early 2020 - but I think the PMF process for the bubble had them by the time of the CEI.

There is apparently the occasional mistake where the system description and the PMF aren't in the same system, presumably because the PMF had to be moved to a reserve system at the last minute but the description had already been entered.
