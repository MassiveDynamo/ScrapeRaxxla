Hey folks. Nothing major, just wanted to share this, (likely already been noted, but couldn't find it.)

Omphalos Infotech was changed to Unified Infotech some time between April 18 and May 7 2019 - I wanted to figure out exactly when, since I originally thought it was done between Codex beta and release in 2018, which was incorrect.

That's about 6 months after the Codex was released. I know there was speculation at the time, but... any 2023 thoughts on why this was changed?
