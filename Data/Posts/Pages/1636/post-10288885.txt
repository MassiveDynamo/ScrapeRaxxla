Are the mysterious signals coming out of Shamash not a sirens sound or a whispering; what if this is just a replication of the oracular dreams Shamash sends Gilgamesh (Art Tornquist?) which are of dread, death and danger - but ultimately are supposedly interpreted as protective and positive, as he travels to the Cedar Forest, which bordered a mountain range and mysterious hidden land!

Cedar Forest - Wikipedia

Gilgamesh travelled East of his kingdom Uruk, close to the Zagros / Elam mountains.

Now Uruk is not in game, except for a body in 51 Arietis…is there a metaphorical clue in the prevalence in certain factions and ‘directions’, such as the ‘East India Company’.
