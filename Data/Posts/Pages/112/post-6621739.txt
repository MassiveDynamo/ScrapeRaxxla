Been checking a bit more on the Lucifer oddities form this post: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=6368699&viewfull=1#post6368699

I landed on Lucifer, with Sirius B directly over head. After two days, Sirius B was on the other side of Lucifer. This seem to correspond with the data listed in the system info(4.9 days rotation, 99 days orbit).
This does of course not match Kepler's laws. Lucifer should not be able to maintain such a slow orbit, without falling into Sirius B. This is probably a bug due to manually input data, but i'll keep an eye on it.
I also bug reported it a while back, but haven't heard anything: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/404652-Wrong-planet-info-for-Lucifer

I'we also checked all the Lagrange point between Sirius and Sirius B, using this 'finder': http://orbitsimulator.com/formulas/LagrangePointFinder.html

Didn't find anything, but the tool may be useful.
