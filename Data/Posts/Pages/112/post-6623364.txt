Wreaken. Them having access to Col 70 is very suspect.

It is very suspect. But haven't you heard? Wreaken got wrecked last year by the GCF. Though i also heard they may have made something of a comeback. I've also been told that the reason why they are in Col 70 is mentioned in "Premonitions", but i haven't gotten around to reading it yet.
