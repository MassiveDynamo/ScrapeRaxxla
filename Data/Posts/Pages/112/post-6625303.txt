Didn't get a chance to go searching for more low population Earth-likes looking for city lights. I spent my off time watching episodes 3 & 4 of the new Lost in Space instead.

Is there any way to get EDDB to sort ELWs by population & rotational period? I think the info is all in there but I can't find any options to use those as search criteria. I don't think EDDB was designed with us tin-foilers in mind.

Yes, it's more limited than it used to be. Once upon a time you could select 2 extra attributes and range was unlimited but now it's one extra and range is limited to 100 lyr. Maybe should beg him to give us at least 1000 lyr.

But, what you ask is there!

Login, select the bodies page, select ELW for body type, select populated yes, select rotational period for extra column, select your reference system and go.

Tested for Sirius and got 26 pages.

Might be easier to learn mysql and run your queries against your local edd or ed-ibe database?
