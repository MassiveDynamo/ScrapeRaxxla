Didn't get a chance to go searching for more low population Earth-likes looking for city lights. I spent my off time watching episodes 3 & 4 of the new Lost in Space instead.

Is there any way to get EDDB to sort ELWs by population & rotational period? I think the info is all in there but I can't find any options to use those as search criteria. I don't think EDDB was designed with us tin-foilers in mind.
