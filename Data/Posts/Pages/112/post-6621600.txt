Good idea, it's testable I think Jameson is an Orbis isn't it? With the hab rings?

https://eddb.io/system/4959 has an Ocellus (iirc 2nd largest type) and literally no-other settlements and a pop of 616k. Orbis is bigger, so until we can find a similar system with just one it'll be hard to tell, but assume 1-2million.

There's no way that more than 1mill people live in the other bases in-system combined, I'd be stunned if the number was larger than a few thousand at the other bases. Even being very conservative it still leaves around 80mill+ "living" on Founder's World.

Just doing a quick check through EDSM:

- ELW system, 53mill pop
- ELW 150mill pop
- ELW system, 1.7mill pop
- ELW system 1.1mill pop
- ELW system 3mill pop

These are probably going to give us the best baseline.

The three with low pops will tell us if lights show with small numbers, and the two that are close to Founder's in pop size will show if there are normally lights at that sort of size. They're single-system worlds with (generally) not too many other settlements, similar to Shinra (ish).

They're all within easy range of the Core too, so no need to go far to test it.

When I'm not hunting Thargoids next I'll go see those places and see if there are any lights on the night-side unless anyone else gets there first (pics or it diodn't happen!).

Awesome! Depending on how much time I have this morning I'll see if I can pop in on some of these systems and give a look.
