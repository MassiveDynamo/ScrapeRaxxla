That's interesting....

Yes it is. Always bothered me that Okinura had city lights on the dark side even though it is tidally locked.

What is crucial now is to determine at what threshold a tidally locked planet gets darkside city lights and at what rotational period a non-tidally locked planet gets them. Exciting times ahead! This is the kind of thing that thrills me and keeps me playing.
I'll do more 'vestigating tomorrow.
