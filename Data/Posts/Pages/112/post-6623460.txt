It is very suspect. But haven't you heard? Wreaken got wrecked last year by the GCF. Though i also heard they may have made something of a comeback. I've also been told that the reason why they are in Col 70 is mentioned in "Premonitions", but i haven't gotten around to reading it yet.

GCF? I'm headed to Ega to get allied with Wreaken as we speak.
