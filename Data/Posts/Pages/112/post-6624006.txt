It is very suspect. But haven't you heard? Wreaken got wrecked last year by the GCF. Though i also heard they may have made something of a comeback. I've also been told that the reason why they are in Col 70 is mentioned in "Premonitions", but i haven't gotten around to reading it yet.
Yeah, I remember there was the campaign against them. And yeah what they’re doing in Col 70 is indeed explained in Premonition. No unwanted spoilers though, obviously.

For me though, it’s not what they’re doing, but what they could be doing that’s the most interesting. As soon as the Col 70 permit drops, the obvious thing to do is going to be to go to the system the Thargoid Probe points to. There’s no indications that Wreaken have done that though...
