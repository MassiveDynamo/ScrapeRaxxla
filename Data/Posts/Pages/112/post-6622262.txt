39 Tauri system.
Eart-like-world: Ad Pontes
Population: 150,000,000
Visible city lights: None

Note: Orbital period is 43,465.6 days. Seriously? Who is going to build a city on the dark side of that? Night on the dark side is over 400 years. Not a good analog.

Vampires?

(also, nice work! Founders World nigh-side lights conspiracy busted!)

EDIT: UN-BUSTED!!! -> See below.
