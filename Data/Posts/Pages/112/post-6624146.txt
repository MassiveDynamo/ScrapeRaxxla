Unlikely but consistent with their love for secrecy and best way to keep secret the fact that they indeed have secrets. After all, what we "know" about them is perhaps just what they want us to know. I suspect, just like in my RP character's universe, that they are much more than we think. Vast underground cities and tech facilities... Ok ok oookaaayy ..Tinfoil hat out !


Jorki's Amateurs of Single ? The Penguin-Knights of The Axe ? Doc's Boys ... all these are strongly subversive !
EDIT: sorry.. bad and easy joke I just couldn't resist ...

I’ll have you know that Jorki’s Tykes have a thoroughly professional attitude to our single malt/Lavian brandy imbibing; we are dedicated (and happy, until the bottle runs dry)!
