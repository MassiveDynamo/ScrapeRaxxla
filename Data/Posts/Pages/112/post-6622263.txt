Liaedin system.
Earth-like-world: Schneider Colony
Population: 52,999,999
Visible city lights: EXTENSIVE.

Notes: I have WAY too much personal history wrapped up in this particular system: THE CRIMSON WILL BLOSSOM!
Rotational period is .6 days.
This is a much better analog for Shinrata Dezhra ... though I'd be happier finding city lights / no city lights on a planet with a slower rotational period closer to that of The Founders World. Regardless, this is the one to beat. Shinrarta has a lower population and NO city lights. Very suspicious. Next step is to find an ELW with a similar rotational period.
