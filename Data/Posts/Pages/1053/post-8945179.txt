Current Musings on Parijat are that the tree is considered to be one of the divine KalpaTaru or wish giving trees... They are described as " having roots made of gold, a silver midriff, lapislazuli boughs, coral leaves, pearl flower, gemstone buds, and diamond fruit." - quoting wikipedia. This description matches in my mind the Meta Material giving "trees" surrounding the Thargoid Barnacles.

While at the same time being related to certain earthly flowering trees ( Nyctanthes arbor-tristis , Epiphyllum oxypetalum and Erythrina variegata ). These flowers remind me alot of the so called "flower ships" of the thargoids and the little drone things that shoot out of them.
The Parijat is also known as the "Night Queen" it flowers at night and wilts under strong sun. Is this a reference to the thargoid Queen and preference for night and possibly the cold? Equinox?
Again quoting from Wikipedia here: " . It is on account of these wish-granting trees that the asuras waged a perpetual war with the devas as the heavenly gods who exclusively benefited freely from the "divine flowers and fruits" from the Kalpavriksha, whereas the asuras lived comparatively in penury at the lower part of its "trunk and roots". The Asuras coming from the lower world .. Devas from the heavens... to play into what Han Zen was just mentioning.
Still playing with Sarasvati and the Confluence....
