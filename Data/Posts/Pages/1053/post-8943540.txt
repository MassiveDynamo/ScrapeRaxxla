Ah, thanks, I knew about the "Book Of The Dead" and about Maat, but so far I did not dive into it; there's also the solar barque with Ra traveling and Ra being reborn after every night which I found interesting because it mentions that Ra is divided into three deities at morning, midday and evening.
The "Breathing Permit Of Hor" sounds interesting because I didn't find anything interesting regarding Horus (the Horus-system looks unremarkable at first glance, but that can be deceiving). (Hor is not the god Horus, just to clarify)
