Nope, the Pilots Federation issues the permits. But the Nav Computer and the FSD do what hardware manufacturers and software developers tell them to do

Does anyone know if there is any way to confirm if the available stars to jump to in the galaxy map differ if you have a normal FSD compared with an Engineered FSD? Perhaps Felicity is modifying your drive to allow you to 'see' something that isn't visible using corporation standard drives?

It's a far-fetched idea, and can't see how it would've worked pre-engineers to find Raxxla but hey this forum is full of left-field ideas!
