Well, that certainly puts a potential totally different slant (no pun intended) on the Raxxla logo!
It answers the dark areas, green “corridors”, and also perhaps the hexagon part of the logo, though I still think the dotted line means it’s hidden.
So perhaps we’re looking for a body comprised of Trapiche emerald (never heard of them before) and gold. That would certainly meet the “ Raxxla is Treasure” theme from the original novella! But what are the three arcs? If they mean we’re looking for a very valuable asteroid then that could make sense.

Edit: it would also make sense of that DB livestream comment “but you don’t know what it is!”
Shurely it's the core of an asteroid. Just mine every one in the game until you find it. Simples.
