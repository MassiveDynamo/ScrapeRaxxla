Then come back and look at Elite Dangerous with a fresh eye.

Yeah, I already know those, but I don't have any (clear) connections yet to ingame stuff.

My problem is that I now have too many leads. It's enough for at least two weeks.

The game has thrown at me two new types of mission I have not seen before (does not mean anything, but they happened at my points of interest).
The game has routed me through the Ququve-system; I wasn't searching for Gold, so Gold found me. Terra Mater looks interesting. Terra = Tellus = Ceres, a.s.o.
The game has routed me through the Minerva-system; I was surprised to find a planet called Eris, given that we already have one in Sol.
I visited the Ma'at-system; oh, I'm sorry, it's Ma'a where the t is missing. Obviously, which system has an extra t in its name?
Then new approaches how to interpret the Isis-system.

It becomes obvious that all those things are not just Easter Eggs, there's a system behind it.
