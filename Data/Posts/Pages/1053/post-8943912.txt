Speaking of the dotted lines and three arcs, what if we should rotate it 60 degrees? Maybe we should turn the lock?

I think that the dotted lines and shape are a reference to Aristotle's wheel. It was a thought experiment on how an inner point on the radius can travel the same distance as the outer point on the radius. Essentially one of them is skipping like a stone on a pond. I'm not sure what this points to , but definitely seems to reinforce the idea that it could be a gate / wormhole.
