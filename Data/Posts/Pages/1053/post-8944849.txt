I think that the dotted lines and shape are a reference to Aristotle's wheel. It was a thought experiment on how an inner point on the radius can travel the same distance as the outer point on the radius. Essentially one of them is skipping like a stone on a pond. I'm not sure what this points to , but definitely seems to reinforce the idea that it could be a gate / wormhole.

Very informtive video. And an interesting idea. So we may think it as a dragging 33gonal shape? Needs further search and attention. The girl in the video is very cute btw.
