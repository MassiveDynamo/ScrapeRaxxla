Well, that certainly puts a potential totally different slant (no pun intended) on the Raxxla logo!
It answers the dark areas, green “corridors”, and also perhaps the hexagon part of the logo, though I still think the dotted line means it’s hidden.
So perhaps we’re looking for a body comprised of Trapiche emerald (never heard of them before) and gold. That would certainly meet the “ Raxxla is Treasure” theme from the original novella! But what are the three arcs? If they mean we’re looking for a very valuable asteroid then that could make sense.

Edit: it would also make sense of that DB livestream comment “but you don’t know what it is!”
