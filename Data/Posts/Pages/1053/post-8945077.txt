Who was the Original?

Then come back and look at Elite Dangerous with a fresh eye.

Non of them are the original. If ancient mythology is a key to finding Raxxla, it means that in the ED reality some of these stories actually happened. All the myths and religions are then different versions of the same story, retold a million times by humans that did not fully comprehend what happened.

It is possible that advanced aliens lived on ancient ED earth. We know that they at least have visited the Sol system. These aliens may have had some form of gateway technology, that allowed them to travel far.
The common theme in most myths is that there are two destinations, that requires passing a gateway. The heavens (Olympos, Asgard, the Field of Reeds, Swarga Loka etc.) and the underworld / realm of the dead (Hades, Niflheim, Duat, Patala etc).

If in ED some form of post Guardian alien is used as 'the gods', it would be natural to guess that Regor (Gamma Veloum) is the destination for the 'underworld' part of a portal. Hen 2-333 could be the 'Olympos', where the 'gods' had their actual home at the time.

The gate / gates would probably be placed within practical distanse to earth / Sol.

This is of course just an example of how FD could construct the Raxxla mystery to enable the old myths to be useful, without bein illogical.

P.S. The Guardians are referred to as 'The Dead', in the game.
