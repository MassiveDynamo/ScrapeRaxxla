Has nything ever been found in the asteroid belt clusters?
The Hesperus megaship was hidden in one and didn't initially show up on a FSS of the system. That was long after people had been publicly speculating that belt clusters would be a good "no-one would check" place to hide mysteries, though.

The Crevie's Salvo station in Kinesi is also in a belt cluster, though that's obvious from the system map.
