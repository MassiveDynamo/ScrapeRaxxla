There's this on page 1:
Ascorbius confirms MB speaking about 'The system where Raxxla is (was?) located has been visited at least once' at Lave-con Q&A
So, in other words, Brookes didn't opt for the wholly esoteric or meta-physical solution. Though, I will say, there is good deal of lore suggesting not all CMDRs have the same origins. Which, honestly, is actually fine. I actually love that the story is flexible enough we all get our own ideas on what Raxxla is exactly (this was strongly hinted via Bonespire Publishing and Olav Redcourt story arcs). So, it appears my ideas merely add flavor and variety to the story but the question remains, "What exactly is Raxxla and why can no find it?". It would appear finding The Dark Wheel or whatever ruins of them that are left would be immensely helpful.

Hurray, welcome back to square one.

Also, I don't think there has been any progress whatsoever on the era between 2230 and 2296 beyond sources that some us hope are canonical but we cannot prove. Hope is a dangerous thing as shown by New Chernobyl station in Gateway. You'd think with 1,668 pages of tinfoil someone would have hit on a solution.
