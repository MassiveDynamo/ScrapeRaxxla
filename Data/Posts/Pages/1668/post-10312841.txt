Poking the Twitch API, the date on the clip is 25 July 2020; checking EliteBGS archives that's very consistent with both the BGS information shown in the clip and a reason for someone interested in Raxxla to be in that system at all so I'd guess the clip was made soon after the video itself - which puts it over a year after the rumour had started circulating in other forms.
Oh, impressive detective work then, I wouldn't have thought on checking the BGS. Meanwhile, what I found was that Michael Brookes was at LaveCon 2016, and in his farewell to Elite forum post, he said he'll be at LaveCon 2017 - but I don't know if he was there or not. Even if he was though, that would have been three years before this clip then. If that were actually said, I would be surprised if nobody reported on it until years after the fact.

Looking for the DJTruthsayer one searching for Raxxla just brings back a lot of results about an early Michael Brookes interview instead (where Michael confirms that it's in the galaxy somewhere) - can you remember any more about when that got mentioned?
Memory is a fickle thing, so don't rely on what I'm going to say now: I think I heard about the rumour, but not the name, sometime in 2018 or 2019. Don't have any dated proof though, unfortunately. In a private conversation with a friend on Discord near the end of 2018, I mentioned in passing among wild rumours that there was even one that somebody found Raxxla already - but that could have been anything, not just this specific one, and we moved on without any further word on that.
So, in short: not really, sorry.
