Poking the Twitch API, the date on the clip is 25 July 2020; checking EliteBGS archives that's very consistent with both the BGS information shown in the clip and a reason for someone interested in Raxxla to be in that system at all so I'd guess the clip was made soon after the video itself - which puts it over a year after the rumour had started circulating in other forms.

Looking for the DJTruthsayer one searching for Raxxla just brings back a lot of results about an early Michael Brookes interview instead (where Michael confirms that it's in the galaxy somewhere) - can you remember any more about when that got mentioned?


Sure, I meant that the pattern of exploration of the galaxy as a whole was non-systematic (and mainly concentrated on the Sol-Colonia-SagA* triangle by system count if not by density)
