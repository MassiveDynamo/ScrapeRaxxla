There's the DJTruthsayer rumour (where he heard it from a guy who heard it from an unnamed Frontier employee), but there's also one from earlier. There was CMDR Ascorbius saying that Michael Brookes himself said at a Lavecon Q&A. The original video was since removed, but somebody clipped it here. I don't see the exact date, but the last time Michael Brookes was at LaveCon was 2016 AFAIK, so that would be it from then.
Poking the Twitch API, the date on the clip is 25 July 2020; checking EliteBGS archives that's very consistent with both the BGS information shown in the clip and a reason for someone interested in Raxxla to be in that system at all so I'd guess the clip was made soon after the video itself - which puts it over a year after the rumour had started circulating in other forms.

Looking for the DJTruthsayer one searching for Raxxla just brings back a lot of results about an early Michael Brookes interview instead (where Michael confirms that it's in the galaxy somewhere) - can you remember any more about when that got mentioned?

By that time, there were systematic area surveys, target surveys, and perhaps even a few boxel surveys too.
Sure, I meant that the pattern of exploration of the galaxy as a whole was non-systematic (and mainly concentrated on the Sol-Colonia-SagA* triangle by system count if not by density)
