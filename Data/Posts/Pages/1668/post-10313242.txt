This list is suspected of being very incomplete.
From memory, Attilius Orbital in CD-43 11917 is also the palm-tree design.

(The bit about "Atlas" in the system description is a red herring, though: that refers to the player faction "Atlas Corporation" which was added to the nearby Lambda Arae system instead but had the description put in the wrong place)
