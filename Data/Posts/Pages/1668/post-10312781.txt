Anyway, something else I wanted to add: there are some assumptions that many people make unintentionally, which might of course not be true: that Raxxla has always been at the same place, and that it's in the same place for everyone. If either (or both) of those are false, then relying on the "someone has already been in the system but didn't notice it" rumour is rather pointless.
All just speculation, of course.

Yeah I have my ow ideas about Raxxla (don't we all?) and the current years of searching and not finding is based off a false assumption made many years ago....of course I could be wrong, maybe one day I will fly out and see if I am or not!
