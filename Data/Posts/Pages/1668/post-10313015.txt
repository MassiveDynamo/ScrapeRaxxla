Has nything ever been found in the asteroid belt clusters?
I believe Warinus asteroid base is within the Castellan Belt in Lave. Actually, pretty sure there are multiple stations either on the outer edge of rings or between rings of gas giants. So, it is likely possible. Might be part of the reason you don't get paid anything for scanning asteroid belts despite doing so helps miners.
