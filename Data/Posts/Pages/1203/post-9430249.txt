It’s probably not Lave 2 or Diso 5. Rafe Zetter says: ‘Raxxla—if it exists—is in another Galaxy. This means; not in Galaxy 1, in Elite. This excludes the old worlds cluster.

In the game since gamma, probably excludes the beta 2 pill. This is the region between Eranin and Sol (Sol was just outside).
I only meant it should be known if a system or planet is unlockable or not.
