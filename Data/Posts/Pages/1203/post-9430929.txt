Raxxla was introduced in 1984 Elite story book but it was added to the game in 2014 Elite Dangerous, DB and MB acknowledged that. Knowing this you can use Sherlock Holmes technique of deduction what information is correct and what is just jibber jabber someone created. So basically any story written about Raxxla after 2014 by self proclaimed Elite Dangerous story makers are fake. Only facts we have is 1.Codex 2. Lave was center of the galaxy in 1984. 3. Sol was center of the galaxy in Frontier. 4. Sag A is center of the galaxy in ED but Sol is still marked as 0.0. I think Raxxla is somewhere in the core systems. Many people have different opinions but I believe there were 9 core systems in 1984 ( some say 11 or 12). I can go on with my theory but I'm not sure if you guys want to hear it.
Lave was never centre of the Galaxy, Orerre and Riedquat were right at the edge.
Galaxy 1
If any system were to be described as the 'centre' it would be Esusti.
