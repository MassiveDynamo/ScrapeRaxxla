WHy would finding Raxxla be game over? It's an Easter Egg not the end goal. SInce it's a sandbox game I dont think there is an end goal. Except perhaps to repel the Thargoids after they've (eventually) invaded the bubble, the Rogue human AI have been defeated, and the lost Guardian Exiles found.
Raxxla is the MAIN QUEST, isn't ? of course you can continue playing, just it will be with out purpose
