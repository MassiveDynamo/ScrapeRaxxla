Just bearing in mind "Spiralling Stars" Jorki popped in for a look see at CD-50 8073 yesterday from its description: "This spiral planetary nebula was discovered by British astronomer John Herschel on April 15, 1836. The nebula's unusual shape is believed to be the result of a wobble in the rotation of its main Wolf-Rayet star, which was likely caused by its binary orbit with a nearby Class K orange star. In contrast to the intriguing shape of the nebula's gas cloud, its interior contains no other celestial objects of note."

they were correct, didnt find Raxxla!



Now on the way to see the Octarine Plains, & maybe find Rincewind &/or the luggage!
