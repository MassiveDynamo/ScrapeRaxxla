Raxxla is the MAIN QUEST, isn't ? of course you can continue playing, just it will be with out purpose
As far we we know, it’s really just an Easter egg, paying homage to a legend mentioned in the original game.
as Jorki said, it’s a sandbox game so there’s really no game over/main quest. The main storylines are likely the Guardian/Thargoid war and later disappearance and the ongoing Thargoid war with Humanity.
