Raxxla is the MAIN QUEST, isn't ? of course you can continue playing, just it will be with out purpose
Depends on you & how you view the purpose of the game.
I've always viewed Raxxla as DB's little Easter Egg, a tribute to Robert Holdstock but likely no impact on gameplay.
The man purpose of the game seems to me to bash Thargoids, porr little things!

edit
P.S. didnt find the Luggage, too bumpy a surface I imagine, but may have found Rincewind's hat!

It's a spooky place!
