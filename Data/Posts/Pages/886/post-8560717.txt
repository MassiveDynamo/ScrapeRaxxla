FD confirmed there will be new engineers for space walk equipment

Ah, was this in a livestream? I never have time to watch livestreams....
Ah, just read further posts. So it was in support of the Odyssey release trailer. Makes sense to have engineers support personal equipment. To those arguing against space walks I agree, current teaser does not indicate that as yet, but Star Citizen has space walk jet packs so there is commercial incentive for FD to come up with something similar (though from the Odyssey vid the personal movement is far more realistic than the clunky animation that SC currently has). We shall see come the next release (or maybe in another teaser vid........)
Personally I want a laser sniper rifle, those darned magpies woke me at 04:30 again!
