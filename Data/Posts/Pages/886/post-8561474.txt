No, wake just sets your current target. I tried, couldn't.
Ok thanks for the quick reply. I’m guessing the permit is obtainable, however it probably has odd prerequisites as others have mentioned. I’m guessing that being allied with the Dark Wheel in Shinrata is the first prerequisite, followed by something else that nobody has figured out yet. Perhaps related to other permitted systems. I’ve searched many of those and found nothing though.
