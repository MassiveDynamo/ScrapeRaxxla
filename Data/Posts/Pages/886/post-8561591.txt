Has anyone identified any ships jumping into LFT 509 from any other system?

Yes, someone spotted npc jumping there (edit: oops, might have misremembered, it might have been Witchâ€™s Reach) from near the station in Lawd 26
Edit: Before I got diverted onto my current quest hypothesis I was going to try to follow that wake and see if there is a random factor, say one in every hundred attempts you can get past the permit? Or perhaps the faction of the npc indicates the permit giver?
