Yes, someone spotted npc jumping there from near the station in Lawd 26
Edit: Before I got diverted onto my current quest hypothesis I was going to try to follow that wake and see if there is a random factor, say one in every hundred attempts you can get past the permit? Or perhaps the faction of the npc indicates the permit giver?

I went to Crampton Installation in the Kaupolock system (closest system to LFT 509) and noticed a lot of ships High Waking to LFT 509. Can’t follow them. All are local factions to Kaupolock. I think the AI can jump to any nearby system and it may not relate to anything. I found Raxxla in that system too... you’ll laugh when you see it
