Understood, maybe I misinterpreted the description, there's a great difference between walking on planets and spacewalking. The use of the term insinuates a certain level of content which, as of late has yet to be confirmed.

Lest we not conflate the issue with our own interpretations. Spacewalks would be cool but...
@Rochester Sorry. I had no intention to claim spacewalks. I was referring to space legs. I thought your question was about the engineers. I hadn't realised you though I meant "space walks" when I said "space walks" I will choose my jovial terms and word play better in the future
