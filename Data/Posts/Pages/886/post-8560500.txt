Understood, maybe I misinterpreted the description, there's a great difference between walking on planets and spacewalking. The use of the term insinuates a certain level of content which, as of late has yet to be confirmed.

Lest we not conflate the issue with our own interpretations. Spacewalks would be cool but...
FD made a video of the anticipated expansion to be released (wish I could find the link, sorry) but the main focus of the video was walking on planets and carrying weapons. There was nothing indicating space walking would be part of it, otherwise I'm sure it would have been in the video.
As far as engineers go, like ships, you can buy a space suit or support gear and weapon(s) then grind for engineering upgrades.
