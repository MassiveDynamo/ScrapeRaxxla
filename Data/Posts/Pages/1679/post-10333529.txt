It is pretty vague and open to interpretation. Are those trees ‘Cedars’?

Cedars denoted the boundary hill of Paradise, they also denoted a mystical forest in the Epic of Gilgamesh!

There’s lots here that could be misinterpreted and of course this is only one garden design of several, are those others relevant? again if correct I suspect it’s at best an abstract reference seeded as part of FD environmental storytelling.

They gave us a clue regarding the DW concerning the hint about a gas giant with eight moons (rather common apparently)…. This could just be another example of this type of ambiguity, or of omphaloskepsis.
