The specific use of the Miltonian cosmos shape on the left definitely steered me towards the theme of a Garden of Eden / Paradise metaphor.

The fact that MB's beacon references the Pendent World (aka Milton's Cosmos) in relation to Raxxla is a big connection for me. Occams Razor says the garden is just MB inserting an easter egg about his favourite mythological references. However, if this was a deliberate insertion by FDev, then it would be reasonable to think it is pointing us to something.

If this garden was a hint to point out something in the game, then there is a chance the other gardens have some kind of symbolism connecting to something as well. Are there any themes around Paradise / Eden that have been overlooked?

Edit: I'll dredge up my old diagram while this topic is circulating..

As a new thought to update this, the central path appears to lead from Heaven through the central circle... perhaps going "over" this element, but involving 4 locations / planets, then leading to the 3rd circle where the path does NOT go through, but instead goes around this third element, leading to an end point - (Raxxla???)

Flip this around 180 degrees and you have a starting point on the right, then going around a "void", then over / through the central element, then reaching the gates of Heaven (aka a realm of enlightenment, aka Raxxla)
