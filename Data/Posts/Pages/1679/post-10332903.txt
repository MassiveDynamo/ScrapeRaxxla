Now that is a very good question.

So far an initial search shows Cmdrs finding the palm tree stations circa October 2015, the Codex was inserted May 2018.

As to whether the ‘gardens’ were part of that update I currently cannot confirm.

They were certainly in game potentially in some initial ‘basic’ form and I believe may originally have had covers? It’s possible those which we see now might have been added later on, as a remodel? But I’m speculating.

There likely is a patch note about this somewhere…
