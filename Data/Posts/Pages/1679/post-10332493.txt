Michael R. Coats - 2020 Masters Thesis.

Rather brilliant - seems to marry my assessments in game, towards somewhere to the . This thesis also identifies the association with East/West with the left/right hand as well, what a find!

Note in game this direction might identify with the . This certainly would advocate some context along the Starship One mystery in that area. I’m not advocating it is directly here but this could identify an area of influence.

Paradise hung from the brow of the Empyrean, the gate was someway off from it, accessible only via a retractable staircase, it was not a straight up/down alignment, so this seems to fit.

The location of Shamash etc I suspect simply identifies the axis of the cosmology, this marries my shifted axis concept with the Empyrean directly above, Eden/Paradise/Raxxla then could be just below this area - within a Westerly orientation.

Of note, this North Westerly area houses an interesting intersection of a series of by Brooke’s, and focuses upon an alignment through the system which oddly aligns with the South Eastern location of the Tour of Brooke’s, and in comparison, the map above technically places this as being also directly above Hell, as well as falling perfectly upon the of the zone of Chaos!

This I speculate marries with my cosmological assumption made previously. I believe this adds weight to my assessment of Raxxla being someplace between , and towards the Morrigans close to a midpoint calculated from Brookes Drabbles.

If nothing else I believe this additional insight helps to further establish the existence of the Miltonian model in game.
