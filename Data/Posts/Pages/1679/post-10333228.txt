Now that is a very good question.

So far an initial search shows Cmdrs finding the palm tree stations circa October 2015, the Codex was inserted May 2018.

As to whether the ‘gardens’ were part of that update I currently cannot confirm.

They were certainly in game potentially in some initial ‘basic’ form and I believe may originally have had covers? It’s possible those which we see now might have been added later on, as a remodel? But I’m speculating.

There likely is a patch note about this somewhere…

Don't remember the pools being mentioned in any patch note. When I first started playing in late 2015 all stations IIRC were fairly plain, but that may have just been the systems I was visiting at the start. I think the pools were implemented together with the palm trees & statues when the luxury interior stations appeared....might have been 2015, though I would have guessed 2016.

I remember thinking when I first saw the pools that they looked like a clue...might be to Milton's cosmology, or maybe a direct system map? FD were doing a lot of the latter in those days (e.g. unregistered Comms beacons clues).
