Good to hear you've considered those other potential bits of info.
Possibly, though we've already discussed the possibility of the tripartite and "corridors" relating to Hecate.
Zeus was apparently nourished after his birth by sacred bees in the cave on Mount Ida where Rhea hid him from Cronus after (possibly aided by Hecate) feeding Cronus the swaddled Omphalos Stone, so the hexagon might imply bees/honeycomb.

There are so many possible interpretations....

Last Sunday I had a mooch around Rhea and Zeus systems, nothing found, but then I don't know what I'm looking for!!
