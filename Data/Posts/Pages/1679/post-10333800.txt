Mmm, I think this interpretation is sketchy. Why is the circle on the right a WW whereas the middle is a blue GG and the leftmost area of blue is ignored or it's Hell? Why are those moons terraformable? Why earth-like? This interpretation to me seems inconsistent to the point of wild conjecture and pareidolia. What do the short straight "paths" mean? They are above and below two of the circles and also one connecting "path", and are too short to be proper garden paths , they start and end nowhere so cannot be walked properly so ought to carry some meaning but this interpretation ignores them...I don't have a thought on their meaning as yet but I can't see how they can be arbitrarily ignored.

This pattern is supposed to represent a garden layout with pools of water, so IMHO the colour blue is likely meaningless. If I were interpreting this garden pattern as a map I would say it represents:
A star, two asteroid belts, and a small planet (though it might instead represent a small star in a binary orbit). Then a single-ringed GG with three moons in a binary orbit with a large planet, then a double-ringed GG and a smaller planet on the outer rim.

But the interpretation depends on the level of abstraction you assume this represents. It could instead represent a system with a star, two asteroid belts (or none, could just be paths) , perhaps the hollow ring overlying the "star" is a ringed station? Or maybe it indicates the star is type "O"? Then four rocky planets with asteroid belt between third and fourth, then a double ringed GG and finally a planet which is Raxxla ("outer rim").

Or maybe .................
