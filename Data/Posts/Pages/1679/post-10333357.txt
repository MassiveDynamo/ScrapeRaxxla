I see a solar system. The sun is not shown because it is a given and part of the mystery - and a waste of limited space. Also because of artistic privilege.

This system has an earth-like world (on left) with a terrraformable world moon that is atmospheric. The earth-like world and it's moon both have no rings because the white stonewotk is the outermost circle indicating land is the last hard characteristic of the planet. Likewise this system has a very small blue gas giant that does in fact have an icy ring beyond its physical surface. This gas planet has four moons, the large one being terraformable (it's possible this moon is not a moon but in synchronous orbit with the gas planet. Finally, the system has a water-world which is atmospheric and terraformable with one moon.

The system may or may not have other planets but the ones ones shown have to be included. Find this system and you may find a clue.
