Mmm, I think this interpretation is sketchy. Why is the circle on the right a WW whereas the middle is a blue GG...

I know what you mean, but then I was just logging in to the game when I took notice of this on the splash sequence:



And now I'm remembering how early Guardian ruins where found by matching the stars/planetary view in game from Horizons promo images or something like that.

I know it's a long shot, but could the similarity in the Odyssey title splash sequence between the plenetary symbol and the space station gardens be an indicator that we are supposed to look at them as a clue to planets? The squence has other details - I'm away to record it and see what else I can see [breaks out new roll of tinfoil] - then gives way to a brief image of a space station orbiting a planet.

It could all just be coincidence, pareidolia, old news that everyone has been over a dozen times before and I'm just behind the curve.

Maybe someone FDev cold be like "C'mon CMDR's, it's been nearly 10 years, Imma throw you a bone..."


EDIT: for ubiqitous typo's!
