Ya i am liking the idea of similar technologies with guardians and thargoids.. there is mention in the codex of a contact early in guardian history which could be how it happened. Wonder where the thargoids picked it up. Maybe there is an older raxxlan civ? Soontil?.. the real one.. not the fake one for tourists

Another russian guy said theory on utube (space raccoons I think) . That guardians are still alive and are shadow cardinals which make war between humans and thargoids. And he says next:
1. Thargoids are pieceful species as they never attack first.
2. That AI which "destroyed" whole guardians....does not look as smart enough in ruins.
3. At first war something was stolen from thargoids that's why they scan only everything - they search stolen item. They could destroy us in weeks but don't do it.
4. Tech brokers are emissary of guardians. And ruins are "trap"(for our curiosity), they supply minimal mats for us to make just a bit better weapon. But not such powerful as "destroyed whole civilization".

To recap: guardians are real bad guys, they still exist, and some humans serve them.

P.S. RAXXLA can be some artifical "body" of guardians
P.P.S. Currently I imagine story for my commander, so she will be bound to star wars galaxy and raxxla will be a way to get free ... maybe will write down some day
