I dont think it should be in the bubble because somehow people found out about it in the past. Ryders father found something about it in "deep space" and went back to "get a team together" sounds like an expedition and.. far away to me. In the beginning of this game there was no route planning and tiny jump ranges for sidewinders... but people made it to Sag A in them.

tbh I wasn't sure the original DW/Ryder story was the same version that carried through Alex becoming head of the DW etc I get lost in the RetCon

Agreed about Sag A but at the time the rumours were 1st heard as referred to in the Codex, the same tech wasn't in ships and the range was theoretically less, but in the original game you just had to plot 7ly Jumps all the time so distance wasn't an issue as such so I don't know which 'version' applies if you know what I mean....and whether that was a consideration when Raxxla was put in.

I need to double check the dates of the Cora story and the foundation of Empire etc to see where humanity had spread to at the same time.
