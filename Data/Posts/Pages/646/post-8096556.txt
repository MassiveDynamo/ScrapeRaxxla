tbh I wasn't sure the original DW/Ryder story was the same version that carried through Alex becoming head of the DW etc I get lost in the RetCon

Agreed about Sag A but at the time the rumours were 1st heard as referred to in the Codex, the same tech wasn't in ships and the range was theoretically less, but in the original game you just had to plot 7ly Jumps all the time so distance wasn't an issue as such so I don't know which 'version' applies if you know what I mean....and whether that was a consideration when Raxxla was put in.

I need to double check the dates of the Cora story and the foundation of Empire etc to see where humanity had spread to at the same time.
The 7 ly limit, was a Galcop Cobra specific limit. It probably means nothing.

The Art and Cora story is from 2296. It's a time of explosive expansion.
2270s - Second attempt to terra-form Mars started.
2280s - Discovery of first non-human relic in space. Origin still unknown in 3200.
2290s - First man "outside" on Mars (ie breathing unaided) on completion of terraforming.
2300s - Remaining indigenous life on Tau Ceti 3 preserved in special enclosures.
2310s - News of elimination of a reputedly sentient race on Achenar 6d by private colonists causes outrage in the Federation. Achenar refuses to join Federation, many terra-forming projects started.
I think the Mars relic may have contained info on Raxxla. That's why it has been kept hidden for a thousand years.
The Imps had managed to wipe out the Mudlarks by 2310, so people could probably get to Achenar in the 2290s.
If you can go to Achenar, you can go anywhere. It took time though. You lost a week per jump, with the pre-frameshift drives.

I would think they could manage a few kly on a well planed expedition.
