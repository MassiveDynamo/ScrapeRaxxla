The 7ly limit seems to have been respected in 'handcrafting' the old worlds, and their relative distances. (keeping them more or less similar to the old games) It is hard to picture how the limit would be able to impact the hunt considering 'intergalactic' (read: between cluster of systems all within in the modern 'bubble') drive were available back when with ranges well beyond 7 ly.

Generally this knowledge (of old cobra limitations) does not seem useful on its own, but may be relevant when more is discovered. (like for determining system on a give route etc)

It might be able to 'spot' clusters of systems or the extent of their representation in elite (via edsm data) that might have been valid 'galaxies' in the old games, but that do not still bare the old names etc based on this range info.
