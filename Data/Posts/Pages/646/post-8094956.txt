Ahh, so space madness has the DW/Raxxla confusion mixed in too. Okay. Thought I had missed something

We don’t know what it is we’re looking for, where to look for it, how to find it, how to recognise it when/if we find it, what lore applies to it, or who does know any of these.

Space Madness is an essential prerequisite for anyone undertaking this Quest, together with an uncommon amount of sheer optimism, unbounded energy and pig-headed persistence!

Edit: and a sense of humour helps!
