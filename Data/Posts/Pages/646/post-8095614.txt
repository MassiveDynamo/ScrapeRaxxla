To recap: guardians are real bad guys, they still exist, and some humans serve them.

P.S. RAXXLA can be some artifical "body" of guardians
P.P.S. Currently I imagine story for my commander, so she will be bound to star wars galaxy and raxxla will be a way to get free ... maybe will write down some day

Could be, only time will tell.

I have hypothesised before that Raxxla is one of the three Guardian arkships that Ram Tah mentioned in their deciphered messages, (I think it’s related to the Mars artefact, I think it’s in the bubble and I think it will transpire that humanity is either descended from Guardians or one of their “prey species”). Or it could be an actual Guardian ship (anaconda size or bigger, not these little fighters!), or a Thargoid mothership (which were supposed to be planet-sized). I still think Merope 5c may be one of the latter, there HAS to be some reason why the UA/TS all point to it!!!
(@FD-I hope you’re going to tell us sometime, cos there seems to be no in-game way to find out why that pointing behaviour exists!)
