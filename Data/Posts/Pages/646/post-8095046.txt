Simulacrae, isn't it strange there are two Earth like planets in Sothis, with sea beds that produce crystalline gold in "previously unseen form of crystalline structure"? There used to be anomalous signal sources in Sothis, and unknown artifacts. Now what are Soontill relics; "unidentified material", "pictographs of unknown origin" "elemental make-up and crystalline structure ..not made by human hands". Then of course there are those floaty things in space, transforming into spiky things.

Ya i am liking the idea of similar technologies with guardians and thargoids.. there is mention in the codex of a contact early in guardian history which could be how it happened. Wonder where the thargoids picked it up. Maybe there is an older raxxlan civ? Soontil?.. the real one.. not the fake one for tourists
