Unique worlds? - Assume you mean they are still HMC/WW etc not a new type, just new look or orbit or something?

imo I honestly cant see fdev messing with the origins of the human species, unless they go Pan-spermia, but its not impossible.

Logically its near or in the bubble or has a gateway in the bubble I think because of historical 'records' and timelines. Whether that was considered when it was put in is a different matter. I kind of think it had to be or the dates wouldn't (needn't) be mentioned in the Codex stories. imo.

I dont think it should be in the bubble because somehow people found out about it in the past. Ryders father found something about it in "deep space" and went back to "get a team together" sounds like an expedition and.. far away to me. In the beginning of this game there was no route planning and tiny jump ranges for sidewinders... but people made it to Sag A in them.

The idea of gateways is intriguing though .. lets assume raxxla is some super far off place that acts as a hub to various gateways. You would need a key.. and the key possibly opens a gate wherever you are. A key could be a crystal or a some unknown object... what if raxxla is fasttravel.... the bane of all openworld games.

I think the darkwheel station is in the bubble ... im picturing a group of grizzled ex-explorers going to hang out at their club [not that one] and they dont want to travel too far.
