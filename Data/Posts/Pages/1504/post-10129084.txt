The traditional pole star is however narratively locked, as confirmed by FD.

The stars don’t spiral however, they rotate around the imaginary axis (eg from our perspective), spinning yes, spiralling. mmm.

Again semantics. What are spiralling stars?

The galaxy is a double spiral but those stars although they look like spiral move relatively, not inwardly.

Pulsars, star’s general don’t spiral, they rotate and emit energy, black holes rotate and consume energy, binaries may rotate but some do spiral towards each other, in some cases one eats the other and the matter spirals towards it… then you have poetic license.

Delphi is close to the Pleiades. The Pleiades have been described as the spiralling stars… who knows, I am genuinely interested to break this description down and see how it can applied.That phrase in the Codex is the key. It means something.
