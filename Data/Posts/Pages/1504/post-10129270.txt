Again with my tin-foil hat on, a galactic north would be a good fit.
There are passenger missions out of Robigo (absolute closest human system to Polaris) for "Journey to Sol's True North star". The mission is rep-locked and very, very difficult to trigger. You might have to do a bunch of missions for Sirius Corporation in the Bubble first.

I might as well just say it already: quit being scared of The Club (better known by their two other names Elite Pilots' Federation and The Dark Wheel). Stop fearing the unknown. That which you fear is actually your salvation. Why do you think I ended up switching to A.O.E. Allied Order of Exemplars when Children of Raxxla had proven they were unwilling to make the leap of faith necessary to fix the self-imposed nightmare the CMDRs find themselves in? I have a responsibility to the larger community. I tried showing Children of Raxxla they had a path to peace and getting the Oresrians back via TDW novella. Fear of ourselves and our ability to change things is the single biggest obstacle the CMDRs face. This is why I became a caretaker for the nebulas. They hold our future. The Alliance is working on a better future for humanity in Elite Dangerous.
