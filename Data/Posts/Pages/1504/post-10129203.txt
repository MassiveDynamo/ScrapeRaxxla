I posted the book the other day , it predates the release of the codex by a month , after reading it , I'm very certain Raxxla near or in sol. or Its the start point.
If you look to linclon station , and watch very closely you will see a moving star. in sorounding systems you can see orbiting stars. You need to time lapse capture it . I think its a bug , but would have been cool. I never got a final response after messaging a few Fdev crew. I also emailed the author , but never got a response.
ps sorry for the no embed on the video
Astrophel - The first extraterrestrial dialogue â€” Stephen Beam
you can get it on kindal for a few dollars . thematically it also fits with the toast


Interesting - When I first saw this i thought it was more recently produced. If the published date is as it says December 2012 then it came out during the Kickstarter for Elite. The codex didnt come out until the Beyond Chapter 4 Beta which i think was Oct 2018.
