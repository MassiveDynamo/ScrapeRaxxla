Helice is also the Greek name for willow an often twisted and spirally plant. Helix of course being a spiral. The choice of name Helice for ursa major as it twists around the axis is apropo. Spirals and rotations are just dependant on your point of view.

As to the locked nature of polaris - i dont know - maybe its the dark wheel location. And we still havent figured out how to get the invite…It certainly fits the jewel on the brow description.

After thinking about this - i like polaris as the dark wheel location. The dark wheel i believe is just a poetic name for the wheel of fate/ the turning stars… what better place than the hub….
We should look north. I'm just not sure witch north.

Personally I'm mostly up in Coma Berenices, which is the galactic north. I have no idea if this is the right north. I'm just there because this can be seen in the galaxy map, up there:
SPOILER

There are of course a lot of other poles. The south pole star of Neptune is Gamma Velorum (Regor). That is also a mysterious place.
