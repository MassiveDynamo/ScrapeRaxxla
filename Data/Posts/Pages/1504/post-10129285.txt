We should look north. I'm just not sure witch north.

Personally I'm mostly up in Coma Berenices, which is the galactic north. I have no idea if this is the right north. I'm just there because this can be seen in the galaxy map, up there:
SPOILER

There are of course a lot of other poles. The south pole star of Neptune is Gamma Velorum (Regor). That is also a mysterious place.
Where specifically is that area on the map, if you zoom out a bit? Which system names are we passing over?

To me, that looks pretty convincing, as a "so obvious there are no clues" Raxxla.
