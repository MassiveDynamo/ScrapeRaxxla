I posted the book the other day , it predates the release of the codex by a month , after reading it , I'm very certain Raxxla near or in sol. or Its the start point.
If you look to linclon station , and watch very closely you will see a moving star. in sorounding systems you can see orbiting stars. You need to time lapse capture it . I think its a bug , but would have been cool. I never got a final response after messaging a few Fdev crew. I also emailed the author , but never got a response.
ps sorry for the no embed on the video

Thank you for posting this. Purchased it and several others especially Uranophobia as our fellow CMDRs seem to be adverse to turning a self-perceived hell into heaven. Hell doesn't exist at least not in the way our modern society treats it. The underworld is a place of cleansing not eternal punishment. You cannot change the past but you sure as heck can change the perception of it.
