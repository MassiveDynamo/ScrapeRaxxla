Raxxla was worth fighting for to the point that like Mars Artifact/Duval Relic that conflicts follow anyone or anything that gets close. The rumors started more than a millennium ago. We are told it is controlled by a cabal. Why exactly is there so much blind trust in those narrating the story? What if those telling the story are fundamentally untrustworthy? The writers of history after all are the victors.

Trust but verify does wonders for detection of false or misleading narratives. Also, do you understand how much of the story might be propaganda? There is such a thing as doubting the narrator but believing the story (at least partly).
