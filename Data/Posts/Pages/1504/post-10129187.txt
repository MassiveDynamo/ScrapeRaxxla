Assuming there is no childrens book and all we have is the Title to see the cunningly concealed facts - assuming we
have the eyes for it….

“These details however, were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to children's story Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars, and soon lost credibility.”

- Ursa Major Minor myth
- Callisto is listed as Daughter of king Lyacon
- King Lyacon is King of Arcadia (Phillip Sydney work)
- a reference to the polar stars.

Aratus and saying that Kynosura is bettor for sailors as north star…. Both were the nursemaids of zeus….kynosura is polaris/ursa minor Helike/ ursa major.

Helice/Helike
Kynosura/Cynosura

Remember when the winking cat made a space station at the true north? Maybe we need to spend more time looking up

Not perfect but it answers most of the clues- ties in princess astrophel to the spirling stars and music of the spheres along with the omphalos … and points us back to the obvious pole star

I posted the book the other day , it predates the release of the codex by a month , after reading it , I'm very certain Raxxla near or in sol. or Its the start point.
If you look to linclon station , and watch very closely you will see a moving star. in sorounding systems you can see orbiting stars. You need to time lapse capture it . I think its a bug , but would have been cool. I never got a final response after messaging a few Fdev crew. I also emailed the author , but never got a response.
ps sorry for the no embed on the video
Astrophel - The first extraterrestrial dialogue — Stephen Beam
