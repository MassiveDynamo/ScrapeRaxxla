I think you’re right on that, but I’d have thought such silly mistakes would be corrected as soon as the game came out. UNLESS these are, by some very strange thinking, actually clues!
Even a believable lie has to be partly true. All light cast shadows. The shadows will mostly be true to form as they are based on something real. They are proof of the existence of what you seek. The inaccuracies are intentional and intended to throw people off the trail. Technetium was a big one as was brown dwarfs. The two are only found together in specific places. Raxxla itself is less of the reason for the misdirection. Most of it was based on events of "First Thargoid War" (written that way very intentionally) and the ensuring cover-up. We actually have very little reason for Raxxla to not be an open secret (other than the connection to events of "First Thargoid War").
