Where specifically is that area on the map, if you zoom out a bit? Which system names are we passing over?

To me, that looks pretty convincing, as a "so obvious there are no clues" Raxxla.
It's up in Coma Berenices / Mell 111 Sector, about 300 ly strait up from Sol.



R is from Castor
A is from Capella
X is from Pollux
L is from Sol
A is from Altair

To get the second X, you just rotate the map a bit, to get the X from one of the MEL 11 Sector XP systems.

30 and 31 Comae Berenisces are good starting points.

Edit: 31 is the closest to NGP in RL. 30 is the closest to NGP in ED.
