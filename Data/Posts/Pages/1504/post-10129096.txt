The traditional pole star is however narratively locked, as confirmed by FD.

The stars don’t spiral however, they rotate around the imaginary axis (eg from our perspective), spinning yes, spiralling. mmm.

Helice is also the Greek name for willow an often twisted and spirally plant. Helix of course being a spiral. The choice of name Helice for ursa major as it twists around the axis is apropo. Spirals and rotations are just dependant on your point of view.

As to the locked nature of polaris - i dont know - maybe its the dark wheel location. And we still havent figured out how to get the invite…It certainly fits the jewel on the brow description.

After thinking about this - i like polaris as the dark wheel location. The dark wheel i believe is just a poetic name for the wheel of fate/ the turning stars… what better place than the hub….
