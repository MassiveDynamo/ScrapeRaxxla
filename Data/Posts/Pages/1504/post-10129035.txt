Assuming there is no childrens book and all we have is the Title to see the cunningly concealed facts - assuming we have the eyes for it….

“These details however, were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to children's story Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars, and soon lost credibility.”

Bear a Striking - Ursa Major Minor myth
Princess- Callisto is listed as Daughter of king Lyacon
Astrophel - King Lyacon is King of Arcadia (Phillip Sydney work)
Spiralling Stars - a reference to the polar stars.

Aratus discusses Helike and Kynosura saying that Kynosura is bettor for sailors as north star…. Both were the nursemaids of zeus….kynosura is polaris/ursa minor Helike/ ursa major.

Helice/Helike
Kynosura/Cynosura

Remember when the winking cat made a space station at the true north? Maybe we need to spend more time looking up

Not perfect but it answers most of the clues- ties in princess astrophel to the spirling stars and music of the spheres along with the omphalos … and points us back to the obvious pole star
