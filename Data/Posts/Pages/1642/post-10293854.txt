Anything on squadron search? If the faction was added 9 June 2019 then it may well have a squadron with a similar name available.
(PC, PC Legacy, XBox and PS4 squadrons are all separate lists, so you'd ideally want to check all of them)
Yeah nothing on Squadron Search either (on PC), didn't know about the Xbox/PS4 specific ones, that makes a lot of sense.

I'm wondering now if maybe a player faction co-opted a local faction. This 'Section 42' or similar made a player faction based in NLTT 46621 so they could create the system description for The Link and wrap it into their group's lore.

The stuff posted above seems to suggest to me that it's a player group interested in doing some myth-making of their own
