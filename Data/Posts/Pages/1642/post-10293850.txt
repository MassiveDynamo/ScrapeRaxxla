I've also been unable to dig up any reference to a player group calling itself "The Link"
Anything on squadron search? If the faction was added 9 June 2019 then it may well have a squadron with a similar name available.
(PC, PC Legacy, XBox and PS4 squadrons are all separate lists, so you'd ideally want to check all of them)
