Yeah looks like they became related due to Inara updates, Inara is a bit funny where it can relate your faction automatically if you spend a good deal of time in a system doing CZ's etc where no other player faction is really operating in
If that were the case it would have happened to me, I've been in that system for about 7 months or so. I think it's some fans joining in with the lore, playing a role.
