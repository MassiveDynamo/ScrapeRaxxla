I wonder if, rather than trying to match the signal to an in-game location, it might better match either a real-world mountain or even a book cover for something by Robert Holdstock? The problem with in-game terrain is that it is now tile-based, meaning there are similar formations everywhere that are rescaled and re-oriented by the procedural generation.
Oh I'm not advocating looking for that mountain range in-game at all. It might be anywhere across billions of planets, or even on an atmo planet we can't reach (though I hope not).

I'm suggesting that the signal shows us the goal. Gives us an idea of what we're heading towards. It's like putting an X on a treasure map, then tearing up the map and giving us the bit with the X on it. We know there's a map, we know that there's the treasure, but we don't know where it is or how to get there! It also fits with the Lore - people know Raxxla exists and can roughly describe it, yet it's still 'lost'?! We've all asked how is that possible?! - this is how. People see it, like Halsey and Gan did - in visions and dreams - but don't know how to get there.

I'm proposing that the method by which it's shown gives us a clue as to how to find more clues - special audio in key locations. The Codex (and other things) tell us where we might start looking for these additional audio. All this is in-game, using in-game clues and in-game knowledge of lore and events.
