NLTT 46621 Investigation
I've been trying to find a list of system descriptions from as early as possible, this is the best I've got so far. Thanks to Lord_Zapan for compiling this back in 2015. I've also looked on the ED wiki page (although less reliable, it also doesn't list NLTT 46621's description).

Obviously these lists are almost certainly not complete at their times of last update, however Lord-Zapan's list at least is decent snapshot of systems from the early days, and the wiki page shows systems that people cared enough to update.

I can't find NLTT 46621's description on any list or post other than here in the last few weeks, however I have seen several references to the system over the years but no-one comments on the system description, sadly. I've also been unable to dig up any reference to a player group calling itself "The Link", which does tally with INARA and EDSM saying it's not a player faction. If it is, they don't seem to have posted anything anywhere. The CoR database lists the Tourist beacon there, as do other places, so it was known and visited, yet... for whatever reason the system description was never noted even though it's weird! It's also not got the system description on EDSM, which many of the older systems with description do (but not even nearly all of them). EDSM lists the system as first being visited (for EDSM) in 2014, so that's extremely early - well within the timeframe Lord_Zapan was compiling their list.

Lack of proof isn't proof of anything other than I can't find it though.

Not sure if this helps, but it at least eliminates a few lines of enquiry. Maybe someone could make a post on the forum asking if anyone knows if The Link is a player faction? Someone might just have the answer.
