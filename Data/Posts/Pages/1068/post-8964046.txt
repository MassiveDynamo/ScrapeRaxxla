Your words do not contradict mine. What do you mean by 60 minutes? The revolution of the Earth around its axis? What if we lived on Mars?
All these conventions are wrong. The only thing that is supposedly constant and not affected by external factors is the speed of light. I.e. everything should be counted only from it.

P.S. Although I understand YOU, the mystery of Raxxla is just a fiction of people and most likely programmers
Well humanity in ED still uses years, hours, minutes and seconds.

So you kinda wrong here.

Edit: Speed of light is a speed and not time. And Ly still uses years. We have e literally nothing else to count on.
