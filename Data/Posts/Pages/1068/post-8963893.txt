Base 2 is as much of a no-brainer as base 10.
Only in the first case it is related to computers as 0 and 1, and in the case of 10 it is the number of fingers on the hand.
If we had 2 hands with 3 fingers each we would count to 6.
You're not correct; there are some cultures that also use the finger joints to count more than 10.
Also the Babylonians used base 60, which is the reason why we have 60 seconds and minutes.

I don't know who mentioned children's books recently, but I think it's worth to take inspiration from Alice in Wonderland:
