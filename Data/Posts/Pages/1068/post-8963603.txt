By Retcon I meant since 2015...or maybe 2013/4 when the authors were given the background story...any differences are due to the story / game changing and not down to the books which were written with accurate info at that time. Whether its still accurate now....

Im lost you see, 2015 was the start of a 10 year storyline, which at least got 'paused' during the news blackout last year and then we get a 2 year storyline. Is that an original 2 year plot line within the 10 years, is it putting some things to rest and moving on to a slightly different future, is it trying to get it back onto the original story? Has the 10 year story been binned or rewritten?

The way Im seeing it Starship One and all the past is being 'closed', all that is being ended and a new direction taken at least for the 2 years. So we are at the end of the end of the old, that chapter has finished.
