I like Drew & won’t cut him out of any royalties due. If you want to know then buy the book!
But read Reclamation before reading Premonition! They’re both good reads!

And who knows what fits with retcon????? But strictly speaking they were proof read by FD (I believe MB) so should be totally compatible with any current version of the lore!
Premonition is fully validated.
Reclamation have a few details of. Manly the Curier that should have been a Clipper. It's not affected at all by the retcon, I think. That was all about Thargoids, the Aliance and the events that could have happened in FFE. There are only a couple of details in two books that are off, due to the direction change. They are all still considered lore.

We at least know that Raxxla is in line with current lore. It's hardly mentioned. When it is, it's only people saying they don't believe in it.
