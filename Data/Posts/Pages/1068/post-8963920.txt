Base 2 is as much of a no-brainer as base 10.
Only in the first case it is related to computers as 0 and 1, and in the case of 10 it is the number of fingers on the hand.
If we had 2 hands with 3 fingers each we would count to 6.
Thargoids have two hands with 3 fingers(or maybe four hands?). They count 0-7 (base 8). ---, |--, -|-, ||-, --|, |-|, -||, |||. Simple and effective.
