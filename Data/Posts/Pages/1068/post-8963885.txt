Speculation time.

I got a new idea how to interpret the weird naming scheme in the Isis-system based on Sifi KO-G b24-5. This is actually kind of an idea that I had very early while playing the game.

The naming in Isis is: Isis 1, Isis 2, Isis I, Isis II, ... Isis X

Why does the naming change after 2? My guess is, that it's either a hint for base-2 or it's a hint for exponentiation.
So basically:
I have a few systems visited where the age of the primary star is 64/128/256/a.s.o.

So my current working theory what the Omphalos Rift might be:

Base 2 is as much of a no-brainer as base 10.
Only in the first case it is related to computers as 0 and 1, and in the case of 10 it is the number of fingers on the hand.
If we had 2 hands with 3 fingers each we would count to 6.
