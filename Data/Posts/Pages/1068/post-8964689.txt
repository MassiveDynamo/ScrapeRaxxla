The carrier has nothing to do with the Raxxla mystery. Sorry. I was in the neighborhood and decided to stop by after reading this thread. The name comes from the Exforce Book series by Craig Alanson. Iâ€™ll probably jump it out sometime Saturday. Sorry for the confusion.

Even tho its isn't connected to raxxla. I'm still thankful for your carrier.

During my journey my fsd almost broke because of heat and I was able to repair on your carrier.

Thank you!
