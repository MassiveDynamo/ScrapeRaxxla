The carrier has nothing to do with the Raxxla mystery. Sorry. I was in the neighborhood and decided to stop by after reading this thread. The name comes from the Exforce Book series by Craig Alanson. Iâ€™ll probably jump it out sometime Saturday. Sorry for the confusion.
Damn you!!!!!

I know the Exfor-series very very well. I can't believe this coincidence! That's like the most improbable thing that could have happened!
