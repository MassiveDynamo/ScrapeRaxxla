You're not correct; there are some cultures that also use the finger joints to count more than 10.
Also the Babylonians used base 60, which is the reason why we have 60 seconds and minutes.

I don't know who mentioned children's books recently, but I think it's worth to take inspiration from Alice in Wonderland:

Your words do not contradict mine. What do you mean by 60 minutes? The revolution of the Earth around its axis? What if we lived on Mars?
All these conventions are wrong. The only thing that is supposedly constant and not affected by external factors is the speed of light. I.e. everything should be counted only from it.

P.S. Although I understand YOU, the mystery of Raxxla is just a fiction of people and most likely programmers
