I have had a secret suspision for some time now..
The story of Prince Rasselas...he has a sister (princess) who is interested in astromomy... and they came from a valley paradise in abyssinia.... a sort of eldorodo..... so ya you are a raxxlan plant and possibly raxxla is in yorkshire ?

Well I came from a valley, but in Industrial Yorkshire so it was no Eden.
I did have a sister but she passed a long time ago, and she wasn’t interested in astronomy.
A Raxxlan plant? No mate, I ain’t no thargoid!!
Raxxla in Yorkshire??? True, it is God’s Own Country, so definitely a paradise (well, more evident in some bits of it, like the North York Moors & Pennines). On the M1 motorway Sheffield is the gateway to the Midlands from the North of England, so it could be seen as the gateway to a different universe!

No, just when I was thinking about a pilot name I googled stars in Leo (my birth sign) and found ‘Rasalas meaning "The Lion's Head toward the South"’....
I’ve been on the South coast for around 45 years (& I’m a head case, you have to be mad to quest for Raxxla!); it seemed to fit nicely!
