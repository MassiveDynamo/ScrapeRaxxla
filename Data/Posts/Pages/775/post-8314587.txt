@SkyRock - 1. No no pirates in Sol, deliberately I think to keep the BGS locked rather than open. Some systems are fixed, probably so players cant do anything too game-breaking.
2. Could be one could be more but most legends point to one Raxxla. Tharg homeworld if it is a living thing will possibly have more than one.
3. Im with others on this one, no date set for DW formation, PFF formed 2805 afaik so far, obviously people were members of DW long before this date but hard to pin down first mention (for me so far). No actual story about when or how they got a station, maybe they started in a station, maybe they got one 3 centuries later. Quite likely DW toast has nothing to do with location or directions, they don't know where it is, theres no legend they ever did so youre right, how can they point to something they don't know where it is. On the other hand, its a laugh innit and you don't ever really know.

Frontier deliberately keep the whole thing wide open so it can go anywhere. Read Agatha Christie for the model, anybody could have done it but only on the last few pages is the conclusion made about which one is the right answer. AC also had a habit of introducing something critical in the denouement that the reader didn't know until that point.

Some writers leave disconnected clues or bits of info all over the place that only make sense at the end

The thread sometimes has 3 or 4 conversations at once, doesn't mean youre being ignored, you got a few likes so a few people just agreed with you and moved on
