This.

Interesting! Looks like a piece of wreckage, at least supposed to represent something manufactured.
Wouldn’t think it’s a graphical artefact; I’m no graphics expert, but it looks to me to be designed.
So either an Easter egg by FD, or an intentional thing to be found? Could this be Raxxla, or something else?
Has anyone tried to approach it? Does its size vary? If size is invariant I’d say it’s an artefact or Easter egg, but if it’s designed then.....
