I'd love to help out with that but unfortunately, my comp has been down for a year. Haven't been able to play a graphical game for a while now.

That sounds really interesting though.
If you mean the checking out the bug possibility, then don’t worry, I was only saying it in jest. It’d need someone from FD to look into it and that pretty much ain’t going to happen. It’s nigh on impossible getting a straight answer on stuff like that even at the best of times!

(All that’s being said in good humour on my part I hasten to add! )
