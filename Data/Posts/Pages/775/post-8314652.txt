As @Han_Zen says, he highlighted it a while back in this thread. I then went, checked and confirmed the phenomena. So first step of independent confirmation is done and itâ€™s not a hardware specific/individual setup specific thing.

What we really need now is an avenue for checking the bug possibility, without having to go through the risks of actually raising it as an issue!

Mmm? Why would raising a bug report on it form a risk?
