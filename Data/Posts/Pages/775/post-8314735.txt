Mmm? Why would raising a bug report on it form a risk?

Well, you never know, it might not be a bug. Canâ€™t be letting the denizens of the issue tracker in on it can we!

But more seriously, even if it is a bug, I quite like its presence! The risk is that if it is a bug, raising it on the issue tracker might be taken as a bug report rather than a request for clarification, and it might end up actually getting removed!
