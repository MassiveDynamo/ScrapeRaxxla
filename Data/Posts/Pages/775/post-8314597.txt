The Dark Wheel might have inherited a station from the shreds of the CIEP after the battle in And Here The Wheel. Finding the CIEP bases is a lead for me.

Raxxla may never have been found by any human. It could still be a legend based on handed down or discovered information, like the Mars Relic, or passed on by Aliens to some groups many centuries ago (or perhaps even to the Ancient Egyptians, etc.). Holdstock only gives speculation on this in the novella sp it is wide open.

Frontier wrote the toast for us for a reason - its too juicy to mean nothing. In fact the codex has only a few small paragraphs, so likely each sentence has something important to say on the matter.
