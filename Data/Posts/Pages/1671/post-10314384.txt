For those of you looking:

The only place I know of where "Randomius Factoria" appears in-game is in the Dynasty logs (here's the second one). I assume because Drew penned at least the first draft of these. I believe Randomius Factoria is also said in his official novels too, because he's a very big fan of Elite: The Dark Wheel, and so wanted to honour that.

Allen Stroud (official author and significant contributor to the game lore) also mentioned it on this very thread.

Don't think that helps any, but your first source for anything should be what's actually in the game, IMO.
