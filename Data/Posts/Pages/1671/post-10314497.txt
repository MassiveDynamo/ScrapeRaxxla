We got it wrong - in my opinion was Braben trying to verbalise - in his fashion, how FD did not understand the behaviour of players.

He’s indicated in that interview that there was (is?) a design. And that they wanted players to follow the missions and interact with the smaller factions.

I logically presume this ought to have pointed to certain missions, or station news (where mysteries used to be promoted via articles in Galnet. That these factions effectively pushed us around the galaxy and that this would be enough for us to stumble upon things…

They got it wrong, because it became evident that players wanted to grind.

They wanted that shiny Anaconda ‘fast’ so they were not playing FD game, they played ‘our’ game… grinding.

I put this down more to FD not implementing an actual finished game, as they cut a LOT of proposed content, so I think there were gaps, and this left players with little to do, so maybe what ‘was’ in game simply was far too esoteric.

that actually makes a lot of sense.
