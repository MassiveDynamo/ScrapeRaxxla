Duly noted.

Most people here DONT want to find Raxxla. What would we do with out Raxxla? How would people fall asleep peacefully, if it was taken away?
Eh, if i found it i would "just" go back to playing the game. "Just" because granted, things would not be the same.
Saying people don't want to find it is a bit of a stretch imo, although i do understand the sentiment.

This morning I did a SC from Tionisla astroid belt targeting the Fortuna system, but at 0.1 to 0.4 Ly's I didn't find anything.

Ach, ninja'd. XD

Any asteroid clusters in the system perchance?
