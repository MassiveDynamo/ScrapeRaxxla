Just realized the "snake bearer" is Ophiuchus. I'll do an analysis in a bit of stars in that constellation. It is also near Serpens ( ). I figure the repeating snake symbolism might well be a hint and its connection to death and rebirth. Also, my post on Lave recently is going to take a bit of research. I am sadly no expert on all of the saints.

Interesting side-note:
The idea appears to have originated in 1970 with Steven Schmidt's suggestion of a 14-sign zodiac, also including Cetus as a sign. A 13-sign zodiac has been promulgated by Walter Berg and by Mark Yazaki in 1995, a suggestion that achieved some popularity in Japan, where Ophiuchus is known as Hebitsukai-za (蛇遣座, "The Serpent Bearer").
