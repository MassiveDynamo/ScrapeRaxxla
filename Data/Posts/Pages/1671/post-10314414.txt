while opiuchus means the snake bearer, i always thought that the underlying symbolism was that hes more of a snake wrangler rather than snake bringer. a man that defeated the snake.
if snakes would represent pilots federation what would that make him?
I suspect this is an allusion to duality of Man. I strongly suspect TDW got their start at Sol, got really firmly established in Beta Hydri (training alongside Judas Syndicate and bounty hunters) and then caught ships in the 2700s to Old Worlds region. The Ryders were better at piracy than actual pirates. Most of their ships they got through bounty hunting. I also think it is absolutely intentional that Pilot's Federation and Consortium entries are right next to each other.
