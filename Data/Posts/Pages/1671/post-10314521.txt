So many clues are so non-leading to anywhere and so far from any connection to anything else that they leave you spending so much time running around to dead ends while others were gaining $ to buy better ships and find more ELW's . It doesn't take long before people start to say to themselves ' why am I wasting all this time with seemingly endless disconnected clues while everyone else is gaining, $, system discoveries, and rank increases.
May I suggest reading today's GalNet. The Omphalos is going to be important in a very big way here shortly. Rhea was Cronus' wife.
