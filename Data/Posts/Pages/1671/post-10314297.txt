‘Lady of Fate, we adore you’

A reference to lady Fortuna. A possible link to Trinkets of hidden fortune?

I heard tell in this thread that there may have been something about this deity that Brookes had worked on. I think via Strouds recollection, but that it was likely dropped?

We know via FD the Trinkets were linked to the ‘removed’ DW story. I believe they had some unknown purpose, but it’s an unknown if this is still functional.

Again there is the similarity to the burial pod of Hammer in Legacy and of Brookes in the tour…

It’s evident Brookes was referring back to this text, some aspect of this deity of Fortuna (wheel of fate) and used cargo pods somehow.

The tour would seem to place emphasis upon the system Artemis; is there something there to find? A crashed pod maybe or some POI in a roid cluster?

This morning I did a SC from Tionisla astroid belt targeting the Fortuna system, but at 0.1 to 0.4 Ly's I didn't find anything.
