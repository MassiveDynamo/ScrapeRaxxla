ive always wondered what was meant by the "they got it wrong". i kinda suspected that we werent meant do be that aligned with superpowers and factions and rather be the independent space freelancers and smugglers and buccaneers... (not like pf lacks murder hobos)
but when in context with the old missions that would make much more sense
