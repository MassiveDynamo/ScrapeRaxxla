Just realized the "snake bearer" is Ophiuchus. I'll do an analysis in a bit of stars in that constellation. It is also near Serpens ( ). I figure the repeating snake symbolism might well be a hint and its connection to death and rebirth. Also, my post on Lave recently is going to take a bit of research. I am sadly no expert on all of the saints.
