The inclusion of lady fortune, I feel is simply an historical aspect of the older removed PF/DW missions, this initially I concluded from my earlier investigations with FD Support, who confirmed it was linked, and essentially a dead end.

Two systems Fortuna and Tyche in game, linked to fortune, might have some unknown spacial relationship with my ‘Cosmological model’ hypothesis. But I think it’s a stretch.

For instance Fortuna is relatively close to a system linked to mountains, and maybe this falls along the midpoint axis of the Morrigans systems (?!); but that’s a real stretch. Not enough information.

Then there’s Tyche which relatively far closer to the hypothetical axis of Chaos, sharing a faction with Olorun. So it’s closer to the northern axis, on the outer rim of Chaos, but then again what could that mean?

At most if such systems had a purpose, it’s I presume may long gone, an archeological - like the DW missions. At most if true, their ‘positions’ might help corroborate my ‘Miltonian model’ - but it tenuous.

Are you checking these systems for named planets or stations that see to stick out? If they are important there should be something consequential in the system.
