ive always wondered what was meant by the "they got it wrong". i kinda suspected that we werent meant do be that aligned with superpowers and factions and rather be the independent space freelancers and smugglers and buccaneers... (not like pf lacks murder hobos)
but when in context with the old missions that would make much more sense
“We got it wrong” - in my opinion was Braben trying to verbalise - in his fashion, how FD did not understand the behaviour of players.

He’s indicated in that interview that there was (is?) a design. And that they wanted players to follow the missions and interact with the smaller factions.

I logically presume this ought to have pointed to certain missions, or station news (where mysteries used to be promoted via articles in Galnet. That these factions effectively pushed us around the galaxy and that this would be enough for us to stumble upon things…

They got it wrong, because it became evident that players just wanted to grind.

They wanted that shiny Anaconda ‘fast’ so they were not playing FDs game (which never had any instructions at the start and was a mile wide and an inch deep!) instead we just opted to play ‘our’ game… most fell into grinding.

I put this down more to FD not implementing an actual finished game at launch, as they did cut a LOT of proposed and clever content, so I think there were gaps, and a lot of bugs; this I can only presume left players with actually very little to do, so maybe what ‘was’ in game in respect to such direction simply was far too esoteric for many players to give a hoot about, as we were either 7,000 light years away, or busy acquiring loot.
