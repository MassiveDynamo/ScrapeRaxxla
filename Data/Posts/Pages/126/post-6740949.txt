I'm not suggesting that the E/F missions aren't related to Raxxla. All I'm suggesting is that there isn't anything in-game that would suggest a connection. It's the Holdstock novella that gives those missions relevance.

And yes, I tend to agree that there isn't any real content connected to Raxxla as the game exists now. I still think its out there but that finding it will be little more than discovering a fun Easter Egg. There probably won't be anything worth interacting with once it has been found.

Possible ideas as to what would possibly happen once its discovered: It starts off as an Easter Egg, at first. But later after its discovery, a patch comes and one of two things could happen. 1). Its discovered that a "gateway" exists in orbit around the Planet (or other celestial body) that allows a single use, infinite jump to anywhere in the Galaxy. Or 2). The Club, now knowing where it is, put it on lock-down. Possibly leading to a unique "invasion" CG where a ingame faction or something organizes a CMDR filled militia to invaded, and force the system back open. Or, alternatively, The Club doesn't lock it down, but instead develops it and creates a second new "Distant Bubble" similar to Colonia.
