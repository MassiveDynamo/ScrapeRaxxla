They know how much time you guys have put into trying to find Raxxla. If they just came out and said that, "sorry, there is no Raxxla planet out there" especially after letting it go on for so long you guys would flip out. So naturally all they can do is ignore you until people eventually move on. Again, I want to believe, truly, but...


I agree with this theory but i also think, instead, Frontier will eventually implement Raxxla within a "patch disguise".
And that would be the Q4 - Exploration update. Sounds convenient to me.

Right now it's about building hype about the subject and keeping it alive.

It would be brilliant to present radical changes to exploration system with Apple of Eden at the end of the tunnel; Raxxla.
