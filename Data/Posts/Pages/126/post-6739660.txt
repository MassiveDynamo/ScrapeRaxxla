That's the point imho, Doc. MB is no longer here to get the sequel running in this game. Since DW and MB left, there has been only Thargoid and Guardians stuff here.
And of course Raxxla is here because of Holdstock's novels. What I mean is I doubt they can help us to find R because the MW and our jump capabilities have evolved since. The game background has changed.
Now, if you are right and the E/F missions are not related to R, then it may be very interesting to find what they are related to. A new Myth ? A new celestial body obfuscated in the outer rim ? wow....

I'm not suggesting that the E/F missions aren't related to Raxxla. All I'm suggesting is that there isn't anything in-game that would suggest a connection. It's the Holdstock novella that gives those missions relevance.

And yes, I tend to agree that there isn't any real content connected to Raxxla as the game exists now. I still think its out there but that finding it will be little more than discovering a fun Easter Egg. There probably won't be anything worth interacting with once it has been found.
