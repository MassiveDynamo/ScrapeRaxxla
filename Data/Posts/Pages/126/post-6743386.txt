You can't find anything obviously related to Raxxla in this game ? Even not a tiny bit so people know what they are doing ?

Raxxla is in Elite: Dangerous. So you have to play the game to find out about it. And thus you know what you are doing; you are playing ED.

There! This must the tiny bit obvious part
Wait a minute... Im not sure if I am even trusting them on "its out there".
