I've quietly watched and observed this Raxxla stuff for some time now. It is precisely the type of thing Elite SHOULD be doing. Exploration and uncovering mysterious locations is what this game should excel at and focus on. I want so badly for this search to be what we all want it to be.

But its not. There is no Raxxla. At least not in any way the Raxxla we deserve or the Raxxla that has been built up here in peoples minds. It seems all i do is come here with pessimism about the game and burst peoples bubbles in the forums and i'm sure most of you will think I have no idea what i'm talking about but yeah, Raxxla is a hoax. The most fun you will get out of the search for Raxxla is here in this forum.

Sincerely,
Former naive Raxxla believer
