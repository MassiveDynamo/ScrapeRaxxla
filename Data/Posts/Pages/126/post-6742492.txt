Possible ideas as to what would possibly happen once its discovered: It starts off as an Easter Egg, at first. But later after its discovery, a patch comes and one of two things could happen. 1). Its discovered that a "gateway" exists in orbit around the Planet (or other celestial body) that allows a single use, infinite jump to anywhere in the Galaxy. Or 2). The Club, now knowing where it is, put it on lock-down. Possibly leading to a unique "invasion" CG where a ingame faction or something organizes a CMDR filled militia to invaded, and force the system back open. Or, alternatively, The Club doesn't lock it down, but instead develops it and creates a second new "Distant Bubble" similar to Colonia.
Funnily enough, that recent reddit post was a pretty good match to what I predicted would happen if someone stumbled across Raxxla.

That's the clue. "There will be no clues".

Well they could have made it a little bit obvious.
