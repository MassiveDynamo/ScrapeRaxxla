And also don't forget that Mr. Brooks' novel Elite: Legacy was billed as the official sequel to The Dark Wheel. Given that there is precious little to connect those two stories I don't give a lot of weight to the statement that the sequel will be played out in the game. For that to happen Frontier needs to learn how to build a story and follow through with it. I don't see that happening. Its more likely that Raxxla will simply turn out to be a minor Easter Egg and nothing more.

Raxxla is out there. It remains to be seen if finding it is worth all the effort.

That's the point imho, Doc. MB is no longer here to get the sequel running in this game. Since DW and MB left, there has been only Thargoid and Guardians stuff here. Seems like DW was in charge of the Rift and MB of Raxxla... We are left alone with SS's aliens...
And of course Raxxla is here because of Holdstock's novels. What I mean is I doubt they can help us to find R because the MW and our jump capabilities have evolved since. The game background has changed.
Now, if you are right and the E/F missions are not related to R, then it may be very interesting to find what they are related to. A new Myth ? A new celestial body obfuscated in the outer rim ? wow....
