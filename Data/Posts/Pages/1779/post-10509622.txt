I concur, as @Jorki Rasalas accounts; piracy is a good way of obtaining them. Sadly I’m in Legacy so can’t find anyone on PS5 to sell them from carriers, if your on PC give Macros a call.

I’m not a particularly good pirate myself, but I was ‘fortunate’ to almost get hold of a few last week but sadly one got scooped up by a really fast NCP, next one was on some trader who jumped before I could catch up to it; the third well I got busted by the cops…

I’d speculate TOHF are only of archeological relevance following the missions being removed, but considering everything, it might be serendipitous to have a couple at hand… just in case!

Currently slowly working up towards a good piracy layout and a short career on the high seas as a privateer.
