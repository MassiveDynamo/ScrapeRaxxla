there are 3 different semi-orbital radii; and i think they all have different orbital periods; so the configuration order completely changes every couple of months, but in the more than 2 years i've been here i cannot remember them ever resembling a hexagon, though i suppose they must eventually do so.
Just looking from supercruise I think there are 6 different radii, though they may round to just three separate values for the precision given.

Still, if it's that rare for them to line up as a hexagon it's presumably not crucial to any discovery.
