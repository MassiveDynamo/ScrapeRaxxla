I read your post and dont see any relationship to ED 10th anniversary celebrations.
My point was: Based on the link & posts, they ( 'FDev' ) are clearly planning....something mysterious.

As for what may or may not be announced OUT of game , perhaps it'll be similar to this--> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/celebrate-elites-ruby-anniversary.628094/ ...?

Regardless, we're sorta getting off-track off-topic here now. ( i only posted that 1st link earlier above because, in my opinion, the posts/signals could possibly relate or lead to RAXXLA maybe )
