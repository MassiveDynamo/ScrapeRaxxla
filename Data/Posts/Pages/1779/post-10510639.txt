Another Pareco thought: the six stations are all in orbits of slightly different radius, so presumably have slightly different orbital periods.

Last night they definitely weren't in a hexagon - they were all bunched up into about 3/4 of the arc, with two of them within 100km or so of each other, but I wonder if that changes over time and if so there's something which only happens if they're in a roughly hexagonal configuration?
