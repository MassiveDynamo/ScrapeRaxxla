OK I've been working on this for the last couple of years but making no further progress, so publishing and asking for what I could have missed. I should mention I'm on Legacy, which could be significant.

4. Pareco station names are the answers to the six questions of the Raxxla toast - CROWN is the diadem; ASIRE (a sigh) is the whisper in witch space; James WEBB was the siren of the deeper void responsible for the foundation of NASA; the GARDEN (of eden) is the longing of our vagabond hearts (according to the song by Joni Mitchel) and so on.
I realise I didn't complete the station list, but this comes with a trigger warning. I believe the "parents grief" is the death of a child, and therefore refers NEVILLE Newman, who received an Advance Australia Award in 1992 for outstanding contribution to Medical Research into Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. That leaves PHILLIPS, but I confess I've struggled with this one to find a definitive reference, there's literally hundreds it ~could~ be.
