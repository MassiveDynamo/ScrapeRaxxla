Another Pareco thought: the six stations are all in orbits of slightly different radius, so presumably have slightly different orbital periods.
there are 3 different semi-orbital radii; and i think they all have different orbital periods; so the configuration order completely changes every couple of months, but in the more than 2 years i've been here i cannot remember them ever resembling a hexagon, though i suppose they must eventually do so.
