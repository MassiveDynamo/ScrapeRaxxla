You get TOHF from trader ships (IIRC I had most success with Adders) through pirating them- you need a reasonably fast well-armed & Shielded ship with cargo space, manifest scanner and a point Defence system. Collector limpets help, but you can collect them after they've been dropped with your cargo scoop, however other pirates may well beat you to them and may in any case open fire/try to grab them from you.

Those trader ships are infrequent (one or two per hour). Anarchy system nav beacons are the best option.
The last I got was from an Adder carrying 100, I got two from the piracy feeding frenzy!
I found it best to look for ships that were bypassing the sharks circling around the nav beacon and going directly for a fuel scoop. You need a fast ship to get to them first, and get away afterwards.

Unless you can find a nice friendly FC owner like Macros!!
