I was looking at the fictional children’s book mentioned in Elite Legacy, the only element which describes its content is ‘some Prince saving a princess from a space dragon.

MB wrote the book Sun Dragon (space dragon).

Is this a clue? Who knows, but maybe worth a shot in the dark.

TLDR i dont think there are any direct references in Sun Dragon.
