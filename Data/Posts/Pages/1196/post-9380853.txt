The Quest To Find Raxxla
That would be AWESOME ! Would love to see the Dubious Profit make an appearance !!! Edit: Although Im starting to wonder if its a hint that the Galactic Summit is in for some unwelcome visitors... (Not just Archon Delane) It's ripe for a pluckin'!!! I actually can't imagine it without, seems...

*edited: There is an interview with current community manager Arthur Tolmie where he does directly state when asked ‚Äòwhere is Raxxla‚Äù at the 0:25:00 mark: AT ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs there. Clearly it‚Äôs there. I‚Äôve said this in another stream, I‚Äôll say it today, it‚Äôs been going a longtime. The payoff would have...

We still can't assume that "in game" is the same as accessible or interactive. Everything fdev says is some kind of tongue in cheek play on words. You couldn't get a straight answer if you asked the shortest distance between 2 points. For example, Polaris is clearly "in game" but thats it. you...

The Quest To Find Raxxla
In the original Elite game, a miss-jump would imply you dropping in whichspace... you ended up on a dark area with no visible stars or planets and a bunch of Thargoid ships around just to attack if they notice your ship flying too fast. In Elite dangerous, whenever your jump drive malfunctions...

Just watched this video too... Well, I have to say I never knew the Thargoids were all female, so I wonder if (or where) there are males of the species? I also wonder if his comment about AI escaping into deep space has been implemented? Raxxla perhaps? Or Guardian AI? Fly Dangerously, Ra...

I don't think the players need another galaxy, so FD didn't make it. Within the Milky Way, it is difficult to find anyone, what is the point of creating a huge Andromeda (which is larger than the Milky Way)? But I like the idea that Raxxla is a gateway through which we will bring trouble upon...

It's Cyrillic alphabet on English client, shown as squares. They need to fix that though. I don't like translation of the game, because it is wrong simply. However, then I can't use cyrillic chat too. Ah, shame, I thought I was perhaps near & getting a comms challenge from Raxxla! üòÅ

You are right to be suspicious of Inara data - Inara has some data that is user editable and I have come across anomolies there before when users have modified the data, but then it hasn't been updated when things change. EDDB and EDSM do not modify the uploaded data from journals so these can...

No not Raxxlitis, I‚Äôm by no means suffering from grind nor fernweh, Raxxla is probably the only one thing which keeps me interested in the game and I hope by Brookes beard it is ‚Äòcurrently‚Äô in game, I sincerely do. Have been on several breaks already, this currently is just a general Frontier...

Also interestingly, it says this: " It contains many objects such as small and large rocks. The biggest object is the dwarf planet Ceres. Other large objects are the asteroids Vesta, Pallas and 10 Hygiea " Has anyone ever come across these named objects? curious if they are actually in game or...
