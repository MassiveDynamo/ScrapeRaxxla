That’s what I thought, but if you can find the source reference I’ll add it to my FDev quotes thread!

While I do have both DB and MB quotes that Raxxla is in game in that thread, I’ve never found any confirmation that it can actually be found! (But I Quest in hope!!)

Don’t remember Destiny. But thought it was interesting they had their own Guardians!
