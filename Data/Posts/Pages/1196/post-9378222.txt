“In the video game Destiny, Ceres was colonized by an alien race called the Fallen at the end of humanity's Golden Age.” (https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/dwarf-planets/ceres/overview/)

Wikipedia (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_(video_game)) “released worldwide on September 9, 2014” (i.e. in time to impact the ED Raxxla) , “Players take on the role of a Guardian” (my emphasis)
Offtopic: Oh I'd like it very much if FDev went a little Destiny-like with Odyssey and maybe added a bike, or some lore-heavy quests to obtain unique weapons. A little on-foot PvP wouldn't hurt none either.
Ontopic: Guardian tech guiding us to Raxxla? Well, Prof Melville said Guardians occupied roughly the same space bubble as humans do in Elite so it would be a definite (and cool) possibility, but FDev said you don't need Horizons to find Raxxla IIRC.
