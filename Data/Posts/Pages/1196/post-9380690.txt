This. Those three circle sectors match the Trojans, Hildas and Greeks asteroid clusters. The center dot-and-circle is Sun's symbol, and the six outer radial segments are present in many symbols for the bodies in Sol. It's almost as if FDev wanted to create a symbol for Raxxla as a solar body yet unfound/unknown.
The three arcs symbol are visible at the entrance to all (that aiâ€™ve seen) in-game asteroid bases. Highly significant! Dont then think it necessarily indicates Trojans, Hildas or Greeks, but it could do! I spent some time looking for them, but the search space is vast.
