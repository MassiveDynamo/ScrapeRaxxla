Maybe the big asteroids are in-game, but in the same way the ancient probes were. Those were found only if you knew where to look and appeared as a signal source only when very close, therefore very easy to miss at high SC speeds unless you were right on top of them. Since there is no lore mention of Ceres (DW posted a pic from FE2 that showed Ceres in-game in 3250, but i heard FE2 isn't canon), and FDev keeps a curious silenzio stampa about the big asteroids I think it's a very good line of investigation. I got this weird feeling about Ceres after I saw some NASA pics of Occator crater, with its bright blue spots (Cerealia Facula - facula means little torch in latin) and the smaller but just as bright Vinalia Faculae in its vicinity.

The big problem about finding the big asteroids in the belt is that their orbit has a pretty wide interval, it's hard to cover just by lil' old me.

Another interesting thing I found is that in ancient greek, "omphalos" also means "umbilical cord". Ummm, umbilical cord? Ceres? Her daughter, Proserpina? Both big asteroids, both allegedly missing? Come on, there's too many coincidences here. Either FDev has to 'fess up what they've done with 'em or it's a HUGE clue.
