The “princess” might perhaps be a nod to DB’s saying “ED does have a story, but it’s not a single-player threaded “rescue the princess” style story, it’s a story of your progression through the game, we will have things that happen to you at certain stages through the game, you’ll get invited to join things, if you get invited to join a secret organisation that’s a thing that can happen to lots of players, if you don’t get that invitation you’ll think to yourself why? I did kill that policeman the other day maybe I need to get my reputation higher”. m.youtube.com/watch?v=gDh9G1gDgMU
@TRDW: I’m still waiitng to be invited guys, and I havent killed any system security operatives for a very long time!!

Mmm, perhaps we do have to rescue the princess! What’s Aisling up to nowadays?
