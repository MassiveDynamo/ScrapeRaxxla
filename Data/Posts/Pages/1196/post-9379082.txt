Well, I’ve got bored looking at Rhea & Ariel. I’m willing to reconsider the asteroids, but has anybody any thoughts on how to actually find them in-game?

If you fly the asteroid belt and encounter an asteroid cluster, if you drop out of SC there is nothing there. So are the asteroid clusters real or totally fictitious?

Since we don't have access to the book, I’m still working on the hypothesis that “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars” is an anagram clue to Raxxla’s location. There’s a good selection of letters! As well as “Alien Ship At Rhea in Sol” I can see:
Sol Ship asteroid Earth Io Callisto Dione Rhea Titan Ariel Titania Triton Charon
And
Asteroid Ceres, Pallas, Astraea.
