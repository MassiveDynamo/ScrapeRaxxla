I was looking at the fictional children’s book mentioned in Elite Legacy, the only element which describes its content is ‘some Prince saving a princess from a space dragon.

MB wrote the book Sun Dragon (space dragon). Yes there is no Astrophil or spinning stars in the title and but maybe the title is irrelevant, or maybe it relates to some reference within that book?

Is this a clue? Who knows, but maybe worth a shot in the dark.
