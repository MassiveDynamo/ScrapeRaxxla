I know this has been postulated before, but has anyone here read ‘Sun Dragon’ by M Brookes?

I’m in two minds as to buy it, but could this be the so called Children’s story referred to in the Codex - as referenced in his other work ‘Elite Legacy’?

If so has anyone interrogated it for references to John Milton, Norse myth, star gates or inter dimensional portals… does it repeatedly discuss certain themes, numbers or locations?

“I had no form of entertainment except for a book, a single book about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon. My father must have bought it on the black market. He couldn’t have got it from anywhere else. “I still have that book.” Elite Legacy M Brookes.

I bought and read it a while ago. Didn’t notice anything relating to our quest here though. Overall it’s not a terribly good book
