Well spotted!

It's entirely possible we're looking at something Guardian related in the logo, since we've already found the Alpha sites, the central pits of which have six pairs of 'bulkheads' surrounding them with a similar angular shape where they protrude above ground. Is Raxxla an 'active' site we just haven't sen yet?

The Regor Sector is still permit locked, perhaps the new II system will reveal more?

Ya I think the dashes in the logo are a little closer to this




I also think Guardian tech might be the key
