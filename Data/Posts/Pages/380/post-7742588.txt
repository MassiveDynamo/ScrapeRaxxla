Edelgard & I experimented with mis-jumps using Thargoid probes in Delphi. Sadly no mis-jump joy and I lost Bob

Ahh sorry... I remember trying misjumps a long while back and i think MB? told us they werent in game.... But cant for the life of me find the reference.... Not sure how to search the old threads anymore.
