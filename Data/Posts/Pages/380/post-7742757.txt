I can't find my old posts either. A lot of stuff here goes in circles, and there are many recurring topics. Sometimes it has been discussed last week, sometimes there are relevant obscure references years back. New theories are rare. Frontier had a frame for the alien story planned before the game was out, and this quest is largely tied to it. Some elements of it go way back. Then there are some paths that have seen surprisingly little attention, with active references, but presumably lead no satisfactory results, other than some candidate systems. I'm under no obligations (other than Lord Tothos' thirst for nuclear fire of course). Then, in a sense, there are hundreds of Raxxlas, when you consider the game of procedural mythos that goes on. To find something new in-game, my best bet would actually go with the sound analysis (not talking about game OST this time, I'd like to throw a certain pmf home system into anarchy, even thargies missed it, barely, but I don't have the time) and, optics theory. It's like a game made by scientists after all. Even Drew kept pointing that LensLock to everybody. I wish there was more time, but I have duties to the people, and without them wouldn't have the need to vent crazy here.
