I believe Galnet reported that the Martian Artifact was no larger than a child’s hand. If that is true then it can’t be any of the Guardian artefacts that we are currently aware of.

Well there is no valid description of these artifacts based on size and weight. It would be to easy of a clue if they just upright say " This artifact is small in diameter"
