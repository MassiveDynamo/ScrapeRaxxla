The Official Explorers Photography Thread.
I took this one a few months back. I posted it over on Reddit at the time, but since it's one of my favorites I thought I'd post it here now as well.

This image this guy made makes me think of that picture with the two planets and the circular station. What if those stars are like this image and they are only the brighter stars darkened by the effect of the sun on the edge of that planet. This seems to reduce the low light stars and make only the brighter stars appear. That could be what that image is. Can you calculate the luminocity from the sun and figure out what brightness of stars can appear the figure out where that image is from?!

And from the astrophel thing being a plant. I really hope Raxxla isn't space weed.
