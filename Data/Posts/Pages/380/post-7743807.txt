Just wondering if anyone else has noticed that the number of dashes vary?
Well spotted!

It's entirely possible we're looking at something Guardian related in the logo, since we've already found the Alpha sites, the central pits of which have six pairs of 'bulkheads' surrounding them with a similar angular shape where they protrude above ground. Is Raxxla an 'active' site we just haven't seen yet?

The Regor Sector is still permit locked, perhaps the new II system will reveal more?
