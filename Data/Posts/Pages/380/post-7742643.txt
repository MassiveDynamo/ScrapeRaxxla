Ahh sorry... I remember trying misjumps a long while back and i think MB? told us they werent in game.... But cant for the life of me find the reference.... Not sure how to search the old threads anymore.
Google might pick up a historic reference. Iâ€™ve had zero success trying to find my old posts since the move to the new forum structure.
