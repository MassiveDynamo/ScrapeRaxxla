Yeah this is more reasonable explanation. Where do you believe the obelisk be portrayed on the icon?

Edit: So the does this mean that the artifact that was found on Mars was a guardian artifact? The orb maybe?

I believe Galnet reported that the Martian Artifact was no larger than a child’s hand. If that is true then it can’t be any of the Guardian artefacts that we are currently aware of.
