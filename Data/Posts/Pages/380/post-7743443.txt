Note that the “Underworld” in Greek Mythology metaphors could represent where Raxxla takes you, or Raxxla itself. This is also mentioned in relation to the Omphalos stones in Greek mythology, or the Opmphalos Rift devices related to Raxxla Codex may allow you to jump long distances across the Milk Way. It is likely we will find those devices first, and slowly unlock the gate to Raxxla itself. The Omphalos Rift may be one device or many.
