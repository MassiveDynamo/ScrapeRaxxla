Hint: Princess Astrophell and the Spiralling Stars.

“astrofell in British or astrophel”
noun
-an unidentified plant, commonly believed to be akin to an aster
Spiralling stars. ... Star WR104 is one of about 200 known so-called Wolf-Rayet stars (named after their discoverers). Such stars are in a phase where they are hot, massive and extremely luminous - typically three times the size, 25 times heavier and 100,000 times brighter than our own sun

Look for unidentified space biological phenomena or “plants” in Wolf-Rayet star systems? Will this lead to clues?
Hint: Omphalos Rift- “interpreted as the alien artifact that allows long-distance communication”. I believe this is what Raxxla actually is. But there may be many of them.

Notes on Omphalos: there are multiples of these stones in Greek mythology. One was located at Delphi, believed to be located at the Adyton near Pythia, The Oracle. Another was hidden by Rhea. Cronos eventually swallowed that one. Another omphalos associated with both Apollo and divination is the Omphalos found at Kerameikos, northwest of Athens’ acropolis. Omphalos stones have also been found at sites such as Thebes and Karnak in Egypt. Omphalos was also found at the ancient Greek oracle site of Ptoion and is connected with the Egyptian oasis of Siwas, in a temple where the gods Amun and Zeus were worshiped. The Omphalos is considered the central point from which terrestrial life originated.
Look in these systems... note that The Oracle is a station in Delphi.
