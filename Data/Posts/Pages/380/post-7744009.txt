Interesting idea, wonder if the outer solid black area of the Raxxla icon could be the obelisk making that shape. I recall everyone was trying to figure out the purpose and shape of these Guardian sites a long time ago when they started finding them.
No, not the obelisks, the static walls sticking up everywhere are a better geometric match.
