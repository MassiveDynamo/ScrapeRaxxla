the 1st post doesn't mention that it was mentioned by an fdev employee in a livestream that "you're looking in the right place" when responding to another live streamer searching for raxxla while in an asteroid field.

That's more of a valid clue than anything connecting the dark wheel to raxxla other than the dark wheel doesn't know where raxxla is (which is part of the reason the dark wheel was founded and exists ...since they're treasure hunters searching for it)
