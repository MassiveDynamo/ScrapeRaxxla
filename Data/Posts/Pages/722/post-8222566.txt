Welcome to the Raxxla Fernweh hunt.

1st Space Station was Meir around Earth.
2nd Space Station was ISS around Earth.

Actually:

Skylab, launched by the USA in 1973 was the first second (possibly 3rd as there was a 2nd Salyut launched around the same time). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab
Mir was third second, launched in 1986. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir
ISS was fourth third. Launched in 1998. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station

I was wrong, Salyut 1 was first. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_1

Also worth mentioning that the Chinese had a space station too, launched in 2011. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong-1
