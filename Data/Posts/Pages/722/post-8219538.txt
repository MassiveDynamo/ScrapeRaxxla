Hi, Commander. The game just takes a blurred "Screenshot" of your view, when entering the station service. You just landed on the landing pad so that's what you see. When you enter the hangar, the background changes accordingly. As for the numbers: I saw them on other systems too. Always those 032 04. Seems to be a common background for the federation.

I’ve noticed the facial tattoos in the past, and the different flags hanging in the background, but hadn’t spotted those numbers. Has anyone checked to see if they might be coordinates? Only two so a long axis!
