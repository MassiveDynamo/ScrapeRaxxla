"The honey is what falls from the air, especially at the risings of the stars, and when the rainbow descends.."
- Aristotle

"This substance is engendered from the air, mostly at the rising of the constellations, and more especially when Sirius is shining, never, however before the rising of the Vergiliae... Whether it is that this liquid is the sweat of the heavens, or whether a saliva emanating from the stars..."
- Pliny the Elder

Nevertheless some, when they have a mind to make the mead of a rougher taste, mingle a sextarius of water with three quarters of a pound of honey, and after they have, according to this proportion, filled a stone bottle, and plaistered it, they suffer it to be forty days in the sun, during the rising of the Dog-star"
- Columella
