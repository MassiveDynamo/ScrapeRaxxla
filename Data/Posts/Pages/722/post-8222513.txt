I tried finding the constellation “Corona Borealis “ but could only find the other Corona ,

Paraphrasing and might be misremembering but the myth behind Borealis talked about Ariadne and the Minotaur and Labrintyh , I thought that was intriguing because in a way we are all wandering the labyrinth of space...

But the constellation is a “crown” and “Gemma” is the brightest star in that , Gemma being Latin for gem/jewel..
