Welcome to the Raxxla Fernweh hunt.

Our most prominent lead since you asked..is now you...a new person with fresh 'eyes to see' maybe, who knows? Don't assume anybody has done anything before even if it looks like they have, check it for yourself to be sure.

Been thinking - the key that is also a door...a musical key that opens a 'door'? Anybody know what key the D-scanner booms in? We have the facility to make certain keys but where is the darn door? (D-scanner activates TPs so it is possible)

Small tinfoil hat (but to me nowhere near as large as usual) - an abandoned space station, probably an old Corilosis - never understood this reference or how it fits in. However. What if and its a big IF:

1st Space Station was Meir around Earth.
2nd Space Station was ISS around Earth.

1st image of Coriolis that inspired everything - 2001 A Space Odessy around Jupiter/Europa. Edit. Around Mars, the oblong black shapes were around Jupiter/Europa. In game the 1st alien artefact was found on Mars ( a few cm across) so why not have a SS there to monitor it and why not keep it running low power to keep it quiet before the artefact was announced....

What if the abandoned SS was in Sol as an homage to 2001, would be an early one that was outmoded and abandoned. One of the few systems where everything is already mapped so no need to use the FSS at all, more likely to miss is maybe?

More ramblings will follow in 2020
