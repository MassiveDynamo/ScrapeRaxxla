Yeah maybe, but then why are we still looking for it as recently as 2009 and will we find the orbital teapot?

[Edit: If the speed of light 'C' is a constant, why would we expect to see perturbations in 'C' due to aether?]

Prior to Michelson/Morley experiment it was logical to believe that the speed of light would vary depending on the direction of movement relative to the aether. The experiment showed no such variation, and as technology and techniques improve measurement accuracy over time it has been repeated (as are measurements in other aspects of physics, in case some new effect might be found). No variation in C has been detected, so speed of light is constant whatever you do; therefore aether doesn’t exist & that fact led Einstein directly to postulating his theory of Relativity.

Don’t know about the teapot, but we might find the Tesla.

Dog had another seizure this morning- that’s 3 Tuesday mornings in a row! at 05:00, 03:00 & 05:30. What the heck is going on? Still waiting to hear results from last Friday’s blood taking.
