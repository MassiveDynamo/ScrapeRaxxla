On the theory of a misjump, is it possible when you're pulled by a Thargoid that you get dropped in the destination system rather than the system you initiate the jump in?
I have only noted when this happens that you are in the jump initiation system not the destination system.

Or it could be another mechanism to cause a misjump that lands you in the destination system at a now apparent not so random destination in that system.
