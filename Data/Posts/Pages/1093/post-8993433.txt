Ah, Galnet today
“the Adamastor had a sister ship – the Hesperus – which in 3113 was sent to… somewhere!”

So, anyone good at star patterns? We need a search location! (is that Orions Belt to the right of the star in the glare? maybe Castor & Pollux in the left corner?)

P.s. there was shooting on the Adamastor before Prof Carver ducked out. I had assumed the “relics” that expedition had gathered included a Goid which wasn’t actually dead, it recovered & started attacking. Now it seems that they had a UA or something that possibly caused madness...but the Galnet post says investigation showed an attack by human weapon at the expedition site, so skulduggery!
