Right but they didn't call it planet 9 or put it in the 9th position. So you can see how one might assume it was supposed to be 399 Persephone. I doubt there will ever be clarification on this. Also 399 Persephone is supposed to be a main belt asteroid. With all the recent speculation on the missing belt I thought this could be a missing asteroid. That's when I noticed the earth masses Persephone is listed to be (in game) and it started me wondering about it.

I'm not an astrophysicist or even have a college education so bare with me here.

It was stated that Persephone was Planet 9 when it was added:

"- Added Persephone (Planet Nine), Haumea, Makemake, Eris, Orcus, 2002 MS4, Salacia, Quaoar, 2007 OR10 and Sedna to Sol"
