It was stated that Persephone was Planet 9 when it was added:

"- Added Persephone (Planet Nine), Haumea, Makemake, Eris, Orcus, 2002 MS4, Salacia, Quaoar, 2007 OR10 and Sedna to Sol"

From 2.2 patch notes.
Copy that, thank you for clarifying this. I don't think I was around for that patch so it's good to know.
