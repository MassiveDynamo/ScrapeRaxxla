I've also noticed that when the game crashes out mid jump it places you in a random. Typically far out location in the destination system as opposed to the main star. I've been able to repeat this by hard closing the game during the jump while in Witchspace
Come to think of it, I've had this happen as well in the past quite a few times while out in the black exploring but never gave it a second thought. I think it may lay weight to the possibility of misjumps in game.
