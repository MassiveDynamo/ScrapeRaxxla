I feel it could be with in the range of Tau Ceti due to it already being legend by the time "Cora came home soused..." but also think it could be anywhere due to how misjumps could send you anywhere (allegedly) but we can't miss jump.

I am in agreement about Sol could be a likely place
A candidate for the possibility of a misjump could be "being pulled from witch-space by a Thargoid" but that just lands you in the system that you start the jump in and at a random distance from the main star so may not be classed as a misjump, who knows?

It could be that you need to be pulled by a Thargoid in a certain system to be in an hidden area of that system that you would never find by any normal means. Might be worthwhile searching the immediate vicinity of such an occurrence when the Goids high wake out of there.

Imagine being pulled by a Thargoid and being dropped out of witch-space in the vicinity of the (hidden, stealthed or whatever) RAXXLA station (or whatever it is?) only a few mm away from you and you didn't have a clue it was even there in the first place and just went about your business just moving on to your original destination.
