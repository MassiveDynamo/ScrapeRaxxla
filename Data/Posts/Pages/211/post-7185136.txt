I think it is worth to start looking for Raxxla again for two reasons a) FD have said that one commander has been to the system Raxxla is, but has skipped it. b) they have hinted that they hope new tools will give players chance to find it more easily.

That Fdev statement was discussed a few pages back, but no one can find an actual official source for it. I'm still not sure if Fdev ever actually said this or if it's more rumor than fact, but I'd love to see some real evidence that Fdev did indeed claim this.

Either way, yes the new exploration tools should make it easier to find Raxxla. As long as we have some idea where in the haystack to hunt for it...
