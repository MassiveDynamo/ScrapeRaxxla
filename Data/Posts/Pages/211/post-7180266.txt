Is the cockpit visibility much better than the mk2? I was questing a few days ago and had to go back to SD to swap my mk2 for my AspX in orderto see the sky box properly.

When exploring do your finds go straight into the codex, or does that happen only when you dock & sell the data?

The cockpit is a reskinned mk2, no different, just with loads of red.

As for data, it appears that info goes to Codex and then Codex syncs with UC when you sell data.
