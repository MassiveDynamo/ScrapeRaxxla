I don't think there has ever been a specific Discord channel created for this thread. Probably because such things tend to fracture existing communities. We saw this with the Formidine Rift thread when a Discord grew up from that. We ended up with two very separate communities that didn't share information across both platforms along with occasional derogatory comments from the Discord users regarding what they considered to be their superior dialog over those who frequented the Rift thread on these forums.

Don't get me wrong. I really like Discord. If someone wanted to start one to discuss the hunt for Raxxla I think that would be swell. I don't think, however, that it should be advertised here in this thread or discussed here on this thread. The last thing I want to see is a bitter rivalry grow between this thread and any other efforts to hunt Raxxla. We don't need an 'official' thread-related Raxxla chatroom for people to start building lists of grievances against each other.
Agreed. Everything's encapsulated in one place at the moment. I can't see any merit to dividing into 2 completely separate places.
