Well, we know there are missing “beacons” that the expedition was supposedly deploying, the “lurking evil” (Guardian/Rogue human AI? from Bovomit sector?) mentioned in the message logs, and I think possibly another megaship or two for Conflux & Gap, maybe some more bases?
but without some new clues I don’t want to go back that direction, I’m having too much fun questing........
Aye, Raxxla is quite fun to chase!
