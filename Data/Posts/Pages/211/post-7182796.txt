Nice clarification from Drew. He is basically in the same position as us, when it comes to Raxxla.

'Raxxla is a definite place, that holds a mysterious secret', according to the codex. We just don't know how to find it.
We don't even know if it's possible to find it directly or if we have to go via The Dark Wheel(due to permit locks)?

This is true. Raxxla is a very closely guarded secret. None of the original ED writers outside of FDev were privy to the details.

Cheers,

Drew.
