Oh, life of a deep space explorer isn't that glamorous, there's not much to tell. Eating same synthetic food every day, studying databases, searching for stellar oddities. The sense of time and distance become blurred after a while. Sometimes you think you are hearing signal sources that aren't there. When you go on for long enough, the sea serpents come and start talking to you. Out there you are without a kingdom, only chance and promises of plenty. "Mars carried Venusâ€™ glove" - not sure if Juan Eusebio Nieremberg would have approved of that. Navel of the world used to be next to Mount Parnassus, but I don't know if that matters. Source 2 is such a tourist spot, I believe they even sell memorabilia at Tranquillity's Stop. I wouldn't mind some discord group people dropping by every now and then, and telling how superior dialogue they'd have there.

Especially when the space madness and boredom gets so bad you start putting Lavian brandy on your breakfast cereal!
