Hi Spacer !
How's doing the Seven Veils II ? Still an iClipper or did you change it for a Krait ?
Btw, lot of Rifters here are still wondering about the meaning of the clues you kindly provided us when the FR mYsTeRy was getting us crazy !
(Some of us still are! [big grin])

Though to be fair you have to be crazy to FRift/Quest; it’s a prerequisite [yesnod]
And if you aren’t at the outset the space madness will quickly take you there! :O

But yes, we would gratefully appreciate a breakdown of the clues.... though with all the troll salt that was spread (not by true FRifters!) after the event I can understand why it didn’t happen
(and I still miss Salomé)
(...and a perceptible storyline)
