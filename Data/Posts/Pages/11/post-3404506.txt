I don't think Raxxla is an actual planet. "Place that isn't a place..."

The whole deal with those data crystals seems to be some sort of treasure hunt, and you usually do those when you're trying to find something small (not of planet sized proportions). Perhaps a certain something that you can actually cargo scoop ?

"...door that is also the key."

To summarize RAXXLA in one word of our language:
Paradoxon.

You need belief to find it, and find the strength to venture there.
You can not pass RAXXLA without belief, for you will lack the door to open.
