Whatever it is, it's in-game, we just need to find it. Clues are what we are missing the most though, and I'm completely certain that they are there, just not found yet.

I've read that Raxxla is a planet with an alien construct on it, which is at the same time the gateway to another galaxy. Oh, and people probably live there too! Although I've also heard that they lost it. How do you loose a planet???

What I'm mostly curious is what will happen the day someone finds it. Does FD have another galaxy in their pocket? Older games had several galaxies on them, so it's not that far fetched...
They've pretty much confirmed that there will only be one Galaxy.
