I don't think Raxxla is an actual planet. "Place that isn't a place..."

The whole deal with those data crystals seems to be some sort of treasure hunt, and you usually do those when you're trying to find something small (not of planet sized proportions). Perhaps a certain something that you can actually cargo scoop ?

"...door that is also the key."

There are two things currently in game that could metaphorically be considered as a "door". The first and most obvious choice is a permit access to a locked system. However, one could argue that a space station's entry could also be characterized as a doorway or passage. Assuming there's a direct connection between Raxxla and the UA's, we should take note of their strong resemblance to the Ocellus starports. FDev after all did say that they (UA's) serve a bigger role and the clues concerning that are beyond obvious.

My take on it is that you need to have a special item in your cargo hold that once you have it delivered somewhere, grants you access to a remove location. There, you might be able to physically enter Witch space. And who Knows, maybe the exit door that gets you back to inhabited space, is in the Merope system itself

Hoped for the same "teleport" effect when transporting an UA to Jaques station at Gliese 1269 (He's still there), but alas, no teleporting occurred. It would be really cool though to have the key and upon entering a station, perhaps a special one?, you would be teleported to Raxxla...

I haven't seen any links between Raxxla, the UA's, the Meta-Alloys, or any combination thereof.
