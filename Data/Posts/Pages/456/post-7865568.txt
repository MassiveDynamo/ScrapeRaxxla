Re: Al Dhanab
Try looking for HD 207971 in the GalMap. If it has a different name in-game (some catalog stars do) , it'll still show up with the HD search.

Ok. Thx.

Btw.: Farseer wasnâ€˜t that the title of the Eldar psychics in WH40K? Anyone ever tried their luck with the Eldar Craftworlds on Galmap? (Only remember Ulthwe but will give it a try)
