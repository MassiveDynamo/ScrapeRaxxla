The present isn't a place either.
So, is the past. Which means it could have been patched out of the game! Or retconned out of the lore!!

Didn't read all the posts after this... 8\

Just thought of something. Look at fiction that this game has references too. The meta answer to finding Raxxla. There is a voice over from a guy from doctor who. Maybe it follows the theme from doctor how and it represents the tardis or something. What happened to the tardis when it was lost?

Where did the tardis, or the doctor, or any of the characters go in doctor who that were real life locations in the game?

Maybe try things like star trek also or any fiction that could have fan service from it in the game.
