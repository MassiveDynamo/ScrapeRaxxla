I'm once again lost today on the line "place that isn't a place". There's just too much to digest in a statement like that. Making a list at work today (cause I'm just so busy) of anything that matches that criteria, even loosely.

Just throwing out there that "the wild" is a place that isn't a "place", but I did not find much in that sector. Always nice to check out the far-flungs though.
