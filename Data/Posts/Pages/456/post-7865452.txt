Getting back on topic...

I mentioned elsewhere that I had a thought about the codex for the DW. I'll mention it here to spread the love..

Lyta Crane is the journalist with the 8th moon of a GG. Some stars are borderline GG and as such might qualify. This makes it much more possible to get the shot in the codex photo, if the star in the picture is the 'gas giant'. This would make the star in the image not the primary of the system.

Now: LYTA are all star classes (and Lyta is an odd name..) and in addition there is a 'Crane' constellation, known as the Grus or Gruis constellation. So my immediate thought was - is there a system in the crane constellation with A primary and an L Y & T as second stars. Some people have already checked, an not found any T stars so far.

Not sure how much of the constellation has been covered - there are a lot of stars, but only a few have an A star. Now I'm back in the bubble I might go look myself, but feel free to have a poke around. If the search is already done then do chip in here for completeness.

Neat idea, though I'm bit bothered with localization issues. If she's Crane in all localized versions I deem a hint improbable as it would only make sense to english speaker.

Btw: Beta Gruis is on EDSM, Alnair only on Inara and Al Dhanab not on

Edit: Crane/Crone?
