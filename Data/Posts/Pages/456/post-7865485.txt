Neat idea, though I'm bit bothered with localization issues. If she's Crane in all localized versions I deem a hint improbable as it would only make sense to english speaker.

Btw: Beta Gruis is on EDSM, Alnair only on Inara and Al Dhanab not on

Edit: Crane/Crone?

Re: Al Dhanab
Try looking for HD 207971 in the GalMap. If it has a different name in-game (some catalog stars do) , it'll still show up with the HD search.
