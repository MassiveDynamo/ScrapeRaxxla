Feeling pretty dejected concerning FD generally following Arthur Tolmie’s confirmation (appreciated for his honesty) the other night that interiors (off topic) were not a considered direction.

Theorising on the ‘why’s’ and ‘whatfores’ about FD’s development modus operandi has only bolstered my own hypothesis about Raxxla being currently none-accessible (albeit ‘out there’), in respect that it’s probably just a narrative drop asset.

I need to do some proper searching of the mind to find a reason to keep playing this game, because as time moves on I’m getting the distinct feeling we have been lied to; not directly concerning Raxxla, but the ‘spirit’ of ED generally.

My expectations were dented when Odyssey dropped, and I could see the writing on the wall before the initial demo, the confirmation around interiors and why it’s not happening only bolster these feelings and theories. I don’t feel any loss, I never expected interiors, just saddens me to think FD aren’t as imaginative as they used to be prior to 2017.

My only hope, is that FD optimise Odyssey to a state where it is playable. I may find some comfort in that, and at least now I can put to rest my ‘obsession’ and maybe shift my energies elsewhere.

My only solace concerning this game has been this community, particularly this thread and others.

I’m not leaving (backer / lifetime pass holder); just...
