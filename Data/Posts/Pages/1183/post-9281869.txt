Once again for those who would disagree, we haven't gotten any recent official respons to anything Raxxla related.
I don't think we will get anything from FD. All hints they want to give us, will be in the game. They have given us a few mission texts and the codex, so far. This hasn't been enough for us to verify if Raxxla is accessible or where it might be.
I would not be surprised if there are a missions or tourist beacons added in Odyssey, that gives a few more bread crumbs. I will wait for the console release before i'm sure there is nothing new, this time.

Personally I lean to the idea that Raxxla is in the game and accessible, but practically impossible to find. I don't think it shows on scans.

My search for Raxxla isn't about finding it. It's more about collecting information and ideas to be able to add new info to the puzzle, when it becomes available in the game.
