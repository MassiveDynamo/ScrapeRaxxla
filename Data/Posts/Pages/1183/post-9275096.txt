It's been so long now I can't recall, but I know it is discussed in the Soontil context, and the relationship between the two I believe.
The Circle existed because of a schism between Oberon and Neptune about whether to just exploit Soontil or continue to seek Raxxla. CEIP was the Oberon branch that sought Soontil, I believe
