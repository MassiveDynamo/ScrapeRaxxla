My opinion, I consider it the most probable, is that Raxxla is still not in the game, and FD's statement that this is the end of the story should be taken literally. In other words, the Physical (game, if you like) manifestation of Raxxla will appear only in the very last, or one of the last patches for the game, at the end of the life cycle, but not earlier.
Also, more or less direct indications, or directions of how and where to look for it, also should not be expected before this period.
But nevertheless, froniters can add some references, some hints (as they already did) that will help us in our search, although now they mostly lead to the wrong place (because we do not have the main key)
