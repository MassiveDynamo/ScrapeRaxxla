No not Raxxlitis, I’m by no means suffering from grind nor fernweh, Raxxla is probably the only one thing which keeps me interested in the game and I hope by Brookes beard it is ‘currently’ in game, I sincerely do.

Have been on several breaks already, this currently is just a general Frontier Development malaise, caused by too much behavioural analysis. I’m over it now.

Raxxla provides me a star to fly by.
