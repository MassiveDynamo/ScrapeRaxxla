It's just occured to me, perhaps Raxxla is the missing Cassiopeia (hidden in a dyson sphere........)
If only there was a cmdr who could organise a mission to go look for it.
Anyone got any remains of the late CMDR McMillan and a 'Cloning for Dummies' book

I have no desire to spend another month + demonstrating Cass-A doesn't exist so:

B) I really hope you're wrong since it means I'd never find it.
