I do quite like the hypothesis that Raxxla is in one of the aforementioned systems:
DRYU BRA XX-L A7-0
PHOOE BRA XX-L A76-0
HYPAE BRA XX-L A7-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A7-0

any of these in the “outer rim”?
...

To be honest, according to the galaxy map there is no HYPAE BRA XX-L A7-0 in the galaxy. But by screening the current dump from EDSM if found HYPAO BRA XX-L A7-0, which I can also find in game. From this search I can say that there are currently no other RAXXLAs in the EDSM database. (Removed all non-alpha characters from the system names and then searched for Raxxla).
