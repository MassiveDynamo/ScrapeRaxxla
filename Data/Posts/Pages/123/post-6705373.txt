Glad to see this thread is still going, I'm looking for something to do in game, can someone catch me up on the basics of what has been discussed? How much effort is being concentrated towards the original novella? Is the 'Outer Rim' clue still being explored?

Is it possible that outer rim relates to a ringed planet, maybe a huge gas giant, Raxxla could be a moon? If not it could be a system on the far side of the galaxy, there was a theory early on in the game that the Thargoids came from the far side of Sag A*, possible connection there maybe?

Has the video detailing the art source book been posted? I can't remember the specifics but I'll find the link, basically a CMDR finds an old Sci-Fi art book that the original Novella author tied a lose story too, it's contains Raxxla, I'll find the link if needed.

Happy hunting
