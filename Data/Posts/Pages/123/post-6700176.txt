It's just occured to me, perhaps Raxxla is the missing Cassiopeia (hidden in a dyson sphere........)
If only there was a cmdr who could organise a mission to go look for it.
Anyone got any remains of the late CMDR McMillan and a 'Cloning for Dummies' book

I've got a book called "Cloning for Dollies" but I am a bit sheepish about lending it out...

Back on topic I have absolutely no ideas or theories about Raxxla to impart.
