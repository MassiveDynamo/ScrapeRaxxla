I have been searching out in the Rift for more weeks than I can remember. There are so many system's that have been explored it's amazing. There are also a lot of unexplored systems still out there. I coming back to the bubble now as I need to repair and feel the need to fight some Thargoids and get back to my piracy before space madness sets in (it may already have!).

And no I have not found Raxxla, yet
