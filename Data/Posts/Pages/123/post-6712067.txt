I'm curious to know what folks think will happen when/if Raxxla is found â€¦ do we think that scanning a planetary body will yield any type of message to say that it's Raxxla? What if it's been scanned already and just has some 'procedurally generated' planet name?

I, for myself, can imagine a dozen of game mechanics for this. Interdiction/hyperdiction-like, cinematic load screen when aproaching, new kind of USS/planetary POI ...etc... It depends only on how much the FDevs want us to find it, imho.

Any interaction with this "coms control" ?
