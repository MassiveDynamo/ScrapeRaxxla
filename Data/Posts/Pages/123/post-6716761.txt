Any interaction with this "coms control" ?

Yeah it gave a data package.

Is it a new one? Many surface sites have been messed up lately. Not sure how tip off missions currently are. Rawat Depot++ in Coni system still played out that mysterious scanned message a few weeks ago, and possibility of some new bits of information is main reason I like hopping into SRV every now and then. I think I was supposed to post about it but didn't remember. Also Raxxla mystery likely has nothing to do with places like this, and doesn't require Horizons at all.

I think its a new tip off that's appeared in the past few weeks. I wasn't suggesting its anything particular to do with Raxxla. Just wondered what the heck its all about, and posit the possibility that FD are replacing the station-found missions with tip off messages for hints and clues to in-game mysteries â€¦ shame the server bank seems to be stuffed atm. Will try again when 3.1 drops
