What do we think this is all about then:

Is it a new one? Many surface sites have been messed up lately. Not sure how tip off missions currently are. Rawat Depot++ in Coni system still played out that mysterious scanned message a few weeks ago, and possibility of some new bits of information is main reason I like hopping into SRV every now and then. I think I was supposed to post about it but didn't remember. Also Raxxla mystery likely has nothing to do with places like this, and doesn't require Horizons at all.
