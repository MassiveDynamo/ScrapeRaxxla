I have been searching out in the Rift for more weeks than I can remember.
It seems that something makes you think that Raxxla could be in the Rift. Any particular reason for it ? I am asking because when the Rift mYsTeRy - quest was going on, I believed that too. But since the ...err.. 'weird' ending, no longer.

How much effort is being concentrated towards the original novella? Is the 'Outer Rim' clue still being explored?
I think there is no secret spoiling if I say that our excellent fellow threader Macros has set up a mean gang of throat-cutters and they are currently exploring the outer rim of the MW. So beware if you plan to go there .
I, for myself, being a lazy Cmdr, I am just exploring the outer rim of the Bubble.
