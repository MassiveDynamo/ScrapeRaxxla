What if it turns out to be something stupid like mars. And the thing found on mars is related to raxxla. Maybe raxxla is the ancient name for mars.

No, it will be worse than that. In a twist of FD's irony it will turn out to be Earth (OR LHS 3447).

We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.
