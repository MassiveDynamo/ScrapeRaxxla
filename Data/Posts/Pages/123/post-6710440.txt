Has the video detailing the art source book been posted? I can't remember the specifics but I'll find the link, basically a CMDR finds an old Sci-Fi art book that the original Novella author tied a lose story too, it's contains Raxxla, I'll find the link if needed.

I'm not sure if the video ever got posted in this exact thread but I think I know the video you are referring to.

A certain player who used to play under the in-game name of Finn McMillan found a copy of The Alien World by Steven Eisler who turns out to be Robert Holdstock who wrote The Dark Wheel? A pudgy middle-aged guy wearing an Elite Dangerous logo ballcap if I remember correctly.

Here's a link to the relevant portions extracted from The Alien World: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HuDtu7J_IMWF7791wL6Qg6rBgP88JhW9AUoAkWEkwoY/edit?usp=sharing
