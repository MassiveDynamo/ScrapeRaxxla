And yeah, I’ve got some suspicions about about DW2! We’re you watching the DW2 livestream? There was a point where Ed was saying about the stuff on the way and the CG for a station around Sag A*, so I dropped something in the chat along the lines of ‘!!! Interesting! Especially with Supermassive Blackholes being the mothers of galaxies! ’. Ed had an interesting look on his face afterwards!

Quite interesting, yeah. Might be that MB and DB are no longer the only Devs who know about Raxxla...
Let's just find "the brow" of this supermassive BH ! (Which I would call the "fate" or "doom" of the galaxy, rather than the "mother"... but it's just me.)

Where is her brow, ... snip ..

In some other language, the " jewell burns on the top of the mother..etc" is the translation . I don't think there is one Raxxla per every ED localization... Or, lost in translation, could be ?
