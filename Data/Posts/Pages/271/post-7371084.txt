Nice. Only localisation I couldn't translate !
Now we have, Brow, Stirn, Fronte, Front, галактик and Cima
(Differs only in Spanish)
Umm, I think there was something lost in the translation (pun intended)...
галактик with latin aplhabet is: galaktik
I think in your list should be "коронa" which translates to crown.
