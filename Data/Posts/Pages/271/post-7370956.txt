Yes, it is. If I'm right in my localisation mentioned "crown" or something same.

May I ask what's your localisation of the game ?

There is that system... like 4000 Ly right over Sgr A*.
Can't remember its name... Ophiuchi ?
Yep, V2 107 Ophiuchi
Ophioukhos; "serpent-bearer", ...meh...
main is a K star in ED
Unreachable, it was, iirc...
It may have changed since I was near there..

EDIT: forget it... still unreachable. My memory is becoming as solid as Pa's...

Serpent?
