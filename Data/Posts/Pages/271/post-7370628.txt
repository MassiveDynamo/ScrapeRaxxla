I read some Elite chronology titles and found one thing. There was special BHs In the extended edition that using for travel to other galaxies. In same text this other galaxies was a spurs of the Milly way. So probably MW is the mother of galaxies. Where is her brow, jewel etc?.. Where is the Galaxy face? It should be a bright thing. It should burns. In same time I looked at that Raxxla logo from the Codex. I definitely view Sun symbol. That circle with a dot. It surrounded by something triple. This thing holding sun inside itself.

So we (you) should to check Sol system twice. Not like a common Commander. But like a hunter for the hidden thing.

Unfortunately I can never to visit Sol myself and check all my ideas. Some my principles block me from it. For example I don't want to prove myself in Federal Navy. So I will be a humble exploer who only reads Galnet news about the real heroes. ;-) One day you will found it! And I will smile reading it while scanning another ice body.
