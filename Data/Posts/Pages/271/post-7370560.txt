A small warning regarding mythological system names in ED. There is hardly a deity from European or north African mythology or religion that is not represented by a system in the bubble. If you cant find it, it probably has an alternative spelling.

It is easy to go mad, if you take system names as a confirmation of any hypothesis. Anything can be made into a plausible connection.

Stay sharp and be skeptical. Your idea is probably wrong, but you should still check it out. One of our silly ideas will one day, turn out to be the right one.

Good luck in the void.

This. We have a habbit naming things after myths and old gods. Additionally Raxxla is not a human made, so its locationâ€™s hiding behind a human myth is highly unlikely imho.
