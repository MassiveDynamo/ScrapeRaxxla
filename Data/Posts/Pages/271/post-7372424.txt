Some Raxxla Weirdness:

So Everyone is hooked into the Casiopeia thing, and Guru 951 claim... I have some interesting developments.

"The jewel that burns in the brow of the mother of galaxies"

If you dissect the Cassiopeia stars, one main star is Caph. this means hand, which is held near the forehead in many drawings of Cassiopeia. But her actual brow, is somewhere in the middle of the V that is formed by Caph, gamma, and Schedar. The middle of this is peculiar as it contains a star called

Even though my best guess is he just went through all the Cassiopeia stars at the early stages of his search, this is an interesting find.

It is a runaway star, moving at around 2.5 million mph relative to its neighbors (1,100 kilometers per second). Its magnetic field and wind of particles creates a visible bow shock 4 light-years ahead of it, colliding with the diffuse, and usually invisible, interstellar gas and dust. This is about the same distance that Earth is from Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun.[13] The dimensions of the bow shock are vast: around 12 light-years long and 1.8 light-years wide.[14]
That's just beautiful.
