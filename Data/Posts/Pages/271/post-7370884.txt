In some other language, the " jewell burns on the top of the mother..etc" is the translation . I don't think there is one Raxxla per every ED localization... Or, lost in translation, could be ?
Yes, it is. If I'm right in my localisation mentioned "crown" or something same. Or may be crown, diadem or forehead. Jewel on the head. What is it? The top level of MW? Top from the center? From Earth? Polaris is a good variant but it haven't any link to the "mother".

Also we may think about Corona Borealis constellation. It alpha is Gemma so same to "gem", and to "jewel" words.

P.s. Yes, I know what Alphekka is just single star (Ingame). But this theory was beautiful anyway
