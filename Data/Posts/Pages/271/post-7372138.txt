Thanks for the hint. I'll bring a combat ship and will report if anything peculiar happens after/when shooting Dark whatsoevers.

I went there last night, it's just a repeatable scripted event. Anywhere from 10-20 ships show up and it becomes a mini combat zone for a little while. After everything's done nothing else really happens. It might be part of some invisible checklist but who knows. The attacking party was sol workers party for me, nothing about dark anything. I followed some of the ships out of the system and they just head to random stations and dock.

It seems to just be an additional way to obtain rep with some of the Sol factions.
