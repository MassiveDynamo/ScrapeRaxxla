Persephone is the last planet (system map, not orrery) in the Sol system, a landable 2G ice world, 400k LS from the Sun. Has a government installation in orbit named Primary Transport Authority. T7 named WayFinder piloted by Neil Horsburgh flew around for a while. Scanning the installation starts a scenario where it gets attacked by ships with names like Dark Aspirant or similar. The installation asks for help defending, but I had to run away as I wasn't in a combat ship.

Thanks for the hint. I'll bring a combat ship and will report if anything peculiar happens after/when shooting Dark whatsoevers.
