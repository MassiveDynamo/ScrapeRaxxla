Yes, it is. If I'm right in my localisation mentioned "crown" or something same. Or may be crown, diadem or forehead. Jewel on the head. What is it? The top level of MW? Top from the center? From Earth? Polaris is a good variant but it haven't any link to the "mother".

Also we may think about Corona Borealis constellation. It alpha is Gemma so same to "gem", and to "jewel" words.

P.s. Yes, I know what Alphekka is just single star (Ingame). But this theory was beautiful anyway

The Jewel is actually one of the official names of Alphekka. Gnosia is another name for it.

Corona Borealis in mythology, is linked to Ariadne: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne

Aridane is linked to labyrinths, weaving and solving of mazes and pusles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne's_thread_(logic)

As the daughter of king Minos, she is also a princess. Lots of good bits from her.

Corona Borealis is also linked to the Welsh goddess Arianrhod. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianrhod

Arianrhod means 'silver wheel'. She is a virgin mother and is associated with the moon and the stars and weaving. https://feminismandreligion.com/2013/02/23/arianrhod-celtic-star-goddess-2/

Alphekka is also right next door to Dea Motrona (literally meaning mother goddess).

It's an interesting region.
