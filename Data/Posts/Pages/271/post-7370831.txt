Yeah, I figured you’d have done the full mapping etc. but thought I’d still better check just in case. I’m playing with a new alt at the moment, and I’ve found the sites fine (one deliberately and one accidentally), so they’re definitely not bugged in general. I’ll take a run out to the Trianguli one when so get chance and see if I get the same as you did.

I’m signed up to DW2, but my main account was already out a little way more or less on the route, so I didn’t come back for the start. Also, I’m in Open, - are you in Fleetcomm?

And yeah, I’ve got some suspicions about about DW2! We’re you watching the DW2 livestream? There was a point where Ed was saying about the stuff on the way and the CG for a station around Sag A*, so I dropped something in the chat along the lines of ‘!!! Interesting! Especially with Supermassive Blackholes being the mothers of galaxies! ’. Ed had an interesting look on his face afterwards!

Yes, Im in Fleetcom for DW2, but currently spending some time in Solo with my young clone getting his AspX engineered. However I want to get back to doing some more mining for DW2, got up to top 50% sunday afternoon- not bad in a Phantom when everyone else seems to be flying mining condas of clippers!

Thought I heard you mentioned on that livestream. I didn’t spot that look, but I think Iwas thread reading while watching. Interesting!
