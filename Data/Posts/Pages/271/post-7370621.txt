This. We have a habbit naming things after myths and old gods. Additionally Raxxla is not a human made, so its location’s hiding behind a human myth is highly unlikely imho.

Unfortunately the game is programmed by humans so that could be a weak basis for hypothesising. Someone in FD seems to be inordinately fond of mythology, and we’ve seen a picture of Michael Brookes’ tattoo.....
But Han_Zen is quite correct (as usual! ) , following mythology too closely may well lead to space madness.

Develop an hypothesis, then test its validity and be prepared to move on to another if it fails. Eventually some may turn out to be correct and could lead to a valid theory and conclusion. If you find something report it here with some supporting evidence.

I am personally not into mythology so tend not to follow those types of hypothesis too closely, but am willing to accept they might lead to Raxxla. However the toast in the Dark Wheel Codex entry is, IMHO, far more likely to lead to TDW stealth station than to Raxxla.
