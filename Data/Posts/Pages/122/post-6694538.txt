I don't say the Founders World has nothing to do with Raxxla... But I doubt Raxxla (whatever it turns out to be) is there. Because the ...tiny part a little bit obvious wouldn't then be tiny nor a little bit. Besides it would be totally inconsistent with the Founders/Elite missions.

Well ... strictly speaking you're issued the "Founders World Permit" not the Shinrarta Dezra permit
Do you know, Doc, if at that time the "Shinrarta Dezra" name was already implemented in the game? It may have come later ?

you are quite right in stating that we can't quite access the Founder World at the moment.
Did someone really try to land ? I mean thoroughly, from many different spots of the orbit... different angles, speed, etc (hauling SAP 8 core conts?) ? I don't say we may land on an atmospheric, but it could trigger something.
