Has anyone looked into the elite opening screen? I’m not talking about the menu screen with “Start”, “Training”, etc., but the screen you click before that one, the screen that starts the game. You see the giant words “Elite Dangerous”, an elite symbol, and a planet at the bottom of the elite symbol. Background is star constellations. The actual elite symbol doesn’t include that little circle (which looks like a mysterious planet) at the bottom, correct? The star constellations on that opening screen may be a significant clue to finding Raxxla. What if Raxxla was right in front of our faces this whole time?
