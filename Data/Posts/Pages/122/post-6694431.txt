Well ... strictly speaking you're issued the "Founders World Permit" not the Shinrarta Dezra permit but you are quite right in stating that we can't quite access the Founder World at the moment.

I hadn't really given it much thought but it does kind of make this permit pretty unique. Are there any other system permits that are named for a single planet inside that system and not for the system name itself?

That hadnâ€™t struck me, very good point. Could it be a hangover from the original kickstarter access? or is there a hint of some deeper mystery?

edit: is this game dying? Where is the forum activity now, apart from this thread? Nothing on the alien archeology, mysteries, breaking news, theories & tinfoilery thread for 10days now; has the game really devolved to just everyone shooting thargoids?
