Do you know, Doc, if at that time the "Shinrarta Dezra" name was already implemented in the game? It may have come later ?
Naming the Founders World system was a Kickstarter reward so, yes. The name has been around since the game first entered beta.

Did someone really try to land ? I mean thoroughly, from many different spots of the orbit... different angles, speed, etc (hauling SAP 8 core conts?) ? I don't say we may land on an atmospheric, but it could trigger something.

I haven't personally though it is on my to do list.
