Raxxla is not in any of those systems. I found them by brute forcing the sector list: https://cim.sotl.org.uk/elite-dangerous/

rOmiLaYu was relatively close by and checked them all. Nothing special in any of them. They are all far away, but not what I would call 'on the outer rim of the galaxy'.

As far as I know, there are no tools that allows searching for systems that contains 'RA XX-L A'. It has to be done semi manually. That means that I have probably missed a few.

Murphy’s law implies Raxxla will be in the last system in the list of ones you’ve missed. So just complete the manual search, select the last one & David’s your uncle!
