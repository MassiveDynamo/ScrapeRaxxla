Not strictly speaking. You can access the Shinrarta Dezra system once you attain elite rank in any discipline. The Founders World planet is still inaccessible until, presumably, atmospheric landings are introduced.

Well ... strictly speaking you're issued the "Founders World Permit" not the Shinrarta Dezra permit but you are quite right in stating that we can't quite access the Founder World at the moment.

I hadn't really given it much thought but it does kind of make this permit pretty unique. Are there any other system permits that are named for a single planet inside that system and not for the system name itself?
