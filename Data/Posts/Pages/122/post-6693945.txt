You can access the Founders World by reaching Elite in any of the four disciplines (Combat, Trade, Exploration, CQC).

Not strictly speaking. You can access the Shinrarta Dezra system once you attain elite rank in any discipline. The Founders World planet is still inaccessible until, presumably, atmospheric landings are introduced. So if SD is where Raxxla is located then Raxxla may be Founders World, or it may be any of the other celestial bodies therein. But this hypothesis has been floating around for so long that I’m sure every SD celestial body has been minutely examined and the system deep space has been searched many times for hidden or wandering objects with no success being reported.

The only wandering body reported that I remember was the mysterious asteroid belt in Lave, but think that was confirmed to be a bug.

I do quite like the hypothesis that Raxxla is in one of the aforementioned systems:
DRYU BRA XX-L A7-0
PHOOE BRA XX-L A76-0
HYPAE BRA XX-L A7-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A7-0

any of these in the “outer rim”?
