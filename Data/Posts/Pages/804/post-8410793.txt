I have a question ... when I fly in bubble some systems cannot show me system map from star map, this means it was never visited by me, right (also red on "visited" filter)?
Now ...once I jump in and honk - all bodies are known. And if I try to sell data to UC - it cannot be sold as I visited it 2nd time (just absent).
So question is why it happens? And may it be related to raxxla?
Bright example is Sol. I thought it's because "home" ... but right now just visited another one "Kolyawa".

So why those systems are special and can it be related to raxxla?

As long as the system has a civilization above 1mil I think (forgot the exact number) then this scenario occurs. You can search for this in the forums. It's nothing.
