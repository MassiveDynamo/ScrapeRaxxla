I think I had that too many times, specialy I remember this:
Sol Stairways, we'll get you where you're going' before jumping out.
...seemed like bug for me. I think I gave away to get into CZ there as I couldn't. Once I get close it appeared behind me. Like saying 10km ahead, but marker flows away. And never saw fights.
...however, that was not Sol for sure, as I was wondered "what Sol Stairways do here" I recall...
...I think "mother Gaia" (or whatever it called, that one from Mercury) was involved in CZ in my case.
