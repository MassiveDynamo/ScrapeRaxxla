I have a question ... when I fly in bubble some systems cannot show me system map from star map, this means it was never visited by me, right (also red on "visited" filter)?
Now ...once I jump in and honk - all bodies are known. And if I try to sell data to UC - it cannot be sold as I visited it 2nd time (just absent).
So question is why it happens? And may it be related to raxxla?
Bright example is Sol. I thought it's because "home" ... but right now just visited another one "Kolyawa".

So why those systems are special and can it be related to raxxla?
