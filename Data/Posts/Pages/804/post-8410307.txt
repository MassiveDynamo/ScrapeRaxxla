Are they populated controlled systems? I think some systems are 'known' in the way that i know about Amsterdam. Ive never been there, i dont know the map or roads but im aware of it and so are everyone else. Ive had systems ive never been in that dont offer a 'discovered' and is already scanned. I feel like this is the same pretty much but idk for sure
