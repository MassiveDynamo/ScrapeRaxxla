I had it higher but i couldnt boost. Im fine with it at 70.5 though. Also i have a few optionals i switch around that affect it some. I had it up to 74 before i started making it boost capable
Yes, that what I say, engi that for "engine focused" then you can boost. Also add expereminatl for capacity maybe. Not a big deal from lightweight there.
4A "engine focused" can boost 5a/6d trusters. And 6d clean tune / weight does 320 boost on my ship. I think 5A/dirty could do 358 ... but...dont think I need it.
