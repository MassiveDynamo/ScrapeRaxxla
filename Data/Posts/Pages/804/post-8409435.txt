Iâ€™m think Jameson memorial were controlled by TDW, for quite a while. This was before FD locked it to PF.

Yes, remember that & seeing DW in control for a while. I suspect (with my very limited understanding of BGS mechanics) FD changed it to put PF in charge so DW cannot be ejected from Shinrarta, which makes me think they are an outer wheel of the the real DW agglomerate.
Edit: but as spiky-haired girl said in Premonition they are there as a distraction, implying the mechanism to get into TRDW is elsewhere....
Edit2: 54% Deadly & currently resting the thumbs!!!
