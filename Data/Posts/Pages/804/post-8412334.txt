Hey nice. Im only jumping about 70.5 with all my internals.
Guess you miss some ...Check cores.
I just changed 6D distributor with generic engi to 4A for engine. It added 1.5s pause in addition doing boosting, however freed more then 20t, so I could install figher for same range. Shield remains ok, i tested by boosting itno ground from about 20m It holds.
