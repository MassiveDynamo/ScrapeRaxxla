I, 2 hours ago, did 2 wing assassinations both were elite rank missions but both targets were only deadly. Didnt seem to have any problems though. Of course im rocking the vette with g5 eng on most of it with 3500+ shield and 6500+ hull. The one target was in a python for some reason.
I use MK-2 for all Tried to do miner/explorer yday too out of T10. 10 mins later I figured it will be same as MK-2, except will have 2.5x cargo, slower moves, and less jump range - sold it back >:
Like those guys with 540 boost speed. Also yeh, for missions need heavy protected shielded. For regular fights better works repair limpets, even for thargoids as for me.
Problem with missions - they jump away and reset fight if you try to kite em, which is needed for limpets. On missions you must take in-face-fire.
