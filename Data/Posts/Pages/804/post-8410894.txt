Bill Turner (engineer) was involved in the Salomé plotline

In Premonition I seem to remember he was a traitor & sold her & her buddies out, or am I getting confused with Elvira who was definitely an enemy


I think the npc name is slightly interesting, and the wake behaviour, but perhaps more interesting is using that phrase when it’s a Cobra and not a regular passenger liner. May warrant marking as an odd incident and potential evidence if anyone has a relevant hypothesis
