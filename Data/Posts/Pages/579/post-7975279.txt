That's when we get a pilot level system... with specialized MMORPG classes, and we have to grind from level 1 to 60 before Elite: Burning Crusade gets released. Can we at least get tier armor sets for our ships yet?
Tier armors will be available on the Battle pass but if you want the different variants you'll need the premium Battle pass .
