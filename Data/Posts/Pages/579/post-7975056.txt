The victor writes his-story...

Consider that "Fake News" (propaganda) is not a "new" phenomena. There's nothing new under the Sun and considering how difficult and time consuming it still is today to write a comprehensive account of something that was actually observed, do you really think *scribes would have wasted time on a lie?

The lower limit of human population on this planet is stretching back further and further into the past as more and more archaeological discoveries are being made, in some really obscure places. It appears we've been here significantly longer than ~7000 years but most of the evidence has corroded away.

So which is correct? His-story, her-story and do either in any way resemble the truth?
