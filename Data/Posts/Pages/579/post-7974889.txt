I am German so please forgive any incomgruities. In German it‘s Priesterkönig Johannes. Translation would be Presterking John or something like that. The problem I have with that part is that his kingdom never got a name. So finding Eldorado and Atlantis was fairly easy, but that part? Are we to look for Ekbatana, India, Bactria, Ethiopia?
To me Eldorado, Atlantis and Prestyr John are ideas of mythical places in our culture. The names arent the important part it is what they stand for. Reminds me there is a good book "the edges of the earth in ancient thought" talks a bit about thse things.
