IIRC, he was hinted at the end of "Marco Polo" season 2 somewhere halfway on the Silky Road.So, Ekbatana or Bactria.
But he also appeared in popular culture as a character connected with Nordic mythology.

Hm rethinking on that: Presterking John is actually a fraud as hystory knows. The bishop of Edessa made the story up to start another crusade.

Atlanis and Eldorado are real myths. So simply forget about John?
