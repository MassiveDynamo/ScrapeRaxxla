the stone age lasted for a minute or two. they were pretty good at masonry by the end of it, but new technology replaces the old, with the discovery and improvement of metallurgy, and innovations like cement and concrete, ancient skills have been forgotten and lost, it doesn't make them smarter than us because they could move some blocks around and put them together properly. the second a geologist moves a rock and robotic sentinels burst from the ground and things start glowing and the site starts vibrating, then I might think "yeah, these guys were really smart... but not smart enough to be not dead."
