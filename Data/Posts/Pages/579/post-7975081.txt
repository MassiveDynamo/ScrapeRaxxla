Or Atlantis?
Probably niether, but it sure as bio-waste wasn't built by nomadic hunter gatherers. Important to keep in mind about these structures is they show a firm grip on engineering that humans were not supposed to have in the estimated time period and since they can't carbon date rock, they're just guessing at dates.

Further, since a lot of them are precisely orientated to the cardinal directions (NEWS) and many also factor in major star constellations and celestial objects we've only 'officially' learned about in the recent past, there's a possibility humans were significantly smarter thousands of years ago than we are right now.

Some of these ancient structures simply cannot be replicated with current technology.

[Sacsayhuaman isn't the only place that exhibits this kind of precision radial geometry]
