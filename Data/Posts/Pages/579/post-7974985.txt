What What What!?

I've watched at least 5 separate documentaries where at least 6 different people have found Atlantis in 6 different areas. Are you saying that they were all wrong!?

Seriously though, all myths were made up at some point unless they are based on fact and even that may be inaccurate if no original source. If your grandparent tells you a story you may pass the same story on to your grandchild. You may make up a story that gets passed on as a truth then turned into fact. You may hear about something and make a story up to explain it and pass that on, blending fact and perception and the line gets lost.

Interestingly, original source material is often accurate through 10s if not 100s of generations in verbal heritage cultures. Think about it, verbal words are all you have to record your culture, your gonna be pretty specific about certain things and not exaggerate, its too important for that. Stories are something else and the 2 get confused.

Sometime mid or late last century a group of Westerners visited tribes and groups of hunter gatherer and similar cultures. One they visited was an Innuit tribe, who told a story passed down from their ancestors. It was about a group of Caucasian men who were observed in an ice-bound ship and then seen wandering in the ice generations ago, the Innuit knew they couldn't help them or feed them so had to leave them to die / fend for themselves. The Westerners who heard the story knew it was just a myth and for years it was ignored as just urban myth.

Years later it turns out that of course the story wasn't a story, it was the remnants of the Shackleton Expedition and was a factual account of what happened, passed down through the generations, accurately, verbally.
