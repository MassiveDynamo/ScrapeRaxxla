I am German so please forgive any incomgruities. In German it‘s Priesterkönig Johannes. Translation would be Presterking John or something like that. The problem I have with that part is that his kingdom never got a name. So finding Eldorado and Atlantis was fairly easy, but that part? Are we to look for Ekbatana, India, Bactria, Ethiopia?

IIRC, he was hinted at the end of "Marco Polo" season 2 somewhere halfway on the Silky Road.So, Ekbatana or Bactria.
But he also appeared in popular culture as a character connected with Nordic mythology.
