Awesome, that's a clean signal too, comparatively

I've been trying to composite an illustration of this shape together to see if it's anything useful. Let me ask you; look at the top point, I see something else there? Also the central circle seems to have divisions in it, those divisions also consistently appear, there's one at about 2 O'clock, a line that bisects the circle about 1/3 from the bottom?

What do you think?
Yes - thanks for pointing that out. Looking more carefully I had also seen that at the top of the triangle there appears to be a small circle with a vertical line in it from top to bottom - right down the middle. The line may have a slight bow in it.

In the circle inside the triangle, I see two horizontal lines that are only in the circle - such that the circle is divided into thirds. The spectrogram does have a lot of horizontal line characteristic throughout the recordings but, in the case of the circle, the two lines are more distinct and do not continue outside the circle. This makes me think they are unique. It is more distinct in the ship recordings versus the carrier jumps. The carrier jump recordings have a lot of other carrier noise and audio artistry to them so they are not as good (as clean) in my opinion.
