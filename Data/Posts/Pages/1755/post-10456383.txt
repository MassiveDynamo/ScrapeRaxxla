Yes that’s what Im getting at, it’s an obvious plot device, but this is a PEGI level game, the open promotion of drugs etc (especially through skins) etc although not overt, is an area where a company wanting to keep within that limit, might not want to necessarily endorse. It always struck me as odd.

I’m probably overthinking it. And that’s the problem with ED. There is very little consistency.

On this tack the codex might allude in its last couple of chapters a potential need for being allied, since it does discuss despots etc? But again these are two a penny in ED…

Ya i wondered why they didnt continue with dreamware - because i think it is a continuation of that storyline. I suspect it is like u pointed out - dragons.

Im suspecting their purpose was some sort of offering to the guardian of one of the “portals”. Possibly different offerings dependent on the portal being used - the upper portal for the sky/ lightning god lower portal for earth goddess. Hence the reason Lucas Byzantium got caught with al that Dreamware in imperial space (FFE)…. Lucan…
