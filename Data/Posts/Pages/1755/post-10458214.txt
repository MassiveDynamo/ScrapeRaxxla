A little lightbulb flickered in my head...

Raxxla has been suggested to be anything from an unremarkable moon to a state of cosmic enlightenment.
The earliest documented stories tend to agree on several points, however: that Raxxla is a definite place, and that it holds a mystical secret.
"A definite place" - the only way Raxxla can exist in the game is within a star system - via Stellar Forge.
"Anything" = this is telling us that anything about a system can be a candidate - or even a contextual clue to find it.

State of cosmic enlightenment - a system's STATE is defined by factors determined by the Stellar Forge, BGS etc.

Could this be a clue that Raxxla is hidden within a settled system??? and a state such as 'Elated' happiness could get us closer to revealing it?
Combined with the above concealment trickery, it could be hidden in the bubble very easily.
