Yes that’s what Im getting at, it’s an obvious plot device, but this is a PEGI level game, the open promotion of drugs etc (especially through skins) etc although not overt, is an area where a company wanting to keep within that limit, might not want to necessarily endorse. It always struck me as odd.

I’m probably overthinking it. And that’s the problem with ED. There is very little consistency. I’m more inclined to suspect Onionhead was another parallel environmental storyline, like the Far God cult etc, but probably dropped / due to some narrative / business changes, or just never fully exploited.

Panem Is in Kappa Fornacis, home to Dragons of Kappa Fornacis.

Dragons…

But again the Codex ought to be the key, there currently doesn’t seem to be any mention of mechanical aspects towards activation. As with Trinkets I suspect they ‘used’ to be involved but not are not a requirement. In my interpretation it mostly if not wholly locational.

On this tack the codex might allude in its last couple of chapters a potential need for being allied, since it does discuss despots etc? But again these are two a penny in ED…

There is 656 smaller factions with the name Dragon, in the title.
