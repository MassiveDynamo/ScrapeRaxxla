Could this be a clue that Raxxla is hidden within a settled system??? and a state such as 'Elated' happiness could get us closer to revealing it?
Happiness is a derived variable, so a requirement for Elated would mainly be a requirement for some combination of Boom/Investment + Civil Liberty + Public Holiday. Only the first three of those states existed when the Codex was published and Happiness introduced, and only the first two before that (with the pre-3.3 Investment being very different in both cause and effect to the current one, and also not in the original release of the BGS)

Combined with the above concealment trickery, it could be hidden in the bubble very easily.
It's certainly possible to get state-specific POIs (and always has been), but the Boom state is the most common possibility so wouldn't be a great concealment and all of the others [edit: the others involved in Elated, that is] can't have been the original way it was hidden.
