Wasn’t the BGS initially not an intended player game aspect?

I recall initially how players wanted to manipulate the BGS early on and FD were not keen upon it, they eventually relented on this and now it’s seen as generally acceptable, but I’m certain it initially was not intended to be interpreted as such?

Varuna's Pledge was deployed in Pemoeri as the Hodack Prison Colony's Gatekeeper megaship."

The only other messing about with the BGS by Frontier I can remember would be in Shin Dez to stop the Pilots' Federation losing control to the Dark Wheel
