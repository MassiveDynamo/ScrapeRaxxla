One might - but it’s doubtful.

Why is Onionhead in game? It’s a narcotic, and by discussing it FD are engaged in PEGI 18 themes?

It originated in the system of Panem, from the Latin "bread and circuses" used to describe entertainment capitalised to distract public attention from more important matters!

I think it has alot to do with Aldous Huxley (Heaven and Hell) and the connection of Hallucinogenics with IndoEuropean Soma -Norse Suttungs Mead... and Taliesin gains his abilities through ingesting three drops of a special brew... A somewhat dubious path to enlightenment

Remember in MBs book - the only mention of Raxxla is when she goes to Panem...
