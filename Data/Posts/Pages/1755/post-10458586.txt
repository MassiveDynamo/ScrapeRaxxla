Wasn’t the BGS initially not an intended player game aspect?

I recall initially how players wanted to manipulate the BGS early on and FD were not keen upon it, they eventually relented on this and now it’s seen as generally acceptable, but I’m certain it initially was not intended to be interpreted as such?
