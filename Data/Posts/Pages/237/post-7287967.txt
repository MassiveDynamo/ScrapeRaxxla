From A&S sonnet 20: "That sweet black which veils thye heavenly eye..."

Veil... VEIL NEBULAE! There's two: Veil east and Veil west. Anyone close by? See if you can find any other clues?

Veil nebula east is more red and is darker, fitting the "Red Porphir" from sonnet 9.

Addendum: The only system I see engulfed by the Veil east nebula is the Veil East sector RO-Q B5-2.

Just so happens thats where I am right now (logged out for festivities but will be there...soon).
