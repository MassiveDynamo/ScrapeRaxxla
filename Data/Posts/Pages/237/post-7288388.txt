Be sure to pay special attention to gas giants with >=8 moons. There are instances in game where you can only detect signals within a couple of light seconds (Zurara), so if you see a moon that fits the description given in the dark wheel codex entry, be sure to surface scan and get real close.

Roger that - currently back at work but if/when back here I'm going to give them everything, open/flybys etc.

On my travels I have noticed that close orbit signals do appear on the fss, although likewise even with full exploration modules additional bodies also sometimes ping up when you fly out of system. Not sure if that' bugged or intentional.

One thing that has always left me uncertain is what if Raxxlas bugged...what if we've already found it but cant see it due to some unknown flaw.

Never the less it's enough of an objective to make exploration tantalising again.
