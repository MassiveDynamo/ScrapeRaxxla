Just reviewing the zurara logs from Rebecca. Seems relatively clear the zurara is in the same boat as the other generation ships, backup locations to escape to in the event of a thargoid invasion of the bubble. There are only two interesting things of note if Raxxla and the thargoids/zurara have anything to do with each other. (Which they may not)
1. The zurara logs say they left beacons around EL/Terraformable worlds that so far as I’ve heard haven’t ever been found to actually exist yet.
2. Rebecca says that the answers to why and who are “back in the core(bubble), not out here” and she went straight from the zurara back to the bubble.

Considering how little of the galaxy has been discovered, if the quote of FD being surprised it hasn’t been found (without clues mind you) is real and refers to Raxxla then it must be closer to the bubble or a popular general area/destination. But that hinges on that quote being real.
