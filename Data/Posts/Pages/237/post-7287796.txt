The Cat's Eye nebula doesn't have a star on GalMap. Could this be a clue, somehow?

"As that sweet black which veils the heav'nly eye:"

I don't know about sweet black, but it's blue, and the star either isn't there on GalMap because you can't go there, or it is obscured - or hidden beyond a veil.

Just so I'm not crazy, is there any other place called "eye" in the galaxy?
