Couldnt keep away, logged quickly back in and a few jumps later...nope nothing, system already scanned and mapped, nothing weird here.

Going to map the nebula whilst I'm here, it seemed a likely candidate to me also, rule this one out.

Be sure to pay special attention to gas giants with >=8 moons. There are instances in game where you can only detect signals within a couple of light seconds (Zurara), so if you see a moon that fits the description given in the dark wheel codex entry, be sure to surface scan and get real close.
