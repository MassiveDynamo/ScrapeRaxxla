I've seen interesting features like that on plenty of occasions - but on investigation there's nothing significant.
I think it's shadows - sometimes they show up at altitude but kinda disappear as you get lower, maybe because they get smeared out.
I'm not poo-pooing the idea that R may be in an exotic system, and I hope we find one, regardless...Bt honestly, from a R perspective I think we may be better looking for a rouge system, rather than an exotic one. This seems to fit better with my interpretation of the "clues" (ducks to avoid people throwing "THERE WILL BE NO CLUES" in my general direction), such as 'Fernweh' and a place that isnt a place (it has no star). Just like exotic....we have a system classification, but no examples found to date.
