Real-life exotic stars are linked to exotic matter (mostly theoretical stuff). In-game exotic stars might include more things, such as Thorne-Zytkow objects (neutron stars trapped inside red giants) or the aforementioned black hole stars (or quasi stars, which are basically self-contained supernovae).
However, at this point I think Raxxla is just FD trolling. Like a giant literal easter egg space pinata with confetti floating when pew-pew'd.
