@PeteACarter: thanks for checking those Gap base sites. Still can’t understand how I didn’t see the terrain feature while I was landing at the Conflux site. Probably because I was landing! I’m guessing it was a video artefact since nobody else has reported anything.
Not going back to check!

I've seen interesting features like that on plenty of occasions - but on investigation there's nothing significant.
I think it's shadows - sometimes they show up at altitude but kinda disappear as you get lower, maybe because they get smeared out.
