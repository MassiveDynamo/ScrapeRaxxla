I'm curious what all is in exotic star class. Quasar or quark stars? What all else is there?
Well we don’t know, we don’t know what elite dangerous have added so I can’t say what they look like, but exotic stars emit special light frequencies that I believe could help identify them, right now Im still trying to identify areas and the frequencies they would emit in the game so I can find areas they might come from
