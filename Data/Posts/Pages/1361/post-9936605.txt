Mmm, it might have been relevant to “TDW hidden station” except we are told that was a wheeled station (orbis) not a coriolis.

I might believe it was related to Raxxla, simce it has similarities to the logo. But since we cant target anything by sound what they heck does that phrase mean?
Well, rethinking it I agree with @Rochester, it is probably just a joke about the missing feature in the sky (the Anomaly). So, they choose a transparent image because that fits with the message: "yes a fix was necessary to display the thing, but you weren't left out it is coming for you too". Orbis Coriolis, because why not... Probably not much to dig...
All messed up.
