Has anyone got a flight path of the stargoid?

Also is anyone in game able to use F F S to look at any black bit of space and see if they get a siren type noise through the system.
Hz does not affect the noise I'm getting and it just repeats like a helicopter flying over head.
See the dedicated thread for updates re the anomalyâ€™s flightpath

New red-orange dot approaching the bubble at 0.8ly per minute-- Thargoid mothership?
This happened pretty close to its expected arrival time at the system - so has it now stopped moving, or did it just get behind you to head off somewhere else? No, it hadn't passed. I'm a bit deaf and suffer with tinnitus so can make it out unfortunately. I'll never hear the coffee machine...
