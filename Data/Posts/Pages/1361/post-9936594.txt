Interpretation is open. The hidden message in the image is "Just because you can't see something doesn't mean it is not real".
Either a hint on how to search, or a mere confirmation that hidden things are very real..
Mmm, it might have been relevant to “TDW hidden station” except we are told that was a wheeled station (orbis) not a Coriolis as depicted.

I might believe it was related to Raxxla, simce it has similarities to the logo. But since we cant target anything by sound what they heck does that phrase mean?

Edit: yep, I agree with other comments. Think it’s FD hinting listen/decode sounds from the incoming “Was Far But A little Bit Nearer Now God”
