Interpretation is open. The hidden message in the image is "Just because you can't see something doesn't mean it is not real".
Either a hint on how to search, or a mere confirmation that hidden things are very real..
Interpretation is very open true, I’d assume however it’s more relevant to the current narrative and maybe not historical content, but nevertheless I feel they are stipulating there is sound content in game, which resolves somehow to a signal or code, likely this is found in the FSS.

At present the FSS doesn’t see the Thargod object but we can here it, so FD maybe just encouraging us to de-code it…

I’d like to think there is other content out there in the FSS, they did put a lot of work into the sound, eg utilising real astronomical noises for various planets based on real data, most players don’t hear that… point the FSS out of the system and there are various sounds to be made out, I often wondered if FD utilised this for hiding things in plain sight (hearing)…

I suspect the references are relevant to current narrative content.
