Has anyone got a flight path of the stargoid?

Also is anyone in game able to use F F S to look at any black bit of space and see if they get a siren type noise through the system.
Hz does not affect the noise I'm getting and it just repeats like a helicopter flying over head.
have you recently been doing engineering and not rebooted?
is there an industrial station or system in the path you are aimed at?
any traffic nearby?

jungleish watery noises from agri and earth likes and water worlds
mechanical noises like traffic and sirens from industrial systems or systems with a lot of unknown mechanical
I did notice the siren is different or at least more pronounced lately and seems to be more than one.
fwiw, imo night is better than boost or normal
