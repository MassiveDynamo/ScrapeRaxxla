Acknowledging this is total wackadoodle, no evidence whatsoever, just random unconscious brain sneeze caused by cheese dreams whilst reading Milton…

“To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!”

On the brow of the crystalline sphere, the sphere of Urania, the goddess of astronomy (of all stars) where Lucifer first walked upon during his journey he saw heavens gate, beset by blazing jewels and gems…upon the brow of the spheres…

Not from John Milton, but an interpretation (paraphrased) of the ‘Parallel Prose’ edition referenced my MB.

I need to stop reading Milton methinks.

Well, Ive wondered if the point of MB’s tattoo was to emphasise the journey to Eden/Paradise Lost & Regained (didnt Milton also write Paradise Regained?). The message being whatever journey/mythology you want, you end up at the destination....
Which would take me back to my Alpha Centauri/Eden hypothesis (search this thread); but I searched for comets in ACent last week (see my sheet) but couldnt detect any-however when I was out at Eden a year so so ago I kept seeing npc appear out of nowhere which on current form seems often to be comet positions. Is there a way the search method perhaps is not detecting all of them? Maybe a physical range limit within system?
