fwiw, I just made a recording with what sounds like a voice very bumpy, digitized(possibly mechanical aka translator) very noisy from where my ship is at the moment.
as in I am too far away and too many things are in between.
getting louder as it gets nearer.
seems like a conversation as well as something attempting communications by various shifts in audio range and speed and languages..
I do hope someone else is hearing these sounds...



starts and ends with a blip like a radio message might.
so far I can only make out what sounds like 'understand it'
first part slightly off, could be 'send it'

another sound follows shortly after
a groan I guess with either a lower volume one after that or an echo.
all in 5 minutes, no trinkets or anything. engines off

on the 7th I recorded too.
a lot of loud low deep groans , mostly slow mo and occasional other similar sound over or along with(real hard to tell)more sped up(more like a word)
near the end is what seems very clearly digitized 'Hello', followed by something too garbled.
again, 5 minutes

trinkets, engines off
seems the trinkets made the background quieter, especially compared to today's.
