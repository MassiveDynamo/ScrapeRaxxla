Actually, is this a hint to listen to signals from the corners of a dodecahdral station?? Are there antennae there? Usually I think station signals have been recorded from the docking bay homing lights

Edit: ah, checked the other thread-the anomaly visually disappeared. Part of the storyline, or a bug? (Pun accidental but intentional)
