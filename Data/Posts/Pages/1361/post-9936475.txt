Three suns, maybe a ternary system L, Y, T in the Crane constellation (Lyta Crane, where the remaining A refers to a planet orbiting the first star?), I take only the first three letters because a brown dwarf would not be gravitational centre for a main sequence A star, and the picture shows only three "stars" (if they are even stars)?
Here is my sheet for the Crane constellation (aka Gruis)

Constellations dont tend to contain L/Y/T primaries as they are too dark to see from earth.
