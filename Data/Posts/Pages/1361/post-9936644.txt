have you recently been doing engineering and not rebooted?
is there an industrial station or system in the path you are aimed at?
any traffic nearby?

No i was following some Egyptian star maps that lead me to a book from the 60s
I was trying various things and systems from it, landed in a system and using F F S i got some really odd noises, its possible that i was looking at the Stargoid, but i'm not 100% sure on my orientation and I'm at work now.
