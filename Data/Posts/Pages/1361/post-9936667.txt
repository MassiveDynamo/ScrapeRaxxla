Acknowledging this is total wackadoodle, no evidence whatsoever, just random unconscious brain sneeze caused by cheese dreams whilst reading Milton…

“To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!”

On the brow of the crystalline sphere, the sphere of Urania, the goddess of astronomy (of all stars) where Lucifer first walked upon during his journey he saw heavens gate, beset by blazing jewels and gems…upon the brow of the spheres…

Not from John Milton, but an interpretation (paraphrased) of the ‘Parallel Prose’ edition referenced my MB.

I need to stop reading Milton methinks.
