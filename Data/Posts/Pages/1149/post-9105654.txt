So, been poking around in Sol a bit. Am I correct in assuming all the bodies are already 100% mapped in the DSS? Has anyone tried remapping them with probes again (even though the map will show 100% complete from the start) to see if any new POIs come up? I'm sure someone has so I'm going to hold off trying that for now and see if I can play hide and seek with asteroids for a bit.

Tried it on a few bodies in Sol on my first visit many moons ago just in case, cant recall which ones specifically though and nothing new appeared, iirc I was just confused they were pre-mapped and wasn't sure what was going on so was just checking. Found out later why they were pre-mapped and never bothered again. Doubtful theres anything more to see though tbh.
