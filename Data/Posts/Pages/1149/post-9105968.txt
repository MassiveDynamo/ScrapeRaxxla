Ya- I get where you are coming from on this. We are all picking and choosing bits because Its very hard to come up with anything that fits the whole. My personal take on that was that he was responding to the direct question and not giving a broad sweeping statement. And "clues" meant just that - out of game "clues" like the filthy tweets they give (anti twitterite here). But I dont consider ingame or in text stuff on raxxla as "clues" in the same sense. They are part of the story in my mind and part of the in game "path" to finding it.... but ya that is my interpretation of it. Like you said earlier I would prefer the more "entertaining" route
MB “We did look at a story involving Raxxla, but felt that was a story that should be played out in game rather than as a novel.” ( https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-legacy.50320/post-2566545; https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/fdev-ed-relevant-quotes-videos.553526/#post-8671776 )

To be a story played out in game there must be an in-game storyline with clues. The fact that we haven’t found it/them may mean we’re looking in the wrong places. This is the frustrating thing about the disappearance of the SD missions, since they were the only thing that we have seen in-game that clearly related to Raxxla. Until we got the Codex, which doesn’t seem to help.
