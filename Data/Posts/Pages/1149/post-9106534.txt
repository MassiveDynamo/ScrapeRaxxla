Dunno, my mind is in free fall.

I know how you feel mate and am sorry to hear about the co-pawlot. Its heart-breaking to watch and know you can do nothing to help. My Sister gave me the best advice so Ill pass it on 'Dont give up until they have given up'. If they are still happy in themselves then they must be coping with it somehow, they are stronger than we are sometimes, but all we can do is watch and feel helpless.

On a lighter note one of mine is not able to go up the stairs anymore but still wants to laze up there in the sun so he just stands at the bottom of the stairs and 'WOOF!' until he gets carried up. We call it the 'Bark & Ride' service
