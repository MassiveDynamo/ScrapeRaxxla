I think Im overly concerned with spamming the same info on 2 threads but an update on the Asteroid FSS POI conundrum. Note it still didnt show the Hesperus in the belt and couldnt even tell if an FSS signal at all due to number of FCs in system, but this is from original Hesperus thread.

Just for future reference:

It seems that if there is something in a belt you now get 2 zooms from the base FSS, one showing the belt and the POI and then one more just showing the belt, but no signal showing other or human etc. If nothing there it just zooms straight into the belt. It might be a compromise and might be a solution for hard to find but not having to drop into every belt from SC. Might. Or it might be just these LP and these belts, more research and evidence needed.

Taurus LP is visible in the Asteroid Belt like a Res Site or an LP around a planet when first zoom
California LP the same
Perseus Dark LP the same (pics below of 2 zoom scenario)

And did we ever get a reason / official response why the SD missions stopped appearing? 1st time I went to SD I was expecting them as had accidentally learned they existed there but avoided any more info as spoilers so didn't know they'd been taken away again, quite disappointed at the time. Was it just another Gan Romero thing with people reading too much into it and 'wasting their time'?

And MB quote 'story played out in game' again hints its more than 'ta dah you found it'...or was an intention at some point to do it that way maybe.
