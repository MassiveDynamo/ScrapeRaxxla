Just an update .. beginning evidence gathering mission. Calculation of most likely coordinates is done. There are a total of 5 systems (often with multiple sets of 8 moons of unnamed gas giants) on either end of the line between Astrophil and Stella (and we may be dealing with a "so as above so below scenario). As of now, the information is being kept strictly TOP SECRET until theory validation is completed but will be revealed to everyone once this phase is completed (this is because this zone of possibility is based on 5-6 systems averaged that are all in close proximity - the calculations are not easy and this still produced a very small target zone with which to find candidates in that zone). Even if part of this is wrong, we have a framework that produces a 40 LY bubble of possibility and this can be rapidly redeployed to test theories. This is based on hard evidence with direct ties to the codexes, galnet, and other in-game sources. Everything had to match and for anything to be included it had to survive multiple rounds of falsification attempts or see if it stood up to alternative explanations. This is real folks.
Basically the point of this test is validate whether Delphi System is the axis point to find Raxxla or not. There are indications Delphi System is a giant red herring such as the following:
-System name changed
-Tau Ceti became self sufficient as 2159
-Mars Artifact discovery 2280
-Multiple terraformed bodies closer to Sol than Tau Ceti suggest the who region was busy with terraforming and mining and other industrial projects related to terraforming and settlement during this time.

It is therefore a strong possibility this will just prove whether or Delphi is correct or red herring. If it is a red herring, the next best candidate for axis point between Astrophil and Stella is probably Sol (though open to suggestions here).
