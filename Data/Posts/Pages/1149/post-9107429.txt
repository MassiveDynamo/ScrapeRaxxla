Just an update .. beginning evidence gathering mission. Calculation of most likely coordinates is done. There are a total of 5 systems (often with multiple sets of 8 moons of unnamed gas giants) on either end of the line between Astrophil and Stella (and we may be dealing with a "so as above so below scenario). As of now, the information is being kept strictly TOP SECRET until theory validation is completed but will be revealed to everyone once this phase is completed (this is because this zone of possibility is based on 5-6 systems averaged that are all in close proximity - the calculations are not easy and this still produced a very small target zone with which to find candidates in that zone). Even if part of this is wrong, we have a framework that produces a 40 LY bubble of possibility and this can be rapidly redeployed to test theories. This is based on hard evidence with direct ties to the codexes, galnet, and other in-game sources. Everything had to match and for anything to be included it had to survive multiple rounds of falsification attempts or see if it stood up to alternative explanations. This is real folks.
If you have a "so as above so below scenario", keep an eye on your jumponium. You dont want to get stuck above nowhere.
