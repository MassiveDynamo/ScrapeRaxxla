If you have a "so as above so below scenario", keep an eye on your jumponium. You dont want to get stuck above nowhere.
I will definitely be stocking up on jumponium material. Also, see my other post about what this is intending to either validate or falsify. By the way, I intend to share EVERYTHING once we know what what this means and next steps. The way I see if we can start a rapid fire validation / falsification process since there are some known connections.
