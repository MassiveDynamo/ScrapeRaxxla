Yes, things may well have changed since MB’s statements; everything else seems to have changed, which makes a nonsense of the “MB said no clues so there can be NO clues!!” whine. No, I don’t think we ever got a satisfactory FD explanation of the SD missions. Some responses seemed to say they should still be in game, others “no comment” (which says something!), others were going to check....nobody really seemed to say anything at all about them. The “no comment” I find interesting; to me it implies the subject matter is Raxxla-related, so there must be some form of storyline leading to it. Perhaps the SD missions were either too obvious or, to my mind more likely, that they were obfuscations put out by SD TDW and it’s their role to obfuscate things so the missions were red herrings.

Dunno, my mind is in free fall. Dog seizure at 2am, cat crying to go out at 5:30, then another dog seizure at 9. Need more coffee!! No DIY today methinks! Might even fire up the PC and do some flying. I’ve managed to achieve 30 minutes of EDO alpha testing to date, and having just watched OA’s vid I’m not even minded to try the xenobology “mini game” (FD please note - game’s are supposed to be interesting and entertaining!!). Might have a trip out to Adamastor & Hesperus & the LPs to try and catch up on that storyline ready for the next instalment.
