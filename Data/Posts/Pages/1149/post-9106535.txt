Hope the hound is OK. I have an elderly Border Collie (11) who has a growing list of health issues but still thinks he is 3, so know all about the worries.
Thanks! He seems fine now. Usually takes half an hour for him to recover properly. Now he's giving me black looks (difficult for a choccy lab!) as wants his lunch!!
He's on phenobarbital so is going slow now walks like an old man, though he's only 4 1/2.
But I definitely need more coffee!!!!!!!!!!
