"Hey Mark, load the intern into a dev account and have him grab a screenie of the dark wheel station." seems a lot easier than "Oi Mark, 'ave the art team build a one off station assest and model it in front of a small moon and big faffing star."

Very funny and probably more likely.

Good comments. Thanks
