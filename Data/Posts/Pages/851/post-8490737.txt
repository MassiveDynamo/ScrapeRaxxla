In my understanding, the DarkWheel home system and hidden station is a Brown Dwarf star somewhat close to Sol but not visible in the Galaxy Map... this would make it "Unnamed" and most likely would require a player to actually fly there in SC until it shows up on the left-side panel so you could hyper jump there.

NASA estimates about several of such Brown Dwarf star systems close by

and there's Michael Brooks mentioning "dark" stellar bodies/systems being added to the game and I have no news on if any of those were already found.
