Regarding the use of “unnamed” in reference to the gas giant. Is that FDEV being disingenuous or just very clever word usage. I first read it as unnamed gas giant as in the referred to gas giant doesn’t have a name. But can it not also be read as - I choose not to give you the name….leaving it unnamed in the context of the clue….whilst it actually still might have a name?

I’ll try to learn about parallax.

Would the time TRITON became permit locked roughly coincide with the time the CODEX entry on THE DARK WHEEL was provided, or has the CODEX entry been in the game since the very start?

Again I appreciate the comments.

The unnamed gas giant. I have always read it as the name was not given. Never occurred to me that the gas giant might not have a name. Lol. Funny how people read things differently.

Regarding Triton - I had similar thoughts. Spent ages becoming an ally of Mother Gia and every other faction in Sol. Didn't unlock anything, but I am only double elite. When I get back to the bubble I might grind out my combat ranks and head back to Sol.

I have some other Sol theories as well. One regarding the Martin artifact. One regarding the brightest asteroid in Sol which I'm yet to locate in game. The final regarding Sue, Cripple and Sneer (but that will require space legs!)
