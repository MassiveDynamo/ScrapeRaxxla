It’s a bit tricky to get the station name, after they(TS) also started to scan ships. The morse message changes when you are within 1000m of the TS.
If you want the station name, you need someone else to drop the TS.
If you drop it your self, you imediately get the ‘Ship scan detected’ message and will not get the station or planet name.
