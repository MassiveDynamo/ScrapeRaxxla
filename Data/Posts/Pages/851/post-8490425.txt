Great work and a compelling read, CMDR. However, a I think it has a few holes in it. One, it assumes disinformation on the part of Pilots' Federation (FDev). The Codex says "unnamed gas giant." So either the journalist is wrong or FDev as being disingenuous. As to the station actually orbited Neptune, you are correct in that it wouldn't be detectable by the FSS but it would be by parallax. And so many CMDR's have been in and around that area, someone should have spotted it, I would think. Also, Triton hasn't always been permit locked. Prior to a few years ago it was a landable planet. The reason for the permit lock was, however, never explained.

Regarding the use of “unnamed” in reference to the gas giant. Is that FDEV being disingenuous or just very clever word usage. I first read it as unnamed gas giant as in the referred to gas giant doesn’t have a name. But can it not also be read as - I choose not to give you the name….leaving it unnamed in the context of the clue….whilst it actually still might have a name?

I’ll try to learn about parallax.

Would the time TRITON became permit locked roughly coincide with the time the CODEX entry on THE DARK WHEEL was provided, or has the CODEX entry been in the game since the very start?

Again I appreciate the comments.
