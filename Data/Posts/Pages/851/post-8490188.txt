Thargoid Sensor (TS) is the updated name for the Unknown Atifact (UA).
Also, there's an old post from Michael Brooks saying that we've only scratched the surface regarding understanding the TS. This was mentioned after the "have you listened to it" and people came up with the pictogram from sound spectograph via Audacity...

So, yeah... I still think there's more to it

hhmmm..... intereting.... need a corrosive cargo hold now.... hmm.... ive had theories involving the thargoid items... time to start investigating.....
