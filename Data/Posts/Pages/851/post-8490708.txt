The unnamed gas giant. I have always read it as the name was not given. Never occurred to me that the gas giant might not have a name. Lol. Funny how people read things differently.

Regarding Triton - I had similar thoughts. Spent ages becoming an ally of Mother Gia and every other faction in Sol. Didn't unlock anything, but I am only double elite. When I get back to the bubble I might grind out my combat ranks and head back to Sol.

I have some other Sol theories as well. One regarding the Martin artifact. One regarding the brightest asteroid in Sol which I'm yet to locate in game. The final regarding Sue, Cripple and Sneer (but that will require space legs!)

It is funny how different people read things differently. I've always read it as the gas giant doesn't have a name. It wasn't until this past Sunday, that I gave it a thought that it might refer to the other as well....i.e. I choose not to tell you the name (even though it has one).

I'm about 3 weeks from triple Elite after I'm done farming Thargoid scouts in the Pleiades, so I might have a go at MOTHER GAIA after that. Can't hurt right?
