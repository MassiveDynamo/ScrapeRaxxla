Triton is a Dev used location... I know the link is to a closed thread, but its true none the less...

SPOILER: SPOILER

EDIT: As far as I know, its been locked since they started work on atmos landings, and its just been locked since... in my opinion, its most likely still used as a final tessting place for new game assets, possibley things like SRV and Fighter testing, before releasing them live into the servers for all of us....

Its also said in a few places that Fdev locked it for a future season of content, that it has cryo-volcanism (basically water/ice geysers) and it might be a testing area for large geysers like full sized volcanoes that might never be used in game becuase they were found unfesable...

Somebody is optimistic.
