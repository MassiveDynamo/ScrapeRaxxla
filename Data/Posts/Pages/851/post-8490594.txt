Random question number 2 - does anybody know if the mention of Raxxla in game "since the end of beta" is legit? I've not directly seen it, but dont know if its indirect, given the timing of DBs "of course it is" comment? There are often comments about it being there before Horizons

Anyway - if it is legit, would this tie in with Triton becoming permit locked??
