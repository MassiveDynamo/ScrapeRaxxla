It is funny how different people read things differently. I've always read it as the gas giant doesn't have a name. It wasn't until this past Sunday, that I gave it a thought that it might refer to the other as well....i.e. I choose not to tell you the name (even though it has one).

I'm about 3 weeks from triple Elite after I'm done farming Thargoid scouts in the Pleiades, so I might have a go at MOTHER GAIA after that. Can't hurt right?
I personally have read it both ways and have kept an open mind to the possibilities of either. Ive always been the type to trust what people say less than completely
