Just trying to passively analyse the codex without overthinking it, sometimes this can identify very obvious associations normally we ignore outright.

Here the search: ‘gateway to parallel universes story’ identified the Wiki text:

Fiction has long borrowed an idea of "another world" from myth, legend and religion. Heaven, Hell, Olympus, and Valhallaare all "alternative universes" different from the familiar material realm. Plato reflected deeply on the parallel realities, resulting in Platonism, in which the upper reality is perfect while the lower earthly reality is an imperfect shadow of the heavenly.

The Codex could simply be stating the obvious in some aspects, or reinforcing the meaning behind other segments, eg this concept of an ‘Otherworld’ and the Miltonian Universe in game? Brookes As above, So below universe, built from the carcasses of Older gods..

You should probably read the following:

Otherworld - Wikipedia

Oneironautics - Wikipedia

There's a reason Dream-ware, Insight, and Insight Entertainment Suite are a thing. There are places in Bubble and elsewhere where "reality" is porous. I'd encourage looking into "Sargasso Sea of Space".

On a less-metaphysical note and back to Milton: Tree of Life is the taller of the two trees. Tree of Knowledge is shorter. There are places names in Paradise Lost mapping to systems. I believe the grotto where the trees are located is walled and hard to get into. Those connections need to be looked into further. Also, the Otherworld entry mentioned a Persian heavenly bridge named Chinvat.
