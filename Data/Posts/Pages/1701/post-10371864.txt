Hm, the description explicitly draws attention to the star's asteroid belt. Of course, the sheer size of it makes finding something there near-impossible if we have to rely on Mk. I Eyeball alone...
In any case, it'd be very funny if Raxxla was next door to ShinDez - and thus packed with fleet carriers! - all along.

Forget the planet remains, I'm more interested in who this powerful crime family is. Anyone of significance in the lore?
The idea of a gateway to the underworld could also relate to shady underworld figures in the lore. People or organisations that may be symbolic of 'evil' in mythology.

Assuming the Dark Wheel is still active, they would logically utilise the underworld just as much as they would "shape-change" to infiltrate places of power. The fact that Freeholm is a close neighbour to the source of Onionhead is not lost on me. How that lore has played out could shine a light on something.
