Don't know if this was mentioned, I was absent for 10 years

First ever mention of Raxxla.
Event at Leesti.
There are more, on later pages.



from Commodore C64 Manual: Elite (1985)

and here Ian Bell mentions it "I don't know. The missions vary across the platforms. There is no Raxxla functionality in the 6502 versions AFAICR."
Recollection

Maybe it would be worth it to dig through the ancient coding of BBC/C64 original Elite
