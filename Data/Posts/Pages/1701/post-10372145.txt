Just trying to passively analyse the codex without overthinking it, sometimes this can identify very obvious associations normally we ignore outright.

Here the search: ‘gateway to parallel universes story in fiction’ identified the Wiki text:

Fiction has long borrowed an idea of "another world" from myth, legend and religion. Heaven, Hell, Olympus, and Valhallaare all "alternative universes" different from the familiar material realm. Plato reflected deeply on the parallel realities, resulting in Platonism, in which the upper reality is perfect while the lower earthly reality is an imperfect shadow of the heavenly.

The Codex could simply be stating the obvious in some aspects, or reinforcing the meaning behind other segments, the description of a story about gateways might just be a reflection in the codex of the previous statement about Lost Realms, eg Paradises like Atlantis etc, then the wider ‘Otherworlds’ of Holdstock and the Miltonian Universe in game?

Or Brookes ‘As above, So below’ universe, built from the carcasses of Older gods.. or some actual fictional story involving travel to an alternate dimension, but if we presume it’s Brooke’s child’s story involving Dragons, a Princess, a prince and spiralling stars?

It might not be telling us anything specific, in some segments, but certainly reflecting upon the wider aspects of the overarching design?

Oh there I go….
