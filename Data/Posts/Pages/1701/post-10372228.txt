Also, Elite's Universe contains something that is tantamount to Marvel's Darkhold: the first manual. It is worth noting that, Alioth didn't become Alioth officially until June 30th, 2016. Alioth is named because of the Elite series and Marvel Universe. In that Universe, Alioth is devourer of time itself.

Alioth has been one of the names of Epsilon Ursae Majoris for a very long time it derives from the Arabic star names - something about a sheeps tail.

Disney stealing the Necronomicon and giving it a silly name howeverâ€¦
