A meta-discussion using ChatGPT:

? How would one organize this thread https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253 in sub-categories/theories for easier perusal?

ChatGPT:
Organizing a thread like "The Quest to Find Raxxla" into sub-categories and theories for easier perusal can greatly enhance its accessibility and usefulness. Here's a suggestion on how you could organize it:























Whew, sounds like a lot of work if doing this from scratch. I'd much rather just fly my ship tbh

I love this thread, it documents many skeins of thought and theory, contains much humour, and not a little eccentricity (an honourable English trait, I believe many eccentrics live in Cambridge!). IMO anyone who hasn't got the stamina to catch up on 1700+ pages is unlikely to have the stamina to be a successful Questor ().

If you were to undertake such a course of action then I would recommend renaming this thread to "The Original and Best Quest to find Raxxla" and create an alternate thread, organised as per your post, but entitled "The Game of Lazy Bones questing for Raxxla"
