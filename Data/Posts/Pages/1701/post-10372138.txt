Well, no intensions of re-organizing the thread, merely thoughts on adding a 'metadata' layer on top.

Also I haven't seen any Lazy Bones in this thread (yet)

Edit: Could be nice if a poster could tag a post from a list of tags. @PhilWeeks ?
"Lazy bones" was the only rhyme I could think of for "Thrones"!
( I'm no poet!!)
