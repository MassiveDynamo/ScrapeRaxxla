Do you happen to have the list of which names are used still?

I didn't see any obvious clumping for the Greek ones besides the general "deities only seem to appear 45-85 LY from Sol" restriction, but it'd be good to do some more thorough checks.
I haven't done any systematic checks but from what I can see, all the Motif-index lists have been used.
The main western religions Greek, Norse and Egyptian are best represented, but the clumping is easier to see when you get hits on the less represented religions.
Many deities are listed in several categories. I suspect all the data was pulled and put in one big mythology list, that was washed for duplicates and strange characters, before import.
Similar list have probably existed for Science figures, astronomy, literature and historical characters.
