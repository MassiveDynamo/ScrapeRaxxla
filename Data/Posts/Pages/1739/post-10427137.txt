I checked on nearby Antares and that wasn't the case... maybe not always?
Well now I'm doubting myself. I don't know if there's certain conditions that cause that or if it's a bug that sometimes happens, I've seen it plenty of times though over the years and it's been discussed before so it's at least somewhat 'normal' ??!..?
