The description of "a dysfunctional family of adopted superhero siblings with bizarre powers attempting both to save the world and find their place within it" has a very Legacy vibe to it

Was the logo symbology present in the comic Volumes 1-3? Those were release prior to 2014 and that's the only way I can think it would have any influence because the TV show commenced in 2019 - well after ED release.
