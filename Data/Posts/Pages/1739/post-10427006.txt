Systems that have more than one star, when you zoon in and select them as you have here, will split apart and show you some of the other stars, but they aren't selectable since you can only lock onto the primary and Galmap is more of a navigation software system.

Yup that’s it in a nut shell

There are also stars that are totally separate and unselective because they’re an artifac of a redundant duplicate catalog.
