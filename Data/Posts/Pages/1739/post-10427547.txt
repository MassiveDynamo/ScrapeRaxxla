have we (community) got any closer yet?
It's very hard to say. I guess we've definitely found a few more combinations of location+action which don't reveal Raxxla, which technically reduces the potential space for it to be, which might be considered "getting closer" if you really need some good news.

The tricky thing as always is that "a course of thinking/action which is on the right lines but incomplete" and "making up a giant theory that it will eventually turn out has nothing to do with the answer" both look the same for now.
