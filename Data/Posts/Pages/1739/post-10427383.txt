Anyone watch the Umbrella Academy....ok ok hear me out please, The Televator, My Fiance had seen the logo on my computer and asked why I had a logo of a show I said i didnt like..... look at the garden outside of it the shape is an exact replica of our Raxxla logo, in the new season of the tv show a scene shows it exactly overhead with the statue head being center.....the Logo is perfect, correct and exact!

Now look at the description of the Televator:

In the comics, the Televator was invented by Sir Reginald Hargreeves as an elevator lift that allows the team to travel in time, space and even other dimensions. While the Netflix series does most of its time travel thanks to the Commission's briefcases or Five's abilities, the comic uses the Televator for such exploits.


Now i Know This show and the comics are much newer than Elite Lore however The greenish hue, the exact logo shape, the description...where did this idea come from? if we could figure out where the writers of this show/comic got the inspiration could it be related? the logo, color and references of space, time and universal travel are a bit to coincidental.

Its Crazy...Its Thinfoil.....but its to matching to miss out putting here
