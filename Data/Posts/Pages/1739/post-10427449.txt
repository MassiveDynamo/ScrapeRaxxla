The Tionisla Graveyard:

The first thing you see is a shimmering, silver disc, a double spiral of tiny bright points. It slowly turns: it's a galaxy in miniature, with the same intense blur of light at its centre, because here is where the biggest tombs are to be found.

SPOILER: A SUSPICION

Come closer and soon you can see that the stars in this galaxy are markers...

Oh and there is some real Grail Quest and Golden Fleece stuff going on in FE2 and FFE (ya its been said before - I will go into detail at some point but its late...) - well it got me on to Preiddeu Annwfn (think MBs Drabble...) and Annwn and its king Arawn. Well at any rate if you take the story "The spoils of Annwyfn" - You have King Arthur going off into the Otherworld/Underworld. The interesting stuff is the Cauldron. Pearls around its Rim... And it will not work for a coward... (need to be an elite combateer i imagine). There is a prisoner held deep within the fortress.. since we are melding myths here - I imagine the Holdstock version also has Ariadne Dionysus and the Labrynth (and dont forget Asterion..well a Lovecraftian version) . I really need to read Keltica... I have been trying to find Pearl references for Raxxla for a while - I think that Ariadnes Crown and Arwans Cauldron fit the bill.
Ya there are some systems to check out including Annwn, Ennead and Labrynth to name a few.... But I have high hopes for Witches Reach!
