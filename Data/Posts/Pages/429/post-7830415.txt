Ot of interest, if you believe there is no starting point other than search every system, then why are YOU wasting YOUR time on a Raxxla thread? Just trolling?

I believe there are things that commanders need to do in order to 'unlock' (not necessarily talking about a permit here) Raxxla. I'm on this thread to see whether anyone has any ideas of what those things might be - you know, like the old Dark Wheel missions.
I don't believe there is an easter egg hunt launched from a clue in information released 4 years after Raxxla was added to the game.
