It down to interpretation. I interpret "There will be no clues" as in....This will be nothing like the rift mystery. There will be no in-game beacons telling us to "go here, go there". The codex gives us clues, in some way or another. If it doesn't, then we might as well close this thread and go back to hauling freight between systems

I am not suggesting that a simple cypher will be the answer. I am wondering if a simple cypher will give us a piece of thread to pull.

The thing is, the Codex arrived in 3.3, but Raxxla has been in-game since gamma - so whatever the mechanism for finding Raxxla is doesn't require the information from the Codex. Therefore, anything in the Codex that is intended to assist in finding Raxxla - anything that gives us a thread to pull - is by definition a clue.
