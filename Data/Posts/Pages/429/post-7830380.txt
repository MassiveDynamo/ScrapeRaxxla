It down to interpretation. I interpret "There will be no clues" as in....This will be nothing like the rift mystery. There will be no in-game beacons telling us to "go here, go there". The codex gives us clues, in some way or another. If it doesn't, then we might as well close this thread and go back to hauling freight between systems

I am not suggesting that a simple cypher will be the answer. I am wondering if a simple cypher will give us a piece of thread to pull.
This thread and our collective efforts MUST work on the following principles:

Raxxla exists (confirmed)
Raxxla can be discovered
Raxxla is a complex, multi-step puzzle, there is not just a random planet in the middle of the void that can be stumbled across by accident, on somebody 3 weeks into the game.

Otherwise, whats the point?

The "cypher is the start" theory may be right, or it may be wrong, just like smallest(all, all-1) of the theories on this thread. But isn't wisdom of the masses, and bouncing ideas off each other, the whole idea of the last 43x pages?
