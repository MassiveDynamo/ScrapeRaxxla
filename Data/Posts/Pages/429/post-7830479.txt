This thread and our collective efforts MUST work on the following principles:

Raxxla exists (confirmed)
Raxxla can be discovered
Raxxla is a complex, multi-step puzzle, there is not just a random planet in the middle of the void that can be stumbled across by accident, on somebody 3 weeks into the game.

Otherwise, whats the point?

The "cypher is the start" theory may be right, or it may be wrong, just like smallest(all, all-1) of the theories on this thread. But isn't wisdom of the masses, and bouncing ideas off each other, the whole idea of the last 43x pages?

Get someone from FDev to say Raxxla is currently in the game and can be found. I think Raxxla is a hoax to keep players playing the game.
