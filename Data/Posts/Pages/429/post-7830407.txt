If the codex was not intended to give us a starting point, then why add it?
It was added because it's not a puzzle if you don't have a starting point....its a go and search 400 billion systems...Good luck.

Once again, if there is not a staring point then this entire thread (and the game) are a total waste of eveybodies personal investment and Fdev have badly let us down. I rather not believe that. I rather keep having fun

The Raxxla Codex entry is (imo) simply to introduce new players to the existence of the mystery - in the same way that it introduces them to the existence of the Thargoids and Guardians.
