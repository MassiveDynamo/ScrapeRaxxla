Raxxla exists (confirmed)
Raxxla can be discovered
Raxxla is a complex, multi-step puzzle, there is not just a random planet in the middle of the void that can be stumbled across by accident, on somebody 3 weeks into the game.

I'm not convinced that point 3 is necessarily true - nothing that FDev have said has indicated that there is a 'multi-step puzzle' involved in finding Raxxla (and indeed 'There will be no clues' suggests that it isn't). That's not to say there aren't requirements that need to be met in order for a player to find Raxxla, but I don't expect meeting any of those requirements to trigger a message saying "Congratulations, you're one step closer to Raxxla" - at least until ALL the requirements have been met.
