The Raxxla Codex entry is a list of cryptic clues, because that's all we've ever had about Raxxla - and it explicitly states that everything is just rumors.

Here's two questions for you to answer:

1. Why add clues in v3.3 and not previously?
2. How will people running a localized version of ED decode an encrypted clue when the text is completely different?
1. Because in 3.3 they were "ready" for us to find it
2. Well Fernweh is a Germanic word lol. How will we ever find it if we use Wanderlust as the key?

I would like to go back to enjoying myself now thank you. I don't know if the ignore button works in threads, but I'll give it a go
