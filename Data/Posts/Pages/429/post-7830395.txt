The thing is, the Codex arrived in 3.3, but Raxxla has been in-game since gamma - so whatever the mechanism for finding Raxxla is doesn't require the information from the Codex. Therefore, anything in the Codex that is intended to assist in finding Raxxla - anything that gives us a thread to pull - is by definition a clue.
If the codex was not intended to give us a starting point, then why add it?
It was added because it's not a puzzle if you don't have a starting point....its a go and search 400 billion systems...Good luck.

Once again, if there is not a staring point then this entire thread (and the game) are a total waste of eveybodies personal investment and Fdev have badly let us down. I rather not believe that. I rather keep having fun
