The Raxxla Codex entry is a list of cryptic clues, because that's all we've ever had about Raxxla - and it explicitly states that everything is just rumors.

Here's two questions for you to answer:

1. Why add clues in v3.3 and not previously?
2. How will people running a localized version of ED decode an encrypted clue when the text is completely different?

1. to keep us searching
1.1 to give 'no' clues

2. because it's not meant to be nitpicked to infinity but to give a framework (history of myth, ties to TDW, anecdotal evidence and rumored content) -> all of this will work regardless of localization
