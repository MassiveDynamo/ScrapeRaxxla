There is a big difference. Guardian/thargoid entries not written as cryptic clues. I assume you think the DW codex entry is fluff also?

Again, that's fine. I have no issue with different opinions. I just don't understand why you would be on a Raxxla thread. I don't believe in ghosts...so guess what...I don't participate in ghost hunting forums. I don't go trolling their boards and telling them it's all a big waste of time.

The Raxxla Codex entry is a list of cryptic clues, because that's all we've ever had about Raxxla - and it explicitly states that everything is just rumors.

Here's two questions for you to answer:

1. Why add clues in v3.3 and not previously?
2. How will people running a localized version of ED decode an encrypted clue when the text is completely different?
