If the codex was not intended to give us a starting point, then why add it?
It was added because it's not a puzzle if you don't have a starting point....its a go and search 400 billion systems...Good luck.

Once again, if there is not a staring point then this entire thread (and the game) are a total waste of eveybodies personal investment and Fdev have badly let us down. I rather not believe that. I rather keep having fun
Ot of interest, if you believe there is no starting point other than search every system, then why are YOU wasting YOUR time on a Raxxla thread? Just trolling?
