The Raxxla Codex entry is (imo) simply to introduce new players to the existence of the mystery - in the same way that it introduces them to the existence of the Thargoids and Guardians.
There is a big difference. Guardian/thargoid entries not written as cryptic clues. I assume you think the DW codex entry is fluff also?

Again, that's fine. I have no issue with different opinions. I just don't understand why you would be on a Raxxla thread. I don't believe in ghosts...so guess what...I don't participate in ghost hunting forums. I don't go trolling their boards and telling them it's all a big waste of time.
