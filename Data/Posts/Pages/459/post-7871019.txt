It's a photograph of a 300 year old wrinkled page of moveable type, that you're comparing one letter of to a formatting error in a joke email sent by FDev QA team in response to a joke bug report, before any reference to a different poem was added to the Codex (iirc).

I think you're reading too much into it.

It's of course far fetched. The main reason the poem interesting is the use of the word 'Astrophel'. The word is basically never used, except in this poem and in literature about the poem or Sir. P. S.
