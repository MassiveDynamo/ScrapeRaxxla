Maybe the clue we're looking for, in regards to our Astrophel, is the "Princess" part. In the original poem Astrophel (or Astrophil) is a reference to the author, Phillip Sydney. Astrophil means "Star Lover". Perhaps "Princess" is meant to point us toward a female star Lover. Caroline Herschel? Hypatia?
