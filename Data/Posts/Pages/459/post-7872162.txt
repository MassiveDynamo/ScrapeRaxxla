As fernweh seems to be floating on the collective subconscious again, here's a thought I don't believe has been brought up .

Fernweh backwards is Hewn Ref.
Maybe Hewn Reef?

Hewn usually refers to wood carved furniture like chainsaw art or a log cabin, hewn from raw materials.

Coud Raxxla then be a hewn system?

A system hacked and engineered to perform as a machine, perhaps with something like a gravitic lagrange point, or negative void at a focus of the engineered system, something along those lines. Don't want to wander too far over the what if logic cliff but I'm sure there's one virgin with 72 bazookas.

However this does satisfy the original clues of a place that's not a place, a door that's also the key.

This is really for orbital math nerds of which I am not.
Universe Sandbox is fun to play with and can plug in ED info and see what happens.

Fud 4 thot.
