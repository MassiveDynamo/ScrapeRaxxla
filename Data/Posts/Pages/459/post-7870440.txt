Ok, so Astrophel is a synonym of astrofell, which is from the Greek Aster. In Sol's main belt, there should be 1218 Aster. This is interesting as Sol is the home of humanity. Home is a place that is also a place.

In ED, we also have Aster in Ross 154, which is missing its rings.

We also have Aster Trees, which have only ever been discovered in Cliewoae sector, which is in the Abyss - The darkest void...
The name confusion is mentioned in a section of the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophel_and_Stella

Personally I'm most intrigued by the actual title page (second edition. Not first, as I said in the previous post)
SPOILER

There are a few interesting bits.

Stella is written STELLA, just like planet was written PLANET (last letter in italic) in the letter where UC denies any knowledge of Raxxla.
The sentence 'Well in the Ring there is the Ruby sett, Where comly shape, & vertue both are mett', is about a jewel on top of a ring.
There is also a Greek text that I haven't translated, but it seem to be a quote from Symposium by Xenophon.

A bit of text on the bottom is hidden.
