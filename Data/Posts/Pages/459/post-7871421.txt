Sumarizing, i ran into a tip about a ship, and when i got there, it gave me random fragments that leads me to believe they were talking about raxxla.
So a im atm heading to what i hope is true and ill revendevous with a ship in SAGI A, and hopefully that will lead me to another tip... Or a dead end... Lets see...

This all came from doing a job for the dark wheel in Jameson, in this case taking a passenger...

Havent been this excited about a game event since february when i went on my 1st real exploration trip out.

I’m on my way back to the bubble after a dark wheel passenger mission to Colonia. I’ve been getting the same vibe. I will join you once I’m done and unpacked my deep space DBX.
