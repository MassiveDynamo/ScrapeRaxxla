If our schedules are compatible will gladly have your company.
ATM kinda sidetracked, hitting some undiscovered systems with lots of bodies, and playing tag... ke ke ke if i have to do the trip, i might as well take something out of it.

I know what you mean. My 4 hour trip to Colonia turned into 3 days. Luckily my passengers were explorers so didnâ€™t mind.
