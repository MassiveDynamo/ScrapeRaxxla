As fernweh seems to be floating on the collective subconscious again, here's a thought I don't believe has been brought up .

Fernweh backwards is Hewn Ref.
Maybe Hewn Reef?

Hewn usually refers to wood carved furniture like chainsaw art or a log cabin, hewn from raw materials.

Coud Raxxla then be a hewn system?

A system hacked and engineered to perform as a machine, perhaps with something like a gravitic lagrange point, or negative void at a focus of the engineered system, something along those lines. Don't want to wander too far over the what if logic cliff but I'm sure there's one virgin with 72 .

However this does satisfy the original clues of a place that's not a place, a door that's also the key.

This is really for orbital math nerds of which I am not.
is fun to play with and can plug in ED info and see what happens.

Fud 4 thot.

A planet that's a machine......wonder if it is trying to calculate the question to the answer 42?
