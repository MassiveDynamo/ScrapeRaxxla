If you compare the 'L's in 'Stella' with the one in 'Astrophel' you'll see that the whole of 'STELLA' is written in italics, not just the 'A'.
Good catch. Movable type from the era when that was printed had a lot of idiosyncrasies that go misunderstood in the modern era. Example: English still used the letter ᚦ to represent the sound "th" but the type cases (actual luggage like cases used to hold the moveable type blocks) that came from continental Europe excluded the letter so English printer substituted an uppercase Y for ᚦ. This when you see a sign that reads "Ye Olde Book Shoppe" it would be prounounced as "The Old Book Shop".
