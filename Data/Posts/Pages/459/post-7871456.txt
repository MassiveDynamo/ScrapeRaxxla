I’m on my way back to the bubble after a dark wheel passenger mission to Colonia. I’ve been getting the same vibe. I will join you once I’m done and unpacked my deep space DBX.

If our schedules are compatible will gladly have your company.
ATM kinda sidetracked, hitting some undiscovered systems with lots of bodies, and playing tag... ke ke ke if i have to do the trip, i might as well take something out of it.
