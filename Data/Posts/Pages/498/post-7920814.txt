It's not my intention to give offense or cause any drama, but when every idea is quoted in the next comment followed by "I remember back when we did that and found nothing, it's pointless" it might cause someone to abandon what could be a valuable lead. It seems counter productive, but perhaps I'm taking it too seriously. In any case I volunteer to follow up on any leads.

There’s plenty of potential leads in this thread, but whichever you choose to test let us know with the results and the specific objects you try it against. Just because many people have tried various experiments with various black holes/neutron stars/asterisms/myths/classical poetry books ... with negative results doesn’t mean these same experiments won’t yield fruit with the right black hole/neutron star/asterism/myth/classical poetry...
So the people (me included) who try to provide our experience of previous attempts aren’t trying to discourage, unless you’re trying exactly the same things we’ve done fruitlessly before; we’ve tried many things, which is why this thread has so many pages, although the Formidine Rift ran up to four threads if I recall correctly.
