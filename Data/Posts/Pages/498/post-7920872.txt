I read that article before posting. The black hole in the article is orbiting a Be-Star. The black hole in 27 Gamma Cass is NOT orbiting "anything".

The black hole appears to be orbiting the barycenter of the black hole + neutron star.

The reason the black hole in the center of our galaxy doesn't do this (visibly, but it still is very very slightly tugged by passing stars) is because it weighs millions of times more than any of the stars near it. A neutron star and stellar-mass black hole can be close enough in mass to orbit each other (around the barycenter) and it'd look exactly like that. They continue being affected by gravity, even the gravity of non-black holes.
