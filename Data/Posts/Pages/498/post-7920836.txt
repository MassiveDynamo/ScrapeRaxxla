I’m reclining in front of the tv with a mug of cold drinking chocolate and a sulky cat who wants to go out and play with the mice she likes to bring home.
I’m always serious!

Not really!
So the cat ended eating your Yorkshire Terrier and now she only has mice left to play with ? I feared it would happen...
