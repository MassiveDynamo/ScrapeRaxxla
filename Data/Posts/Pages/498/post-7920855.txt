So the cat ended eating your Yorkshire Terrier and now she only has mice left to play with ? I feared it would happen...

No
She has a love/hate relationship with my chocolate labrador co-pawlot!
He loves to make a fuss of her & she hates it, especially when he sniffs her rear end.
The finer points of animal behaviour puzzle me!

She knows she’s the boss of the house
He just thinks he is, at times, when he doesn’t want food/a walk/food/tummy rub/food/more food...
