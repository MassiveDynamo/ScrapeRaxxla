Just out of curiosity, since i trust both of you: what are your current ranks (Combat, Exploration, Trade, Empire, Federation)?



...or a sled. I'll wager 10 Kamitra cigars that it's a sled.



Bodies can orbit around "nothing" if they're in a pair, that's the principle of the barycenter. There's one body closer to the "center" that would be static without any external influence, but then you add a second body orbiting around it, and it pulls it ever so slightly, forcing it to describe an orbit of its own, seemingly around nothing. You can see it with binary rocky bodies in many systems, and here it may be something similar, only with way bigger numbers. Also, Neutron Star + Black Hole doesn't seem to be that rare, someone just posted on /r/eliteexplorers today. Not to completely discard 27 Cass as a place of interest though, i'm still intrigued by it, and it fits a lot of clues.
