IMHO “Astrophil and Stella”, and anything else written by or relating to Philip Sydney (or his paramour) is in no way relevant to “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars”

I think it was always a bit of a leap of faith relating the two, but if you want to run with that hypothesis enjoy your quest, it’s a personal journey!
What's weird, I think, is the spelling. From my googling (which I'm sure everyone did):

"There is no evidence that the title is authorial. It derives from the first printed text, the unauthorized quarto edition published by Thomas Newman (1591). Newman may also have been responsible for the consistent practice in early printings of calling the lover persona 'Astrophel'. Ringler emended to 'Astrophil' on the grounds of etymological correctness, since the name is presumably based on Greek aster philein, and means 'lover of a star' (with stella meaning 'star'); the 'phil' element alluding also, no doubt, to Sidney's Christian name."

Since it's spelled "Astrophel" in the Codex, that maybe does actually suggest a link to Sydney's work?!
