Holdstock's original novella which came with the original game in the UK was written as a bit of flavour for an otherwise quite dull (visually) space trading and combat game. It had no direct link to the game itself. The whole premise of it was to allow the player to imagine being part of an amazing narrative which could be taking part around them. I and many others didn't realise this at the time and spent years searching for Raxxla in the original. Raxxla was not in the original game at all, and was derived from Holdstock's earlier works - a literary easter egg, or simply recycling of ideas from other literary works.
Raxxla remained out of the sequels, and existed only in the minds of the players. The ONLY time Raxxla has been mentioned at all is in the Codex, and a fleeting, possible side reference in TDW missions.
You should not use Holdstocks novel as a quote machine to find Raxxla in this game. If you must use it, think how another author, say Allan Stroud, would incorporate Holdstock's Raxxla vision into Elite IV.

I have. There are no direct conflicts even with looking purely at Elite Dangerous for the earliest timelines. This is precisely why I feel comfortable citing it being mentioned by Jason Ryder. It is important that Lavian Brandy requires barrels made from oak trees from Earth. Details even seemingly innocuous ones matter.
