Just my two cents (and yes I get I have "exotic" ideas on the lore front) for maximally effective and fun theorycrafting:

-Any ideas need to have all necessary claims be able to survive investigation.
-Understand the era ideas apply.
-If possible, see if the idea can be used to predict where or how it is found.
-Does anything else explicitly contradict the idea?
-Does the concept self-limit possible locations in some fashion.

Then use this to go looking. Refine, reiterate, and revise. Yes, rumors happen very early but we also have few good limits on human expansion.
