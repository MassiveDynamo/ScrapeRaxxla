TBh I personally think it may basically mean that we shouldn't trust old stuff cos it's not always correct - or something like that.



I mean... that feels pretty familiar (affectionate, nudging wink)... cough-cough-holdstock-cough-cough...
Possible that

From Astrophil and Stella:
I said thou wert most fair, and so indeed thou art;
I said thou wert most sweet, sweet poison to my heart;
I said my soul was thine (oh that I then had lied!)
I said thine eyes were stars, thy the milk'n way;
Thy fingers Cupid's shafts, thy voice the angels' lay:
And all I said so well, as no man it denied.

Refers to persephone (Cora milk again, daughter)
then it should be her mother Demeter that is mother of galaxies
