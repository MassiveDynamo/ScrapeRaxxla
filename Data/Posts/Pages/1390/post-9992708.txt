What's weird, I think, is the spelling. From my googling (which I'm sure everyone did):



Since it's spelled "Astrophel" in the Codex, that maybe does actually suggest a link to Sydney's work?!
You can generate PDFs from Wikisource. The earlier one is by Sydney but was published in error with all manner of spelling problems and such. I suspect those may be important to the hints we are supposed to see regarding Raxxla.
