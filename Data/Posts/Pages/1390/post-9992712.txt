You can generate PDFs from Wikisource. The earlier one is by Sydney but was published in error with all manner of spelling problems and such. I suspect those may be important to the hints we are supposed to see regarding Raxxla.

TBh I personally think it may basically mean that we shouldn't trust old stuff cos it's not always correct - or something like that.

CODEX: "These details however, were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to children's story Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars, and soon lost credibility. Undaunted, some Raxxla seekers insisted that the story's author had cunningly concealed facts about the mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to see."

I mean... that feels pretty familiar (affectionate, nudging wink)... cough-cough-holdstock-cough-cough...
