Our core problem is the search is full of areas where it isn't always clear where efforts are too much or too little. Moderation in all things may help. The other thing, is there seems to be a fair amount indirect hints where something exists either purely in-game and in the novels where we are told just enough that it could be completely dismissed if one isn't closely paying attention. I wish there was less ambiguity, but that's what happens there are "no hints". Lastly, the "lady of Fate" thing in that message is weird. I think the story involving Thargoids must be much more complex. Maybe it means we aren't staring down extinction.
