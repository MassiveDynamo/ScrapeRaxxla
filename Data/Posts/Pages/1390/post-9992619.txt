IMHO “Astrophil and Stella”, and anything else written by or relating to Philip Sydney (or his paramour) is in no way relevant to “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars”

I think it was always a bit of a leap of faith relating the two, but if you want to run with that hypothesis enjoy your quest, it’s a personal journey!
