Ya I am pretty confident that much like the rest of the game it is tied to hoop-jumping. In the sense that the only way you could make it a journey that "everyone" has to travel themselves is that your personal codex has to know that you went to certain destinations and possibly did certain things. Maybe even checked off all your elites ... then and only then will the dark wheel contact you and give you the permit.... to their station... afterwhich ... more hoop jumping.

Edit: Drew has the right idea with his Lore Tour... maybe a "Tour of the Universe" is in order... I just realized that the luxury liner they took was named "Starfriend" ... Astrophil anyone ?

Which luxury liner are you referring to?
