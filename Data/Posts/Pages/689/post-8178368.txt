That's not exactly correct although I am on the side of there being no triggers but only signpostings, a wink and a nudge so to speak.

From the interview by djtruthsayer -

"Raxxla is in the Milky Way. This was confirmed during DJTruthsayer's lore interview with Michael Brookes.[9] Question: "Where is Raxxla?" Brookes: "Well it's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where it is. It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." Question: "You have said that there will be no clues though?" Brookes: "That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious just so people know what they're doing. There's nothing to be revealed at this stage."[9]"

Watch the interview, the nuance is more easily understood when you listen to it.

The "there will be no clues" was by djtruthsayer. And how do you reconcile that with MB's subsequent line

Ya I am pretty confident that much like the rest of the game it is tied to hoop-jumping. In the sense that the only way you could make it a journey that "everyone" has to travel themselves is that your personal codex has to know that you went to certain destinations and possibly did certain things. Maybe even checked off all your elites ... then and only then will the dark wheel contact you and give you the permit.... to their station... afterwhich ... more hoop jumping.

Edit: Drew has the right idea with his Lore Tour... maybe a "Tour of the Universe" is in order... I just realized that the luxury liner they took was named "Starfriend" ... Astrophil anyone ?
