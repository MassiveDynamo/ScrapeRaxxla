I think I get the gist of that Google translate message..

The problem with assuming you have to do a Konami code type action to find it is that it would make finding it impossible, because the game will not give you any hints as to how to find it, as per fdev.

What you're thinking about only makes sense if clues and such are there to find for those looking,. When we have been told by fdev that no such clues exist nor will be given

They might not have been telling the truth at the time. Certainly since then we’ve been given the Codex which is clearly a set of clues, trouble is we haven’t successfully decoded them.
