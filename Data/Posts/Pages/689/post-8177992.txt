Some offtop. Many time ago I read one book. It was the alternate story about the ancient heroes and the gods. But more about the heroes. Some of them was the members of the special teaching. They named theirself as "The Shinings" (it's my own translation). And they has special words to detect fellow members. When one of them want to check possiblity of the interlocutor be the Shining too, he should say special phrase. And the interlocutor must answer him using some special words. Common thing for any secret societies. But that Shinings has three "steps" or ranks. Those who was only first step members, should have answered using only first word of three, etc.

I have thought about our quest. What if we should hear the answers? But we can't ask questions. We can't to say something even. Only our doings says for us. What if we should do something special? Not a fight, not a trade, not an explore. And then we should hear the answer. Also the game was "released" in 2014. Five years ago! And Raxxla hunters was there since that date. So all questions was said. And all answers was unheared. If its even been there. This thoughts make me sad. So many people play the game. And no one didn't took even first step. First confirmed step!
