Looks like a fixed typo..
i dont think it's fixed as far as i know. people are getting the same message with the "typo" in it currently. that is if we assume it is a typo ofcourse.

When they fix the typo in the loading screen Ill start believing there may be subtle messages in the text elsewhere

well, the thing is, even if that is in fact a typo, the correct spelling would then be "Pilots Federation". the fact remains that it is a separate hidden reputation, that doesn't seem to belong or to be linked to any minor faction in any system. wich makes me suspect that it might be the real pilots federation and not just some minor branch of the faction. and the fact that it's linked to only goid killing or rescue missions is quite interresting, and should at least be investigated. i dont think anyone is allied with that faction yet.
