Ya I am pretty confident that much like the rest of the game it is tied to hoop-jumping. In the sense that the only way you could make it a journey that "everyone" has to travel themselves is that your personal codex has to know that you went to certain destinations and possibly did certain things. Maybe even checked off all your elites ... then and only then will the dark wheel contact you and give you the permit.... to their station... afterwhich ... more hoop jumping.

Edit: Drew has the right idea with his Lore Tour... maybe a "Tour of the Universe" is in order... I just realized that the luxury liner they took was named "Starfriend" ... Astrophil anyone ?
May be also worth expressing interest and keeping an eye on this;

Potential 2020 Lore 'Tour'
Folks, I'm thinking of doing something of an Elite Dangerous 'Lore Tour' in the new year. A sort of guided tour of all the original '84-'93 cool places in the game, with selected new ones too. On Twitch and in-game maybe with the odd side-quest, background, a hint of nostalgia, history, any...

Some of you may have already seen it but thought I would repost here in case anyone missed it.

Details are pretty scarce at the moment, and I am not saying it will lead to anything Raxxla related. It will nonetheless be cool and a great time for all us lore junkies.
