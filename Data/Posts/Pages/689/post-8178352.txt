Who's to say when there will be. That makes it sound inaccessible.

Well it'd be pretty rude of DB if he had confirmed to DW it exists but left out that its currently unreachable. Same goes for MB. I don't believe this is so and anyone searching for Raxxla simply cannot believe this as well because you might as well just quit. Thousands of hours wasted collectively, it would be a PR nightmare. Hence the Gan Romero decision.
