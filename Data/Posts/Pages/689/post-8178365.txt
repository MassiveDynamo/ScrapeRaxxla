Well it'd be pretty rude of DB if he had confirmed to DW it exists but left out that its currently unreachable. Same goes for MB. I don't believe this is so and anyone searching for Raxxla simply cannot believe this as well because you might as well just quit. Thousands of hours wasted collectively, it would be a PR nightmare. Hence the Gan Romero decision.
Wasting my time is what im best at
