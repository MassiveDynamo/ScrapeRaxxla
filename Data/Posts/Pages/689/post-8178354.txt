i dont think it's fixed as far as i know. people are getting the same message with the "typo" in it currently. that is if we assume it is a typo ofcourse.



well, the thing is, even if that is in fact a typo, the correct spelling would then be "Pilots Federation". the fact remains that it is a separate hidden reputation, that doesn't seem to belong or to be linked to any minor faction in any system. wich makes me suspect that it might be the real pilots federation and not just some minor branch of the faction. and the fact that it's linked to only goid killing or rescue missions is quite interresting, and should at least be investigated. i dont think anyone is allied with that faction yet.
Speaking of getting PF rep up, I have to take a short break from fighting â€˜goids. They seem to have got their revenge on me, been bitten by a spider or some kind of bug. Feeling pretty crook and my arm is quite stiff and sore. Been in and out of the hospital for blood tests and stuff. I probably will stick to light duties if I do play at all, at least until I am feeling better. Might mess around and build my Type 10 into a Multi-crew focused turret platform for fighting Thargoid Scouts.
