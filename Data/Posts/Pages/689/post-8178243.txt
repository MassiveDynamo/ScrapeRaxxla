I think I get the gist of that Google translate message..

The problem with assuming you have to do a Konami code type action to find it is that it would make finding it impossible, because the game will not give you any hints as to how to find it, as per fdev.

What you're thinking about only makes sense if clues and such are there to find for those looking,. When we have been told by fdev that no such clues exist nor will be given

That's not exactly correct although I am on the side of there being no triggers but only signpostings, a wink and a nudge so to speak.

From the interview by djtruthsayer -

"Raxxla is in the Milky Way. This was confirmed during DJTruthsayer's lore interview with Michael Brookes.[9] Question: "Where is Raxxla?" Brookes: "Well it's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where it is. It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." Question: "You have said that there will be no clues though?" Brookes: "That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious just so people know what they're doing. There's nothing to be revealed at this stage."[9]"

Watch the interview, the nuance is more easily understood when you listen to it.

The "there will be no clues" was by djtruthsayer. And how do you reconcile that with MB's subsequent line "That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious just so people know what they're doing."
