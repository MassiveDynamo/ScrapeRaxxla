anyways, i think it stands to reason that there is maybe a 2%? chance that raxxla is a space station of some type with a drive of some kind, and there by could be moving betweeen the outter edges of some systems.... just somthing to keep in mind for those who believe it is a station

Edit: doesnt the original story talk about a portal that Ben Ryder built to get to raxxla? i swear that story mentions his potral having a drive of some kind... maybe thats what we should be looking for too?
Admittedly i havent read through all source material. I've only completed the dark wheel & and here the wheel. Im yet to find a copy of tales from the frontier. I have reclamation, premonition and out of the darkness. Also i plan on getting legacy and mostly harmless (this will be the second book of this title i will have read by that time)

From as far as i have found, no mention of Ben Ryder. Jason was Alex's father and Alex was the father of Oberon and Neptune. I know i havent all of the lineage of course Liz Ryder somehow fits into this but i have yet to get to that as well. Where does Ben Ryder come from (what book i mean)?
