anyways, i think it stands to reason that there is maybe a 2%? chance that raxxla is a space station of some type with a drive of some kind, and there by could be moving betweeen the outter edges of some systems.... just somthing to keep in mind for those who believe it is a station

Edit: doesnt the original story talk about a portal that Ben Ryder built to get to raxxla? i swear that story mentions his potral having a drive of some kind... maybe thats what we should be looking for too?
