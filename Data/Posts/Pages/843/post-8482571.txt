"Giant drives can be attached to move them from system to system when required, albeit much more slowly than even the largest cargo ships. Only a few of them have been so equipped..."

In my mind those would be sublight drives, not FSD's...but I suppose that could be open to interpretation.

above that, in the first paragraph of overview, its does call it a hyperdrive, not a FSD or sublight...

"It can be fitted with engines and a hyperdrive to be easily moved where needed "
