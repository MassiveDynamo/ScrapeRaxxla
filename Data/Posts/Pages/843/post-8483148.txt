Ben was Jason's father. There is nothing in The Dark Wheel that connects him to Raxxla. There are a lot of fan fiction and Oolite stories that puts different spinns on the story, but those aren't of much value. FD have probably not even read them.

The best real description of Raxxla is what Rafe Zetter tells Alex about it: 'Your father was chasing the mythical plant Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and lifeâ€¦ '

Admittedly we have already found a bunch of these, in the form of Guardian sites. I still hope Raxxla is unique in ED.
