the "door thats a key' was talking about the frame shift drives. and "place thats not a place" was hyperspace/witchspace.
The frame shift drive is the single key to the whole of this experience, isn't it? What if, as I joked with an old friend a while back about the ending of this video, it happens to be the case that FDEV happens to know- and I'm referencing the supercruise stream where they had the resident psychologist on staff discussing Odyssey, that the experience of being in the galaxy- in whatever way you choose to explore it- and the wonder, aggression, hope, and anguish of the experience is the place, that mystery within that is human experience, from 1984 until the first generation ships left Sol, until Arissa took the Imperial throne, until now?

What if that's the real frame shift, that wormhole, that place that isn't a place?
