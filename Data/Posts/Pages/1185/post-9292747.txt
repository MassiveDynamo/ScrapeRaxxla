No system exist, when you aren't in it. They don't get put in a server, when they are discovered. It's still just a key that is put in a generator, when you jump in.
The server basically just stores what you can see in the log files.
Maybe I have not been able to express myself well, English is not my native language. What I mean is that the undiscovered systems don't have any log files, there is no information about them until they are discovered by someone. Is this correct? That's why I say that Raxxla must be in some already generated system not one yet to discover.
Or what you mean is that Raxxla can be added to the server anytime if the correct system is discovered?
