I have a question. Every time a system is discovered, it is generated procedurally. With this in mind, wouldn't it be obvious that if Raxxla exists in the game it would be within a system that has already been discovered? Because if it's not discovered, it doesn't really exist in the game, right?
No system exist, when you aren't in it. They don't get put in a server, when they are discovered. It's still just a key that is put in a generator, when you jump in.
The server basically just stores what you can see in the log files.
