well i have always thought the "door thats a key' was talking about the frame shift drives. and "place thats not a place" was hyperspace/witchspace. and the hyperspace tunnels we jump through seem to have 6 light pillars that form raxxlas green logo the ones that you see comming off the star your jumping, to with our hud targeting the middle part of the logo. and we can only jump solo... i know its just space madness talking, theres no way fdev would make us search for years to say "Raxxla is the name of the wormhole everyone frameshift jumps through".... right?
