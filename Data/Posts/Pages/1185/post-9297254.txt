The frame shift drive is the single key to the whole of this experience, isn't it? What if, as I joked with an old friend a while back about the ending of this video, it happens to be the case that FDEV happens to know- and I'm referencing the supercruise stream where they had the resident psychologist on staff discussing Odyssey, that the experience of being in the galaxy- in whatever way you choose to explore it- and the wonder, aggression, hope, and anguish of the experience is the place, that mystery within that is human experience, from 1984 until the first generation ships left Sol, until Arissa took the Imperial throne, until now?

What if that's the real frame shift, that wormhole, that place that isn't a place?
that actually sounds logical. more logical than one of my thoughts that raxxla isnt a planet at all and is actualy a generation ship with a prototype hyperdrive.
Or even crazier it is a planet but the star of its system is surrounded by a alien Dyson Sphere.
