Anyway, I decided to follow up on that idea I posted earlier and found my way over to Ptolemy, thinking there might be something people might have missed over at Barnard. I didn't find anything other than a single jump over to Galileo, which leads me to think that the whole Raxxla situation really is FDEV's grand vision finale for their exploration-focused pilots, and a couple of out of the ordinary "Align with escape vector" prompts while FSD charging out of the asteroid belts, which a few theories have mentioned as a possibility- Raxxla being a hidden planet being located in a region out of visible light and for whatever reason inaccessible to FSS. I followed it up with a trip to Ronemar in the Witch Head nebula, which is just an Alliance outpost with lots of Thargoid activity, which also led me to think about some of the theories that have tied the Thargoids to Raxxla and the INRA Thargoid connection- which I briefly touched on in one of my previous story arcs- and that weird thing that happened between me and one of the Thargoid pairs during hyper diction. With the Aegis disappearing, it made me wonder if anyone's attempted anything like bring Guardian relics into Thargoid space to get hyperdicted and then approached them, possibly triggering some signal or hidden listening-post type thing on the interceptors themselves. Anyone?
