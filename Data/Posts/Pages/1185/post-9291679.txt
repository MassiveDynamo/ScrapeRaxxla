In the book version of 2001, the Monolith is on Iapeatus, a moon of Saturn, rather than Jupiter, so if Raxxla is a 2001 reference, it might be round Saturn.
Ah, thanks! It's a long time since I watched the film but I thought the transport gateway monolith was on the surface somewhere!
Iapetus could be worth a look!
