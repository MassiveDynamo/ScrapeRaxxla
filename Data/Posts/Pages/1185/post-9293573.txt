No system exist, when you aren't in it. They don't get put in a server, when they are discovered. It's still just a key that is put in a generator, when you jump in.
The server basically just stores what you can see in the log files.
I'd suggest they both exist and do not exist simultaneously in a quantum state until they are actually observed at which point their physical state is confirmed and no longer in quantum limbo o7
