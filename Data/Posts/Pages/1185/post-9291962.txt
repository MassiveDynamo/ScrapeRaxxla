I actualy think we could take a different approach to Raxxla what this thread. Correct me if I'm wrong but they actualy never confirmed you could find Raxxla in the game, but that it is somewhere out there. What if it's part of the storyline and not yet accesable? We could find clue's first in storyline based POI's about Raxxla. Maybe do a mission to find more listening posts?
