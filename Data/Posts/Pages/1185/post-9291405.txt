I don't think FD are afraid to move stuff around, a bit. If Raxxla is a planet / moon like it's described in the Dark Wheel, the thing that actually does something (alien construct / portal / ophalos rift / monolith) may have moved. It could have started in orbit and been moved to the surface, with the Horizons or Odyssey release (depending on type of atmosphere).

As long as Raxxla isn't found, they can update it.
