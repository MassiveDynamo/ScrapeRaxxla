Something I'd like to ask: The Codex tells about Art and Kore who obviously lived in Tau Ceti. Did we already search and probe that system thoroughly? Idea behind it is, if Kore actually had a map, it might be hidden there somewhere...

Currently pootling around in Tau Ceti upon this very assumption. Nothing really sticking out, faction alignment is pretty easy as is their permit but not a great deal to do otherwise.

Highly likely I have missed something, next I'll explore encircling systems in search any factions linked to Art or Kore / crash site etc...be cool if there was some breadcrumb out there, this is as good a place as any.

And that got me thinking. The toast and codex are enticing an all but need more concrete evidence, and by all accounts there's been something in game since day one pointing the way.

So its probably time for my Cmdr to finally begin their journey towards Elite.

I've been in game since launch and never really sought after riches nor Elite rank. That all changed when I hit Dangerous the other night.

Dangerous was my old 84 rank and the key objective for my current Cmdr. Now for perspective my intention was always to savour the journey, choosing those routes least travelled, flying nothing but an old Cobra mk iii since launch and role playing not grinding.

For those with eyes to see read your flight instruction manual (p28). They have been watching all along.

I'll slip off and explore and maybe someone will be in touch; I've a feeling they may have tried before but this time I'll listen.
