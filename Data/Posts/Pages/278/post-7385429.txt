I also want to remind you that its being in the game since day 1 does not mean it's still in the same shape. It's probably a station in the beginning, now it's on a non-atmospheric planet and it will be on an atmospheric planet prior to the update. If it's not found by then obviously.

I remember DW's post in this thread about the FR myth evolved with the game updates. (they put some assets on the planet surfaces after the horizons update) Too lazy to find it now at 4 am.
