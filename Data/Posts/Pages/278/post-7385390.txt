Im not too sure if this station is more reasonable. Dont you think this station is too close to the sun because we know it orbits the 8. moon of a gas giant.It should be further away from the sun, not?

Stars near the end of their lifes may become enormous. I think that would make a great story if TDW want to relocate their station and miss-jump due to Thargoid interference. If we pull the right strings and trigger some events, maybe. Then they broadcast an emergency call to the elite pilots, etc.
