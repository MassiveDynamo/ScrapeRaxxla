I know its not strictly Canon, but with the recent emergence of the faction calling themselves The Dark Wheel, and needing to be Elite to access their home system, I thought this part of The Dark Wheel by Robert Holdstock tied into the narrative:

"One thing's for sure,' Rafe went on drily. 'Unless you get there, unless you become Ãˆlite, you'll never get to Raxxla. And you'll never know exactly what your father was searching for.'
'I don't understand.'
'Were you aware of his involvement in The Dark Wheel?'

So perhaps the secret to finding Raxxla lies in Shinrarta Dezhra, as you need to be Elite to gain entry. I am also assuming the emblem on the dark wheel logo is also Elite? (Combat?)

I always found that grave accent very intriguing. It's no accident that accent was put on there.
