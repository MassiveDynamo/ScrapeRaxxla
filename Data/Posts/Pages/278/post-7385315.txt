Ok. Anyone here who really searched Tau Ceti?

Ive been nosing around there recently. Nothing out of the ordinary yet

The only thing thats a little strange is the FSS seems a little bugged there.

I brought it up a few pages back - Think it's probably nothing.

Interesting system though with a good backstory, I'm continuing to work there with the bald fellas to see if anything happens. Checking out Convoys and manifest scanning. Nothing yet but I'll probably spend a little more time there amongst other things
