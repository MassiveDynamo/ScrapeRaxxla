Im not too sure if this station is more reasonable. Dont you think this station is too close to the sun because we know it orbits the 8. moon of a gas giant.It should be further away from the sun, not?

I'm with you on this. I think the image is an idealized image, since if there was a gas giant that close to the sun, and revealing the colour of the sun, would be too revealing - in terms of proximity and star type. FD know only too well when they reveal this kind of information players get to it very quickly.
