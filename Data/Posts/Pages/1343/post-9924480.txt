And maybe we should be carrying containers of Fish
(Place that is not a Plaice!)

The only thing that calls up the Elite requirement possibility is the original Holdstock TDW novella, "Unless you get there, unless you become Ã©lite, you'll never get to Raxxla" and that seems to have been retconned from ED lore as far as I understand the current lore mishmash.
But worth getting friendly with all the engineers in Horizons- it does help to get a fully engineered ship. I love my 60+ ly Phantom, and the engineered vette & Krait for BH...

I dont think DB would have changed the Raxxla location or criteria from the original beta/gamma-so no Odyssey, not on planetary surface...
