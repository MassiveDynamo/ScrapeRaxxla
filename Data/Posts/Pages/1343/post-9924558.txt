Do you happen to remember... in the release, as far as I remember, there was no such detailed codex like now. Right? Then there was another loading screen, showing the station, some kind of moon and planet. But I don't remember about the codex, was it at all
that's right. The codex only came in a little while ago with Beyond Chapter 4, see https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/5c0fadbfa9a9182e01271bb2
The original game start menu had a Coriolis dodecahedron station above a planet/moon combination. That was later replaced (at least for Horizons) by an Orbis wheeled station. I think those videos are still in the game folder to be viewed,
