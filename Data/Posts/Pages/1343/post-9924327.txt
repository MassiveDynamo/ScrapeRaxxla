Once I find some I will!

I've got a few strings to tie up before I leave the bubble again and I want to have a couple for my voyage to the Zurarah.


I do wish we didn't need to... were forced to have cargo move between active ships. It would make my experiments much easier to do lol.
Try liners & trader ships (Dolphin, Adder, Type6 etc) in anarchy system at the nav beacon. Find a ship soon after it enters the nav beacon instance so it’s distant from the other ships. Once you’ve checked the cargo carried with manifest scanner and found some then target it, get near (within the range of your hatchbreaker limpets), fire one, stand by to retrieve the Trinket(s) dropped. You might need to deploy extra hatchbreakers. Collector limpets might help to get them as often the trader tries to retrieve them, as does every pirate within range, and they’re remarkably agile and quick in doing so! Yesterday I found a Dolphin with 10 at Orrere, managed to get 4....
