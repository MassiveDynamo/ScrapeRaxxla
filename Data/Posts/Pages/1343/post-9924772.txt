seeing the sounds of the trinkets of hidden fortune in the video posted earlier, Im sure iv heard some of the before! I may be suffering from space madness however didnt one of the unregistered comms beacons in the bubble that does nothing also make sounds like this and was found back in 2015-16??? Going to try nosedive down the rabbit hole however it seems many threads are locked from back then even for viewing

On that note cant remember who said they where going to give me some trinkets, I am now in Orrere if the offer still stands would be handy to get one or two while I search for this beacon, Cant seem to get any ships that have them onboard yet
