Do you have any particular interest in Alpha Hydri? As far as I'm aware it's just another permit-locked Bubble system.

No, other than it’s a random system to find permit locked in that location. Nothing I’ve found points to it in particular, but I never see it mentioned (it wasn’t even listed in the player spreadsheet of permit locked systems when I last checked, which is weird).
