You lost me just after insubstantial....

I’m thinking that Raxxla started off as pure myth, something like “the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow” (apologies if any reader actually believes in leprechauns, I have no desire to belittle anybody’s personal belief system!). Since we were told by FD “it exists” and “it’s in the Milky Way” then the Raxxla we are looking for is something substantial (i.e. not a state of cosmic enlightenment), so the original myth must have been applied to name whatever “it” is by whoever/whatever found “it”.

And back in the original game (~3190), around the time of that naming, jump range was only 7ly.

Edit: just wondering if that “cosmetic enlightenment” in the Codex is not a typing slip but actually intended as a clue...
