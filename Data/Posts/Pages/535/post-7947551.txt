I’m thinking that Raxxla started off as pure myth, something like “the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow” (apologies if any reader actually believes in leprechauns, I have no desire to belittle anybody’s personal belief system!). Since we were told by FD “it exists” and “it’s in the Milky Way” then the Raxxla we are looking for is something substantial (i.e. not a state of cosmic, or even ‘cosmetic’, enlightenment), so the original myth must have been applied to name whatever “it” is by whoever/whatever found “it”.

And back in the original game (~3190), around the time of that naming, jump range was only 7ly.

Edit: just wondering if that “cosmetic enlightenment” in the Codex is not a typing slip but actually intended as a clue...
Ok, I now understand but I'm not sure I agree. As a player for 3 weeks, and aimless in every sense of the word, I got about 200ish lightyears out of the bubble in my stock sidewinder, which I think is 6 or 7 lys isnt it?
I dont think I've seen any evidence that R wasn't found well before 2296. It may even have moved since its first discovery??
Maybe I'm just not thinking clearly as I'm so hurt and upset about your leprechaun comment. How could you dash my dreams like that? When I'm not hunting Raxxla, chasing the end of the rainbow is my other hobby. I find them almost synonymous.
