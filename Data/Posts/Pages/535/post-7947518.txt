Just checked the ED timeline yesterday. From Codex the first report of Raxxla myth was in 2296, but that is even before the era of the original game, which I think is around 3190 (from wiki - mycoid attack on goids). So Raxxla myth must originally have been something insubstantial, such as an insubstantial goal that could never be found... giving a name which was then applied to “it” when “it” was found. Or am I going off my head here?
You lost me just after insubstantial....
