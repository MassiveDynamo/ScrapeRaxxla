Ok, I now understand but I'm not sure I agree. As a player for 3 weeks, and aimless in every sense of the word, I got about 200ish lightyears out of the bubble in my stock sidewinder, which I think is 6 or 7 lys isnt it?
I dont think I've seen any evidence that R wasn't found well before 2296. It may even have moved since its first discovery??
Maybe I'm just not thinking clearly as I'm so hurt and upset about your leprechaun comment. How could you dash my dreams like that? When I'm not hunting Raxxla, chasing the end of the rainbow is my other hobby. I find them almost synonymous.

I was speaking from the point of view of a Krait Phantom pilot, galactic explorer and an amateur historian interested in 21st Century Earth history, when “pot of gold at the end of the rainbow” meant that something was idealistic, possibly valuable and desirable, but impossible to find. In no way do I deny, challenge or confirm the presence, existence, or belief in leprechauns or similar creatures. I am sure many people do believe in them and wish those believers all happiness and success in their hunt for the end of their rainbow (be it multicoloured or otherwise).
