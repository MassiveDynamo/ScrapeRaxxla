But was it on purpose, or was it by accident?
Is Raxxla so irrelevant for the majority of players and for the game success that Fdev didn't care looking after this "quest" line?
Let's look at the ongoing Thargo√Ød war, and more broadly to the last years of narratives. Would Fdev goes "ho no, not this system it is Raxxla related" or is it more likely that they wouldn't even know they break the quest line?
Raxxla related systems are easy enough to find .. Raxxla not so much. Oisir-Raxxlans were rather fond conquoring without directly fighting a population. This changes the population in dramatic and unexpected ways. Old systems especially with mythological references are often connected but merely old works well, too -populated or not. Don't you think it a bit odd that Diso Ma Corn is no longer machine harvested? The Oisir-Raxxla were methodical in the way they took over systems and that left traces that can be found.
