plus the phrase
“some Raxxla seekers insisted that the story's author had cunningly concealed facts about the mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to see.”
How do I explain now?
I have my own truth, you have your own truth. So the person who wrote the codex has an own truth. Humans usually talk & interpret from the own perspective.
So if there is a fact leading to Raxxla in a RL book, then this book is probably somehow related to ED Theme.

I am new to this community, before I signed up for GFN I was doing trade runs and Npc Hunting for 1000 hours on Xbox all alone, but worked myself more in the games lore since some months,but afaik a story author was mentioning Raxxla already in RL.

The codex was attached later to the game, right?
