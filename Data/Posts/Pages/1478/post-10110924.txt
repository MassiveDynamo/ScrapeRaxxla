This in the game (correct me if I'm wrong) there is only one place. Hmm.
It's when jumping from system to system.

Dont think the phrase exists in-game anymore. It was part of the description of one of the old Elite/Founder missions that seemed to have a relation to TDW and Raxxla, but those missions disappeared around 2016.
