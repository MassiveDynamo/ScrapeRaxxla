I thought about this and to me this is linked to the opening text of the codex entry, which could be a reference to the all seeing eye (a.k.a. Eye of Providence.) What leads me to thinks it's a reference to this is the part about the jewl. Definetly located on the forehead.
'for those with eyes to see' is clearly related to the chilenen's story. Without the story, I don't think it's very relevant.

The question is how do we find a copy of Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars?

Is it an RL story that has had a name change, in the ED universe?
Is it an in game story that can be found by discovering the right log somewhere?
Is it available in the Dark Wheel library?

We need to find the text. Then we can use our eyes to see.
