'for those with eyes to see' is clearly related to the chilenen's story. Without the story, I don't think it's very relevant.

The question is how do we find a copy of Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars?

Is it an RL story that has had a name change, in the ED universe?
Is it an in game story that can be found by discovering the right log somewhere?
Is it available in the Dark Wheel library?

We need to find the text. Then we can use our eyes to see.

"For those with eyes to see" is far more ancient than just Raxxla. There is, though, a story of mother of the cosmos whose son was nearly immortal but died in war that is particularly pivotal to Elite Dangerous. But it is also many stories especially myths and legends. Finding the text won't help you, however. The lesson is more important than the text itself.

For what is inside of you is what is outside of you,
and the one who fashions you on the outside
is the one who shaped the inside of you.
And what you see outside of you, you see inside of you;
it is visible and it is your garment.

--excerpted from "The Thunder, Perfect Mind"

May I suggest teaching yourself how to find Jones Colony, Essafa (well the place formerly known as Essafa). This will help on the whole "for those with eyes to see" bit.
