But was it on purpose, or was it by accident?
Is Raxxla so irrelevant for the majority of players and for the game success that Fdev didn't care looking after this "quest" line?
Let's look at the ongoing Thargo√Ød war, and more broadly to the last years of narratives. Would Fdev goes "ho no, not this system it is Raxxla related" or is it more likely that they wouldn't even know they break the quest line?

Maybe the book isn't a book at all, but a metaphorical description of the game we are playing. We are star lovers for we play Elite.
So it could very well be a visual clue, and the place somewhere not on a map (hence a place not a place) where we could access something (somewhere?).
A place that could create a mis-jump maybe, just like in Elite II. Only speculations of course.
For all we know Fdev could be reading these threads and think "Anyway, they are happy playing & chasing dreams let's keep it that way. If we admit we break it up years ago surely they will quit"
