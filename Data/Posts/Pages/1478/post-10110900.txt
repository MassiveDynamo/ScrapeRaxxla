This in the game (correct me if I'm wrong) there is only one place. Hmm.
It's when jumping from system to system.

What else can fit under these words?
What I meant is that it could be within a system but a few hundreds of thousands LS in any direction, far from any planet or station. If we are to rely on visual clues from within said system, which can be any of them, then no wonder no one ever found anything.
As time pass, it becomes likely (in my opinion) that the riddle isn't much sophisticated but there's more chances to win the lottery than to find Raxxla.
Of course this opinion is as solid (moot) as any other theory. The only fact is ten years, thousands of players, still at square one.
