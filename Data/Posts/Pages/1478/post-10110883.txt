'for those with eyes to see'
I thought about this and to me this is linked to the opening text of the codex entry, which could be a reference to the all seeing eye (a.k.a. Eye of Providence.) What leads me to thinks it's a reference to this is the part about the jewl. Definetly located on the forehead.
