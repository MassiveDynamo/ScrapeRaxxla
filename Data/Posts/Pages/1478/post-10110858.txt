It could be that the system itself is already known & explored, maybe even inhabited, but the "place that is not a place" (somewhere in the vacuum, far from any regular routes) could be found from visual clues from within this system. A set of spiralling stars visible only from a certain angle, for "those with eyes to see".
But after nearly ten years, we have nothing solid. Were not it supposed to be pointers from inside the game as one progress?
Or did everybody so far failed the "test"?
Exploring this universe is fascinating, but the game play mechanics are overall not so deep and that makes me doubt of Raxxla's mystery design.
I mean, if it's only a dot lost in the immensity of space without any clue that's not very fun or fair.
I wish we could hear Fdev on that again.
