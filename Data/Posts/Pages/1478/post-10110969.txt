This in the game (correct me if I'm wrong) there is only one place. Hmm.
It's when jumping from system to system.

What else can fit under these words?
"A place that is not a place, a door that is also the key."

A crossroads such as the entry/exit of bigger stations and asteroid bases. Which oddly enough bares resemblence to the image connected to the codex. But, yes certainly Witch-space too and the stars most certainly do spiral as you prepare to exit the Witch-space tunnel.
