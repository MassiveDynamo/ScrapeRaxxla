Ninety percent sure these have been renamed.
Are system names & planet names & such all STATIC ?

sorry i'm just confused by what you meant when you said "have been renamed" ... Are you saying once i scan/map/honk a system ingame , later ( whenever ) it might get RE-named again?

If so, that would literally make finding Raxxla ( if it's a hidden system ) completely impossible.
