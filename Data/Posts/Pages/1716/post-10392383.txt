Twas Ascorbius who reported that saying.
Yes - but that certainly wasn't the original source of the rumour. That clip is from July 2020, and there's https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-406#post-7800401 from this thread in May 2019 which refers to it as a debunked rumour.

I've not been able to track it back any earlier than that, though clearly that can't have been the first mention either.
