4th game in the Elite series. While some places like Lave have stayed the same all the way since the beginning, there is a non-trivial amount of human space that had name changes due to political upheaval and/or Universal Cartographics harmonizing name schemes between Independent systems, Federation, and The Empire. Example, the system Gateway used to be Oltiqu. GalMap will show astronomical names if applicable. A lot of history is buried by way of local names for places (e.g. stations, named planets, ports, etc).
Lave just moved all the way from just beyond Imperial space, to where it is today. It used to be close to Facece.
