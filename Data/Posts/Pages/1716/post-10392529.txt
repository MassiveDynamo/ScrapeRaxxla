I was dabbling a bit with the name again. Raxxla that is.

I try to read hints as general and find whats common about them. When it comes to the cosmology this myth operates in, it seem to be geocentric. Milton, silent song of the spheres and the omphalos idea are all geocentric in their view of the sky.

I was thinking the name might say something in this context. I came up with this:

First i splitt the name in three parts. Ra, xx and la. Then I let AI analyse it in the context of astronomy. There were several suggestions but I was after a location, so I landed on this:

Ra = Right (of course)
xx = 20 (simple roman numerals)
la = latitude or more specifically celestial latitude

This gives longitude in one coordinate system and latitude in another an just the number 20.

I tried putting 20 in both coordinates and recalculating the latitude to normal equatorial declination. This gives:

Ra 20h Dec -0.57°

The closest named star is at


This is about as close you can get with Roman numerals

The system is a binary with no planets an has the interesting alternative name of: Thanih kab

In the sky, the system is close to Altair. Crossing the magpie bridge from Vega will get you close.
The system also have a listening post.

This is just a simple analyses, following the path of least resistance. There are endless other way to interpret the name.

Ive been re-looking at names of events updates for the game…. Horizons and Azimuth both come to mind ….. the horizon is what you measure your azimuth along … essentially your local version of right ascension…. I think this a good path to re-travel…. Look at with fresh eyes.
