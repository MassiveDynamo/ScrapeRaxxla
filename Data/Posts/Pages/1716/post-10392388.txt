There is nothing wrong with investigating the galactic background noise. The main issue is that it has been done for eight years. I don't know if there is much more to find. The sound has been analysed and the source has been triangulated.
Not the galactic background, the "Landscape Signal". That was only discovered a few years ago, and yes, triangulated to an area near a star neae the very centre of the galaxy.

It's demonstrably an artificial signal.

I've shown that there's images in the spectrogram which everyone has missed.

There's clearly investigation to be done into this literal actual thing that matches all the criteria in the Codex.
