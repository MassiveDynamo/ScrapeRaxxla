Lave just moved all the way from just beyond Imperial space, to where it is today. It used to be close to Facece.
For now we'll stick with handwavium, but I want a better explanation (especially given reality's penchant for being stranger than fiction).

It's getting really damn tempting to start cross-referencing stellar moving groups against lore important systems. Possibly also runaway stars. We also have a recurring gravitational anomaly racing across a large region of the extended bubble. Different coordinate systems isn't enough to single-handedly explain away some of the extreme oddities going on here. Yes, there's the whole more reliable measurements angle but again that will only get you so far. The crazy thing is we have a ton of lore backing Vetitice and Facece being the same place by way of Jaques. I am just not sure we missed some major hint or completely misinterpreted something.
