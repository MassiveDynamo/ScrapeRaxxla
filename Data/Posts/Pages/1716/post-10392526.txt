Are system names & planet names & such all STATIC ?

sorry i'm just confused by what you meant when you said "have been renamed" ... Are you saying once i scan/map/honk a system ingame , later ( whenever ) it might get RE-named again?

If so, that would literally make finding Raxxla ( if it's a hidden system ) completely impossible.
4th game in the Elite series. While some places like Lave have stayed the same all the way since the beginning, there is a non-trivial amount of human space that had name changes due to political upheaval and/or Universal Cartographics harmonizing name schemes between Independent systems, Federation, and The Empire. Example, the system Gateway used to be Oltiqu. GalMap will show astronomical names if applicable. A lot of history is buried by way of local names for places (e.g. stations, named planets, ports, etc).
