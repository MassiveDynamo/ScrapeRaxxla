Cora comes home soused and raving with wild stories, a new one every night. She claims she's found a map to some pirate stash, and all I have to do is loan her my ship so we can go dig it up. Maybe we should go find Raxxla while we're at it!
FROM THE JOURNAL OF ART TORNQVIST, CIRCA 2296

I am kinda thinking this is the actual clue, and the only one we need.

edit - images of system I'm in, has a lot of pirate sites. What is the chance the pirates are the enemy that holds raxxla but they have no clue what they have¿
