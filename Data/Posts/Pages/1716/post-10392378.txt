Don't forget, the orrery also holds clues. Though they may not be raxxla but DW clues; regardless..

Not my pic but this one kinda shows the garden and how it looks like an orrery.

I don;t want to muddy the waters with this as it doesn't really follow the clues we have from the codex.
Looks like you're a bit out of touch. I suggest you search for @Rochester 's posts in this thread over the last few months. He has shown that the Codex mention of Atlantis, Lost Worlds, ancient gods, etc etc are mirrored by in-game system names, and it seems Michael Brookes also coded the cosmography of John Milton's Paradise Lost (MB's favourite book) in-game. What you are calling the orrery in the garden design left panel seems to be a representation of PL cosmography with the "pendent world" that held Paradise and the Garden of Eden, & that PL quotation is highlighted in the final tourist beacon of the Brookes Memorial Tour.
