Yes - but that certainly wasn't the original source of the rumour. That clip is from July 2020, and there's https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-406#post-7800401 from this thread in May 2019 which refers to it as a debunked rumour.

I've not been able to track it back any earlier than that, though clearly that can't have been the first mention either.
Can't see which post you're referring to. As I said, it is an uncorroborated rumour...at the time I remember several others claimed support for this but in a different thread (can't remember which one), but they seemed to recant or said they had been misunderstood. Unless Ascorbius or MB themselves outright denied it then I can't see how it can be said to be debunked.

I don't think it makes much difference. If Raxxla first report was 2296 & it had already become an urban myth then the likelihood is that it is located in the human bubble, and therefore may well be in a system that was visited early. I long explored the hypothesis that it is in Sol...

But my interpretation of the "hints" we have is that it is probably located in a planetary ring...which means from their size it may never be found, so I can quite believe the system was visited but Raxxla wasn't detected.
