Are system names & planet names & such all STATIC ?

sorry i'm just confused by what you meant when you said "have been renamed" ... Are you saying once i scan/map/honk a system ingame , later ( whenever ) it might get RE-named again?

If so, that would literally make finding Raxxla ( if it's a hidden system ) completely impossible.
I think he was referring to the “official” star names vs the names that are often in elite….. such as Achenar in elite vs Achernar. The trick with hunting for real stars you might not know the name in elite is to go into the galaxy map and type the HD or HIP name ( HD 10144 or HIP 7588 for Achenar) for that particular star … it will often take you to what you are looking for.

There have been a few in game renamings associated with expansion of the bubble and colonia for example … but not very many in the grand scheme.
