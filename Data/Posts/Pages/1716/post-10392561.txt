Antares [-39,-34]
Antares is an interesting system.

Beta Lyrae [-146,85]
Beta Lyrae is a contact binary. Unfortunately, the game crashes when you visit
it.

Betelgeuse [59,14]
It’s possible to fly through into the atmosphere of the gas-giant Betelgeuse B.

Hadar [-6,-40]
Hadar is an interesting system.

Pleiades [32,32]
There are lots of systems around here with nice-looking stars.

Spica [-4,-17]
Spica is an interesting system.

Vequex [-1,5]
Allegiance: Alliance, joined 3247
Type: Mining
Government: Alliance Democracy
Population: 101,350
Policing: Average — piracy relatively common
Tech: Basic equipment only
Illegal goods: Narcotics, live animals, nerve gas, slaves, battle weapons
Physical: Type M, main sequence, flare star with unusually predictable flare

sequence

It is surprising that this system is inhabited
at all. In fact, the only industry is mining.

If it was just the miners, the system pop-
ulation would be less than 10,000. A large

proportion of the population is in fact mili-
tary in nature, this system being a prime training ground for Alliance Joint Navy

cadets. The other large slice of the population is from the Braben Research In-
stitute, based at a massive orbital city, orbiting the star at 0.4 AU. There are

a number of oddities about this system (the best known being the regularity of
the flare star), and active research continues into many of the phenomena that
have been observed all over the system.
