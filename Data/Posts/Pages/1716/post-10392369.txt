Thanks, that makes things a little clearer! Yep, planetary rings are huge! Without a more precise indication of its location then this Quest loses its attraction as an intellectual puzzle...but I can't imagine MB would have wanted that. It makes sense (if you believe they are valid clues, - I do!) for the right hand panel of the garden design and/or the codex Raxxla logo to provide that precise hint, but I'm just not seeing it. I think the logo hints at an "asteroid station" hidden in a ring, i.e. based on extant Coriolis or asteroid station designs but probably with some handwavium.

Twas Ascorbius who reported that saying. I queried him about it and reported back in this thread (just a few pages ago? ). In my FD Quotes thread (see my signature) there was a link to his Twitch stream where he said it. That link might no longer be valid, but I have also found it by Google search.
Don't forget, the orrery also holds clues. Though they may not be raxxla but DW clues; regardless..

Not my pic but this one kinda shows the garden and how it looks like an orrery.

I don;t want to muddy the waters with this as it doesn't really follow the clues we have from the codex.
