I have special grass that puts out runners that reach over or around the bare patches in the lawn and goes straight into the borders, I have to move it constantly and now looks like my lawn has a comb-over. Vice versa I have flower shoots popping up in the grass.

Maybe we are just doing it wrong, maybe the border should be grass and the lawn should be the flowerbed.
