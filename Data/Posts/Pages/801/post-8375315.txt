Not really ... saw systems (Star +(bh+bh)) + huge star and named as (Star), where masses (Star +(bh+bh)) < huge star
And well, entry point is mostly 1st star on top of map. But extrta rare (like I saw 3-4 times) entry point to system can be on 2nd star on map, maybe 300000ls away from 1st, but system named as 1st.
Maybe it is based on luminosity? I.e. brightest star names ...
It might depends on the gravitational field (i.e. the global deformation of space time in the system). Being related to masses and distances between objects, it could sometimes leads the pilot to be dropped near the not-heaviest star in the system if the field has it highest distortion at that point. I'll try to do the maths later today (but kinda rusty on that point).
