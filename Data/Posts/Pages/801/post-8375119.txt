Alexzk - I don't have the science knowledge you do but general agreement in the forum is the entry point is based on mass, if you have different evidence it will shake it all up or maybe just a bug. Don't know if or what fdev have said on the subject. Luminosity makes sense for the GalMap Primary as that's the one we 'see' from Earth and extrapolate the others?
Actually...A/B-class stars must be deep purple and basically dark for us (as they have most energy in UV diapason). But we see it as we see - in colors which our atmosphere would do. So colors/luminosity correction is used in game.

....i think i saw 1 such double-star in bubble. I just think "oh cool, one more" and didn't pay attention. I think it was some "Gleese" catalog. I think top-most star didn't have planets, all planets and stations were on 2nd at bottom. But star system named as top one.
