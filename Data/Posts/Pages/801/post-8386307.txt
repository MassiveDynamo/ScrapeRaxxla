42% Deadly, only another 928 goid scouts to murder!
Trying to limit myself to a couple of hours play per day to help the rsi. Might have a break at 50% & do some more galactic sightseeing. Anybody doing anything special this isolationary holiday weekend (apart from staying in & ignoring the sunshine)?
