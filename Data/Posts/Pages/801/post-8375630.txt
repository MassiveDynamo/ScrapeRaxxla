I’m out of ideas.

CD-31 1974

There is a Visitor beacon at a gas giant that says the following
View attachment 167836

If you mouse over the belt cluster right next to the gas giant, there is a distinct signal/tone that plays in the background. Sounds like a phone ring, from the caller’s perspective. No other cluster I’ve tried produces this signal. Flying around the clusters, I’ve had some very odd music and sounds come up here and there.

On my phone right now. Will edit in the video in a sec when I get my laptop. Will try to EQ the audio as well to highlight the signal.

Edit: Not sure how to upload an audio file but the signal is around 520Hz. Here's the raw video.

Okey, I'm in that system ... can't hear a bell >: Just normal regular sound of changed target.
Upd: right ... it do sound, beam-beam-beam...pause...beam-beam-beam. Other asteroid field do not

Just to clarify you 2 are talking about the same music effect which is the beam beam beam pause beam beam beam sound... if so, its not unique to that belt. There are other belts which have the same effect.
