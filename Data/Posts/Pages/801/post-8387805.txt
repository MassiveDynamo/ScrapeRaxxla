42% Deadly, only another 928 goid scouts to murder!
Trying to limit myself to a couple of hours play per day to help the rsi. Might have a break at 50% & do some more galactic sightseeing. Anybody doing anything special this isolationary holiday weekend (apart from staying in & ignoring the sunshine)?
Just flew today something like 8000ly mostly without NS .. as hit part between sleeves. Disk was thin there, about +/- 500ly only. Drived SRV some, found 2 planets with alive crystals, 1 with Yttrium and 1 with tellurium or technetium ... so I think such crystals may have any G5 mat random .. They were 25k ls from system entry, however very close to own 2nd star and icy planets.
