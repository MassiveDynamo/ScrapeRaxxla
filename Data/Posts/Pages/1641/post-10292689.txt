just another random thought...

have you tried pointing to and listening to the signal, from the opposite side of a Black Hole?
So while pointing at the signal thru the black hole, so a magnifying glass kinda idea, but with sound? maybe more detail would be visible?
I have done it from Sgr A* but sadly there's no changes. It's a good idea that I wish worked I've no idea if other black holes may get different results though.
