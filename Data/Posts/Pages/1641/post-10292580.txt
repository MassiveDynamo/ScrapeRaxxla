So, if I understand this correctly, you think there might be as many as five other landscape signals out there that have not been found because not enough people drop out in normal space and listen whilst their ship is pointing in the right direction?

What other directions have been checked? e.g. M31 Andromeda, M33 Triangulum, the Magellanic Clouds, the Thargoid system that Probes point to in Col 70 Sector, Merope, Gamma Velorum (Regor), the Horse Head Nebula?

Has there been any work done to determine if the signal has a musical origin? Is there an instrument that produces a spectrum like that or is it synthetic?

Sorry for all the questions!

I guess I am wondering why a puzzle would be hidden in this way - is it the key to Raxxla or something else?

For a single player, I wonder if it would be quicker to head out to the Rim and pan across the Milky Way rather than survey the whole sky from within the Bubble... .

My next task for when I'm able to get in-game is to make sure I've visited more / the rest of the systems I mentioned a few days ago and to check for places that stand out just below them. Interesting system or planet/station names, something giving a clue that it might be close to Raxxla, if you know your Robert Holdstock, which I think will be crucial. (I think I have visited all the tree-runes as well but I can check that).
