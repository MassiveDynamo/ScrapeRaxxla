I wonder if, rather than trying to match the signal to an in-game location, it might better match either a real-world mountain or even a book cover for something by Robert Holdstock? The problem with in-game terrain is that it is now tile-based, meaning there are similar formations everywhere that are rescaled and re-oriented by the procedural generation.
