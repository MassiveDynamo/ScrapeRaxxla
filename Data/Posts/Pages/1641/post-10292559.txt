You say the signal is pretty much the same in Sol as near to the "source". Do we have data on that?
I know people have been looking at it for ages and have judged it to be the same, but is it identical beyond reasonable doubt?
I can only say that from my own tests I would probably not be able to tell you where a recording was made from, only whether it was pointing off at and angle, or more towards the source.

Weirdly the Landscape Signal seems to override the normal background noise of the galaxy in everything but the low frequencies. This seems to be consistent regardless of distance. I've tested it from the Pleiades, half-way between the bubble and Sgr A*, and right next to the source, in Stuemeae JM-W C1-5825.

Definitely worth more testing though, there may be small variations worth noting. At the time I wasn't looking for any differences in the signal, only whether it was basically the same, and most of my research so far has been to determine if anything changes the signal at the source (nothing does so far).
