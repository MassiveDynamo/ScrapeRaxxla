Also, random thoughts...

Has anyone ever taken Ancient Keys, from the Guardian Beacons, to the Anomalies?
Or Thargoid stuff for that matter?

Try flying around, see if they behave differently, jettison them and test....

Anomalies
E-Type Anomaly
K-Type Anomaly
L-Type Anomaly
P-Type Anomaly
Q-Type Anomaly
T-Type Anomaly

Maybe somthing might happen...?
I realize I might just have opened a can of worms, but someone with Corrosion experience and some time, could check it out XD

I'm certainly unable too XD im still out near Beagle Point... and I'm not in the best of situations XD after repairs in BP, I headed out... and lost an SRV...annndd Passed Out on the surface of a planet.... "-_- Oi my life...
Lost all my exo-bio scans since BP, which isnt fun considering those were the first i ever did, ever, lol, lost an SRV, and all for what?
Lol, So I could stand WAY to close to a Lava Gyser in a basic Artemis Suit without any shields turned on.... XD OOOPS lol
Anyways, off to the next adventure lmao....

Headed to a DSSA Fleet Carrier next, on route to the large, oddly shaped Permit Locked Region out here by BP... it has me curious... just wish I had a Key from a Beacon with me for some Guardian theory chasing...


P.s. - Note to Devs.
THANK YOU F.DEV !!! for not having me completely die on the surface of that planet, and lose my ship and go to the great unknown with none of my exploration data...!
I havnt sold the vast bulk of my ships nav data since I left the bubble, expecting a huge payout for first discovered systems with full system scans... was about to rage quit forever after I passed out and thought it was all gone!
Thank You F.dev!
And Happy New Year to All!
