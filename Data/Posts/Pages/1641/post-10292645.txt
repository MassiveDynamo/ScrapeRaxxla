a system in game (relatively close also to Shibboleth)!

Not sure if you know, but Shibboleth is the system featured in the official novel Nemorensis. I assume it's the author's custom system, same as Peregrina, Soontil, etc. There's a section where one of the characters goes into detail about Shibboleth (there's an animal living on the world called the Shibbolethi), the plot gets there about the half-way mark. The Book title links to the whole thing, etc. Not sure if that helps

My initial thoughts on seeing this drawing are the same as when I first saw the landscape signal visual interpretation, namely it made me ask: is this just exactly that - a visual representation of an actual mountain range?

You tracingâ€™s bring this into focus for me, and again make me consider is this simply just a pictorial representation, of some famous mountain range?
Yeah, I think it's literally showing us the Omphalos Rift location. My assumption is that once we get there we'll be able to line up the location and see the same view 'for real'

If we'd found this way back when, before the new scanning systems we'd have to Mk I eyeball the landscape right? This is what we'd be looking for. Maybe we still need to even now we have new planet-scanning tools!
