I believe that the signal is incomplete
This is 11 seconds out of 100-ish seconds of signal. There are traces of other shapes in there but I wanted to get this out here and get feedback on it while I'm working on the rest.

My hope/guess is that the Landscape Signal is essentially a fragmented treasure map.

I wonder if there is more audio that can be found in more specific locations which we can use to 'fill in the blanks' in the Landscape Signal? Much like piecing together a map that's been torn into bits. The key is that the Landscape Signal can only be detected in realspace - how many of us have sat in solar systems in real-space and recorded audio? How many systems? how many planets? I bet not many. Most explorers stay in supercruise most of the time (any why not!)

just another random thought...

have you tried pointing to and listening to the signal, from the opposite side of a Black Hole?
So while pointing at the signal thru the black hole, so a magnifying glass kinda idea, but with sound? maybe more detail would be visible?
