Louis, you said you were recording while flying around - have you got a handy setup where you can watch a spectrogram on one monitor as you play? because that sounds like a great help.
Not sure about Louis,

but I've done something similar to that for other reasons in life, years ago, cant even honestly remember why,
and I had to re-Google the instructions just now on how to do it, and I'm not sure if it works with Audacity because I don't use it and have no idea if Audacity does Spectrum from live Microphone input...

But for anyone, including yourself who wants to try, you can do this in Native Windows;
