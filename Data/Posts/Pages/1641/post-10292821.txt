If you are in the Bubble, there is a potentially related effort underway due to an NPC faction named The Link. They are presently 2nd in terms of influence in NLTT 46621. A war just broke out for control of the system this morning. There should be ample space and ground combat opportunities. Anyways, this is why we are pushing to get them in power and have anyone interested get allied. The hope is there are Raxxla-linked missions for this particular faction.
