I am wondering where Artemis fits into this ^^

There is a system called Sin and I think a few with death or death-god-related names (e.g. Anubis, which I visited today and is an empty system).

I have also found a few Eve-related names (e.g. Maev, Maeve).

There are many mythologies present in system names so I think we have to look at what is common, rather than asking which is the correct one to use.
This will hopefully give an indication of a path to follow. (e.g. Persephone to Bridge, then Sin, not sure where after that.)
I am back to thinking that there is a route-as-password and we have to pass through key systems in the correct order for the final jump to allow Raxxla to be visible, or perhaps just to be sure we are arriving at the right system.
I still hope that checking ring systems in the correct system is the way to go, rather than depending on taking the right heading for millions of Ls into deep space. My investigations have taught me that unmapped bodies are extremely rare and even remote bodies have first footfalls, so I do not think Raxxla is something that will show up on a scan of any kind.
