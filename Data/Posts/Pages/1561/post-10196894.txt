King rank does not unlock anything that I'm aware of (same for the final Federal Auxiliary Navy rank). (I have both just in case they are needed for anything).

There is a system called Rex but I don't think there's anything there ( I have data on it and visited nearby systems today but did not go back for that reason).

Looking back at Rochester's diagrams showing the triangles of the Greek Triad goddesses and the Midgard-Alioth-Bifrost, they both align to form pyramids with Axis Mundi and Artemis may be a clue as to what distance from Axis Mundi to look within those pyramids. This is still a lot to search, even if this is the correct way of reading it. That is why the route is so important.

A further complication is that some of these systems were in the previous games and one of the lore videos (forget which but it was one of the Michael Brookes ones) mentioned that they had to be stretched a bit to fit into the ED galaxy (though I suppose stretching could have been done to make sure that they lined up in the right way for us to find a route to Raxxla...).

I did some searching nearer Hecate today but I wandered about the place a lot, aiming for named systems with no population. The only thing I found in passing was a listening post pointing to the Generation Ship where there was a child 'saviour' who persuaded the population to space themselves looking for the promised land... .
