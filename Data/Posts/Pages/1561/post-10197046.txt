Laphria, a surname of Artemis among the Calydonians
It's a lot more than that. Please read up on the Laphria festival on Wikipedia. Welcome to the dark side of the lore. There is ritual sacrifice related to the King. Nemorensis (official novel by Simon Spurrier) is all about this ritualistic sacrifice. The leadership of humanity got infected. This is why dichotomy is central to the lore. I really cannot say more. Suffice it say I was trying to be cautious when I earlier stated humans were different from other species but we are running out of time (see today's GalNet). The traditional-branch figured out a way to get back at us for pulling a Prometheus and stealing the secret of Raxxla. It is a cycle the must be broken at ANY COST.
