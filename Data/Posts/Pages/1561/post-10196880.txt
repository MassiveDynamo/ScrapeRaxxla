I am wondering where Artemis fits into this ^^

Very much this. Looking at Legacy - the story also has two characters Selene and Sabiha Mehta … who could be described as related to Artemis and well the Moon. Also curious about Darik and Darius …. Both meaning Darius … also with his father Rex. And of course the Twin Vipers and two Eagles relating to the axis.

Artemis relating to the Moon and Orion and arguably Sagittarius….

King? - Imperials? ….Achenar?

This could be pointing at an Axis between Achenar and Orion…. Or maybe we need King rank to access a secret imperial base on the moon by flying in at a particular azimuth…... Or is there a system unlock at king rank we need to look at?
