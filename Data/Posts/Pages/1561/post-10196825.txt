Alioth has the following:
Station: Golden Gate (Heaven reference) orbiting the gas giant Bifrost. Bifrost is the burning rainbow bridge of Norse cosmogony. There is a separate system named Bifrost that is 102.99 LY distance. @Rochester would this be the bridge you are looking for?
Thats one possibility I’ve previously entertained, but disregarded due to an absence of correlative evidence. Until recently.

It could help us determine the hemisphere of heaven, because just below it is the system Hera - wife of Zeus. Thing is are there any systems there about which could denote a ‘Paradise of fools’?

Now if that’s true - then Eden (Raxxla) is anywhere potentially between the realm of the gods and the realm of demons! There are some weird systems in this area, remember Shibboleth and the Sampo, lest we forget Mary’s journey to Acadia!

It’s still this same general area… question is; is this accurate to Raxxla or something else or is it obfuscation!

Note there is a ‘Cockaigne’ system within the Lost Realms area!
