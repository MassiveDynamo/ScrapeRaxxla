seeing how the clues might fit with Milton i am struck by his Arcades…

“But els in deep of night when drowsines
Hath lockt up mortal sense, then listen I
To the celestial Sirens harmony,
That sit upon the nine enfolded Sphears
And sing to those that hold the vital shears [ 65 ]
And turn the Adamantine spindle round,
On which the fate of gods and men is wound.
Such sweet compulsion doth in musick ly,
To lull the daughters of Necessity,
And keep unsteddy Nature to her law, [ 70 ]
And the low world in measur'd motion draw
After the heavenly tune, which none can hear
Of human mould with grosse unpurged ear;
And yet such musick worthiest were to blaze
The peerles height of her immortal praise, [ 75 ]
Whose lustre leads us, and for her most fit,
If my inferior hand or voice could hit
Inimitable sounds, yet as we go,
What ere the skill of lesser gods can show,
I will assay, her worth to celebrate, [ 80 ]
And so attend ye toward her glittering state;
Where ye may all that are of noble stemm
Approach, and kiss her sacred vestures hemm.”

Has - listening , sirens. Spheres, Necessity(fate), and the spindle (axis)

But mostly is talking about listening to the heavenly music to find her…

Arcades - Arcadia - phillip Sidney - Artemis

The two vipers were Darius and Simeon
Darius the great king … and Simeon… the one who listens….

Maybe back to listening for things?
In the Arcadian Stream?
