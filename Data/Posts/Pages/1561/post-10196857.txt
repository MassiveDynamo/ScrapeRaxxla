Midgard was actually in the lower celestial realm in Norse mythology, if you follow traditional galactic north in game itâ€™s unusually too far north, but when you apply the Greek compas theory, it fists perfectly in line with Bifrost which seemingly is now in the heavens and very close by to Alfheim which was described as being the highest level of the Norse universe.

Again this goes to confirm my hypothesis that using the Greek winds denotes the correct alignment of Yggdrasil!

Outstanding!!!


*Purple denotes, Midgard (bottom) Alioth then Bifrost (top). Alfheim is highlighted. Green denotes the Greek wind compass.

White denotes the Triad Greek goddesses focusing upon Persephone, with the Lost Realms area opposite.
