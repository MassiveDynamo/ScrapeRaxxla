Very much this. Looking at Legacy - the story also has two characters Selene and Sabiha Mehta … who could be described as related to Artemis and well the Moon. Also curious about Darik and Darius …. Both meaning Darius … also with his father Rex. And of course the Twin Vipers and two Eagles relating to the axis.

Artemis relating to the Moon and Orion and arguably Sagittarius….

King? - Imperials? ….Achenar?

This could be pointing at an Axis between Achenar and Orion…. Or maybe we need King rank to access a secret imperial base on the moon by flying in at a particular azimuth…... Or is there a system unlock at king rank we need to look at?

Looking at Legacy - Possible clues/Mythological references (from Wikipedia):

Artemis, goddess of chastity, hunting, and the moon

Laphria, a surname of Artemis among the Calydonians

Darius, the Great a Persian king of kings

Selene, goddess and personification of the Moon, aka Mene, often identified with Artemis. Roman equivalent was Luna. Selene and Artemis were also associated with Hecate (a daughter of Demeter and sister to Persephone).

Julia, gens Julia was one of the most prominent patrician families in ancient Rome. Only daughter of first Roman emperor Augustus. The name Julia means “youthful” or “Jove's child” and was once an imperial Roman name given to those born in the house of Julius Caesar.

Demeter, Olympian goddess of the harvest, agricultural fertility and protector of marriage and women, health & birth (Roman counterpart: Ceres)

Lina Mater (Gentle Mother)

Mmm, isnt Ram Tah based at Meene?
