Also smack-dab in the heart of the Alliance... contrasting with the lost realms which are in Imperial space.

...wait. puts on tinfoil

There's a bunch of threes all over the Raxxla story, including the Miltonian Heaven/World/Hell trio. You know what else is in threes in the ED verse?
Superpowers.

The Federation is based on Sol - can't get more earthly than that.
The Empire is "below" it according to the reference frame we adopted, and we found a ton of Underworld-related stars there.
Which would leave the Alliance, being "above" Federal space, as the heavenly counterpart - and the (3296-era) Bubble as the cosmos.

Unfortunately it's still working hours here, buuuuuut I just got intrigued with this line of thought.

EDIT: I'm having this hunch that our traditional navigational stars (which ) might play a role - the Oisir-Raxxla of the book were presumably using them as a reference when on Earth, after all.
You probably need to include Lave, Zaonce (new financial capital), and the old financial capital Andceeth (it had the Trouble Vault and was subjected to Wrekcht's Raid). Andceeth is the only other human system that has a planet named Capitol other than Achenar.

Lave is further above than Sol. Zaonce is obviously close to Lave. Andceeth is about 104 LY away from Lave itself.
