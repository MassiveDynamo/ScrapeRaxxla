These are all potential possibilities, we need to investigate because there does seem to be multiple possibilities.

We have the region of hell in the Greek underworld, and it too is mixed in with Holdstockâ€™s Lost Realms.

Holdstock attributes Eden as being similarly to these, as a lost realm. Where as Milton proposes Eden is fixed between heaven and hell.

The codex it might be presumed, then tells us to follow (in my opinion) the path of Persephone to the underworld, it then describes the Holdstock realm. The Brookes tour takes us there also?

So is Raxxla in the lost realms area or is it above it? Or is it elsewhere, because hell is likewise a perversion of heaven, so it too might sit below this region!

Is Lucifers viaduct in game, or is that too much of one particular influence over another?

We also have the path of Jacques, which does intersect a system called Bridge!
