Alioth has the following:
Station: Golden Gate (Heaven reference) orbiting the gas giant Bifrost. Bifrost is the burning rainbow bridge of Norse cosmogony. There is a separate system named Bifrost that is 102.99 LY distance. @Rochester would this be the bridge you are looking for?
Also smack-dab in the heart of the Alliance... contrasting with the lost realms which are in Imperial space.

...wait. puts on tinfoil

There's a bunch of threes all over the Raxxla story, including the Miltonian Heaven/World/Hell trio. You know what else is in threes in the ED verse?
Superpowers.

The Federation is based on Sol - can't get more earthly than that.
The Empire is "below" it according to the reference frame we adopted, and we found a ton of Underworld-related stars there.
Which would leave the Alliance, being "above" Federal space, as the heavenly counterpart - and the (3296-era) Bubble as the cosmos.

Unfortunately it's still working hours here, buuuuuut I just got intrigued with this line of thought.

EDIT: I'm having this hunch that our traditional navigational stars (which include both Alioth and Achenar) might play a role - the Oisir-Raxxla of the book were presumably using them as a reference when on Earth, after all.
