Don't know if you guys are flying with "orbits off" (I do!), maybe turning it ON allow to detect things from afar as the orbit is visible well before the orbiting object?

Another idea: did someone checked the rear of the Dark Wheel station in Shinrarta? Since the picture in the codex show it from behind, maybe there's something to be found looking at the back of stations (listening to coms, an inscription..).
I flew over one yesterday (not Shirarta as I did not have hit Elite yet), and there are antennas and other thingies that produce sounds.
