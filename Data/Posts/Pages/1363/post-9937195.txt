It bugged me for some time, after listening (again) for the codex entry "Pilot Federation" I believe it is intentional.
The logo used for the codex entry TDW is reminiscent of the Pilot Federation logo, while the Raxxla codex entry uses TDW logo.
There might be a way, something we are missing.
I can't believe it will be solved just by looking around. There's something to unlock in a specific way, something to do.
Maybe.
