Specifically, burn this into your brains:

"I would say his intention was always to include Raxxla, The Dark Wheel, and references that would provide a narrative continuance. I worked with that in mind, preserving and developing the hints given in the background from Frontier: Elite 2 and Frontier First Encounters. I don't know how far they got on game implementation of that narrative but he would always reply confidently that it was in the game."

- Allen Stroud, 2021, this thread.

Raxxla is a Holdstock invention, he developed the concepts for the Dark Wheel novella not DB nor IB, they of course gave him contexts for the game mechanics but it was Holdstock who developed the Raxxla myth.

Raxxla is a Holdstock Invention but based on a whole set of mythic traditions. It is the path of enlightenment*

*I am adding a caveat because I suspect it is enlightenment with a twist.... Just like Utopias are never wonderful places and sometime esoteric paths of clues turn out to be someones laundry list. Or maybe the god of enlightenment is Yog Sothoth...

Also worth mentioning that Holdstock's books (not TDW) are not public domain and FD do not hold the rights to any of those stories or characters.

Authors take characters and storylines from other authors all the time. One chain of stories comes to mind.... Jorge Luis Borges wrote Death and the Compass ... Stansislaw Lem wrote the Chain of Chance ..... Umberto Eco wrote Foucaults Pendulum.
