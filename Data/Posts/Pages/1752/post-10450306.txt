FE2 didn't have any story line or scripted missions. There were lots of ships, a sett of different missions and a nice galaxy. Nothing more.
It' was a nice game, but it felt empty quite quickly. Nothing ever changed, except your rank and bank account.

FE2 is probably one of the technically most impressive games ever made. DB wrote the original Amiga version entirely in assembly code. The game fit on a single floppy disk.
I played Frontier specifically on an Amiga 1200 in the 199x. And just from a floppy disk.
Yes there were no Thargoids there, but that doesn't prove there couldn't be Raxxla. Or is showing other galaxies just a code error?
