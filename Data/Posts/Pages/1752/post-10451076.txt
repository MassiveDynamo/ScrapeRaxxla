I disagree strongly with almost anything that talks about Holdstock's non-Elite work.

Ok thats fine - but i would argue that you are missing out an a big part. I get you are focused on the nifty hidden-image at the centerish of the Galaxy. But Id say there is a reason it is there and it has to do with the path... and the Path is Lore... And lore (well the story i guess actually - Awen) especially in this case is made of allusions and references to things that arent always right in front of us. The reason I keep mentioning the Langford Basalisk from the FFE Journals is i believe the thing in the Center you are interested in - is a new Elite version of it.

A bit about the storyline in elite ive noticed:
A while back we had Marlinists who were fighting the empire.... Theta group folks... they were called The Nine Martyrs - ive linked to a site about the actual Nine Martyrs of Orthodox Christianity - look at the last name on the list. The Nine has another meaning - Ennead the name of a system and one of the Marlinist Ships... There is also the Nine Maidens who stoked the fire below the Cauldron... I believe we are on the path to Annwn one way or another.

Drew Wagar is a massive fan of Elite 1984 almost exclusively, and TDW novella, and is also a fan of mythology and mystery as well as being an author with all the influences that brings. Almost everything he created for Elite or helped with is rich in allusions to The Dark Wheel Novella and mythology.

Regarding Drew.... Im not trying to speak for him but id say- yes he is a big fan and a writer - im sure he understands the allusions he is using and he has been looking for raxxla longer than most of us- he is also under NDA. As to the comparison of Characters its pointless if you arent interested in looking at Holdstocks work.
