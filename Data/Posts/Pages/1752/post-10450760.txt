I played Frontier specifically on an Amiga 1200 in the 199x. And just from a floppy disk.
Yes there were no Thargoids there, but that doesn't prove there couldn't be Raxxla. Or is showing other galaxies just a code error?
I urge you to watch Drew's Lore tour 7
He knows a great deal about Elite and what went on back at the beginning and explains why Raxxla was pretty much not in the first games.
