I played Frontier specifically on an Amiga 1200 in the 199x. And just from a floppy disk.
Yes there were no Thargoids there, but that doesn't prove there couldn't be Raxxla. Or is showing other galaxies just a code error?
The other galaxies are the same galaxy. It's just overflow in the code. Same as the worm-hole bug.
