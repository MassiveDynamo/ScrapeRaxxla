Has anyone attempted to utilize "CHAT GPT"? It's reported that it has the answer's to just about everything. And even agrees that the secret to life is 42! Which I've never ever seen utilized in any of the equation's involving where is Raxxla.

These tools are just echo chambers, put rubbish in - get rubbish out, put actual information in - get spurious tripe and polarised misinformation out.
