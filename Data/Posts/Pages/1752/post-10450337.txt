I played Frontier specifically on an Amiga 1200 in the 199x. And just from a floppy disk.
Yes there were no Thargoids there, but that doesn't prove there couldn't be Raxxla. Or is showing other galaxies just a code error?
As already stated (many, many times now), that game has been entirely taken apart and Raxxla does not exist in any prior game. Full stop.

It's worth remembering that Raxxla wasn't really ever a Braben thing. It's probably only in Elite Dangerous because of a bunch of fans of the lore working on the game.
