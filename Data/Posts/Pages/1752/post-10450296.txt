I'm sorry, I didn't quite follow you.
You mean the special names of planets and systems? (like the Sun)
Or the fact that if you zoom out on the galaxy map, you can see other galaxies?
FE2 didn't have any story line or scripted missions. There were lots of ships, a sett of different missions and a nice galaxy. Nothing more.
It' was a nice game, but it felt empty quite quickly. Nothing ever changed, except your rank and bank account.

FE2 is probably one of the technically most impressive games ever made. DB wrote the original Amiga version entirely in assembly code. The game fit on a single floppy disk.
