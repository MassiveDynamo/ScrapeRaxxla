I didn't think to use camera mode. I think camera mode may have different factors to it. I don't think you can see the andromeda galaxy in normal cockpit mode. It seems to be a part of a different layer. If the camera mode fixes that that would be convenient. Not to mention the ability to fly around with your view to make it easier to locate objects. I always forget that mode exists.

I'll go back to maia later and try to find the quad star setup. I should have taken a screenshot the first time. 8)

I see it while driving to the B lack hole. I think.

Right to the left of the screen above the heatsinks. Unless this is a different star pattern they stick out more in the black hole region. Almost like it's emphasizing them.
SPOILER

Hard to say, I keep finding more quad stars. I swore I saw some that were sticking out more than others in the black hole area.

Does anyone know of a black hole more aligned with those nebula heading towards the bernard nebula. I'm trying to find one that has them aligned like a planetary alignment. I want to see if it does anything odd. 8)

On another odd note. Has anyone tried getting right up to a wormhole then using the galaxy map to find a system on the other side and warp to it while physically against the black holes exclusion zone? Maybe in the right circumstances we could actually use a blackhole to warp somehow. I wonder if you could line up with that hip 13044 system or something odd like that or get to places you couldn't normally. Maybe while in a cobra of some sort. ><
