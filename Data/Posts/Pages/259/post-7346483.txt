I think those two are the cluster of planets in the system. Those were the ones I was looking at at one point. What is odd is that if seen in the correct location it or another similar set of stars show up as a perfect sqaure while in the blackhole area. This only occured while close to the black whole but not looking directly through the black hole. I tried to line it up to look through the black hole directly. But I ended up either loosing site of the sqaure of stars or it stopped looking like a square and went back to that two planet pattern... I still don't now what it was.

Those clusters are inner system bodies/small disks of bodies.

Did you see another set of inner system stars like that that form a square? I'm still not sure what I was looking at for certain. But it was potentially odd.
