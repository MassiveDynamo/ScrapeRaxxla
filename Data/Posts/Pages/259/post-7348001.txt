Could we say that Ananke is “the mother of galaxies” then? If so, what’s and what’s in her ‘brow’?

Edit: Also, do we know the toast of TDW is before or after Raxxla jumped away? I kinda missed that.

Ananke and a bunch of other goddesses would qualify. Most gods from common ancient religions have a system named after them.

I have no idea what would be the jewel(star or planet) on her brow.
