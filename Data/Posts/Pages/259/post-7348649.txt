I've got a fellow player, who works on the Canonn R&D team, potentially making a tool to show a list of systems within a set number of ly that fits the parameters of a Gas Giant with 8 moons (Based off of EDSM data of course).

I pulled the recent systems list from https://eddb.io/api , dumped it into SQL, but it doesn't contain the moon info.
The main bodies says it's no longer available, so I never went further trying to script a list from the database info.

i'm on DW2, and actively searching gas giants + 8 moons, but nothing so far
