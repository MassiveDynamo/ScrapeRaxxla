Ok, I'm new here, but I have a theory which I cant see many people discussing.....

I think there is a good chance that The Dark Wheel in Shinrata are fake. Not least because they operate in the open, but also because lots of people have allied with them and found nothing. If this is true, then the lore and rumours imply that you need the "real" dark wheel's help to find Raxxla. The real dark wheel only accept a few exceptional commanders from each generation and it is pointless trying to find them.... they have to approach you.... Initially in disguise. I believe there are only a few hundred triple elite commanders. Perhaps when 3xelite cmdrs get a random 50k credit job pop up, whilst in-flight, from a random fraction they have never heard of, they dismiss it out of hand, when in fact it's a dark wheel test mission?

Any thoughts?
