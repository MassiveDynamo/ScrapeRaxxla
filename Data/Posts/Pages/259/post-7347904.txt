On page 322, CMDR GURU explains his groups findings, and so far I think they're the best source of Raxxla info thus far.

Everything has an incredible link to Greek mythology, including the Thargoid interceptors - named Cyclops, Basilisk, Medusa and Hydra, respectively. I think this is enough proof to say that the Thargoids and Raxxla are intertwined.

We also know that the only member of the Dark Wheel that we've heard of since 1984 is the former senator Kahina Tijani Loren, may she rest in peace. She was known to have stolen meta-alloys from Darnielle's Progress - forty something, if I remember correctly? Why would the Dark Wheel need meta-alloys?

Anyways, as I write this, I sit in my newly built Imperial Courier, the Seven Veils, with a pair of meta-alloys in my hold outside of a Thargoid surface site. Unsure of what to do from here on out, but I'll keep looking.
