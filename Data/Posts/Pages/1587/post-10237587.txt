Honestly I don’t believe it goes that deep, @Allen Stroud has confirmed already what the lore is/isn’t. Anything else is personal role playing.

I propose the elements I’m entertaining don’t correspond to lore at all. I think they are intentionally placed outside of the wider game concept, certainly well researched and placed in accordance with a specific plan by person/s with a great deal of insight into fiction and pan-European mythology.

I suspect this is separate from the rest of the game and is focused solely upon Holdstock, Raxxla and very possibly a now archived wider narrative or at a minimum an elaborate Raxxla quest seeped in Holdstockian and Miltonian references, which we’ll never get to see.

I do now have a very strong suspicion Brookes statement regarding a journey we all must take, was his coy sense of humour playing out, describing the very real architecture he laid out in game, which lead towards his abstract concept of an ‘Otherworld’, an ‘Eden’.

I can speculate that originally this may have been narratively locked through missions etc, but it was bugged and / or clashed with some other project and possibly I suspect later retconned.

I don’t presume to speculate this is some wider esoteric mythical concept based upon certain particular world views, lore or history, but simply a geo-spacial map, a series of systems grouped together utilising certain naming system based upon various shared relationships, linked to Norse and Celtic mythology, but with direction, and a central focal point borrowed from a shared concept built from a reference to Holdstock and Milton.

Nothing more. I honestly don’t believe it goes beyond this.

Of course I could be wrong.
