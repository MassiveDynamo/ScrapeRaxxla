Agreed. Part of the problem here is the cultural component of names that are apparently used by Federation vs Empire. We then have Universal Cartographics bolted on top of this. If it was straightforward investigation that would be simpler. Yes, core lore is essentially 3100 - present. The Raxxla mythos is buried in the deep lore covering 1960s - 3309. Technically, I guess the actual deep lore covers millions of years when you factor the Guardians. Also, Alien World's timelines possibly go back to nearly Permian period on Earth and when Mars used to have oceans. There's a non-trivial amount of educated guesswork from snippets of clues.

Also, are we currently working with the idea the Martian Relic is actually Guardian? I think based on the statue from Mitterand Hollow that would be my most likely choice. Yet, those same unregistered comms beacons are what first lead to crashed Thargoids.

The problem is search realistically involves being a historian, astrobiology, astronomy and understanding stellar lifecycles, sorting through piles of propaganda from the superpowers, figuring out what the Pilots' Federation deal is in all this, and tracking of people bound and determined to keep their actions secret. If this was straight science, we would have a lot easier time in making progress.
