Also, are we currently working with the idea the Martian Relic is actually Guardian?
As with so much, it's anyone's guess. For me though, I think it's most likely to be either Thargoid or Guardian.

In the interview with DJ Truthsayer MB discusses the Relic briefly.

SPOILER












If you watch the video when MB mentions it, it looks to me like he knows what the Relic is and is excited by it. He segues from the Relic into Thargoids almost immediately, which might indicate that he was associating the Relic with Thargoids, or not, hard to tell - if the Relic was Guardian then MB might have been thinking about the connection between Guardians and Thargoids there, who knows. He might just have been replying to DJ's earlier comment about Thargoids.

However, I'm not sure any of this means Raxxla at all. It could do, but it might just have been the introduction of a new alien race to the Elite galaxy, or part of the reintroduction of the Thargoids - or some other seed for some other storyline that MB dreamt up and was keeping in his pocket, or could have been something Fdev decided was always going to remain a fun mystery with no answer.
