The Horizons trailer opens to Moonshot speech by President John F. Kennedy. Curiously, the Moon and the Kennedy brothers are literally the first thing mentioned in Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide. Remember, we found out about Raxxla because of the misbuilt Talmor Lens at Earth. The lore includes so much more than just 3100 -3309.

"We choose to go to the Moon in this decade..."

You literally cannot have Raxxla without Earth prominently featuring into the lore.
