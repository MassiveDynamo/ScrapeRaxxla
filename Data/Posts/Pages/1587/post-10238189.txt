Yup that’s another obvious link there isn’t, I can’t begin to break down that text because technically it’s old lore, and Holdstock built it himself with little assistance from Bell nor Braben, it was from my own recollection his own work.

But certainly when Brookes began on the Raxxla method for Elite Dangerous such a reference would have been very obvious and it only goes I presume to tie in this mythology between both games.

I do wonder how much said system has relevance today, what else from that text could also have import?
We've seen many times there's a lot of correlation between some parts of The Dark Wheel and current in-game texts.

Maybe it just means that you're on the right track? At least thinking about the same things at Brookes maybe was.
