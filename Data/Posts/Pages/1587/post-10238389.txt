This feels like it's got legs to me.

In TDW Ryder Snr. was killed by the people that protected Raxxla, basically. The Codex says that Raxxla is protected/controlled by powerful people. The Dark Wheel members needing to be Elite ensures they can fight well enough to defend themselves from those people, etc.

Interacting with the mission system is really the oldest 'power' we've had in Elite, it makes sense that Fdev would make use of that system as part of the Raxxla 'story'.

I've no idea how to take this any further though, the factions have changed considerably since launch so it's likely harder than ever to know where to look? Would you know if a faction that's currently in he Lost Realms was always there? I suppose you'd have to look on EDDB or INARA at the faction shifts over time or something?
If it’s faction driven it ought to be possible to map it (an aspect I’ve not looked into given the initial size of this problem) but now potentially this is much-much smaller?)).

FD is rather possessive over their narrative, they have been known to reset the BGS to suit their needs, or even flip a system status from Anarchy to stable in a day to protect a certain system.

If factions are in play then those will be a ‘fixture’ just as much as systems or bodies names, their reputation may be in tatters but I very much doubt they would have been eradicated.

For instance: in Ross 788 (a Micheal Brookes system) the controlling faction is the ‘Defence Party of Nastrond’, this is the same faction required to obtain the permit for the locked system ‘Nastrond’ (a Norse named system part of the Yggdrasil systems), coincidence?

Currently not in the mood to build a faction matrix. Again it’s not difficult, just a spreadsheet, and likely can be undertaken via a 3rd party site in a matter of hours or days, if the mood strikes!
