If it’s faction driven it ought to be possible to map it (an aspect I’ve not looked into given the initial size of this problem) but now potentially this is much-much smaller?)).

FD is rather possessive over their narrative, they have been known to reset the BGS to suit their needs, or even flip a system status from Anarchy to stable in a day to protect a certain system.

If factions are in play then those will be a ‘fixture’ just as much as systems or bodies names, their reputation may be in tatters but I very much doubt they would have been eradicated.

For instance: in Ross 788 (a Micheal Brookes system) the controlling faction is the ‘Defence Party of Nastrond’, this is the same faction required to obtain the permit for the locked system ‘Nastrond’ (a Norse named system part of the Yggdrasil systems), coincidence?

Currently not in the mood to build a faction matrix. Again it’s not difficult, just a spreadsheet, and likely can be undertaken via a 3rd party site in a matter of hours or days, if the mood strikes!
Well, if you ever do I'll be happy to help check factions or whatever. I'm not sure how long I'll be with the Landscape Expedition but if it can be done remotely (by looking on INARA or whatever) I'll be happy to help if you need it.
