There may be literary links between the romantic idea of ‘pastoral’ poetry of Sidney and that of the Celtic concept of ‘Otherworld’. Its generally accepted early Irish / Celt mythology was ‘appropriated’ and underwent some merger with Roman/Greek concepts, as it did with the gods / goddess etc. Later this evolved into the concept of a fairy realm.

As I re-read the Codex it seems that many elements are drawing upon this theme, again this is an abstract concept, not a literal one and I’m likely grasping at straws, but I do wonder if the reference to Princess Astrophel is a specific link to some cross-over text when 1500 poets rambled on about fairies (although I used to appropriate that with the ‘fairy queen’ aka Queeny),

Needs more digging…
