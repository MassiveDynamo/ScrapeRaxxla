@Rochester, I just found this in some older notes, relevant (maybe?) to your ideas? You've probably already thought of this, apologies if so.

In the original Dark Wheel novella, Alex Ryder's co-pilot is Elyssia Fields = Elysian Fields.

The Dark Wheel: " 'Trader Fields', she said, and touched the heel of her right hand to her left shoulder by way of salute. 'My given name is Elyssia. Elyssia Fields.' She smiled again. 'My brood mother's little joke. She discovered Greek mythology at age 9 when she was incubating her first cluster."
