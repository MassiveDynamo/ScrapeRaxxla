I have long wondered if being allied with a faction might not be the key. FD and Braben himself did say “they got it wrong” that they wanted players to interact more with the smaller factions. This basically is a big area of the game that’s been ignored by many.

Potentially they said ‘ we know why players can’t find it’ does this relate to our behaviour, failure to interact in a certain way? Are there mission systems in place for Raxxla, is there some faction, some tyrant or cabal that is the key, or is there some type of ‘environmental storytelling’ going on, references, names etc that indicate some collective relationship?
This feels like it's got legs to me.

In TDW Ryder Snr. was killed by the people that protected Raxxla, basically. The Codex says that Raxxla is protected/controlled by powerful people. The Dark Wheel members needing to be Elite ensures they can fight well enough to defend themselves from those people, etc.

Interacting with the mission system is really the oldest 'power' we've had in Elite, it makes sense that Fdev would make use of that system as part of the Raxxla 'story'.

I've no idea how to take this any further though, the factions have changed considerably since launch so it's likely harder than ever to know where to look? Would you know if a faction that's currently in he Lost Realms was always there? I suppose you'd have to look on EDDB or INARA at the faction shifts over time or something?
