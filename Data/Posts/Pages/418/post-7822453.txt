Well we dont' know anything at all - not a thing other than whats stated for fact in the codex which is almost nothing. But thats why its fun (although the gloss is wearing thin, I must say)

We have to be reasonable - the FSS can pick up a farting geyser from 1M ls away... it can find something the size of a planet - they more or less gave it to us to find TDW and Raxxla.. (thats conjecture, of course)
