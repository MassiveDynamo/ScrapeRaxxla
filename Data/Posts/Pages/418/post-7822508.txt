Nah, definitely Merope on the left. The Thargoid Sensor points to Merope (which is reflected symbolically in the image), and the system diagram is an exact match for Merope.

And no, everything here isn't just rumours. Depends who's active at any given time, but plenty of us make a pretty clear distinction of fact (and accuracy of those facts) versus rumours.

The issue with Raxxla of course, is that there is so little that is actual verifiable fact. Macros keeps the OP up to date with genuine stuff though.

Even when it comes to rumours, there's different kinds of rumours that need to be treated differently (IMHO). The stuff in the Codex for example is rumour, but essentially official rumour. At the other end of the scale you've got the stuff that just goes around the houses. Stuff from Fan Fic. Various hoaxes etc. Then there's various degrees of things in between.

Anyway, you get the idea.

(On the statement from Canonn, I'd be very surprised if it wasn't just a case of it being very out of date. Han Zen's already given the latest situation anyway so nothing more to add on that really.)

You forget to mention the trolls, there have been a few of those!
And yes, that Canonn statement about the pictogram originated a couple of years ago when we were trying to decipher it. The trouble is that things get written down & then forgotten about so they donâ€™t get updated.
