Actually that indicates that the planet is orbiting the barycenter of a binary (or multiple) star. You can tell by the body naming scheme - if a planet is orbiting stars A and B, it will have the name AB1. They're not rogue since they're in fixed orbits (although they may be rouge).
Huh, on the orbiting plane the planet didn’t revolve around either star, in fact it didn’t have an orbital plane from what I remembered I just assumed an X indicated it had no orbital plane. Oh well there’s something I need to land on then, a rouge planet huehuehue
