Pics or it didn't happen and all that.

But it sounds very suspiciously like you're not talking about rogue planets. What you're describing is planets orbiting a barycentre - they're pretty common. They're still gravitationally bound, not rogue.

(For reference, everything orbiting orbits a barycentre. It's just that in a system with the majority of the mass in a single body (such as our solar system, or say a satellite going round the Earth) then the barycentre is inside that body.)

Edit - pic confirms that it's as above, but ninja'd by Drew anyway!
