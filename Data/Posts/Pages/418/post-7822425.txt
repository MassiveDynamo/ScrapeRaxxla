Iâ€™ve found a few in my journeys, they will have an X symbol on the system map with a line drawn away indicating they orbit no celestial bodie

Actually that indicates that the planet is orbiting the barycenter of a binary (or multiple) star. You can tell by the body naming scheme - if a planet is orbiting stars A and B, it will have the name AB1. They're not rogue since they're in fixed orbits (although they may be rouge).
