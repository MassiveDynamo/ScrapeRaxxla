Pics or it didn't happen and all that.

But it sounds very suspiciously like you're not talking about rogue planets. What you're describing is planets orbiting a barycentre - they're pretty common. They're still gravitationally bound, not rogue.

(For reference, everything orbiting orbits a barycentre. It's just that in a system with the majority of the mass in a single body (such as our solar system, or say a satellite going round the Earth) then the barycentre is inside that body.)
Didn’t take a picture of the orbital plane... it was just a plant that sat in between the two stars which gave some amazing in game screen shots, both stars had an asteroid belt around them with this planet sat in the middle of the two as they had the same solar masses (from what I remembered) but yes I do think it’s a barycentre planet.
