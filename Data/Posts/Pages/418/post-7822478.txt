The codex only makes four positive statements for Raxxla:
Raxxla is a place (consistent with the 'its in the milky way' quote)
It holds a 'mystical' secret
The myth existed well before 2296
The location of [R] is a deadly secret
Thats it. Everything else in the codex is 'the myth says' or ' in some versions' etc. i.e. maybes.

In TDW codex the only positive statement is 'Finding Raxxla is their principal aim', which of course means they haven't found it yet after hundreds of years..

everything else is a maybe..
