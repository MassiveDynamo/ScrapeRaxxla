Could be Raxxla that Halsey saw. However, as I recall it, Halsey was abducted by god-like creatures and that doesn't sound like anything Raxxla. Smiled at the last sentence in the article

I asked Jackie about the system names, and nothing notable came to light.

I think Halsey got to do a reverse Tron thing and visited Frontier's Headquarters. She described god-like creatures because she met her creators.

I used to play a lot of Interactive Fiction back in the 80s and remember one of the Infocom titles where the player encounters some of the "Implementors" (game designers). The encounter sounded very similar to what Halsey claimed to have encountered in that Galnet article.

There has been some speculation in scientific circles that our universe could be a simulation running on an advanced computer. In the case of Elite Dangerous WE know that the galaxy is a simulation. Halsey doesn't know it cause she's an NPC. She is part of the simulation. She met her creators and mistook programmers as her god.
