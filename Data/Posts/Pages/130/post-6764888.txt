FINE... FINE... I will go to some of them after I pass the galactic core... sheesh! I have been cured from space madness three times now but hey, 4 times is the charm no?

About to head there to. Maybe we could wing up?

BTW I have bookmarked all those Systems. Am I being a bit too imaginative or does the shape drawn by all of them in the galaxy look like a stickman with a Long neck Standing on the Galaxy Center? I'm not at home so cannot upload screenshot.
