As for the likelihood of the random names not meaning anything. Does the naming convention have any history in the game franchise or have any reason to be thought of by an NPC? It could be if it's in a *Raxxla* system that is a hint to it's location. Maybe the NPC's and other used the naming convention to name the planet/location. But left it vague on purpose somehow.
