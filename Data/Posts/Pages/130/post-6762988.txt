Any RAXXLA coordinates in or near the Bubble? I would think this secret planet would be closer, not tens of thousands of lightyears away, seeing that it was founded before improved FSDs were invented.

Maybe Raxxla can or has moved. Maybe there is some sort of wormhole that it went through or you have/had to go through to get to it. Maybe that wormhole no longer exists. Maybe Raxxla has magical powers and can go where it wants. Maybe FD just doesnt care what makes logical sense and is like " ya, we put it over here. wanna fight about it?"
