I think Halsey got to do a reverse Tron thing and visited Frontier's Headquarters. She described god-like creatures because she met her creators.

I used to play a lot of Interactive Fiction back in the 80s and remember one of the Infocom titles where the player encounters some of the "Implementors" (game designers). The encounter sounded very similar to what Halsey claimed to have encountered in that Galnet article.

There has been some speculation in scientific circles that our universe could be a simulation running on an advanced computer. In the case of Elite Dangerous WE know that the galaxy is a simulation. Halsey doesn't know it cause she's an NPC. She is part of the simulation. She met her creators and mistook programmers as her god.

I had the thought a while back that Raxxla might actually be Frontier HQ, finding it would mean arriving in Cambridge and knocking on their office door. After all, who else has that much power over the Elite universe. Oh, now I've got my headache again, best go for a lie down![smile]
