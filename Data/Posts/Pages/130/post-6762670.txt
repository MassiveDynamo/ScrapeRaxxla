I've always wondered if Halsey's Comments ever had any weight on the mystery esspecially that one "Halsey Shares her Vision" article

As for the Procedural systems that contain "Raxxla" in the name. I don't think the Procgen systems will contain anything since the naming conventions are just denoting Startype, Mass, age, etc of the main star. Jackie Silver posted something about that a while back that explains why the systems are named that way.
