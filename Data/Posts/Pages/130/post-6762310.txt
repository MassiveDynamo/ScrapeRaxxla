Why does Raxxla have to be an ELW? Have I missed a clue?

1. I'd prefer if there were a number of steps/goals that needed to be completed allowing the location of Raxxla to be identified. Preferably with some kind of feedback to indicate that a step/goal had been achieved. Not just blindly flying around scanning, or following kindergarten-level 'clues'.

2. No, no definitive Raxxla is an ELW statement. It's just my expectations.
