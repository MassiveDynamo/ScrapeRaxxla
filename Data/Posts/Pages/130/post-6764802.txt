(A little o.t. but not entirely, just an amusing aside...)

So I was browsing the "Today's Posts" link and happened across this thread: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/431060-The-final-dinosaur

Thought as I joke I would post that the 37th 'hidden' dinosaur was the "Raxxlasauraus" (bit bored admittedly).

Next thing I know, reported and moderated. No sense of humour some people... :S
