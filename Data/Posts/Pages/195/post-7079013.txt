Trinkets of Hidden Fortune (in-game description): “This container appears to hold an assorted collection of low-value trinkets, knick-knacks and statuettes. Such trinkets are generally used by superstitious pilots to try and win favour with the lady Fortuna. However, these particular knick-knacks have a much more valuable prize hidden within”...The commodity is directly linked to The Dark Wheel; from the DW missions they clearly contain data crystals that might be decoded for valuable information. Seems quite similar to SAP8 core containers which also appear to contain data crystals?
Can & how do we get these hidden data crystals decoded in-game?? Is this a step we are missing?

I don't think all Trinkets of Hidden Fortune contain something valuable inside them. This sounds like a simple smuggling ploy. Think the television series Lost where Mr. Eko was smuggling heroine inside statues of the Virgin Mary.

And it isn't 100% clear if the data crystal is actually inside the trinkets. In fact I'd argue against that. The Trinket delivery was intended to "Seal the deal. Show them we're dedicated to forming a long lasting relationship". The response after completing the deliver was "Tell your boss that we'll have the data crystal we found sent over shortly". If the data crystal was inside the Trinket then why would TDW have to send the Trinket to someone else in order to get it extracted? Makes more sense for the recipient of the Trinket to have already had the data crystal on hand and whatever was smuggled inside the trinkets were intended to buy access to the crystal.
