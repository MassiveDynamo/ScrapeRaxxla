Trinkets of Hidden Fortune (in-game description): “This container appears to hold an assorted collection of low-value trinkets, knick-knacks and statuettes. Such trinkets are generally used by superstitious pilots to try and win favour with the lady Fortuna. However, these particular knick-knacks have a much more valuable prize hidden within”...The commodity is directly linked to The Dark Wheel; from the DW missions they clearly contain data crystals that might be decoded for valuable information. Seems quite similar to SAP8 core containers which also appear to contain data crystals?
Can & how do we get these hidden data crystals decoded in-game?? Is this a step we are missing?
