I only say it is immune to BGS because I was talking with someone one night in Diaguandri. I was bemoaning the fact that I had just returned to the bubble after being out for a few months, only to return and I was locked out of outfitting at Ray gateway because of a lockdown. The other CMDR said that this was precisely the reason he was based out of Jameson in SD because it was impossible to send it into a lockdown, that it was immune to the BGS. I never verified or researched the claim. It made sense to me.
Jameson Memorial as a station is immune to Lockdown and other effects because its controlling faction (Pilots Fed Local Branch) is a non-influence faction and so can't have BGS states. Same applies to detention centres and engineer bases.

The SD system as a whole is also separately restricted - factions can't expand into it, and factions already there can't have conflicts to change station ownership within the system - but BGS states can otherwise be applied normally. TDW are currently in Boom, for example, so should be able to get Expansion too.
