I think I’ve only ever encountered them in pirate traps in anarchy systems; think they were free-floating, but 4 pirates appeared & my shields were dropping too fast to scoop one. Might be good idea to try this in a wing. Happened to me about three times in one day, but not come across any since, just was pondering whether we have been missing a trick in the Quest.

Did anybody who got one as part of the missions (when they were available) try ejecting & scanning one?

edit: @Jaiotu- did you get a Trinket & try destroying it to see if any “hidden treasure” or data crystal remained?

Thanks - there's some useful information there. I didn't even know of such a cargo!
