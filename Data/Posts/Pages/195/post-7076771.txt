Oh. You're asking if The Dark Wheel has a home world in the game lore?

I'm not sure about The Dark Wheel but the The Dark Wheel has always been led by a member of the Ryder family (per John Harper's And Here the Wheel) and Holdstock did give the Ryder family a home system. From The Dark Wheel:

"For his part, Alex Ryder would need a lot more convincing. He was a tall, fair-haired young man, wiry and athletic.He was atmo-surfing champion on the Ryder's homeworld, Ontiat, and very bright."


Actually no, I'm asking if there's a clear-cut section of the system/galaxy map that says "you're in this faction's homeworld".

Btw, has anyone looked at my sheeeeeet?
