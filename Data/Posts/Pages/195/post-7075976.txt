Shinrarta isn't their home is what I'm saying, or it would say so. It's run by software like EDDiscovery mostly, not players. Had EDD or another plug detected TDW homeworld, the information would get priority. I could still be wrong, but I'm confident that I'm not. A question remains unanswered: Are there other means to determine a home system (preferably ingame)? I'm a 2 month old player that's only been doing exploration and engineer unlocks, so I don't know about factions.

Oh. You're asking if The Dark Wheel has a home world in the game lore?

I'm not sure about The Dark Wheel but the The Dark Wheel has always been led by a member of the Ryder family (per John Harper's And Here the Wheel) and Holdstock did give the Ryder family a home system. From The Dark Wheel:

"For his part, Alex Ryder would need a lot more convincing. He was a tall, fair-haired young man, wiry and athletic.He was atmo-surfing champion on the Ryder's homeworld, Ontiat, and very bright."
