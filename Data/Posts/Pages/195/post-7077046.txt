Actually no, I'm asking if there's a clear-cut section of the system/galaxy map that says "you're in this faction's homeworld".

Btw, has anyone looked at my sheeeeeet?

I think that the majority of systems with that kind of text description are the ones for player minor factions aren't they? Most systems are home to several BGS minor factions and the system descriptions rarely list every faction that makes it's home there.
