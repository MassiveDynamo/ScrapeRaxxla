Someone said SD is immune to BGS. We could ask FD for a confirmation...but do they care ?
I think not.

I only say it is immune to BGS because I was talking with someone one night in Diaguandri. I was bemoaning the fact that I had just returned to the bubble after being out for a few months, only to return and I was locked out of outfitting at Ray gateway because of a lockdown. The other CMDR said that this was precisely the reason he was based out of Jameson in SD because it was impossible to send it into a lockdown, that it was immune to the BGS. I never verified or researched the claim. It made sense to me.
