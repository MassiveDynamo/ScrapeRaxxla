Someone said SD is immune to BGS. We could ask FD for a confirmation...but do they care ?
I think not.

I think they have a company policy of saying nothing that could be used to provide clues as to their storylines.
During my FRifting days I pm’d DB, DW and Ed asking if dark systems were actually implemented in game to clarify my search; this would be known fact to pilots in the era & was lore from Drew’s books. I got no response, now we find in the journal specification that RoguePlanet is in the StarType classification implying dark systems may well be in-game.....

They say nothink, nothink!
