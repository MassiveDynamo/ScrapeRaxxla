SD certainly has a "no conflicts and no inbound expansions" lock on it but probably nothing further - I think if you could get The Dark Wheel over 75% influence there they'd expand, but it's a large and high-traffic system so that might be tricky when they don't control any decent stations. They're about as close now as they've ever been, and there's still a big way to go.[/QUOTE]


It would be fairly easy to test this if even a small % of us rifters get together to expand TDW!
