Maia is controlled by the Ryder Revolutionary Party
Ontiat in Elite, but not in ED (ESM)

Ryder Revolutionary Party is named for Ben Ryder from these Forums not Ben Ryder from The Dark Wheel novella. He and Obsidian Ant got naming rewards as being key voices behind colonizing the Pleiades.

As far as Ontiat ... I don't think it exists in Elite Dangerous or if it does it has a different name. If memory serves (and it's been a while) Ontiat was within seven light years of Lave in the 1984 version of the game.

EDIT: I stand corrected. Ontiat was 14.8 Light-years from Lave.
