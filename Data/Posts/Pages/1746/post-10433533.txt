If it were for instance only 2 bodies, 1 being a ringed then this drastically reduces to probability of finding it as we can now use 3rd party maps.
That would be simpler, but it wouldn't be that difficult to search for all systems containing a particular five-body configuration as well.

I've got a full 3rd-party body list - and that should be entirely accurate when it comes to "planets within/adjacent to the bubble" - so if you can describe a search area and what configuration to look for I can probably get you a list of candidates fairly quickly.
