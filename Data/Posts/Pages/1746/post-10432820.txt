IMO, if it was IN a system it would draw attention to the system not the signal itself.

The fact you cant means the signal is the important bit.
Exactly!
If the signal were intended to represent energy leakage through the Omphalos Rift so that you could locate it and pass through it to Raxxla but you can't locate it to a system (which seems to be the only place we can FSD jump from/to) then it can't be related and is likely just flavour/obfuscation...

The only proviso to that is perhaps if it is "located" in hyperspace and you need to pass through it by jumping between systems either side of it...
Oops. just thought if another proviso - the player journal file permits a system to be constructed from a main star plus optional other bodies. And section 15.2 allows that star to be one of the types we usually see, plus BH and Neutron stars, but also allows for an Exotic Star or a Rogue Planet...so perhaps that's what you're looking for. In which case I'd expect you to have to get close to it then investigate the nearby systems listed in your nav panel-perhaps it's only detected & listed at close range, and may not show in galmap.
