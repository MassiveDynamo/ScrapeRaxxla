So a question is; does this represent a 4 body system; a 2 body system (with two moons); a 5 body system etc, etc, etc!

Map legends please FD,,,?

As with the DW codex I do suspect FD have tried to narrow down the search by providing some information, but such is still widely interpretational.

These are the questions I think we ought to be asking FD, not more clues please, but reduce the obfuscation @Paul_Crowther?
