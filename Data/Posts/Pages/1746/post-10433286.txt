Well I've read Legacy several times and the one thing I get out of it is that Raxxla is in Alliance space, which is far removed from Achenar.
Well there in lies the rub, in Legacy of all the locations named, Beaumont is the only one not in game, and Achenar out of the primary systems named is the furthest removed, that is odd. Still there was at least one other system named, that was furthest removed, and that was much higher up!

Legacy systems shown in green.


Legacy systems overlaid with the systems: Norse Norns, Greek Fates and (highest) ‘Fortune’. Note how the furthest Legacy system is upon a similar alignment to the Fortunes and the Thetis signal, but still too far removed.


There’s also mention of a Ross 629, which likewise is not in game!

I only draw upon Beaumont because of the strange fulcrum it ought to share being in the same area as the Lost Realms and the underworld.

Alliance space Would be the logical choice, it ties in with the Trinkets too likely!
