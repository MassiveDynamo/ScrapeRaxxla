Picking a rough 50LY radius from Thetis, systems with 5 or fewer bodies (planets or moons), at least one body ringed:
Beta Pictoris *
9 G. Carinae *, +
LTT 2513
BPM 72493 *, +
LAWD 27
Niu Bese
StKM 1-442 *
Pichanto
Dyindumasci
Hakkaia

*: still has five or fewer bodies if stars are also counted
+: two or fewer bodies, counting planets and moons only (though in 9 G. Carinae the rings are around a Y-dwarf star)
