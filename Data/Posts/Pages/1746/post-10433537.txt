I agree. The search ought to be for a system with at least one ringed body in a system with at most 5 bodies?

I currently suspect the apex of the Miltonian model is around Thetis, based upon my assessment of other systems which seem to correlate. So said system should be within a certain radius from there?

This theory is one of my go-to objectives, which I’ve still not had time to fully explore, as I tend to get distracted…

Currently attempting to obtain some trinkets… before that, spent far too long looking for mysterious (probably) fictitious mountains!



In addition to this, this hypothetical axis is also very close to the system Olorun, which is named after the Yoruba god of the sky. This is interesting because the Yoruba creation myth utilises a mythos involving a ‘golden chain’ much like in Paradise Lost, which linked the upper realm to the Earth.

In addition, equally odd is how Amun likewise falls directly upon the outer rim of the ‘signal radius, from Thetis!

This is too much of a coincidence!



I think maybe I need to refocus and go back here and try and resolve to exploring that whole area in more depth, I think I’ve exhausted my patience on Beaumont.

A bridge to the Empyrean?
