If so then that's quite interesting. Is that all you were doing at the time?
Can't see any lore reason why SD-TDW would support goids...
But if (as Premonition told us) they're a front & not the real TDW, & real TDW are a faction of PF & who may "quietly shut down TDW imposters", and you get allied with "PilotsFederation" faction via burning station rescue missions or Thargoid kills, then perhaps part of the Raxxla storyline is to adversely affect SD-TDW?? Is this the codex's test of skill to join TDW?
