Well going off topic but… who knows. wouldn’t presume to know their motives, but intuition might advocate they’re not the protagonist in this conundrum.

The Brookes Tours I believe spell out who probably is. So I hope FD leave Raxxla and the DW well alone. The worst thing they could do is mess with it, because then it becomes a narrative arc, which will mean it becomes a gated culdesac.

Through its presence, the Codex is advocating a positive affirmation, its a location already in game. Therefore not something underdevelopment, at least maybe something esoteric, but not something narrative, at least I hope not.
Agreed, and I don't necessarily mean meddling with the journey itself, but, like they did with the codex update, I wonder if it's time to slip in another rumour somewhere in the game. Something to help subtly frame a better understanding of what it is and is not.

The only reason I'm thinking this is because the PP2.0 update will likely introduce a lot of new elements to sift through with a nanoscopic filter.

Notably this is also the home for the Orbis Starport ‘Tannhauser Gate’, a reference to the film Bladerunner, one of MB favourite films.

I am no theologian but I understand Saint Michael was charged with the care of the souls of Purgatory!
Legacy and Blade Runner share the same theme of uprising against oppressive superpowers.
If Raxxla is a journey we must all follow for ourselves - in this context it would make sense that MB is telling us to follow the same narrative arc as Legacy in some way.

Let's say the Beaumont system is Michel. This could act as an underworld starting point (like Freeholm was), then there could be a pattern of actions such as pirating NPCs to act as the "uprising" element. Maybe that triggers something.
Then we progress through a series of tests (circles of hell themed) to move towards Raxxla.
