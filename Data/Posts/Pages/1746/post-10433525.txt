Any good map ought to have a legend, to allow you to quickly orientate oneself, but failing that, said design ought to also be relatable in general, something that is comparable.

Nevertheless it provides us some context in that it’s a system with a limited number of bodies!

If it were for instance, only 2 bodies, 1 being a ringed then this drastically reduces the probability of finding it as we can now use 3rd party maps to weed out a large proportion?

I suspect we know from the design (if correct) that that general location is at the boundary of Chaos, it being very likely I suspect, close to or around Thetis.

The point of the design ultimately should be to allow us to quickly identify the system visually…
