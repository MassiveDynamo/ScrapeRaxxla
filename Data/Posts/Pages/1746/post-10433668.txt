Picking a rough 50LY radius from Thetis, systems with 5 or fewer bodies (planets or moons), at least one body ringed:
Beta Pictoris *
9 G. Carinae *, +
LTT 2513
BPM 72493 *, +
LAWD 27
Niu Bese
StKM 1-442 *
Pichanto
Dyindumasci
Hakkaia

*: still has five or fewer bodies if stars are also counted
+: two or fewer bodies, counting planets and moons only (though in 9 G. Carinae the rings are around a Y-dwarf star)

Examined:
Beta Pictoris, all belt clusters, HazRes
9 G. Carinae , all belt clusters visited, rings at 9 G. Carinae 1 surfaced scanned.
LTT 2513: All four belt clusters, ring at LTT 2513 4 (Impossible task to look at every rock, just took a short flyby at a random place)
BPM 72493: All five belt clusters, ring at BPM 72493 1. Bromelite & Alexandrite hotspot.
LAWD 27, Examined belt cluster 1 & 2, unable to get near belt cluster 3 (too close and exit to normal space). LAWD 27 4: Double Void Opal Hotspot.
