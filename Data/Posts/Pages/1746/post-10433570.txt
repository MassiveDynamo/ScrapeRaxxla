I agree. The search ought to be for a system with at least one ringed body in a system with at most 5 bodies?

I currently suspect the apex of the Miltonian model is around Thetis, based upon my assessment of other systems which seem to correlate. So said system should be within a certain radius from there?

This theory is one of my go-to objectives, which I’ve still not had time to fully explore, as I tend to get distracted…

Currently attempting to obtain some trinkets… before that, spent far too long looking for mysterious (probably) fictitious mountains!



In addition to this, this hypothetical axis is also very close to the system , which is named after the Yoruba god of the sky. This is interesting because the Yoruba creation myth utilises a mythos involving a ‘’ much like in Paradise Lost, which linked the upper realm to the Earth.

Ironically not far off this axis, and upon the outer rim of this zone of chaos is the system Alpha Centauri, which does have the body named Eden. Not that I think that’s directly linked, only probably evidence said ‘construct’ is accurate.

I think maybe I need to refocus and go back here and try and resolve to exploring the area in more depth, I think I’ve exhausted my patience on Beaumont.
