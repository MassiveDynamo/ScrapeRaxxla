As I was pondering the question I had an epiphany.

The common aspect of the garden is the water.
In the left "Milton cosmos" circle, the water depicts Hell.
So by that association, the other two ponds could also represent some aspect of Hell.

Therefore what could the other two aspects represent? peering into Hell? Dante's inferno? or Milton's?.

Then I wonder if the idea of Hell in game is linking back to Jaques. Could the system where the Battle of Hell's Gate be what this map is representing?
Jaques' "fall" moment was his capture by Imperials - thereafter 'tormented' by his cybernetic augmentations, enslaved by the genetic disease, the legal battle over him between the superpowers, and forced to do hard labour to repay debts. Not to mention literally losing his mind and legs in an accident.

Back to the map:
The ten lights could represent Dante's Malebolge - the ten ditches of the Malebolge
Long causeway bridges run from the outer circumference of Malebolge to its center, pictured as spokes on a wheel. At the center of Malebolge is the ninth and final circle of hell, known as Cocytus.
