Well the Guardians are extinct

Mmm, I’m not sure that’s true. If I remember correctly Ram Tah said that the Guardian AI constructs rose up and killed the Guardians, but before that happened at least one faction was exiled, expelled because their love of technology offended the traditionalist guardians. Also “Before they developed faster-than-light technology, the Guardians constructed three large arks (one may be Raxxla) for their first interstellar colonies, similar to the generation ships employed by humans”

So we may find at least one enclave of Guardian exile descendants ( assuming that’s not humanity, guardians were expert in genetic manipulation!), possibly one or more of their colonies/ark ships, and also perhaps some Guardian AI, as well as the rogue human-created AI that was then banned but “it is believed that one or two AI (sentient machines) have escaped into deep space”.
If you look at the EDSM map of restricted sectors to my mind it matches reasonably well with that potential number of alien species https://www.edsm.net/en/galactic-mapping#2/0/0/25000|restrictedSectors
