The name Furuhjelm is actually derived from an estate in Southern Birkaland, Finland. Sadly the manor is burned.
Birkarls were medieval people known for violently controlling trade and taxation in Lappmark, also for their fur hats and fancy red sleds, if poetry is to be believed.
(Does it matter the tree in the coat of arms is actually Scots pine?)
I doubt it matters, it was more an interesting tip-bit that I discovered whilst investigating Hasley's trip. I highly doubt it has any direct influence over the storyline, but you never know!
