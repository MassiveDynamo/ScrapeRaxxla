Raxxla is a made up mystery. If FD want, they can say that Zeus was a Guardian and used Raxxla to access Olympus.
It all depends on what FD wants it to be.
I suppose one could tame a divine mythical horse by sleeping at the temple of Athene, but I would rather air-dash to Thessaloniki and take a bus to the beautiful little town of Litochoro, and access Olympus from there. Here is even a list of hotels over there: https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Litochoro
