Excellent spot! (But where did you find that coat of arms? In-game?? Late breakfast, headcold starting, coffee not working yet...)

It might well suggest that the reason for Halsey’s secret route change was guardian-related, and perhaps strengthens my suspicion that the “secret diversion to Azaleach” was misdirection- perhaps by the Club who seem to have instigated her assassination. Perhaps the secret is in/near I’ve already remarked that the route she took is not the straight line/shortest, which itself seems suspicious.

I think Dominic Corner’s comment about elite missions was made before the SD missions disappeared, but could be wrong-someone can check on the FD quotes thread, definitely got a cold hovering & not quite “with it”.

It could also be that those SD elite missions were rewritten, perhaps as part of a more explicit TDW storyline and nobody has yet attained membership. Tyko has decided to pull his finger out & get back to SD to test out my current DW hypothesis, arthritic thumbs and RL permitting.

The CoA was from a search after it was mentionedon a few web sites, so I did some historical research.
I think Dominic's post was made on the 2nd Dec 2020... 10 days ago?
