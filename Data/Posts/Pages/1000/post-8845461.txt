What wonders me, humanity put presence in whole Galaxy during 6 - 7 years game exists.
Now we have 2 alien cultures which were far more advanced and still we find it locked to small regions.
Well the Guardians are extinct and Thargoids are hive minded. Hive mind perk is always overlooked for some reason in these conversations.
Interceptors and Scouts are at the very bottom of their hierarchy and they don't wander off too much from their main hive, they do the labor. We don't know what their Queens do in the meantime, they might be travelling across the galaxy, and possibly they have been, since they bioengineer themselves and we've seen some features of them in other life forms around the galaxy. It might be difficult to spot them because they utilize witchspace in ways we don't know. And maybe they are intergalactic species (most likely) and the Milky Way is one of the dullest ones they don't care much about.

Or the region they are present is the only part they care about.
