they might be travelling across the galaxy, and possibly they have been, since they bioengineer themselves and we've seen some features of them in other life forms around the galaxy.
And that returns to my year old observation. Bio-signals and stellar anomalies are not equal spread around.
Most I found was dryman region. And maybe close radial sectors. That was like each 5 jumps you meet stellar anomaly and/or planet with bio signals.
So I had theory RAXXLA is life source, i.e. close to it life concentration grows.
