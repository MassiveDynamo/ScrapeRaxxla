The name Furuhjelm is actually derived from an estate in Southern Birkaland, Finland. Sadly the manor is burned.
Birkarls were medieval people known for violently controlling trade and taxation in Lappmark, also for their fur hats and fancy red sleds, if poetry is to be believed.
(Does it matter the tree in the coat of arms is actually Scots pine?)

Scots Pine?
Yep, that confirms itâ€™s a fake. Clearly skulduggery by The Club provocateurs aiming to promote confusion over Raxxla. Yggdrasil is an immense Ash tree!!
