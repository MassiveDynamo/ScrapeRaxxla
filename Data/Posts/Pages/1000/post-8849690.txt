it makes no logical sense why raxxla would be associated with any kind of earth mythology. It's not connected to anything ancient in human history. It didn't exist until semi-recent interstellar travel.

Playing ancient astronaut theory is fun and all, but you might as well be concocting theories that try and associate the dates braben released elite to astrology and then looking for systems that coincidentally have those same numbers in them.

There's no national treasure / da vinci's code secret to raxxla. If you believe braben when he said it's in the game, then you have to also believe when it was said that there would be no clues to it.

Now who's going to start testing one of my theories that raxxla is actually a dyson sphere where the sphere siphons power from a wormhole to create a plasma shield that looks and feels like a star (and since the wormhole has the gravity of a star, the entire thing is perfectly disguised? All you gotta do is keep approaching every star you come to until you either explode from overheating, or ...pop enough heatsinks to make it thru the plasma shield.

It's either that or visit every roid field and look for what can only be a very underwelming discovery of a megaship place-holder for raxxla
