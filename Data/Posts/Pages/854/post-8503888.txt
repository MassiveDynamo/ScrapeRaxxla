Anyone on PC out there ever tried using this?

VisitedStarsCache.space

I tried and its not working for me..... I'm not sure if I'm doing somthing wrong, or if its becuase my PC account I havnt left the Pilots Federation Core systems yet.... I nuked my PC account a while back so I could try getting Elite without leaving the orginal systems, as well as FSS them fully and make sure there was nothing hiding in them.... but bottom line is, I havnt left yet and Im not sure if I cant see the systems becuase im locked inside, or becuase ive done somthing wrong....

I figured, if it exists and works, I can, and others here if you wanted, find systems specfically not explored easier ect...

Let me know if anyone has tried/does try it.. thankz


EDIT: Never mind, i got it to work, just need to change the filters in the galmap... wont show you the system map for systems, but will deff show the systems visited and not visited...

very usefull tool.... this will deff help me plot my courses...
