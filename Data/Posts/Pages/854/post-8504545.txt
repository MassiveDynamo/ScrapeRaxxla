Nice! Ya I havent made it to the Void yet... still pfaffing around.... Ive had to use the Outer Arm a couple times unfortunatly due to my limited jump range... Keep an ear out for those Sirens

What speeding again?
Didn’t see the Space Whale Crossing sign?
Unpaid space tax? annual ship inspection expired?
Distracted by a nodding BRAYBEN????
Hypnotised by singing of half-woman half-bird aliens?
It’s no excuse!
Blues n twos will getcha!
