Right....so I have finally made it through Aquila's Halo. (That's a bit of a lie - I had to drop into Outer Arm for a few days in the middle, due to running out of stars) Anyway, I will be passing over into The Void tomorrow, so if anybody has any "Sirens of the deepest void" tinfoil they would like checked out whilst I'm there, please let me know and I'll try to check it out tomorrow.
