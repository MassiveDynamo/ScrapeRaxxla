Is this the location of the Dark Wheel station?
How can we go about locating it if it is? What are some ideas given the tools we have?
Are the clusters spoken of in both The Alien World and The Dark Wheel novella actually discover-able?
Is this 1 or both of the clusters? Or is it either?
Why is John Jameson's mission launch location in the Ain system within "First Cluster" of stars from Sol?
Does this give relevance to both books?
Is this completely the wrong direction?

Here's a rough version of the script
