If there is evidence somewhere of FDev confirming that someone visited Raxxla and left unaware, we need to find it and link it in the OP. Personally, I think it is urban myth but if it does exist, it is exactly the sort of thing this thread should record.

I have so far collected the following rumour, speculation and he-said-she-said forum foam:-

"Some person told me. They said someone was in the system but just honked and jumped away."
"They also said that it came from the FDev panel, idk how credible it is but I wouldnt be suprised if it happened"
"I like the idea that Raxxla was honked. That some casual explorer just saw a system of ice and rock and passed it up. Never realizing that the biggest treasure was in his grasp but he was fooled by the allure of money. "
"Rumor has it that the system has been honked but the entity itself has not been scanned. (Confirmation?)"
"afaik system has NOT been honked. Devs said some cmdr visited the system, scooped and jumped out without honking"
