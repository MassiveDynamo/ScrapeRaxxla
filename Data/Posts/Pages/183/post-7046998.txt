I saw a reddit thread that referenced an interview with someone at FDev who confirmed the system in which it exists had been honked by a player, but the planet was not detail scanned.

I didn't see the source material, so it's just hearsay from me, but I like to believe that it's true. If nothing else for the, "missed it by that much" aspect. Was it you? Me? We may never know.

There you go solid proof!

you need to be quite sceptical over claims on Reddit!
as far as we know only two people in FD are likely to know the location of Raxxla, David Braben and Michael Brookes. Donâ€™t suppose this mysterious FD dev was either of those?
