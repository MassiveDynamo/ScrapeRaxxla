Going to pay more attention to "a" mass systems in future, though, and also systems where you jump in and there's "nothing" in front of you and you *assume* it's a binary barycentre.

Donâ€™t spend a long time looking for something other than a barycentre, make that your second hypothesis! On my first trip out to Colonia via the neutron highway two weeks ago I almost came a cropper half a dozen times when emerging at the barycentre of a close pair or triple. In several cases they were a neutron star and G class in close proximity. Luckily I had several heat sink launchers to hand.

I guess your csv file analysis is from EDSM? So only the cases found so far. I suspect most A mass systems will not have been explored since they are not scoopable and worth very little, so a very good place for DB to hide a certain celestial object.
