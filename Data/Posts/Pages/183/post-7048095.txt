That Reddit reference has “The last part of system names, which I call the "STAR-CLASS" (e.g. c6-4, d13-7, etc.) actually means something. The first letter is based on the mass of the star (possibly includes the mass of all stars in the system). The first number is part of its coordinate within its sector, and the last number is arbitrary.”

I think if there is no hyphenated suffix then the implication is that there is only one of the A mass type objects in that subsector (subsubsector?), & if there are more than one then the hyphenated suffix is used to index them. The reason why there would be such a low local probability of low mass systems escapes me (astrophysics is not my thing), might be the tail end of a statistical distribution but it is an interesting anomaly that might bear investigation, most explorers seem to go for the higher mass (G to H) systems in the hope of getting profitable black holes etc, so maybe we should start systematically exploring the opposite. Are you going to post a link to your csv search results so we can contribute?

of course Han_Zen may be right (he often is ) that the rogueplanet object type is merely a placeholder, but hey, futile searching is what we do best (or at least have most experience of)

I did a very brief survey of about four "a#" systems last night and got bored super quickly. Low mass systems really are the worst Brown dwarfs do paint their icy moons is a very satisfying pink hue, though, so maybe these are the fabled rouge planets after all!

Han_Zen also mentioned PSO J318.5-22 which isn't in EDSM but it is in the Beta Pictoris moving group and Beta Pictoris is in EDSM so I'm going to have a poke around there later and see if there's anything funny going on.
