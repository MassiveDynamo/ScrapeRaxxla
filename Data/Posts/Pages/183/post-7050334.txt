Has anyone here been to the region 'behind' Running man, where there are a lot of named stars?

These stars are probably proc. gen.(no HIP or HD number) but they are named after famous astronomers, mathematicians, astronauts and similar.
The region is dense with 2MASS stars and other real stars. These smaller star have names like Newton, Galileo or Ptolemy(plenty more).
The region is not permit locked but may be inaccessible, due to other locked sectors.
