If there is evidence somewhere of FDev confirming that someone visited Raxxla and left unaware, we need to find it and link it in the OP. Personally, I think it is urban myth but if it does exist, it is exactly the sort of thing this thread should record.

I have so far collected the following rumour, speculation and he-said-she-said forum foam:-

"Some person told me. They said someone was in the system but just honked and jumped away."
"They also said that it came from the FDev panel, idk how credible it is but I wouldnt be suprised if it happened"

I strongly suspect this arose from Reddit trolling or wishful thinking, and will continue in this view until a source reference is produced. Nobody has ever supplied a source reference for it. As far as we know DB and MB are probably the only FD personnel who know where Raxxla is located, & probably what it is (DB’s comment to ED Lewis in the recent livestream), so nobody else from FD would be able to comment about some passing visitor honking its system or otherwise. We do know that DB said there would be no clues, hence I’m convinced it’s a load of .
