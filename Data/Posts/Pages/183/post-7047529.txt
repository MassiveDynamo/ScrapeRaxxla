Two confirmed rogue planets but half a dozen candidates, so far. Edit: has anyone visited the RL rogues in-game?

I vaguely recall an unverified rumour that I looked all of these (rogues and rogue candidates from Wiki) up in Simbad some months/years ago and tried to find them on the Galmap under all of their designations, and think I only found one or two of the candidates, visited them, and found nothing out of the ordinary. And posted the list, which ones I found, and which ones I visited, somewhere. Possibly in this very thread even, not sure.

To my shame I did not try to find any of the rouge planets though.

Edit: It might have all been a bad dream with a lot of dots screaming though.
