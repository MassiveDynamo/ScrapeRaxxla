of course Han_Zen may be right (he often is ) that the rogueplanet object type is merely a placeholder, but hey, futile searching is what we do best (or at least have most experience of)

I'm not saying that there rogueplanet object type is definitely not in use. It's just that with the number of rogues science predicts we should have found them, if they are possible to target.

If they are searchable but not possible to target like nebulae or dark regions, they must have very strange names.

The other option is of course that it is possible to target it, but it does not contain the < 12Mj free floaters we would expect. In that case there could be so few(or just one) of them, that they have been missed.
