Not wanting to go round in circles (as this thread often does), but did anything ever come of the DJ Truthsayer mission to find Raxxla? I have read before in this forum (too lazy to search for source) that he had an idea for where it was/what it was/how to get to it, but I never heard anything more beyond that.
