Yes I miss read
“Raxxla was described as a mythical planet which held an alien construct that served as a gateway to other universes.”
“Raxxla is said to hold an alien artefact called the Omphalos Rift, which acts as a gateway to parallel universes.”
I meant to say the Alison used an orb like construction. It’s not officially confirmed for cannon in elite but it is in the published’ dark wheel’ book
Alison? Auto-correct kicking in there and changing it from Aliens I presume!

There's nothing in The Dark Wheel novella about aliens using an orb like construction though. Are you thinking of something else?
