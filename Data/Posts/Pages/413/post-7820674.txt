Funny you should say gamma, there are a few star systems with the first name gamma E.G gamma leporis and gamma doradus and are two systems that CURRENTLY overlap with my areas I have identified but there are 33 areas in the entire Milky Way galaxy that also fit so I’m not so sure. Funny thing about both these systems, they are the brightest out of both there constellations and both relate to Greek mythology and Chinese alike, in these ‘burning jewels’ you speak of in a latter post perhaps bright stars?

Wait did you say 33 or actually 35. Concerning "33" that is the number of dots in the inner circle of the Raxxla an as well the number of degrees in AASR.
