New discovery, 18 of the 33 (ish) areas are permit locked which is weird? They all seem to be about the same distance from each other give or take 20 lys

Makes perfect sense; Thargoid strongholds are no-go zones for now. Have you been able to match the Col 70 Sector to any areas?
I suspect that the Thargoid homeworld is located there in close proximity to Barnard's Loop.
