Constellations are named in order of brightness using greek letters, hence alpha-beta-gamma-delta doradus - first brightest stars of the doradus constellation. I was refering to the quote that raxxla was introduced in the game after the beta test, in the gamma release, acording to FDEV.

Yes but I was implying that releasing it during a ‘gamma’ release was more than just a coincidence who knows
