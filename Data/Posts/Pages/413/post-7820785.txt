This will be my last post of the day but has anybody said anything about Jasmina Halsey and the recent ship theift visions? Halsey describes things in her visions as “They are out there. I have seen them. We must put aside our petty differences and work together to establish contact. There is so much we could learn from them.”
And
“I saw a place of extraordinary beauty. A paradise. It was truly wonderful. This was no dream – it was a glimpse of something very real. We must find this place. It could be our future.”
And
"It was wonderful. Amazing. I saw the universe, and our galaxy within it, as I'd never seen it before, and I felt the presence of the real caretakers of our galaxy. The paradox of their existence – tiny yet gargantuan, fleeting yet eternal. They spoke to me as I drifted in the void. It was amazing. I must share their message."
Could she have seen something a bit like the intergalactic network I have been speaking about? Maybe even shown it by a type 4 civilisation that perhaps built the gateways that could control the energy required to travel through it?
