Wait did you say 33 or actually 35. Concerning "33" that is the number of dots in the inner circle of the Raxxla an as well the number of degrees in AASR.
33 exact areas in our galaxy that ‘could’ be where there are overlaps of that particular star. I didn’t realise there where 33 dots in the inner circle tbh I haven’t even seen the Raxxla flag I only started reading about this stuff this morning so.. could be a coincidence but I’ll try a few more things to see if I come out with the same result.
As I said before the rotations differ the further out you get so mathematically it’s hard for me to get the speeds and identify current positions of the star systems in the distant galaxy and the overlaps of ours, light is relative but can be distorted by gravity so the NASA pictures I am using can be slightly incorrect but that shouldn’t affect the number of locations that particular star can overlap with
