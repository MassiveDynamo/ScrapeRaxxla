Could be that no one goes any more but did?
Could be. Could be lots of things though. Most likely, if what TDW (novella) says is correct then the people on Raxxla are still there IMHO.

It's worth bearing in mind however, that TDW novella isn't canon for ED, (though some things are confirmed - the existence of certain characters for example) and is more myth and legend. More crucially lots of info comes from things characters say - those characters could be wrong, could be misportraying things a bit or could be outright lying.
