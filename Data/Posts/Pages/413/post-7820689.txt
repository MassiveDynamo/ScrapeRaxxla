Funny you should say gamma, there are a few star systems with the first name gamma E.G gamma leporis and gamma doradus ...

Constellations are named in order of brightness using greek letters, hence alpha-beta-gamma-delta doradus - first brightest stars of the doradus constellation. I was refering to the quote that raxxla was introduced in the game after the beta test, in the gamma release, acording to FDEV.
