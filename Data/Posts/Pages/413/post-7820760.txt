Thargs weren't in the Gamma, so that goes against the 'Raxxla was in game since the Gamma' quotation,though we don't know exactly when the thargoid stuff was seeded i



I wouldn't count the thargoid star map out just because it was put in game after raxxla. We are using the codex for hints and clues and that was added afterwards...
