Hmm, there's still nothing like that in TDW. Worth bearing in mind that in TDW no one actually goes to Raxxla, and the only discussion of what Raxxla is is by people who have not been there. What's on Raxxla is barely described. Pertinent quote:

“Rafe chuckled and shook his head. 'You see, that's the big question. Your father was chasing the mythical plant Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life . . .“

“A corps of Elite-ranked pilots was suspected to have found Raxxla and exploited the gateway for their own selfish purposes, and hired assassins to eliminate any independent pilots and members of the Dark Wheel who tried to uncover Raxxla”
Could be that no one goes any more but did?
