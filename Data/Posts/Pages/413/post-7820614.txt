Not sure on The Dark Wheel and ‘orb’ technology. Sounds suspiciously like fan-fic rather than anything canon. Have you got a source for it?
Yes I miss read
“Raxxla was described as a mythical planet which held an alien construct that served as a gateway to other universes.”
“Raxxla is said to hold an alien artefact called the Omphalos Rift, which acts as a gateway to parallel universes.”
I meant to say the Alison used an orb like construction. It’s not officially confirmed for cannon in elite but it is in the published’ dark wheel’ book
