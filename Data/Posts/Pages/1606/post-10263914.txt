From our dear friend of the thread Dr Stroud....

Chaos Reborn: The Loremaster's Guide
Saturday 6th of February and the start of my research sabbatical from Buckinghamshire New University to work on my Creative Writing ...

"The main element of this work was in writing a full history from AD 2013 to AD 3250, some of which came from the previously published Frontier Gazetteer and First Encounters News Journals. Where I made expansions or alterations, David Braben asked me to label and cite what I'd done.

As an example, the Federation guidebook is more than 18,000 words with 8,388 words of history narrative. It names every President from 2599 onwards, expands on the stories of Raul Santorini, Zack Blackbeam, Dentara Rast, the Jameson family and more, who might be names a few fans of the old games recognise.

How much or little Frontier Developments elected to use was entirely their choice and subsequently these guidebooks were then provided to the writers of official fiction so they might develop their stories. We were asked not to publish information from the guides, although it was acknowledged that quite a bit might be used in Dave Hughes' Elite Encounters RPG."

Whilst I'd visited Dr Stroud's website a few times in the past and knew from MB interviews that some of the galaxy had been based on a prev version, not sure I'd picked up the older news services providing the starting point for some of the lore ("some of which came from the previously published Frontier Gazetteer and First Encounters News Journals").

I know @Han_Zen is aware as I did a quick search on the forums but thought it might be useful if anyone else hadn't picked up on this.

I wonder which stories were expanded on and altered



just a thought
