Interesting you use the term gateway Edelgard. I've often wondered about the connection between Thargoids and Raxxla and if there is one (latterly the Guardians as well). Is it possible that Raxxla was indeed a gateway of sorts that allowed the Thargoids into our Galaxy? Either by luck or other means we obtained their technology and used it to gain FTL? Did the Guardians come through first and share their tech, the Thargoids destroying them when they found out? Was the gateway somehow destroyed either by accident or on purpose to prevent more Thargoids coming through? Did th thargoids then start their seeding of our galaxy to either create their war machines or to try and repair the gate?

Apologies just my idle ramblings and I'm afraid not based on any evidence!
That's pretty much exactly what I have thought at various times too!

Many interpretations of the Raxxla Codex have lead to the Pleiades. So many connections between the Raxxla Codex and Thargoids have been proposed. I personally have wondered if the Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3 system is the location of the "Raxxla Gate" and the Thargoids are sending messages 'home' via it.

There's plenty of holes in the idea of Thargoids controlling Raxxla, but no more than most others
