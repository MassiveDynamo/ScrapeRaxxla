True - but in the case of a supergiant, system age should be the more concerning factor. Gamma Velorum's age is estimated at 3.5 - 5.5 million years, which is nowhere near enough time (given that they used 1-2 million of it being extinct) for the Guardians to have evolved from a primordial planet. It shouldn't even be enough time for a planet to coalesce and cool to the point where it could support life, though the stellar forge can be a bit generous about that at times.
But all this is relatively moot if we are thinking that the Guardians might have (via Raxxla, Omphalos, or whatever) come from another galaxy/ universe, isn't it?

Of course, if that's the line of inquiry, then we can't draw knowledge half as easily.
