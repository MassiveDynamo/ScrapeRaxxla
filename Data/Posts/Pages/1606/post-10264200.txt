The Olf Trygvasson and the Ancient airplanes on Jameson's rock / Mystery in the sands stories both indicate some form of time warp phenomenon.
Yeah these were the ones that I earmarked. Of course there's no guarantee that they lead anywhere, but they're fun to get a feel for everyone's inspiration in crafting the story.

Jameson's Pride in Uszaa seems to be the likely step in following the ancient planes story. Though it is encouraging that it's the only named body in that system.
Maybe I'll have a cruise around the southern region tonight with a hot chocolate.

I did so much flitting around Triton and Haumea a while back, just hoping for magic to happen!
Strangely support never got back to me on Haumea (I had that supposedly common bug where it always scans but never completes).
