As always, there are more holes than rabbits.

I found the mention of Olf Trygvasson at the end of the First Encounters news journals interesting.
A quick little story of a scientist vanishing through an extra dimensional space/time travel machine.

Olaf Tryggvason was a king of Norway, influential Christian proselytiser. Lots of snakes in his story.
