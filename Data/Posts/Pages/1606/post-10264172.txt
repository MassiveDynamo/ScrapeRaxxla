As always, there are more holes than rabbits.

I found the mention of Olf Trygvasson at the end of the First Encounters news journals interesting.
A quick little story of a scientist vanishing through an extra dimensional space/time travel machine.

Olaf Tryggvason was a king of Norway, influential Christian proselytiser. Lots of snakes in his story.
The Olf Trygvasson and the Ancient airplanes on Jameson's rock / Mystery in the sands stories both indicate some form of time warp phenomenon.

I'm not sure these stories were actually published in the game though. The Journals have bee extracted from the source code of FFE. Some of those stories were never in the in-game papers. They were probably intended for a part of the story line that was never implemented.
It was well known that FFE was released by Gametech, before it was complete. This is probably the reason FD chose to self publish ED.
