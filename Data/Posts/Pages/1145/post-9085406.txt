The FSS does not resolve ‘cold’ objects, smaller than 135 km radius.
Objects in a cluster are the exception. Perhaps the hole count as one?

Our ships are a good example. Unless we turn on a beacon, they are ‘cold’enough to go undetected, in normal space.

The FSS can see big things and things with considerable emission. That’s it.
Ooo,
Do ship’s Beacons show on the FSS? I’ve never tried that.
