Wow. I'm, uh, speechless. I'm not sure if we should be sending out the Space Madness Response Team with extra Lavian Brandy and Wagon Wheels, or congratulating you. Or both. Dare I ask where the Trinkets fit in? ;-)

There is a good paragraph or so on the Importance of having a personal Talisman that is talked about in Where the Time Winds Blow.... Its just an assumption though.

I am intrigued by these wagon wheels ... someday. The lavian brandy might get worked on a bit tonight as i try to map this
