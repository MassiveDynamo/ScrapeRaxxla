I've been saying that for quite some time now... that Raxxla may not be a signal you can lock-to-drop but you have to fly there in SC then drop in normal space and you'd find it because you would already know where to look for it.

Guess where we have an Asteroid Belt with no lock-to-drop but we can fly there in SC? R.: Sol

Not saying Raxxla is there, but maybe something leading to it...
It's a bit different though. Game cannot show 2 things in same location so it shows belt. Now to keep it hidden it must have same orbital speed as belt. Because ... FDevs moved that beacon manually 2 days ago and today it is inside belt again -> meaning different orbital speed. Maybe because of masses.
So only we learn for sure - belt WILL hide anything if it is in same position as belt.
