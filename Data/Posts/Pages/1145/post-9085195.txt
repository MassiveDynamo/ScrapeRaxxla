Now imagine this... place the targeting point of such "Asteroid Belt" inside the main star.

Everything inside the belt will not be shown in FSS nor in navigation panel and it will stay rotating with the asteroid belt around the main star as usual.
Sounds like game bug
...about Sol's belt...well, it says there 0-chunks, i.e. no big concentrated big chunks which may hide anything.
Real "belt" means 1000 000 kms between 2 rocks in avr. In-game "chunks" mean those rocks are concentrated a little and then it can hide something.

They could adjust sol's belt as you say, because we do not observe chunks now in RL. So they had to "fix" what Star Forge made. But ...that is sort of bug still.
