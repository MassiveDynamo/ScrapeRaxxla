Sounds like game bug
...about Sol's belt...well, it says there 0-chunks, i.e. no big concentrated big chunks which may hide anything.
Real "belt" means 1000 000 kms between 2 rocks in avr. In-game "chunks" mean those rocks are concentrated a little and then it can hide something.

They could adjust sol's belt as you say, because we do not observe chunks now in RL. So they had to "fix" what Star Forge made. But ...that is sort of bug still.
The “game bug” of the asteroid belt targeting point being located within Sol was spotted and reported several years ago (2016), by me. FD have done nothing to correct it in 5 years. In the hand-crafted system that is humanity’s origin.
Methinks this is not a “bug”; it is intentional and part of their way of hiding something that is located in the asteroid belt!
