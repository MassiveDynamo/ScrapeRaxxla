belt is very sparse
This is usual how things are going. I think in other systems such a belts are absent just. In Sol It kept for RL reasons.
Like famous Duke Nukem mirrors - in fact it was not mirrors - it was copies of the same space placed mirrored by designers.
So Sol's belt is some trickstery to create impossible for engine object - i.e. sparse belt.
