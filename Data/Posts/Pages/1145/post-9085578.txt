Frontier have updated Sol system at least a couple of times... once to add new Kuiper belt bodies after Pluto, and I'm quite positive they have changed the Asteroid Belt description because I remember it saying it was mined to depletion as an excuse for not having target-to-drop capabilities.

Wanna be even more puzzled? Go to New Yembo system, home of Universal Cartographics, there you will find another 3 examples of "non-existing" asteroid belts (the ones close to the main star do exist).

Why the Universal Cartographics home system is outside the bubble? And why having the same crazy non-existing asteroid belts there as well? Are they the ones blocking our access to them?
