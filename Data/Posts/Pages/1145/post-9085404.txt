Wow. I'm, uh, speechless. I'm not sure if we should be sending out the Space Madness Response Team with extra Lavian Brandy and Wagon Wheels, or congratulating you. Or both. Dare I ask where the Trinkets fit in? ;-)
For the Wagon Wheel fanatics amongst you with access to UK television- Snackmasters on Channel4 at 21:00 BST tonight has two chefs attempting to replicate said confectionary/biscuit.

Now why canâ€™t they try something useful, like replicating Lavian Brandy from potatoes and cauliflower?
