... When I dropped into asteroid belt part 1 (6ls from my position) I can see visually beacon.
Soo ...maybe raxxla / dw could be hid same way.

I've been saying that for quite some time now... that Raxxla may not be a signal you can lock-to-drop but you have to fly there in SC then drop in normal space and you'd find it because you would already know where to look for it.

Guess where we have an Asteroid Belt with no lock-to-drop but we can fly there in SC? R.: Sol

Not saying Raxxla is there, but maybe something leading to it...
