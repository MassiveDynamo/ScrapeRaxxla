Well, I know Sol’s asteroid belt is very sparse, so perhaps this really is FD attempting to portray something that is there but isn’t, if you know what I mean. As opposed to the other belts we see where there are endless asteroids very close together. Sol’s asteroid belt may or may not be a hiding place. But my Raxxla in Sol hypothesis brought together sufficient “evidence” to convince me. I think it’s there but detectable only by someone very lucky after sacrificing to Randomius Factorial, which is not enjoyable gameplay for me. I might go back sometime and try again, but it gets very boring very quickly!
