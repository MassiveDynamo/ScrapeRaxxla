Now imagine this... place the targeting point of such "Asteroid Belt" inside the main star.

Everything inside the belt will not be shown in FSS nor in navigation panel and it will stay rotating with the asteroid belt around the main star as usual.
Annnnd maybe "something" is actually part of the belt, instead of just in it.... like a giant asteroid that contains that "something"
