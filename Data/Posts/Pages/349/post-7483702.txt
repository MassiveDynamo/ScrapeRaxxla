I always check Lagrange points in interesting systems. Particularly L3, L4 and L5, because it's easy to just fly a lap of the orbit line.
L1 is on the path from star to planet, so that one is free. L2 can be more tricky to be sure of

Many thanks for your excellent service to the Federation CMDR! o7
