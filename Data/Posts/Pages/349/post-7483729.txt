I don't think you can take the date of Brewer's incorporation / start of starport manufacture as a limiting date.

The TDW station is just said to be a Toroid.

In the no-artificial gravity ED universe, the Toroid is pretty much the most effective station design if it's intended for long term habitation:

- The spin is stable
- No contrarotating parts are needed to maintain the stability of the spin
- Much less wear and tear as a consequence.
- Full effective gravity at the habitation sections
- Zero grav docking, and zero/very low grav loading/unloading
- Day/night can be created via the spin and orientation

It'd be surprising if Toroid stations weren't in use from very early times.

(Just going to add for clarity that it's not the optimal design for all types of station. The optimal design will change depending on what a station's purposes are.)

It might even be a Guardian station, of some unknown shape not constrained to one of the human station types.
