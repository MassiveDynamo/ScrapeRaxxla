I don't know if this has been mentioned before but the background of the dark wheel symbol depicts pi to the 10th decimal i think(someone smarter needs to confirm). Is the symbol from in game or from somewhere else?

Hi Cmdr,
from my background of crop circle research I was suspicious about the blueprint of the TDW logo as well as that from the CoR.

It is the crop circle of June 1st, 2008, found at Barbury Castle, Wiltshire. They altered the steps towards the center a bit.

I have written confirmation that the human makers of this crop circle have no affiliation to FDev nor do they are affiliated with any of the authors (i.e.Drew). Their aim to create this crop cirlce was completely different. Sooo, the time the book with the logo was published has a coincidence with the time the crop cirle ("The Pi formation") appeared. The crop circle was taken over for the TDW and CoR logo.
