Raxxla is in the Milky Way. This was confirmed during DJTruthsayer's lore interview with Michael Brookes.
Question: "Where is Raxxla?" Brookes: "Well it's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where it is. It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." Question: "You have said that there will be no clues though?" Brookes: "That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious just so people know what they're doing. There's nothing to be revealed at this stage."

Are you quibbling because I changed 'tiny' to 'little', or because I used the word 'location'? lol
Location, as the original statement doesn't say anything about location being a tiny (or little) bit obvious. There's lots of stuff going round at the moment that's been heard/read second, third (or more) hand and not actually being what was originally said. Wouldn't want to see you going off on a wild goose chase because someone else had misstated what was said!
