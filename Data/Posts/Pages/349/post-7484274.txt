Apparently it's not an isolated phenomena on Saturn.
Birkeland currents more visible in gassy atmospheres?
That image, familiar? Where have I seen that before?


Good call. I probably shouldn't plunge into Saturn's north pole then, hoping to be confronted by Raxxla?
I just find myself often wondering about that FDev statement that the location is "a little bit obvious". I have a feeling that it is either 'hidden in plain sight' or is so close by that if/when it is ever 'found' we will all be kicking ourselves.

Nice handle btw, I hear tell the prince of darkness is a gentleman.
