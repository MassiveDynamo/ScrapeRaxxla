Yeah... that's not actually what the FD statement said I'm afraid.

Raxxla is in the Milky Way. This was confirmed during DJTruthsayer's lore interview with Michael Brookes.
Question: "Where is Raxxla?" Brookes: "Well it's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where it is. It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." Question: "You have said that there will be no clues though?" Brookes: "That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious just so people know what they're doing. There's nothing to be revealed at this stage."

Are you quibbling because I changed 'tiny' to 'little', or because I used the word 'location'? lol
