In a sense it was tho. In the interview MB was asked
Q: “it’s been said there would be no clues”
MB: with a ponderous look “that’s... trueee” (in a way that would imply it is true-ish) but I think you have to make some of it just a tiny bit obvious so people know what they’re doing”
Yeah, but it's not a response to the original question though. What we've actually got is:
- a pre-prepared Q&A
- DJ commenting on the answer "I like it, it's cryptic and it doesn't reveal a damn thing! ... You have always said that there will be no clues though haven't you."
- MB responding to the point about it being said there will be no clues.

Agreed that there's the implication that it's true-ish. And MB is clearly thinking through things before/while answering. It's very possible from that that he's not so much talking about what they have done at that stage, and is more talking about what they're going to have to do (especially when considering that's followed by "but, yeah, but there's nothing to be revealed at this stage."). That's admittedly getting into interpretation of eye-movement territory though which is a bit hokey!


Edit - removed the accidental 's' from "I likes it" - DJ wasn't doing a Popeye impression!
