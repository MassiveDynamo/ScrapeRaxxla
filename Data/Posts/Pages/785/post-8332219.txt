Both at 10.2% influcence. Looks like the Medium CZ is better wrt Influcence than the Low CZ. Saw a significant increase in influence to TDW message after eliminating the Spec Ops and winning the battle.

Checking up on wars; looks like only bounties and combat bonds has an impact on influence during this state.
Noted. Thank you cmdr o7
