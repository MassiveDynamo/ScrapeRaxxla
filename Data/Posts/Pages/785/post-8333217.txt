There is mention of the Ancient home world that was possibly blown up and is now an asteroid belt. It's very coincidental to the one reference by will.

Question (since I cannot play right now (RL) but investigating something):

Is there in the game an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter? Thanks.
