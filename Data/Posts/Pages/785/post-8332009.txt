Ill have to look now, 'almost close' could mean an extra 'rank bar' of some description? Like the Decals for Harmless - Elite?

Disclaimer - I think its just decoration but its a nice side-track and just curious anyway.

Just a thought but now we know that Drew Wagar knows whether DW in SD is real one or not, and that he wrote all the GalNet stories about Salome, and I think all the beacon and clues etc as well, does that add some info to the 'Shadowy Revolution' that Salome refers to in the beacon? She definitely implies they are the 'bad guys' but she was supposed to be in touch with the 'real' DW wasn't she, exposing The Club and Exodus? If it was the 'real' DW all the way through or not. Or is The Club behind the DW or the DW behind The Club (less likely as DB invention) or are they at war with each other.

Controversial - if / when all this is solved we may have a new word CodFluff so just keep that in mind when looking for 'clues' in the Codex.

From his lore thread fairly sure DW said the Club and TDW are enemies, which ties in with the Premonition storyline. The Club are bad guys, not TDW, and the Club are/were the shadowy force manipulating humanity throughout the centuries for their own ends. I interpret what he said as TDW in SD are part of TRDW but set up to hide their inner workings.
