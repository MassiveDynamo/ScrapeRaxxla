Maybe we've been lied to. And it fits the game almost perfectly. Only a few small details like that are different. The rest is basically where elite's story comes from.

Even some of the times like the mid 22nd century for the first space missions and using probes and stuff I think. It's the same story line. So, it might help gain insight into potential elite story details. The differences seem to be minor. And will jokingly or not mentioned asteroid belts in a way that is too unusual. It's like they know it's from the story or something else.
