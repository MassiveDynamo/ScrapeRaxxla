2020-03-14 LFT 926 - The Dark Wheel vs. Los Chupacabras
Both at 10.2% influcence. Looks like the Medium CZ is better wrt Influcence than the Low CZ. Saw a significant increase in influence to TDW message after eliminating the Spec Ops and winning the battle.

Checking up on wars; looks like only bounties and combat bonds has an impact on influence during this state.
