There is mention of the Ancient home world that was possibly blown up and is now an asteroid belt. It's very coincidental to the one reference by will.
Destroyed Ancient Homeworld?
Investigators always hope that the next Ancient site they discover will be the homeworld; theoretically there would be fossil evidence that the Ancients had evolved on such a world and the evidence would confirm the find.

Some propose that the search is futile: the homeworld was undoubtedly reduced to an asteroid belt during the Final War.
