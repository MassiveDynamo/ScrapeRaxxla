Question (since I cannot play right now (RL) but investigating something):

Is there in the game an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter? Thanks.

I think people have looked for it but not found it. I've done a full circle at 1350ls from the sun between jupiter and mars and did a full circle and found nothing. But I could be missing something.

It is likely, although don't think anyone has seen it yet. There were posts about it some week ago.

Thanks for the answers, question was related to the 12th planet according to Sumerians.

CMDR Koben showed me how to drop in on it. The asteroid belt "region" exists but it looks empty, no object found yet.
