No to sidetrack too much but don't the 'Help the War By ABC' missions help? Some Courier, Assassinate someone not in the system type? Maybe not influence as such but the actual War Effort and probably not as effective as combat but do they count for nothing at all? And how often is the influence updated? Ive done missions and not seen any effect so thought must be just every 24 hrs?
