Not sure where you're getting this from but quite a lot is wrong. (And some of it has already been covered on this thread over the last few days.)



A Quirium drive isn't better than an FTL drive, it is an FTL drive. All hyperdrives are FTL drives.

No, the first hyperdrives were in the early 22nd century. The INRA stuff is 1,000 years after that.

As per the above this is 1,000 years after hyperdrives were invented.

Limited compared to what? Anything to support what those limits actually were?

This is not currently canon for ED.

Hang on a sec, a quarrium drive creates a ‘wormhole’ and travels ‘instantaneous’ so cant be FTL travel, it’s effectively teleportation and I never said they were used during the 22nd century and it was a quote from the cannon research group who have pieced evidence from INRA sites across the galaxy.
Not sure what I have wrong here as all you’ve done is pointed out a lack of evidence that I would like to note, I did not put together
