We should define what FTL means. What we are currently doing is more transitions than FTL. Keep mind that I define Transition from Perry Rhodan as instant transit from one place to another whereas FTL from my point of view is more or less what Starfleet does with Warp Drive technology.
Well, call me crazy here...

But FTL is already defined. It means Faster Than Light. The definition is inherent.

People are free to define sub-divisions as much as they like, but ultimately if it means getting something getting somewhere faster than it could travelling through normal space at the speed of light, then it's faster than light.

Warp, Supercruise, Hyperdrives, Infinite Improbability Drives, Wormholes, Instant Transmission, Ridiculous Speed, Ludicrous Speed, etc. - they're all FTL.

It's a catchall term.
