Generation ships didn't have FTL. Take the estimated date of launch, subtract today's date, and you get the maximum distance in lightyears it could travel.

Though, I think Generation Ships stopped getting sent before the Mars relic was found. (I'd have to check)

Mars relic found: 2280
Empire founded: Mid 23 hundreds
Generation ships sent: Prior 2200s

At least that's how I understand Wiki.
