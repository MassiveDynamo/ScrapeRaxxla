Hang on a sec, a quarrium drive creates a ‘wormhole’ and travels ‘instantaneous’ so cant be FTL travel, it’s effectively teleportation and I never said they were used during the 22nd century and it was a quote from the cannon research group who have pieced evidence from INRA sites across the galaxy.
Not sure what I have wrong here as all you’ve done is pointed out a lack of evidence that I would like to note, I did not put together
A Quirium drive is a hyperdrive. It is by definition FTL travel. All hyperdrives are FTL. Perhaps you're meaning something different than FTL?

What you said:

"“The first hyperdrive was reverse engineered from numerous Thargoid ships that were captured by the Galactic Cooperative during the INRA-Thargoid war."

The INRA-Thargoid stuff was in the 32nd Century.

The first hyperdrives were in the 22nd Century.

What you said cannot be true.

I hasten to add that when I say that, I'm not accusing you of lying. It's either the info you're using, the way you're interpreting it, or the way you're posting it on here that's incorrect.
