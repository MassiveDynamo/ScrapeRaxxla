A Quirium drive is a hyperdrive. It is by definition FTL travel. All hyperdrives are FTL. Perhaps you're meaning something different than FTL?

What you said:

"“The first hyperdrive was reverse engineered from numerous Thargoid ships that were captured by the Galactic Cooperative during the INRA-Thargoid war."

The INRA-Thargoid stuff was in the 32nd Century.

The first hyperdrives were in the 22nd Century.

What you said cannot be true.

I hasten to add that when I say that, I'm not accusing you of lying. It's either the info you're using, the way you're interpreting it, or the way you're posting it on here that's incorrect.

That’s not what I said (well I did but...), it’s what I quoted word for word by copy and paste off the cannon site under the name ‘quarrium’ drives.
If your determine FTL as faster than light travel then I guess a quarrium drive can fit into that description, but wormholes are folds in space and they are currently theoretical let’s not forget and elite dangerous is as realistic as it gets. Hawkins theory predict wormholes to be able to transport something instantaneously through space essentially teleporting, so no actual travelling is needed. It’s just a ‘ta da!’ magic trick. FTL or ‘faster than light TRAVEL’ ( in its name ) is an object moving faster than the speed of light but you don't need to be moving faster than the speed of light to be transported by the worm hole.
