What many of you fail to realize is that before humans go to Deep Space, we send the machines. During WW3 those machines sat out there for a few decades while we recouped from the devastation. This is also a part of the hidden, unwritten, and unspoken lore of what happened during that time, to be exact, how the AI developed while it sat out there gaining Sentience. I've got plenty of proof to support this claim, though I will not give All of it here. I will however tell you that it is a result of the Philip K AI we currently are developing which can be seen here.

Sentient Machines
A sentient machine has artificial general intelligence (AGI). It can successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can or it can perform general intelligent action.[1] This is also referred to as strong AI.[2] Machine sentience has been banned in Federal, Empire and Alliance...

"AI which imitates humans is less advanced than machine sentience. However, it is believed that one or two AI (sentient machines) have escaped into deep space."
