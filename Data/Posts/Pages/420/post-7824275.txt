That’s not what I said (well I did but...), it’s what I quoted word for word by copy and paste off the cannon site under the name ‘quarrium’ drives.
If your determine FTL as faster than light travel then I guess a quarrium drive can fit into that description, but wormholes are folds in space and they are currently theoretical let’s not forget and elite dangerous is as realistic as it gets. Hawkins theory predict wormholes to be able to transport something instantaneously through space essentially teleporting, so no actual travelling is needed. It’s just a ‘ta da!’ magic trick. FTL or ‘faster than light TRAVEL’ ( in its name ) is an object moving faster than the speed of light but you don't need to be moving faster than the speed of light to be transported by the worm hole.
Hey, like I said, I wasn't accusing you of anything and I said the source might be wrong.

The only point I'd make there is it's probably worth sense checking what the sources say.

I use FTL as faster than light. If we're talking about travelling, which we are, then it's FTL travel.

Quirium Drives were Hyperdrives. The fuel used was called Quirium. Hyperdrives in this context being a drive for transiting through hyperspace. It's a form of FTL travel.

Wormholes would also involve travelling - they need to be entered, traversed and exited.

If we're talking realistically then you can't ever be moving faster than the speed of light, and all hypothetical forms of FTL travel involve getting around that restriction in a form where you don't locally move faster than light (which you can't) but still arrive at the destination faster than light would (if that light was travelling the 'ordinary' route through normal space).
