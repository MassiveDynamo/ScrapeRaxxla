Later Generation Ships did have FTL. (Knew I remembered it from somewhere, but have had to delay replying while I searched for a source for it. )

I'm also pretty sure that their use extended past the discovery of the Mars Relic, but I need to try and fish out something more definite about that. The best I've got to hand is:

"The first generation ship was launched in 2097, and in the centuries that followed, many more set off into the vastness of space."

Exactly what 'centuries' constitutes in that context is pretty open to interpretation, and would be valid for both them stopping setting off prior to the discovery of the Mars Relic, or for them continuing to set off for hundreds of years after that.

We should define what FTL means. What we are currently doing is more transitions than FTL. Keep mind that I define Transition from Perry Rhodan as instant transit from one place to another whereas FTL from my point of view is more or less what Starfleet does with Warp Drive technology.
