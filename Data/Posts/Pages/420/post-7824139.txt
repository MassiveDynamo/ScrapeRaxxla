Not sure where you're getting this from but quite a lot is wrong. (And some of it has already been covered on this thread over the last few days.)

They had something better than FTL, A quarrium drive.

A Quirium drive isn't better than an FTL drive, it is an FTL drive. All hyperdrives are FTL drives.

â€œThe first hyperdrive was reverse engineered from numerous Thargoid ships that were captured by the Galactic Cooperative during the INRA-Thargoid war.
No, the first hyperdrives were in the early 22nd century. The INRA stuff is 1,000 years after that.

In 3125 AD the original hyperdrive was powered by a fuel known as Quirium.
As per the above this is 1,000 years after hyperdrives were invented.

Tacticus2711 said:
Most Quirium based hyperdrives had a limited jump range
Limited compared to what? Anything to support what those limits actually were?

Tacticus2711 said:
but some people were able to engineer drives to jump across the galaxy or even to other galaxies.
This is not currently canon for ED.
