At least that's how I understand Wiki.

They had something better than FTL, A quarrium drive.

“The first hyperdrive was reverse engineered from numerous Thargoid ships that were captured by the Galactic Cooperative during the INRA-Thargoid war. At the INRA base Almeida Landing, the research team of the engineer Effie Ratling figured out how Thargoid hyperdrives worked to create stable wormholes. This was different than human drives which shifted space around a ship. She created a prototype hybrid drive. When she handed in her report INRA took over and made modifications to the hybrid drive to get it to the test-flight stage. Ratling was only kept as a consultant.

During the first test flight, the wormhole was stable, but Effie Ratling voiced concern about whether a human being would survive going through it. The pilot died when he returned from the wormhole. His body was turned inside out, but the ship was unscathed. INRA launched an investigation, blamed Ratling for the accident and canceled the project. However, INRA carried on testing it in secret until the first hyperdrive was complete.

In 3125 AD the original hyperdrive was powered by a fuel known as Quirium. It's a high energy density material that was produced by the Galactic Cooperative (GalCop). They closely guarded the secret formula of how to produce it. Most Quirium based hyperdrives had a limited jump range, but some people were able to engineer drives to jump across the galaxy or even to other galaxies.

The secret formula was lost when GalCop dissolved on August 19, 3174. The hyperspace industry suffered a major setback. For the next 100 years faster than light travel (FTL) was done using more primitive and slower methods.”
