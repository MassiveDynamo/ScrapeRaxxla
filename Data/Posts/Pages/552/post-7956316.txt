A romanian player told me that Xibalba is slang for mystery in Bulgarian. It is not an object just a word of definition. So he went to the far bottom right quadrant of SAG-A looking for the mystery there first.

Yeah, it becomes clear that there is a different Raxxla, with different clues leading to it for every game localisation. In the English one, it sits on the brow of Cassiopeia, for Russkies in the Corona Borealis, Spaniards are searching Coma Berenices as well as the top of the MW and Pythagorians, from all over the World, who only swear by the Greek spelling are searching.. idk where as I've forgotten most of my maths, etc...
I was told that there even is a mysterious obfuscated Rakslasaurus for those playing that Jurassic World-thing too !
Aren't FD great ?
