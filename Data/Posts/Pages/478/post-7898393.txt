So I just got back from a short exploration trip and decided to drop my data off with the Dark Wheel - because you never know.

Except I realized that we DO know that giving exploration data to the Dark Wheel has no effect on our chances of finding Raxxla - beyond getting allied with the DW if you're not already.

"Why do we know this?" I can hear you asking - because Shinrarta Dezhra has only one orbital station, and the ownership of that station is locked to the Pilots' Federation. This means that prior to planetary landings, there were no stations owned by the DW, so no way to sell them exploration data, and therefore it can't be part of the Raxxla 'unlock' process.

Still, I sold it there anyway - because you never know
