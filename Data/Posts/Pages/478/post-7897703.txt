The Witchhead is one of various unlocked areas which are inside the Col 70 permit locked region.

Col 70 is roughly a 1,000 ly diameter sphere.

Unlocked sectors inside Col 70 include Witchhead, Spirograph, an NGC, Running Man, Orion, Flame, Barnards Loop. Horsehead Dark is also inside but is locked.

The Witchead Sector is at the ‘North’ so is surrounded by Col 70 on all sides except the ‘South’ and ‘South-East’ (maybe some of ‘East’ as well).

It’s been that way for a long long time.

I'm trying to picture north and east and south on the Galaxy map as I rotate it and flip it upside down and all of those directions lose all meaning LOL
