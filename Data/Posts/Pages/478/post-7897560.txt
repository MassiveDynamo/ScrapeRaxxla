Correct me if i'm wrong, but i'm pretty sure there is indeed a large permit locked section that includes at least part of the witch head nebula. AFAIK, the actual nebula isnt locked, but there is a permit locked area that is often referred to by it's proximity.

Edit: apparently, the locked sector is just "above" the nebula. Can't play today to verify, but i'm sure others will confirm
The Witchhead is one of various unlocked areas which are inside the Col 70 permit locked region.

Col 70 is roughly a 1,000 ly diameter sphere.

Unlocked sectors inside Col 70 include Witchhead, Spirograph, an NGC, Running Man, Orion, Flame, Barnards Loop. Horsehead Dark is also inside but is locked.

The Witchead Sector is at the ‘North’ so is surrounded by Col 70 on all sides except the ‘South’ and ‘South-East’ (maybe some of ‘East’ as well).

It’s been that way for a long long time.
