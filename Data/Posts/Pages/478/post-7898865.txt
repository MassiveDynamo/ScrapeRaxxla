Yeah, we had that discussion here, years ago, (iirc, can't find the link, or was it in another thread ? ).
The thing was, if TDW is a key to find Raxxla, anything that increments your good relationship with them should be ok... Whatever the dynamics of the game offers at that precise time (CG, BGS, GalNet events, etc...)

This. Just this. Because, with FD's inconsistencies and game mechanics reworks it goes to show you never can tell..
C'est la vie.

Is that so I can infiltrate NTDW meetings and find out where TRDW are?
Or just to make me look silly?? Might be a useful disguise to keep in my flight suit cargo pocket!

Been pondering the DW Codex entry “only a handful of the bravest and most competent pilots of each
generation are honoured with an invitation to join the group. It is futile to attemp to
contact the Dark Wheel on one's own initiative, however - it is always they who initiate
contact, initially in disguise, revealing their true identity only once a suitable test of
courage and skill has been discreetly administered, and passed.” Bearing in mind they’re “a legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters” I don’t think any assassination missions would form the test. Must be related to exploration/adventure/treasure hunting. And the implication is that it is only a single test, so no point repeating fruitless mssions?

And another thought-according to Felicity they “shut down” anyone pretending to to be Dark Wheel. So all we need to do is put out a rumour about someone, then follow whoever “shuts them down”!

P.S. keep it quiet but SCYTALE SAYS HE’S A MEMBER OF THE DARK WHEEL!
Now what did I do with that disguise??
