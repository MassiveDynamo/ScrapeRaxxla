The clue may be that Conda itself. Only a Hutton-Conda with pre-registered unique coords can find Raxxla !
Did you open the GalMap of this ship ? She may have unknown permits granted !
Yeah, opened up the Galmap. Think there was a bug though, there was already a route plotted when I opened it. No biggie though, just plotted a new one to where I was going. Couldnâ€™t be bothered to put a bug report in for such a trivial issue.
