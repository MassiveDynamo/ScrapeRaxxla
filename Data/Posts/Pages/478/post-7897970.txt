Harmless stuff, just a standard joke.

Sounds like we'd need a new hoax. Something outrageous, yet well researched and plausible, irresistible to your personal hopes and fears, raising just enough adrenalin to override some of the obstacles of a cold, deductive mind, and enter the realm of dreams and wild hypothesis. The mind can be a dangerous thing. You know you want to fight the apathy with myth echoes. Apotheosis is the birth of a culture.
