The idea that it's not an a planetary surface is erroneous.

You can see a lot of surface details from orbit. There is no reason to believe that it couldn't be placed on a surface we can't reach. The only thing Fdev said was that you could find raxxla... Not that you could visit it.

It's also extremely unlikely there are any connections to mythology or books in regards to where raxxla is. Not only would it not make any sense in lore (since mythology and thus the names of stars etc are earth centric and raxxla is decidedly not human-made ....but fdev has stated that there would be no clues to raxxla).

Raxxla is meant to be a needle in the haystack blind search that has a good chance of never coming to fruition. It would be immensely stupid of fdev to not draw out it's discovery for as long as possible...if not indefinitely. Finding it is not in anyone's benefit. The search is.

I just keep my eyes out for anything obviously weird as I jump randomly from system to system. That's no better odds than someone spending a lot of effort trying to find connections and clues where there are none. Though, if it's in a roid cluster....the only way it'll be found is if fdev leaks it. nobody's checking all those.
