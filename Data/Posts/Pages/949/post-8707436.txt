Quite possibly. (and such a game breaking event would be unlikely to be allowed).

BUT... if each player 'had to make their own journey' to unlock the ability - and that journey was so challenging / puzzling, then only a very few select 'best of the best' would manage it, then I can still see that being allowed. This would probably mean that each 'journey' would be different enough that no two commanders had the same path to the unlock.

I don't know that I necessarily believe what I've described, but the thought struck me. And I'm a firm believer that you shouldn't self-censor in a brainstorming situation, because although your own thought might be wrong - or at least incomplete - that it may trigger a better thought in another reader.
