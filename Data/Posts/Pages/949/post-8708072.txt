It is possible that we are barking up the wrong odyssey, with the Odyssey.

The quest for Raxxla was after all originally, the quest of Jason Ryder and his band of merry Dark Wheelers.

In the context of Greek mythology this probably corresponds better to Jason and the Argonauts and the quest for the Golden Fleece.

Their ship the Argos is neatly depicted in the sky, as the Argos Navis constellation. Argos Navis is now split into the three constellations Carina (the hull), Puppis (the poop deck) and Vela (the sails). Seen from earth, this is Guardian space.

After doing a tour of 6 systems Wednesday that I interpreted from the Odyssey just this afternoon I did a tour of 6 systems that I interpreted from the Argonautica....
Hasn’t produced any DW invitation so far....

P.s. did you report the sysmap anomalies we found as a potential graphics bug (to see what the FD reaction would be?)
