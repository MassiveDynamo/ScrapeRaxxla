That’s almost my reasoning as well, it could be an unremarkable moon or asteroid, as the codex states openly for all eyes to see

so big difference between The gamma and the beta was stellar forge.The beta was conducted with a limited amount of test systems 500
Star systems (and no raxxla
Apparently) with the gamma came the 4.3billion stars of the galaxy And asteroid mining it i was recall correctly?
So the tools at our desposal att launch are ALL we need to find raxxla.
Not in a a fancy station interior on a planets surface (orbital maybe - I did like that suggestion), or discovetable by an srv,
But rather something that cane be found by Discover scanners and Visual confirmation.
But in this I include all those fiddly asteroid clusters which sap my enthusiasm for finding raxxla.
Because if one was to follow the star systems of “The odyssey”, my bet is, you got to follow it vi the economical routes which are standard for all ship types, and scan every damned asteroid cluster, ring and every USS that pops up, ignore installations and planets surfaces and deep core mining. Just the basic tools we had at launch count.
I intend to do the broad strokes first.
But “Maybe” there is a long and detailed List of specific system scans One needs to Registered which finally unlocks a permit for raxxla(?)
