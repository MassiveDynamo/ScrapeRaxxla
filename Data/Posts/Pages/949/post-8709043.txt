May I quickly say Boff'in that your insights ( and humour ) have been fantastic. Thank you and I am investigating your theories into my own discovery path.

At the start Frontier Developments may not have taken the "Raxxla" situation very seriously and it was a discoverable system / body / station / space unicorn / alcoholic beverage in game. Then later they changed it into something more substantial like the Zarura, possibly locking it behind a permit system. Unlockable by a 'journey' that curtails gaining ranks, exploration and missions to gain attention from the Dark Wheel.

Atm I am ( hopefully ) getting such attention from TDW gaining allied statues with such corporations and entities that I feel they would have their eyes on. Also I explore thoroughly every system I pass through as much to my ability. It's slow but rather enjoyable. I am in no rush.

Btw, your 'avatar' reminds me of an old game Mercenary on the good old ZX Spectrum. Aaaah, memories

Mercenary, Bingo.
one of my favourite games on the c64. Massive open world sandbox, mysteries and puzzles.
