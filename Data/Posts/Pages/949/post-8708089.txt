Literally just heard on the news that the IG Noble prize has gone to team who gave Helium to an Alligator to make it grunt in a higher pitch, you couldnt make it up!



possibility, chance, likelihood, probability, almost certainly



Define mystery and define simple

There will be no clues = there is no 'mystery' not in a treasure hunt sense, there is nothing to find but Raxxla itself

Simple - Its just there, wherever it is, 1 in 400bn systems and its on one of them, explanations for why its there can come after if needed. Nothing will lead to it

they were just trying to come up with a snappy way of producing party balloons!

Unless Raxxla is within something else! I was struck as I just ended today’s gameplay by the resemblance of the Raxxla codex logo to the guiding lights and hub structure within a station. Wonder if you find this feature within a station (they’ve been in-game from outset) that matches the logo whether that would indicate you’ve found the right system, or whether you “enter” the structure (i.e. a disguised omphalos)?
