oh and try to forget that cutey 3 head dog Cerebus guarding the underworld, that's Hercules and not Odysseus...which like the River Styxx (45 ly from Sol)

You can download a free copy of The Odyssey from Project Gutenberg!

You’re assuming that humanity’s expansion would have been by a spherical shell. I think that’s not quite right. It would have averaged out to be spherical, but would have actually occurred as a spiky “morning star weapon” shape, since they would have not immediately travelled to uninteresting places like LYT systems, but would have emphasised GKM systems for colonisation and any scoop-able systems for travel waypoints to reach them, filling in the gaps later as a much lower priority (& missing out uninteresting places which is why so much of the bubble had unexplored systems).
