I didn't mean "Fdevs testing area" access.

Just the ability to go anywhere in the galaxy at will.
Oh, I see what you mean. But like I said in my previous reply, no. That ability would have to be available to ALL players. Effectively killing off the abilities of the FSD, hyperspace traveling, The engineers and almost all gameplay in general. If one of the superpowers had that ability then they could instantly appear anywhere and wipe out their enemies in an a flash. Thousands of commanders could instantly turn up in Thargoid space and wipe them out before the Thargoids knew what the hell just happened. Gangs of gankers would cause unlimitless chaos possibly causing quite a lot of players to quit the game. Thousands of reasons why I think it's not.
