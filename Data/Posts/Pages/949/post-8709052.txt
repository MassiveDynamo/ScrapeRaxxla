A thought occurred to me this morning (it happens occasionally) whilst in the shower
DB video “ED has a story that "embraces all the players"
m.youtube.com/watch?v=gDh9G1gDgMU
he talks about an invitation to join a secret organisation as being an event that happens at a certain point in a player’s progression/journey through the game.

"You know, if you get invited to join a secret organisation, that can happen to lots of people. And the great thing is, if it doesn't happen to you you'll go "oh, why have they not invited me?" But then that's exciting, you'll think "oh well, ok, I did kill that policeman the other day, maybe I need to get my reputation a bit higher."

The thought was that if you know other people have been invited.....
It’s not a very secret organisation!
