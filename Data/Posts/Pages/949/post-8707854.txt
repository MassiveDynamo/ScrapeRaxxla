does exist the possibility

possibility, chance, likelihood, probability, almost certainly

that the Raxxla mystery is realy , REALLY simple.

Define mystery and define simple

There will be no clues = there is no 'mystery' not in a treasure hunt sense, there is nothing to find but Raxxla itself

Simple - Its just there, wherever it is, 1 in 400bn systems and its on one of them, explanations for why its there can come after if needed. Nothing will lead to it
