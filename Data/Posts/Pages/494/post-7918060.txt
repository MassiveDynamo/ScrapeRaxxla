Yes, ofc. Would have been too nice... But did Lave have that moon in former Elite games ?
You mean a line Sol - Vega and another Lave (or so) - Cassiopeia ?
Should we open the plotters and calculate vectors ?

Did a quick google :

From Elite II



Not sure what the Plus under Lave is for... Moon or Asteroid belt. Alan Stroud described Lave as moonless in Lave Revolution but I think the story is that Lave II was a large asteroid in the Castellan belt (possibly home to secret bases) ... that was recently reclassified as a planet.



taken from the local news before they were wiped

Incidentally if anyone is interested here is a partial alphabet for Lavian Phoenix symbols:
