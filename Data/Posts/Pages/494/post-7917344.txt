There the "old" systems may come into play. As stated above. (Systems from Elite (1984) thread).
I analyzed those system too some time ago and generated a blender model to see those systems in 3D without any obstacles.
See my post (and a screenshot) here: Systems from Elite (1984)
My hope was to "see" something special. It was not a "wow" moment, but it was interesting to see that most of the systems form some kind of own "bubble".
AND: The systems Erlaza, Aten, Atius,Rain and Ra are outside of this bubble. 5 systems, almost a pentagon. Maybe that could mean something.

Others have mentioned this too and I think that's also a valid point: As a software developer, creating a new instance of an old classic, I would (like FDev) add something from the "legacy" application into the new game. So that players could say "Wow! Look: Lave! I remember that from my old days on my Amstrad/C64/BBC.. whatever)
So the developer/designer chooses a handful of common systems to be added to the new game. One, two, maybe five.
But why added FDev so many? And they span over multiple old maps. As I wrote in my post:
"..why use planets of map 1,2,3,6 and 8? Why not 4 or 5? Or just from map 1? .."

I think the old worlds may be very important. I suspect that 'Mother of galaxies' may refer to Galaxy 1, from the Galcop maps.
