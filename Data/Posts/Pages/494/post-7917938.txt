Okay. Here's the rub. I traveled to the Neutron star. I super fueled my drive. Then I returned to the Black hole. I stayed in supercruise as long as possible before dropping out. I looked to the left to anchor my sight on the Milky Way as it does disappear near this thing. I saw it accelerate backward. I know what light distortion looks like. This was NOT that. Hell, there was a rumble as if I was about to jump. But as usual, I dropped out of supercruise. Guys, I am an old git and not one for speculation or excitement. but I would like someone else to do the same.
