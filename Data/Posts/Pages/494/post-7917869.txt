On a side note, there are not many scoopable stars containing a Neutron AND a Black Hole but the Thargoids seem to like them.
Is there a system you can target from 27 Cass that would aim through the black hole from the direction of having charged your fsd after scooping the main star? This would be my series of foolishness to try
