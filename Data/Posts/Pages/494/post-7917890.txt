Is there a system you can target from 27 Cass that would aim through the black hole from the direction of having charged your fsd after scooping the main star? This would be my series of foolishness to try
Heading from the bubble I ended up at the main star. It was a long burn to the Black Hole ( I went directly there ) and then as I got close things went very strange. The nearby nebulae was directly behind as was a peculiar bright star ( possible supernova ).
I'm not trying to start a witch hunt but the system is strange. Three bodies in one system. All 'sort of' correlating to the clues and it also seemed that three orbs have somehow been linked to Raxxla.
