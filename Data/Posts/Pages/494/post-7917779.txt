Mmmmhh... IF the TDW's toast tells us where Raxxla is, then TDW has already found Raxxla, or at least knows where it is. Which, imho, is highly dubious and questionable.
Keep in mind, "Mother of galaxies" in the English localization. "Mother of all the galaxies" in some other. Is Cassiopeia to be considered as the mother of all the galaxies?
Now that "W" shape is interesting, because it can be viewed as a crown shape. In Russky localization of ED, the jewel burns in the Korona (crown).
Are there other "jewels burning in crowns" ?
SPOILER
