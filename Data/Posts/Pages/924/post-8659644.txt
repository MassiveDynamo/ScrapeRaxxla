Decided to do an in-depth analysis of the recent trailer.
I think they may have revealed something.
Possibly have found something of interest to some of you.
2 possible Dark Wheel station locations found. Literal vanishing planets and hidden systems,
two 8th moons of gas giants that vanish from radar. Ghost Worlds.

You're pointing out of Thornycroft Terminal made me wonder - Thornycroft / Tornquist?

Tornquist or Törnquist or Tørnquist is a surname of Swedish origin. The word can mean"Thorn twig" or "thorn branch".

Thornycroft terminal is in Kuwair, meaning "small seawater canal".

Im there now, nothing out of the ordinary, lots of pirate contracts for the neighbouring system.

Then again Tornquist always made me think of Eumaeus, who lived in a hut of thorn branches and welcomes Odysseus the wandering vagabond...
