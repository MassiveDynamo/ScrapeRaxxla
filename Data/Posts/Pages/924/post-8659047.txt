I've got a few o those at Jameson Memorial... normally it's a "small crew" with a VIP passenger of some kind... good rewards. Nothing stood out, really.

Iâ€™m at Jameson now, allied with 3 & friendly with 4th faction. No sign of anything obviously a luxury passenger mission, which is why I was asking. It gets tedious continually reading all the mission descriptions!
