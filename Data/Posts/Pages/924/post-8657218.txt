Yesterday while watching the Odyssey dev diary, spotted a comment that seemed funny and mockingly I proceded to laugh, but then the Sampling tool apears again and with Raxxla already in mind cuz the comment, I thought that the edges of the logo looks like the spikes of the tool, then put my hat on and made the img.

the coment was "Will odyssey be needed to find Raxxla?" . . . but but we already know that it's in game since the release, right guys!?
