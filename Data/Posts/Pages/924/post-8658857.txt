Has anyone actually seen a “luxury passenger” mission come up on the board? Does it have it’s own icon?
Been googling for 30 minutes and haven’t found anything relevant

I’m asking because I’ve got a nice shiny Orca and that’s a mission type I’ve never done & can’t remember ever seeing one. I can see luxury passenger missions are also VIP missions (with the crown icon), but do I have to read through each VIP mission description to find out if its got a luxury cabin requirement or is there something that would tell me immediately?
