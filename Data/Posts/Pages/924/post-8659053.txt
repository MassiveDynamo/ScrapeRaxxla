The only Lighthouse I recall is Jackson's Lighthouse system - its one of the many 0 pop with allegiance systems in game (though it's not in the H+S). There are 238 of these at last count although only a few are really suspicious. A large proportion have Allegience "Guardian" or "Thargoid". Another bunch are prison facilities. And then there are a whole load which just look like human error. CM Draconis is the standout in my dataset - not that you'll find Raxxla there as it is only on the list due to inconsistent data in EDDB
you do not understand me ... oh, this google translator .... someone not so long ago, on a line from the toast of the dark wheel, could find in the nebula a heart and soul a beacon about Cupid, it seems, or Cupid's arrow. I'm interested in this
