Decided to do an in-depth analysis of the recent trailer.
I think they may have revealed something.
Possibly have found something of interest to some of you.
2 possible Dark Wheel station locations found. Literal vanishing planets and hidden systems,
two 8th moons of gas giants that vanish from radar. Ghost Worlds.
