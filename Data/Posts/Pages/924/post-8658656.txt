VERY URGENT QUESTION! who remembers and can tell how the lighthouse was found in the heart and soul nebula? I remember someone found a lighthouse there

The only Lighthouse I recall is Jackson's Lighthouse system - its one of the many 0 pop with allegiance systems in game (though it's not in the H+S). There are 238 of these at last count although only a few are really suspicious. A large proportion have Allegience "Guardian" or "Thargoid". Another bunch are prison facilities. And then there are a whole load which just look like human error. CM Draconis is the standout in my dataset - not that you'll find Raxxla there as it is only on the list due to inconsistent data in EDDB
