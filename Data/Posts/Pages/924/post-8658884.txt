I’m asking because I’ve got a nice shiny Orca and that’s a mission type I’ve never done & can’t remember ever seeing one. I can see luxury passenger missions are also VIP missions (with the crown icon), but do I have to read through each VIP mission description to find out if its got a luxury cabin requirement or is there something that would tell me immediately?
I've got a few o those at Jameson Memorial... normally it's a "small crew" with a VIP passenger of some kind... good rewards. Nothing stood out, really.
