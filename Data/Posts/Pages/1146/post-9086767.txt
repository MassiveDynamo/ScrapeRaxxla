Go visit New Yembo... drop on the existing asteroid belt close to the main star, then open system map and try to do the same with the 3 "non-existing" others...

Then you can post here why the bug on a hand-crafted system would only apply to 3 out of 4 asteroid belts.

Just don't give an oppinion on something you haven't checked by yourself.
