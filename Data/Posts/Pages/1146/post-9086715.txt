Ok, try this... fly over New Yembo, take a look on the regular Asteroid Belt close to the main star.
Then open system map and go visit the other 3 missing ones...

If you don't start scratching your head on why this system so far-off is the home of UC and why the bloody crap there are 3 non-present asteroid belts in the system, then you should retire your tin-foil hattery because oddity and "questioning" is the hole point of searching for something as evasive as Raxxla
