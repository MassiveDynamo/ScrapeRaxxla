placing the target-to-drop signal inside the Sun has worried me for a long time. Of course it means that nobody can use it to drop accurately, which presumably means there is something that is accessible if you drop in the correct place (Not saying it’s Raxxla but it’s Raxxla!!!). What worries me is how can we then drop into it? It’s just going to be random, which as I said before is not enjoyable gameplay. For a while I suspected the “asteroid cluster” detections in the HUD might be the key, but I now suspect it’s just random throughout the belt-you’ve just got to be in the right place at the right time!
I wonder if there is a way that they could link it to a permit that would cause the target to be visible. No permit, in the sun not visible.

My money is also on unfixed bugs though for both Sol and New Yembo, as much as I like the Sol theory.

Unless there is some other evidence, Occam's Razor and all that.
