Spoiler - Oysters. Best Spoiler title ever

Anybody else noticing RL is trying to fit into ED universe? A new source of gravity a long time ago just discovered that as yet nobody sure what it was (Raxxla obviously and why they haven't found out what it was yet)



Now you say that I remember reading it somewhere too and fairly sure it was an official source not urban myth. Not sure about 'excuse' though, they could easily have put it in like any other system and they put in the Voyager probes and a TB about the missing Tesla so seems more like lore that we humans completely ravaged / depleted our own system resources for profit or at least some of it.

Can you remember where it was said / source it though? Was it a Tourist Beacon in Sol or an article? Racking my brain but was a long time ago I saw it.

Edit: Not Tourist Beacon in Sol, listed and transcribed below in link. Spoiler warning it lists other systems as well but first on list is Sol ones. Maybe it was a dev diary or something?

Is it in a Codex entry? I remember seeing it too.
