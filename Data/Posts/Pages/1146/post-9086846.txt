Then you can post here why the bug on a hand-crafted system would only apply to 3 out of 4 asteroid belts.

Well not surprisingly my answer would be 'Because its a bug'. Why can I sometimes do something in game and other times cant do the same thing? Why does SLF sometimes cause rubber-banding and other times doesn't? All these things I just generally assume some sort of bug or error that isn't consistent and doesn't always 'make sense'. I just asked a question to rule it in or out.

'Assumption is the mother of all screw ups'. Your reply assumes I haven't tried to drop in on those signals in Sol or New Yembo.

Don't take a question in a discussion as a dismissal or an attack, it was purely for clarity and suggestion based on known facts. If its wrong its wrong. Just adding it to the discussion for checking or dismissal if known otherwise but not assuming anything such as 'That has been thought about and proven not to be the case' unless I see it posted by someone, nobody had so I asked the question is all.
