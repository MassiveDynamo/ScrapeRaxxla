Ok, fair enough:
Why place the target-to-drop signal inside the Sun?
And Frontier wanted New Yembo to have some "ghost asteroid belts" as welll that far from the bubble?

Don't think so...
Because zero clusters literally means you cannot drop on it because it is absent. However it is present in game, because game cannot have zero-size belt. Conflict.
Simple solution - move cluster into Sun where nobody can drop.
