Simpler solution "if cluster size = zero, then delete cluster"
Something that is not present just don't exist...
It must be present because it is mentioned for Sol system in books.
Point is, regular normal space wide clusters, like in Sol, have 1 rock per million kms in avr. However you can not use such for practical game, because ...distance.
So for the game purpose they condensed rocks, named it clusters. But Sol cannot have such as we don't see such in real life.

All asteroid belts you ever could see in movies like star wars are fake. Distance between rocks is measured in hundreds thousands kms.
