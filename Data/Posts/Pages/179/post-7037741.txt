I've thought for a while now that the cyclops is a "thargoid" by creation/evolution, a creature, rather than a 'ship' piloted by an insectoid being.

Hopefully, time will tell, one way or the other.

My thoughts as well. I don't think that the Thargoids ever developed spaceflight. I think they evolved it.
