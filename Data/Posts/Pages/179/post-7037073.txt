This is the problem with retconning, you never know when it stops & what to believe, which FD never appear to lay down in hard print. Does detract from my immersion!

And good point, I still think what we are seeing is not really the Thargoids. You’d think with FD’s expertise in animating dinosaurs that they could manage realistic “insectoids, crustacean-like bodies, ridged and plated carapace mottled brown and yellow, with clawed limbs” (from OOTD)

Maybe the Thargoid ships we are seeing are flown by telepresence (as we do with slf). All the Thargs themselves stay on a mothership which remains in witchspace. With the way the Tharg tech seems to work, the ships we see are probably grown out of the mothership rather than carried by it.
