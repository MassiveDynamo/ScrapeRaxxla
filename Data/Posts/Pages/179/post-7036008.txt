Right, wise old man ... Any imaginable inconsistency with the official RH's lore coming from FD is always a heavy possibility. Who would deny ?
I can perfectly imagine Raxxla turning out not to be a planet inhabitaded by twisted people or even a certain celestial body. But, in this case, what a lack of respect for the RH's work to keep calling "it" Raxxla, isn't it ? IF they change the object, they should also change the name of the object.
For myself, the non canon "Oolite Raxxla" is the one which seduces me most. Witchspace. Eight interconnected portals across the MW, etc...


Good question, Doc. After all... who has really seen a Tharg in ED ?




Nothing new figured about the "Smurf Galaxy" ?

This is the problem with retconning, you never know when it stops & what to believe, which FD never appear to lay down in hard print. Does detract from my immersion!

And good point, I still think what we are seeing is not really the Thargoids. You’d think with FD’s expertise in animating dinosaurs that they could manage realistic “insectoids, crustacean-like bodies, ridged and plated carapace mottled brown and yellow, with clawed limbs” (from OOTD)
