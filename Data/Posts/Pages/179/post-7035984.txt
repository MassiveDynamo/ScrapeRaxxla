Ok, so we're not following up on the 'Utopia' lead? I mean, Utopia is a power in the game and is also a 'place that isn't a place'.

Just sayin...

The Antal's Utopia is interesting because it shows a human group with similar attitude towards technology as the Guardians that chose AI implants.
This group of Guardians were forcefully exiled and we have no records of what happened to them. We only know they were in a period of extremely rapid evolution, when the were banished from the greater Guardian society.

Antal talks about preserving the collective soul of our species(our memories) in the SIM-Archive: https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/5adf3499b14e287e736eb6de

The Guardian exiles may have had similar ideas. As they were far more advanced than Utopia, they may have been able to 'upload' their entire conciseness and continue their 'lives' in the monolith network or in another artificial system.

Raxxla as an access point to this universe that isn't a place, could be an interesting option.

As a side note, we are seeing several reports of machines behaving suspiciously like they have developed free will. Could this be alien AI invading our technology, due to us messing with Guardian and Thargoid devices?
