You would indeed. They do have that expertise on site and we have animated avatars in our cockpits and yet the octo-ships seems oddly empty.


I'm rewatching Battlestar Galactica season 1 at the moment and a couple of episodes ago Starbuck escaped being marooned on a moon by commandeering a Cylon Raider, a metal fuselage full of ligaments and goop. Maybe the Thargoid octo-ships are the same sort of bio-mechanical hybrid.

Those two circles in the 'cockpit' look to much lie camera shutters to be a coincidence. Either these are the eyes of the ship or a stereoscopic camera for a pilot, deep inside the ship. Perhaps both.
They aren't always empty though. Sometimes (certainly in the early encounters) there are large spherical objects in there (over where the apertures are in the image above)

SPOILER

The pattern on the spheres is similar to that seen in the centre of the underneath of the crashed interceptors.
