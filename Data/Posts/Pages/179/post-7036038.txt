And good point, I still think what we are seeing is not really the Thargoids. You’d think with FD’s expertise in animating dinosaurs that they could manage realistic “insectoids, crustacean-like bodies, ridged and plated carapace mottled brown and yellow, with clawed limbs” (from OOTD)

You would indeed. They do have that expertise on site and we have animated avatars in our cockpits and yet the octo-ships seems oddly empty.

SPOILER

I'm rewatching Battlestar Galactica season 1 at the moment and a couple of episodes ago Starbuck escaped being marooned on a moon by commandeering a Cylon Raider, a metal fuselage full of ligaments and goop. Maybe the Thargoid octo-ships are the same sort of bio-mechanical hybrid.
