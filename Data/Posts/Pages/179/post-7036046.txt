You would indeed. They do have that expertise on site and we have animated avatars in our cockpits and yet the octo-ships seems oddly empty.



I'm rewatching Battlestar Galactica season 1 at the moment and a couple of episodes ago Starbuck escaped being marooned on a moon by commandeering a Cylon Raider, a metal fuselage full of ligaments and goop. Maybe the Thargoid octo-ships are the same sort of bio-mechanical hybrid.

I've thought for a while now that the cyclops is a "thargoid" by creation/evolution, a creature, rather than a 'ship' piloted by an insectoid being.

Hopefully, time will tell, one way or the other.
