You would indeed. They do have that expertise on site and we have animated avatars in our cockpits and yet the octo-ships seems oddly empty.



I'm rewatching Battlestar Galactica season 1 at the moment and a couple of episodes ago Starbuck escaped being marooned on a moon by commandeering a Cylon Raider, a metal fuselage full of ligaments and goop. Maybe the Thargoid octo-ships are the same sort of bio-mechanical hybrid.

Those two circles in the 'cockpit' look to much lie camera shutters to be a coincidence. Either these are the eyes of the ship or a stereoscopic camera for a pilot, deep inside the ship. Perhaps both.
