Those two circles in the 'cockpit' look to much lie camera shutters to be a coincidence. Either these are the eyes of the ship or a stereoscopic camera for a pilot, deep inside the ship. Perhaps both.

I vote for eyes, and if so, hopefully Fdev can animate them at some point to really add to the creepiness...
