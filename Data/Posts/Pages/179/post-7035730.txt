Point of Order!!!!
I may be old,with a poor memory, but I don’t think DB ever “confirmed there is a planet called Raxxla”.
Right, wise old man ... Any imaginable inconsistency with the official RH's lore coming from FD is always a heavy possibility. Who would deny ?
I can perfectly imagine Raxxla turning out not to be a planet inhabitaded by twisted people or even a certain celestial body. But, in this case, what a lack of respect for the RH's work to keep calling "it" Raxxla, isn't it ? IF they change the object, they should also change the name of the object.
For myself, the non canon "Oolite Raxxla" is the one which seduces me most. Witchspace. Eight interconnected portals across the MW, etc...

Are they really alien or are they frauds?
Good question, Doc. After all... who has really seen a Tharg in ED ?

Back from my circumnavigation in ~3weeks, good news is that I haven't found Raxxla,

Nothing new figured about the "Smurf Galaxy" ?
