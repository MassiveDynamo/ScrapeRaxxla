If youre looking into the word Raxxla remember it must have been reverse engineered if it means anything. It was in the 1984 novel, (and an earlier one) but not in the game, it wasn't meant to be a clue at that time so didn't have any significance. Any significance must have been added after if at all.

Ive often wondered if Raxxla is how Alex's little sister pronounced his name when learning to speak and the whole thing is a 'find your little sister' plot
