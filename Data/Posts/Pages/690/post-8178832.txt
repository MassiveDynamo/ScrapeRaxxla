I agree that the name is probably important. The RA 20 (Right alignment) angle has been investigated by many. RA is also the Sun god and may refer to Sol itself.

one of the early things i thought of doing when i discovered the raxxla mystery is to type it's name in the galmap, or look for similar names, and the only suspicious system that came up was RA. the idea whas that RA is the beginning of the word RAXXLA. so maybe the system RA is the begining of the clues/journey to Raxxla. i have done some exploration in there and found nothing too important. i found a sagan class explorer ship in there that, after i scanned it's ship travel log, gave me this:
SPOILER
by the looks of it, the ship's flight path was going from Ra => Ra(*) => LTT 9455. the second line was very suspicious to me. i also heavily explored LTT 9455 but the trail of clues ended there. i discovered later that all the other ships gave a similar ( *) on their flight operations plan so i scratched that theory out. but who knows, maybe there's something to the system RA...

to this day, RA and Tau ceti are very suspicious systems when it comes to raxxla, to me. tau ceti being the only system name mentioned in the raxxla codex, saying it's where the raxxla early stories first began circulating. (maybe it should be read as: thats where the journey begins...)
