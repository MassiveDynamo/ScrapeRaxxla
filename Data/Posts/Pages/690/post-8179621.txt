there are certain facts that have been given by fdev over the years since ed was released.

1. it's in the milky way.
2. it's in the game
3. it's not permit blocked or require any special ranking to find it
4. it's accessible to players (it's not at non-achievable jump ranges)
5. It's not connected to any current or past narrative plots
6. Fdev knows exactly where it is.
7. it's been in the game since the beginning.

The above is not in question unless you don't believe fdev ...in which case anything can be believable to you and there's no point in making any discussion regarding it.

There's been hints that's it's in or immediately around the bubble from one panel interview.
