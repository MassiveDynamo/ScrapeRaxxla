The 'real soontil' was shrouded in a 'fog' in 'And Here The Wheel'. Makes me wonder


Undoubtedly, RAXXLA seems to be everyone's biggest question. Mine included. Yet, they say it's not True cannon to the Elite universe. I do recall a post, two or three years back. Apparently RAXXLA is not the games greatest kept secret, and nor is it tied to it. I tend to believe it. RAXXLA is a planet in Andromeda. The RAXXLA that was in Lave was, but a coriolis station which acted as one of the gateways, or steps, to accessing Andromeda. From there RAXXLA still had to be found, and you can't tell which system in Andromeda it will be in, as it has the ability to be moved, system to system...but I highly doubt to entire galaxies. A coriolis station, however, can be renamed and hidden anywhere. So how do we know its not the very one we start in? Or in a debris field? For example. Lots of questions that just lead to more...yet, again, it allegedly is not the game's greatest kept secret.
