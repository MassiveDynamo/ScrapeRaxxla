haha guys something very funny happened. i went to the official website that sells the "raxxla amplifier" product wich is now "discontinued". they had a link "ask a question about raxxla mkII" so i asked them about the meaning of the name raxxla, and who thought of it, and why? and today i received a response.
SPOILER
i guess that answers that question.
