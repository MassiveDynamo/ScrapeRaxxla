That's not exactly correct although I am on the side of there being no triggers but only signpostings, a wink and a nudge so to speak.

From the interview by djtruthsayer -

"Raxxla is in the Milky Way. This was confirmed during DJTruthsayer's lore interview with Michael Brookes.[9] Question: "Where is Raxxla?" Brookes: "Well it's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where it is. It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." Question: "You have said that there will be no clues though?" Brookes: "That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious just so people know what they're doing. There's nothing to be revealed at this stage."[9]"

Watch the interview, the nuance is more easily understood when you listen to it.

The "there will be no clues" was by djtruthsayer. And how do you reconcile that with MB's subsequent line

Yeah, agreed, it needs to be watched really.

I always think it's worth noting that the first answer is a pre-prepared one, in response to questions which were sent to MB before the interview. The second was a follow on question on the spur of the moment, and the answer is MB, thinking on the spot. The eye movement and body language is interesting.
