I agree that the name is probably important. The RA 20 (Right alignment) angle has been investigated by many. RA is also the Sun god and may refer to Sol itself.

I've been looking at the option that the two Xs represents the crossing point of the Galactic plane with the Celestial plane and the Ecliptic plane respectively. The angles of a normal X do at least fit. I'm trying to align them to go from Raxxla to Raxla, so to speak.

If RA means Right Ascension then the XX could mean 20 or XXL might mean 30 (50 minus 20 but this would be unusual, XXX would be more normal representation). But that leaves the A or LA for Declination, which is meaningless. Also RA is just an angular measurement on the Earth’s ecliptic, you need declination and distance to give a point coordinate. So I’m not convinced RA does mean Right Ascension. The word RAXXLA might be a cypher key though, but is it a door??
