there are certain facts that have been given by fdev over the years since ed was released.

1. it's in the milky way.
2. it's in the game
3. it's not permit blocked or require any special ranking to find it
4. it's accessible to players (it's not at non-achievable jump ranges)
5. It's not connected to any current or past narrative plots
6. Fdev knows exactly where it is.
7. it's been in the game since the beginning.

The above is not in question unless you don't believe fdev ...in which case anything can be believable to you and there's no point in making any discussion regarding it.

There's been hints that's it's in or immediately around the bubble from one panel interview.

Whilst I agree with the sentiment, Raxxla is definitely part of the lore and has not been retconned out of Elite: Dangerous, I have to point out that some of what you have stated is incorrect. Some points are related to the Formidine Rift Mystery.

Some are pure speculation from Drew W. Drew himself has stated he does not know where Raxxla is, and his musings in regards to the matter should be taken only for what they are; speculation from a lore expert.

Whilst certainly worth more than a passing thought (Drewâ€™s The Old Worlds hypothesis is still one of my favourites), they are not proven theories or clues from FDEV.

Hopefully if @drew spots this he can reaffirm what I have said here to clear up any confusion.

All we know for certain is what is linked in the OP in this thread;
