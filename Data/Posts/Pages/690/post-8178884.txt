Has anyone ever seen anything saying when humanity developed FTL comms?

Just speculating on whether we should be treating that early era as being more akin to the Middle Ages in terms of how comms is dependent on transport, or more akin to the current era in real life where comms is independent of, and far far quicker than, transport.

(Or perhaps a blend where infrastructure has to be transported first, which then enables FTL comms between that point and the rest of the FTL comms infrastructure.)
