Need a citation on the mars relic being artificial if that's cool
From my timeline notes
2280 First alien artefact found on Mars. Artificial and measuring no more than a few centimetres square.
Allen Stroud’s PhD thesis quotes his ED lore bible as saying “In 2280, the first non-human relic was found in space. The object, no bigger than a child’s hand was collected by an orbital probe around Europa and quickly brought back to Earth. No information has ever been circulated as to the properties of this item or its origin.”

Tourist beacon 0175 calls it an “object”
Not in-game so maybe check the codex?

Timeline (https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dangerous_Timeline) says
“2280
A small object known as the Martian Relic, the first alien artefact ever documented, is discovered buried on Mars. As the Martian Relic was confiscated by the Federation shortly afterwards, it has been shrouded in secrecy for centuries, with its existence only confirmed by leaked Federal records. All that is known about the object is that it is artificial, it was not created by humans, and it measures no more than a few centimetres square.”

Interestingly the two sources for that EDTimeline entry are that tourist beacon and galnet (https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/57ee33959657baf15c5a5e67) , neither of which (now) confirm it is artificial....maybe retconned??

So unless the codex confirms it’s artifical I’m removing that word from my notes...
