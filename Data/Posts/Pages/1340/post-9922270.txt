So interesting enough I thought I look to see who ever reported this in the past and googled "Elite Dangerous Place that is not a place, A door that is also a key". I found an old reddit post from 7 years that gave the system by Cmdr_Fernweh. I not sure if this was discussed back then but it goes back to the whole Fortune again.

I checked to see what is so interesting about HIP 118321 and check the factions existing in this system. The one in control of the system is interesting enough HIP 118321 Fortune Incorporated. I am allied with them but I can't think of why and what purpose, Either I did it a long time ago when I tried to raise Empire rank and got bored cause I was trying to get a Cutter. Or another reason which I don't remember anymore.

Edit: Another thing about this user is they only posted 5 times 7 years ago and never done so since.

Edit2: Is it me or does this seem coincidental based on Raxxla codex of using Fernweh and then ' ' it for some reason.
