1.5 Patch Notes General Fixes/Tweaks https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/ships-1-5-beta-update-patch-notes.199470/said “Elite/Founder missions are now only available at the Founders World”, so maybe what you found was before that update restricted those missions to Shinrarta?

But see my post https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-9905639
And also my FD Quotes thread from my signature re mission system comments and E/F missions.
