Are you carrying any trinkets?
Of course! Got 5 in the cargo hold.
The whole point of my trip out to Seagull Sector was to get some to see if they opened up a “comet” into the “omphalos rift”...I’m still looking! Thought after the previous day or so conversation about wheels, dark &/or fortune, it was worth trying Fortuna....not being into Latin I wasnt aware of the “eyes to see” reference to her so that got me interested.
