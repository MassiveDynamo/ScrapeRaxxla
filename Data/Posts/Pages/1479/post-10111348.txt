I wonder how exactly they translate the text in the Codex?
I have now read the codex again in my (russian) language.

It says exactly: Princess Astrofel (that's her name) and stellar spiral. (i.e. a spiral of stars)

P.S. And long wanted to ask, what is this picture on the forum logo top left corner?
SPOILER
