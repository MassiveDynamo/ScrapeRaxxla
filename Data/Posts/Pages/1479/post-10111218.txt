Somehow I have a feeling that is merely a similar spelling besides we are talking in Elite Dangerous. This can be found in-game. As stated previously, there are four Jones Colony in four systems. So, which is the correct one? Previously, I mentioned not only is Essafa the older name for the system but also a reference to a very specific place on Earth.

From the "Mic Turner History" beacon:
Yes I understand that. I am asking if EssFafa is the same as Essafa. Cause there is a system named EssFafa in Frontier Elite 2.

Edit: Found this text where is clearly written Essfafa, not Essafa
