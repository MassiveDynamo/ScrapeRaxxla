His background mentions he is a founder of the Alliance tough, as an alternative to Fed and Empire. It could be just lore among many other stories. Why him, why Jones Colony?
You mention just 4 systems. You probably have gone there yourself, why don't you share your findings, if any?
Four systems because there is only four Jones Colony total in the game. Why Mic Turner? Because of anyone outside of the Ryders he is hands down the best lead on members of The Dark Wheel. He was one of the best CMDRs of his era and per First Encounters journals the Turner's Quest disappeared in Pleione while Turner was trying to make contact with the aliens. Seems like a good candidate for a member of The Dark Wheel (which were purportedly seeking Raxxla).

Secretive groups often hide in plain view - see Church of the Path in the Shibboleth system ( https://canonn.science/codex/the-church-of-the-path/ ).

The link to Earth:
Essafa/Es-safa/Al-safa, Syria

This is nearby to Jabal al-Druze or "Mountain of the Druze".

To be able to find out the rest, you must show your knowledge of how to enter the faith. Further, you must demonstrate knowledge of whereabouts is The Dark Wheel's (regional) bases (this is connected to the Essafa at Earth). I have truthfully already probably given out too much information...

Insofar as the TDW stations, simply provide details on what sets them apart and the connection to the Druze (identifying details and what term for sanctuary is from Earth). The TDW stations are exceptionally well known.
