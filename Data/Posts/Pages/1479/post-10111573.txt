It might be, but focus on Elite Dangerous.

Again, the point here is to learn for yourself. Focus instead what is the very specific reference to Earth involving "Essafa" (this is the anglicized spelling). There is very important group tied to this region. Mic Turner is one of the most likely candidates to have been part of The Dark Wheel. It is precisely why his background is intentionally buried in plain view.
His background mentions he is a founder of the Alliance tough, as an alternative to Fed and Empire. It could be just lore among many other stories. Why him, why Jones Colony?
You mention just 4 systems. You probably have gone there yourself, why don't you share your findings, if any?
