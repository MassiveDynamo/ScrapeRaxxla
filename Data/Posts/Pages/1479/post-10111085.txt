If only @David Braben or @Michael Brookes or @drew P could take our minds off some questions about the raxxla codex... but I know that's impossible....

Well I would ask them who composed the codex the following:
1- "children's story "Princess Astrophel and the spiralling stars" " is this referring to the story of Philip Sidney, Astrophil and Stella ?

2-Could it not be "Astrophil and Stella" where could I look for the title Princess Astrophel and the spiralling stars, as we have not found any reference to a children's story or book with the exact name mentioned?

2-Would there be any clues within the game itself, other than the information in the codex regarding raxxla?

3-Some clues could be given about raxxla, ? since the lack of clues and concrete information about raxxla in the codex ... soon it will be 10 years of the game and all we have is theories that lead nowhere ... even the best of the theories can not sustain themselves for not being able to support themselves for lack of clues ...

4- By what means inside and outside the game can we search for clues?

5- Is Elite's current and future lore planned to give us clues or lead us to raxxla or the Dark Whell ?

6-Would it be possible for the codex to be updated with new texts and clues regarding Raxxla and TDW?

7-Could someone be in a system that contains hints or Raxxla itself, what means could be used to identify themselves? SEI, Scanner D, approaching the planet or body to be identified only visually ?
