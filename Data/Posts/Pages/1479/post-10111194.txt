Delphi was a major hint literally
So my thoughts about Delphi (I am very interested in the place on earth cause of the know thyself and you'll know God and the universe quote written at the oracle) is that if the guardians knew about Raxxla, then the Thargoids now too.

I found an entry for a system which has been named Essfafa in FE2. I guess that's what you meant.
