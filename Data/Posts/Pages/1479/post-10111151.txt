5- Is Elite's current and future lore planned to give us clues or lead us to raxxla or the Dark Whell ?

6-Would it be possible for the codex to be updated with new texts and clues regarding Raxxla and TDW?

7-Could someone be in a system that contains hints or Raxxla itself, what means could be used to identify themselves? SEI, Scanner D, approaching the planet or body to be identified only visually ?
You have more than you realize. The feeling that you need more is mere illusion. Why do you CMDRs think you need more? Is not the galaxy your kingdom? Delphi was a major hint literally, figuratively, and allegorically. So, again I ask - what precisely are you missing? Also, there were Delphic Maxims. They are all important, the first especially so. I speak in riddles because only you can remove the veils (see Salom√©'s Seven Veils).
