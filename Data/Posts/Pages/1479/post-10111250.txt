It's true that the only thing we have from the story, is the title. If we want to explore the option that the author hid the facts in the title, there are plenty of options besides anagrams.

Looks visually similar to RAXX, anagrams into ASPS and SAPS, can be numerically converted to 16 1 19 19 (HIP/HR/HD number, coordinates, RA / DEC?)

There are almost endless possibilities with just those four letters.

The other possibility is that it’s enciphered text, since Fd are fond of cyphers & codes. I’m no mathematician nor code breaker....do we have any still lurking?? Anyone explored that angle?

It could also conceivably refer to an as yet unknown text on a Tourist Beacon that we haven’t found yet, or perhaps on an unknown (TDW!) station notice board....??
