Yes I understand that. I am asking if EssFafa is the same as Essafa. Cause there is a system named EssFafa in Frontier Elite 2.

Edit: Found this text where is clearly written Essfafa, not Essafa
Also, I initially didn't see the journal you found. Yes, apparently it Essafa and Essfafa are one and the same. Though, obviously time erased the original though Jones Colony still persists.
