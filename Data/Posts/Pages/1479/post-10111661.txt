That's why I saved further questions about Jones Colony.

But on my researches in the web I found that there are a lot of Delphi stations.
Does someone knows what the stations are good for?
How many are there in total?

If it is an absurdly high number it’s likely part of a seed from a naming catalog. However if it’s finite then it would not hurt to map them.

Mapping the names may identify something, either it’s arbitrary but distributed evenly; tightly packed into a box or sphere; do they align along a particular XYZ etc or have some spatial relationship to another sector of space?

Such spatial shapes may identify if it’s automated or intentional.

If it’s intentional, such an action might identify a pattern or practice, a hotspot or void!

But it’s a lot of work, well not really,100 or so systems could be plotted in a day - if your so inclined.

My suspicions are on a naming catalog seed.
