Yes I understand that. I am asking if EssFafa is the same as Essafa. Cause there is a system named EssFafa in Frontier Elite 2.
It might be, but focus on Elite Dangerous.

Again, the point here is to learn for yourself. Focus instead what is the very specific reference to Earth involving "Essafa" (this is the anglicized spelling). There is very important group tied to this region. Mic Turner is one of the most likely candidates to have been part of The Dark Wheel. It is precisely why his background is intentionally buried in plain view.
