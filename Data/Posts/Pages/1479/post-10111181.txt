You have more than you realize. The feeling that you need more is mere illusion. Why do you CMDRs think you need more? Is not the galaxy your kingdom? Delphi was a major hint literally, figuratively, and allegorically. So, again I ask - what precisely are you missing? Also, there were Delphic Maxims. They are all important the first especially so. I speak in riddles because only you can remove the veils (see Salom√©'s Seven Veils).
So... Another layer of riddles ?
