So my thoughts about Delphi (I am very interested in the place on earth cause of the know thyself and you'll know God and the universe quote written at the oracle) is that if the guardians knew about Raxxla, then the Thargoids now too.

I found an entry for a system which has been named Essfafa in FE2. I guess that's what you meant.
Somehow I have a feeling that is merely a similar spelling besides we are talking in Elite Dangerous. This can be found in-game. As stated previously, there are four Jones Colony in four systems. So, which is the correct one? Previously, I mentioned not only is Essafa the older name for the system but also a reference to a very specific place on Earth.



From the "Mic Turner History" beacon:
Born in 3205, Mic Turner grew up in Jones Colony in the Essafa system. After graduating with honours from the civilian Pilots school, he moved to New California in Alioth, just before the rebellion started.

In 3228, when the Federal corporations supplying New California attempted to raise their prices again, the citizens revolted, taking over the ships berthed in the space station and riding out to the gas mining station to assault the corporate workers. Federal and Imperial forces arrived within days, but fighters from Alioth and several neighbouring independent systems joined forces to repel them.

Turner's pilot skills saw him amongst the first to fly out to the orbital platforms and he won a great deal of respect from his peers for his efforts. It was here he met Meredith Argent, a scientist who led one of the Caker cells on the gas platforms and was direct descendant of Walter Argent, a wealthy industrial from Ayethi in the the 27th century. Argent and Turner were to become partners for life.
