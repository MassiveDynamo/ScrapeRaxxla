Simulacrae is just funning. He likes to make maps etc around in-game topics. He caught me out when I first started playing; wasted several hours as I remember trying to decipher an Unknown Artefact illustration. Just enjoy his art!
They are just first letters... Diagonals. I saw MBs drabble and missed the old drabbles thread.. so i made an attempt at my own. Figured a lovecraftian/ raxxla themed one was in order.
