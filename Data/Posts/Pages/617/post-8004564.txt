actually i spent a long time searching nuentes, it is in a region of original systems that still have the elite 84 descriptions, and close to shinatra dezra. seeing as there have been rumours that the dark wheel was a fake faction, i noticed that nuentes description said something about ‘ this system harbours a dark secret’ then i saw that there was an outpost called ‘ harbouring’ sandwiched between 2 landable planets, so off i went have a search, nothing special found but the outpost has some containers inscribed, so maybe refers to some mycoid type stuff, or not you never know. but as raxxla was there before horizons i assume the link will be in space not on a planet surface
