I'm not actively looking for Raxxla in game anymore because I'm not convinced it's in the game or at the least it's not yet accessible and the fact that this thread alone has been going for 4 years and we're no closer to finding it but i still poke my head in here every now and then just to see how its going. I do admire the dedication, effort, time and belief of those that are certain it's out there somewhere and I hope the very next post is someone saying I've found it but I'm doubtful
