The four fixed astrological stars in Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius, respectively.
The bull, lion, eagle and a man that show up in mythologies from all over the world.
Including in the bible, the tetramorphs guarding Sumerian city gates and the sphinx.
The four Royal stars are supposed to have their origin in ancient Persian Astronomy. As most things in religion and astrology, the sources for this are dubious from a historical perspective.
The Archangels were probably attached as an aspect, at a later time.

Fun fact: Archangel was a rank above Elite in some versions of the original game.
