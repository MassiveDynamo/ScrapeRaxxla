They are just first letters... Diagonals. I saw MBs drabble and missed the old drabbles thread.. so i made an attempt at my own. Figured a lovecraftian/ raxxla themed one was in order.

There was a Drabbles thread? Bet there was one for Tribbles too?
Oh, so much meta-lore that I’ve missed out on over the years!
Or was that metal-ore??

Yes, my mind is free-wheeling. There’s only so much lawn cutting/power raking/hand raking/ scarification/hand-raking that a man can take. I was doing it all yesterday afternoon, and today.
Still got to finish scarifying/hand raking/recut before I can top-dress, level, over-seed and collapse in a heap with a beer or three. Now off to collect grandkids from school/nursery and babysit......

Aaaaggghh!!!

Edit: and got to go buy some sand for the top-dressing before I can do that...
Wonder how much artificial grass costs.......
