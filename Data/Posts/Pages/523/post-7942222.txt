The "Thargoid" name was actually given later, it was after people had seen the footage of the ship with "THARG" on it. I was just making the point that it seems weird that anything close to a human language would be on their ship. I'm just working on crazy theories.
So... Nobody has had the chance to sniff a Thargoid? Guess I'll be the one to do it. For science.

Ancient astronaut theory. Our language came from theirs. Particularly Irish haha
