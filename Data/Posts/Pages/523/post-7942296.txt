They remind me of the alien language from the movie Arrival. Like a lot. Almost exact.
It is definitely close. Also, wasn't that language the key to the protagonist developing a better understanding of time/the fourth dimension?

I keep thinking that time and time travel are somehow relevant to the background story of Elite. Not that players can time travel, just that it may have happened before. For all we know, the lore of Elite could have taken a lot more from Robert Holdstock. Maybe he gave them permission to use the stories as part of the lore? Raxxla and The Dark Wheel both existed, at least as names (in the same works,) years before Elite.
