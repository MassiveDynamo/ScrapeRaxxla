Or the Stargate Theory.. The intersection of three lines that join 6 points in space two by two. What could be these six points ? Systems at N-S-E-W-Up-Down ? Systems of interest/locked ? Should we plot that ?
The problem with the coordinate system used in Stargate is the fact that two non-parallel straight lines do not need to intersect. Not speaking of three intersecting in one point...
Now it is certainly possible but then again Stargate uses constellations as "points" - yeah I never understood how to do that regardless of the fact that constellations are projections of three dimensional objects onto a sphere and hence change their geometry for any moving observer.

But let's have some fun. Raxxla is the gate that also is the key, right? So why not a stargate like system of portals?
Assume that Raxxla actually is a series of gates that might create wormholes throughout the galaxy to another gate of the system. (just as in star gate).
The raxxla logo shows six of those arrows they use to save the coordinates. In stargate they used 7, but then again you can argue that you don't need to tell the gate the point of origin (as the gate inherently knows where it is).
Again if the inner circle of 18 dashes in the raxxla logo is a selection of constellations that would open a possible 18**6 = 34 million locations for our gate system.
At 400 billion systems in the game that's 11800 systems per gate. EDSM knows of 42 million systems. So statistically we should have run across 3500 of those gates.

So either raxxla is not a stargate like system or we are extremely unlucky exploring.

Do whatever you want with that calculation.
