Mmmh... yeah.. Simplest explainations are usually the best.
Then that Omphalos/Navel of the World must be THE ingame clue !
We even know how to find it ! Just let's do like Zeus did !
Two Eagles around the outer rim at same speed, where they meet sits The Omphalos !
FS Commanders !

Zeus also stole the prettiest boy on earth from their parents... so the little boy could pour Epstein and him wine. https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ganymede-Greek-mythology

I think it was the same eagles that took the boy.
