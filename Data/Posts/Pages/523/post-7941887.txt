Given that in the BGS, expansion is by cube space, it necessarily follows that all coordinates shall be 3 dimensional. A Lattice Framework Cypher was identified as the type of Cypher used in a lot of in-game codes. It's certainly true of the Guardian ruins. This could be decoded using Base 8 into Base 10 into ASCII Text I recall. It's also interesting to note that all three original Thargoid invasion routes in the Lore are now in the game. One is located due north of Alliance space, one out of the Witch Head / Col 70 route, plus the first main one that hit all the way to Merope. When we explored all the affected regions two years ago, many systems were still locked. Since then a lot of new material has been added and many systems are now unlocked. I fear that the whole lot will need revisiting again.
