I completely forgot about those! Reminds me of a time I found a surface site with some kind of terminal inside, it looked like it said "Single Thargs in your area!" and it had a video with a bunch of ships smashing into each other. The whole thing left me pretty confused.

Could be a clue to Raxxla?
They remind me of the alien language from the movie Arrival. Like a lot. Almost exact.
