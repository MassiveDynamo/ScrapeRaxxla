From wikipedia:
Robert Paul Holdstock (2 August 1948 â€“ 29 November 2009) was an English novelist and author best known for his works of Celtic, Nordic, Gothic and Pictish fantasy literature, predominantly in the fantasy subgenre of mythic fiction.

From wikitionary:
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thar
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/goid

If you use Irish, it means stealer from beyond.

Edit: Also there is a reason why Ammonia worlds are linked with Thargoids.

The "Thargoid" name was actually given later, it was after people had seen the footage of the ship with "THARG" on it. I was just making the point that it seems weird that anything close to a human language would be on their ship. I'm just working on crazy theories.
So... Nobody has had the chance to sniff a Thargoid? Guess I'll be the one to do it. For science.
