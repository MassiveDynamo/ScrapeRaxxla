Wanted to point out, on the neck of the image on the right, the green line with the marks coming off it in intervals, is the correct angle for, and the marks are the same as the dashes in, the raxxla image. I'm feeling like this has more involvement than we give it credit for as a whole

Ah, but the middle picture on the right is obviously a triple head electric shaver with green blades.
Clearly only clean-shaven explorers with green hair stand a chance of finding Raxxla!
