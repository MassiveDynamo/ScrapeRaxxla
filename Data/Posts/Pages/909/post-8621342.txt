Heads up, Commanders!
I have found out that the Planet name ''Suontaka'' is mentioned in the book: ''Elite: Tales From The Frontier''

Very interesting quote.
It also confirms that the system is not kickstarter/charity reward.
I am currently re-investigating this system and have recruited some folks from Elite Week discord.
The namw "Suontaka" is a very Finnish sounding name, and has a meaning in Finnish.
I suspect Marko or Ulla Susimets√§, who both contributed to the E: D short story compilation.
