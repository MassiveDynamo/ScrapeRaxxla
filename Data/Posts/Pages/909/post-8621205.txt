SPOILER: CD-58 16 NEWS






















Heads up, Commanders!
I have found out that the Planet name ''Suontaka'' is mentioned in the book: ''Elite: Tales From The Frontier''
It said Admiral Duval had caught a member of the terrorist organisation that had targeted the Imperial family. The man was currently held in an abandoned detention facility on Suontaka, in CD-58 16. As soon as they received reinforcements, the prisoner was to be transferred to Capitol for interrogation and trial.

Annora slipped from the chair and headed to her room to pick up her few belongings. Her legs itched with the need to run. The man with the dataslate looked up and stared after her. She didn't care. In the photo, Erik's jaw was bruised and there was a fresh cut over his left eye.

She had to get out of here, now, had to go to Suontaka, to reach Erik before they took him to Capitol. Once there, he'd be like a fly inside an iron fist.
Very interesting quote.
It also confirms that the system is not kickstarter/charity reward.
I am currently re-investigating this system and have recruited some folks from Elite Week discord.
