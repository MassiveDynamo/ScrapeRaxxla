Looks like pretty fit to orbit. Each mark has wrong orbits. It's like 250 000 years ago some star just disappeared and things continued to fly until got by other stars.
+/- a method to investigate nebulas: find any system with orbits, then find another 1, that will be radius of "orbit" to check.

For now need to find any true rogue to be sure it is in game.
