That's getting interesting ...in +/- same cone found 2 more stars each has "inclanated" planet. All 3 has hellium, water, and Earth-like size/gravity.
So explosion could push out all planets and near-by stars got it. Question is if any planet still travels alone ...

Upd: found triple star there, A-B stars are close and have A/B separated systems with inclanated planets present + C star itself inclanated + C star has complete mess in own system..

Seems like explosition kicked whole star too.
