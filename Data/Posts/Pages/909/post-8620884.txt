So, it is 20-26ly to each star.
Counting like Earth 30km/s orbital speed, this is 10000 times slower then light. So there they could get during 250 000 years.
...weird, does not look as fit. I thought such nebulas exist like 10000 years.

...need to think should we search true rogue this same area or somewhere more away.
Got 90 degree on orbit, same around "plane", same 20ly star again...so this means, once radius detected, you can fly in circle and check remnants.
