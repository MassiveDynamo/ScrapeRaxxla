No, I would have believed it if MB had confirmed. Since he didn’t it remains as hearsay evidence & 1, 2 or 3 doesn’t really make it any difference. How many were in the room at the time? Perhaps 30 all supporting it....

As we’ve pointed out, whether true or false it doesn’t give any indication of the location, or nature of Raxxla to any practicable extent. Except perhaps it would lend some weight to the possibility that it‘s nature is more likely to be astronomical than artificial, or else it’s so far from the jump-in point that the original finder didn’t see it. I was just interested in nailing this rumour down as I don’t like loose ends.

I guess for the same reason that if one person say you own a goat, I may not necessarily believe it. If that is seconded by someone else who said you own a goat, I'll put more credence to it. Anyway rumors start when people start saying without evidence 2 out of 3 recant rather than just 1 out of 3 recant.
