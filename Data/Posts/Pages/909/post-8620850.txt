This is definitely explosion result. All stars in small cone have inclinated planets:



I put a bet if we will find rogue planet that will be somewhere near nebula.
P.S. that planet has metal-rich circle, which is not common for M main star. And exploded B/A pair which is common to have metal-rich.

For me it's been so common I stopped investigating these. Too many instances of such lone orbits.
