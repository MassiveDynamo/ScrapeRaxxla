Sorry to say, I found plenty of these orbits 'everywhere', aka nowhere near any nebula or exploding stars.
For me it's been so common I stopped investigating these. Too many instances of such lone orbits.
Concentration what we check. I see near this one a cone. Nothing in 180 direction, i thought maybe 2 cones.
This means ...some 1 planet may still fly alone. Because concentration is big here.

Nothing on my current pos, but a bit right and each star has there:
