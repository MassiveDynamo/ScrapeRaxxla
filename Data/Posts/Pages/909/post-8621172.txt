I guess for the same reason that if one person say you own a goat, I may not necessarily believe it. If that is seconded by someone else who said you own a goat, I'll put more credence to it. Anyway rumors start when people start saying without evidence 2 out of 3 recant rather than just 1 out of 3 recant.

I may smell like a goat, especially after constructing the grandkids activity centre, but I don’t own one. I assume the misunderstanding comes from my use of the word “ kids” to mean my grandchildren whereas it is of course the name for young goats.

You are quite right. This is how rumours start, or at least propagate. I misremembered one recantation as two. But since it only concerned hearsay evidence regarding a rumour that, even if true, does not give us any really meaningful information, I did not think it was worth the effort to go chasing forum posts to check; my bad and I am duly admonished!
