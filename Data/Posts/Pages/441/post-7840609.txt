My two cents about Romero.
If FD want us to have a chance to find him, then more clues are coming.
If no clues are coming... Forget about it. There isn't even an NPC called Gan Romero flying through the MW.
They just love to keep us hyped and swarming like blind flies across their Stellar Forge. (Most of the time for nothing at all.)
Imho.
Btw... He is not supposed to be flying his own ship, is he ? So is there point in being looking for a "Cmdr" Gan Romero DBX ?
Mmmh ? Oh..yes. Ofc. We always can bet on another FD's usual inconsistency.

So I figured out what I hit, but has anyone ever seen the weird disappearing asteroid thing before?
I haven't but I heard they are called "obfuscated".
