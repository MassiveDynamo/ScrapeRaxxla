I used to be CoR. Then I realized that they were more concerned about Salom√©... I left as the pull of Raxxla was stronger than the pull of Tionisla.
I spent a brief time in CoR as well but eventually recused myself when I started the Earth Expeditionary Fleet as the exploration wing of the Earth Defense Fleet. EEF never really caught on ... though we do still have that eyesore of a system out in Colonia thanks to Frontier reneging on the system name of our choice after initially giving it a "yes".

CoR was (is?) a great group of people interested in the lore of Elite.
