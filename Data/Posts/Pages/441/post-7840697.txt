These 6 black hole animations look identical to me. But if we find one black hole called the Omphalos Rift, things will get interesting.

Very interesting, nice

Still makes me wonder why that Spectrum was created and is displayed, seems it'd be pointless to create just for the FSS Screen of a Black Hole (which is entirely redundant otherwise, since there's no need to ever FSS any Star).

Something inside me regrets being still 20k LY out, otherwise I'd probably make a rare trip to fetch a few "weird" Cargo Canisters - or maybe a Guardian Key and see if that Spectrum suddenly does something else. Maia Black Hole maybe, dunno.
A potential Door.... A potential Key in Cargo Bay (I remember a Thargoid "key" in form of a UA opened up the doors to its inside "Galaxy Hologram Simulator").
Hell why not?

Sadly, nothing but blank theory-crafting... if the Animation turns out to be static/fluff FX, it'd be just another dud
