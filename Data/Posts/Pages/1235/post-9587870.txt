Been doing some missions in Van Maanenâ€™s Star of late. Is there a lore (or any other) reason why The Guardians of The Free Spirit faction are nowhere in-game. They are mentioned in the system description as owning the system, but seem to have been overtaken by the Sublime Order of Van Maanens. Odd!!
