Example of what it cant detect?
The megaship in an asteroid belt in the recent Hesperus storyline. You had to drop into the belt to discover it. Though other things can be detected in asteroid belts-e.g. several stations orbit within belts.

So it seems to me that objects in-game have either a detectable/undetectable flag, or a value within which they are detectable but not otherwise. The latter has been seen before in-game, things only becoming visible within so many light seconds. FD could set that range to zero and it would be undetectable.
