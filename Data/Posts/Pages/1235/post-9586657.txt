Example of what it cant detect?
In addition to the comets that are kind of invisible, it can't detect ships in normal space. Ships needs a beacon to be detectable (is this the case for fleet carriers as well? ).
According to the codex even stations will go undetected, if the emissions are low enough.

For natural objects it seems that 135km is the minimum size for a single object. Smaler objects are only detected if they are part of a cluster or ring.
