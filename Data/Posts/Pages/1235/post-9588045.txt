Thanks to Jorki I started reading up on systems with descriptions.

Two permitted systems have descriptions stating that the inhabitants have a subterranean culture and are strictly guarded. Van Maanens Star and Ross 128.

The reason I mention these is because I think we’re being pointed to something inside a planet via Galnet, possibly in a system where a permit is required for entry.

Another permitted system I believe was alluded to was Phekda.

The Winking Cat Galnet article that states that "High-profile crimes such as this have resulted in the 'winking cat' motif becoming a popular anti-establishment symbol, appearing in advertising, graffiti and music. Ironically, the calling card of an art thief is now itself a culturally significant work of art.". By itself this would mean nothing but when reading Phekdas description the Ancients of Mumu is mentioned and if I’m not mistaken they too were a band that was a popular anti-establishment symbol.


The first Winking Cat article describes the very strict security measures to protect the artwork and mentions criminal a lot. This falls inline with Ross 128 in my opinion with its subterranean prisoner cells.

There’s also the Winking Cat article where the painting “Penance Street” is returned. I’m thinking Penance could be alluding to Penitentiary in reference to Ross 128.

One of the Far God cult articles mentions a survivor found underground in a cryopod. A female named Kiona O’Connor. Van Maanen’s Star is an underground society and there is an outpost named O’Connor there as well. As yet there’s no reason for Van Maanen, Ross 128, or Phekda to be permit locked.

Perhaps some of these random system descriptions are being used for more than just flavor text. Or I’ve read too much and are making connections out of nothing.
