It just puzzles me that they seem to have been renamed as “Sublime Order of Van Maanen’s Star” with no reason given. Why not change it in the System description?
I might well be wrong here, but I seem to have a very vague recollection that Guardians of The Free Spirit did originally control the system, but very early BGS shenanigans got them ousted completely, bringing Sublime Order of Van Maanen’s Star to power there.
