Captain Jupiters adventure in the van Maanen's Star: http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/frontie...on-the-frontier/on-the-wrong-side-of-the-law/

This is an official short story that came with FE2, written by David Massey.

All the shorts are here: http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/frontier/books/stories-of-life-on-the-frontier/
Thanks! I’ll read those later!
So, is it possible that “Guardians of The Free Spirit” in the Van Maanen’s system description is a hangover from FFE, but were renamed by FD, possibly because there was a heretical sect in Christianity with a similar name, or was the faction itself taken over by Sublime Order?

It just puzzles me that they seem to have been renamed as “Sublime Order of Van Maanen’s Star” with no reason given. Why not change it in the System description?

The only reference I found in ED lore is that a character in one of the stories in Tales from the Frontier claims that as his religion.
