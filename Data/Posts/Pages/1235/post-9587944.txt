I'd also like to add that there are still undiscovered planet types (but ofcourse the question is if they are actualy in game). These are "RoguePlanet" "X" and "Exotic" (however that last one disappeared from EDSM). These can be found when searching for suns on EDSM but give no examples. EDSM uses in game files for that data.
