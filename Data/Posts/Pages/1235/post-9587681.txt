Been doing some missions in Van Maanen’s Star of late. Is there a lore (or any other) reason why The Guardians of The Free Spirit faction are nowhere in-game. They are mentioned in the system description as owning the system, but seem to have been overtaken by the Sublime Order of Van Maanens. Odd!!

From what I can see after keyword searching all of Galnet, The Elite Timeline, and the wiki, the only mention of The Guardians of The Free Spirit is in the system description. Unless they’re a call back from lore in an older Elite game. I also find their mention as odd, coupled with the description that “They believe in maximum hardship and live underground on several of the inner planets of the system. It is forbidden by Federal Law to enter the system without the permission of the Guardians.”
