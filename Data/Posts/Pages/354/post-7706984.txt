Hello, time for my first Raxxla post.

Haven’t seen anyone talk about the COLOR of the Raxxla image in the codex. I think it’s worth considering that because of the similarities in color, night vision may be involved in a step to finding it.

ALSO, I see everyone talking about looking for a gas giant with 8 moons. Technically, can’t a star be considered a gas giant? And again, any one body that orbits a less massive object could technically be referred to as a moon. This idea of gas giant and moon is a bit of a stretch but good to consider I think.
