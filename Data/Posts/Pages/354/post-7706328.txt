Just in case anyone is getting a little tired of the negativity that is allowed on the forums, there is a discord created for all Raxxla hunters. It is the Independent Raxxla Hunters discord and is moderated enough to cut down on people who are rude and damaging to the community. To give you an idea of the kind of community and openness that we have a user provided to everyone, without restriction a Library that provides searchable access to galnet, beacons and other resources.

If you come come knowing:

There is no membership or hierarchy
There are no leaders
Join, be nice, have fun

I commend the effort, but maintain what I've always said about having a discord - not everyone uses it, and it splits the conversation and information over different locations, which I don't think helps.

(I'm not having a go at you for creating it, I hasten to add!)

For that reason, I'll personally stick to this thread (and being vaguely amused by the idea that doing so implies I'm not independent! ).
