I commend the effort, but maintain what I've always said about having a discord - not everyone uses it, and it splits the conversation and information over different locations, which I don't think helps.

(I'm not having a go at you for creating it, I hasten to add!)

For that reason, I'll personally stick to this thread (and being vaguely amused by the idea that doing so implies I'm not independent! ).

No offense taken, it another option for those who will use it. Though personally, I would join just for access to the automated library system.
