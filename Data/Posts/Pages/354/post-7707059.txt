Hello, time for my first Raxxla post.

Haven’t seen anyone talk about the COLOR of the Raxxla image in the codex. I think it’s worth considering that because of the similarities in color, night vision may be involved in a step to finding it.

ALSO, I see everyone talking about looking for a gas giant with 8 moons. Technically, can’t a star be considered a gas giant? And again, any one body that orbits a less massive object could technically be referred to as a moon. This idea of gas giant and moon is a bit of a stretch but good to consider I think.

From my understanding is a Gas Giant is a failed attempt of becoming a star. It is possible that the so called star on the codex is actually a Gas Giant in transition to forming either between being a star itself or a in transition to becoming a Gas Giant due to the failure of becoming a star itself.

This explains the idea why the orbit of the station is always in the dark side of the 8th moon due to the possibility of it being dangerous during it's transition. Which also explains the use of lower power outputs it's using critical systems like life support. The possibility to this is if the Gas Giant does succeed to becoming a star the moon Blocks most of the EMP blast from the succeeding Star formation. This helps from ruining any other systems that are not online and be able to access back up systems if other systems do go down.

Making it less of a pain to fix primary systems on the station.
