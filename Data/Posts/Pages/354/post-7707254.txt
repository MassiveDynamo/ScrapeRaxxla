The question: why in the Shinrarta Dezhra system the second star has a code number, and not a name? The dark wheel base is on the eighth satellite of the gas giant (their base is always on the dark side of the satellite...maybe). Access to the system only for the Elite (sending to the first Elite book; You will never see them without a rank, although relatively recently they have had expansion into the neighboring system, Inara check). If the player is new, then for him it will be a discovery - he will find the Dark Wheel for the first time (as in the legends).The system is located in the center of the habitable bubble, and is under the " our nose". Something unusual was not found in this system, maybe I was looking badly ( at that moment I heard a rumor about the system HIP13044, in some sense, I was shown the mystical system when I was at the base of the Dark Wheel, it came out mystically).
