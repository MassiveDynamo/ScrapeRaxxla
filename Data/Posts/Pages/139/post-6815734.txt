Is it possible to make a long line of ships. refuel them. and use them as a chain of refuellers to get a single ship to go a very long distance? Or even infinitely far?

You would need a chain of ships. One jumps and maybe holds alot of fuel. IT goes as far as it can. The next ship flys as far as possible and another comes along and fuels them using them and jump points or refuel point.

To achieve what? Supercruise to another system? Unfortunately, that's not possible. Witch space is in fact the "loading screen" for the next system. No loading, no system, even if you should long be there after all that supercruising.

There used to be a thread detailing all the permit locked systems and how to access the accessible ones.
You can probably still find it via Google

I know, I have it here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=122593

But no explanation for those systems.
