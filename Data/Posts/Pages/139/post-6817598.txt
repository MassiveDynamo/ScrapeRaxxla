Even if Raxxla is 100Ls from the main star, if it doesn't show up on honk then it isn't going to be found - which would be the EXACT opposite of 'obvious'.

I'm still leaning towards 'random' system with a unique planet image on the SysMap.

I was more comparing it to the POI's that Show up when Close by 1000 ls.
