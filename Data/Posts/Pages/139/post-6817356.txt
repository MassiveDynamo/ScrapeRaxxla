I think the ‘every commander for them self’ and ‘we know how to get there’ comments might point towards a Voyager type challenge.
Some form of ‘in system’ navigation challenge.
The commet mechanics have been in game since launch and could be used for something like that.

Well with all those who have wandered around in sol looking for the ancient probes we can be sure it isn't there. We would have stumbled upon.

But if that's how to find Raxxla, we'll definitely Need it a tiny bit obvious. "We Need to make it at least a tiny bit obvious" - to me this Phrase tells that it hasn't yet been made even a tiny bit obvious. If Raxxla is as far from its main star as Hutton is but doesn't Show up on honk, then don't expect anyone finding it anytime soon.
