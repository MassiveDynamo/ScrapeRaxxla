Okay so I Tweeted David for a more official confirmation on whether it truly is "In range" or "within reach" of an "unmodified" or "stock" Cobra MK3. etc. I've heard different variations and the meanings can change things. For instance, if it's "in range" that can be referring to the Jameson crash site. Because that is the only MKIII that I know something could be in range of. Of course there could be the more obvious referring of the jump range, but just trying to cover all meanings. See what I mean? A slight differing of the way something is said and the whole meaning is fudged up. Granted there was a meaning in the first place.
