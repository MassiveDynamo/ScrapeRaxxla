What is known about Bellica, LHS 2894, Ross 354 and Wolf 262? Those are permit locked systems that are much closer to Sol. Is there any lore around them?

There are also many Fed locked systems we don't know how to unlock yet (though I don't think Feds are hiding Raxxla). Have efforts been made to find a way to unlock them?

There used to be a thread detailing all the permit locked systems and how to access the accessible ones.
You can probably still find it via Google
