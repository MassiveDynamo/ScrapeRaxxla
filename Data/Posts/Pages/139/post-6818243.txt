Didn't notice this before. Also didn'thave this pic. But there is a space in between his beard hair locations and it looks just like the shape of the eye in the original Raxxla painting.... (AKA his mouth area.)



That is actually quit interesting. It's so well shaped in this picture. Which is in front of a half planet making the same half eye shape.... oO

His head is exactly where the wheel in the return of the children of raxxla picture put it...(and only in this picture. Not the general video.) 8\ Are we sure they are not messing with us in subtle ways?! (An image which is so far very hard to get to show up in a forum.)

How far do they go to hide hints potentially? (If he ever shows up in a video with an odd piece of corn mysteriously placed in his beard I will crack up. ><) I'm assuming he works for frontier.
