Well with all those who have wandered around in sol looking for the ancient probes we can be sure it isn't there. We would have stumbled upon.

But if that's how to find Raxxla, we'll definitely Need it a tiny bit obvious. "We Need to make it at least a tiny bit obvious" - to me this Phrase tells that it hasn't yet been made even a tiny bit obvious. If Raxxla is as far from its main star as Hutton is but doesn't Show up on honk, then don't expect anyone finding it anytime soon.

Even if Raxxla is 100Ls from the main star, if it doesn't show up on honk then it isn't going to be found - which would be the EXACT opposite of 'obvious'.

I'm still leaning towards 'random' system with a unique planet image on the SysMap.
