Which book is that from Scytale? Is it "The Dark Wheel", or "And Here the Wheel" maybe? I don't remeber the character names (either goldfish memory or haven't read).

Scares me to think though the The Club is actually the FDev design executive and they are indeed just making fools of us for their own (in-game) gain!

They definitely must have good laughs at us ...

Why are you and others dead set that is the case? I thought nobody knew where it was or what it was connected too.

I spent months, time ago, exploring the Rift in the believe that its mYsTeRy which caused so many ships lost was indeed Raxxla and its people.
I was very disappointed when it turned out to be that pathetic human stranded megaship...
But you are right on one point...who says Raxxla cannot be in the Rift region ? Even if it has nothing to do with the solved FR mystery. Because, if it is sure R isn't in the FR then, we no longer have the entire MW to search... Just the MW minus the FR.[haha]
