I pretty much like this fan fiction... Aims to the point imho.

Which book is that from Scytale? Is it "The Dark Wheel", or "And Here the Wheel" maybe? I don't remeber the character names (either goldfish memory or haven't read).

Scares me to think though the The Club is actually the FDev design executive and they are indeed just making fools of us for their own (in-game) gain!
