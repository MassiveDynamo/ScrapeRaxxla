If I was going to take anything literally from that comment, it would be that the criteria for finding Raxxla are different for every Cmdr - "for themselves"

Or, alternatively, it's just a parental way of saying "I'm not going to tell you".

I think the ‘every commander for them self’ and ‘we know how to get there’ comments might point towards a Voyager type challenge.
Some form of ‘in system’ navigation challenge.
The commet mechanics have been in game since launch and could be used for something like that.
