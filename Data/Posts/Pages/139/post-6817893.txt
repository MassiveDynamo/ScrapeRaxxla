But I also keep finding threads that state a commander has been through the system Raxxla is in, but never detail scanned any of the bodies. Just simply passed through. I would love to see an official source to that comment, though, because that would be a pretty substantial hint.

That's the thing, there is NO official source. It's just a zombie fact.
