Well with all those who have wandered around in sol looking for the ancient probes we can be sure it isn't there. We would have stumbled upon.

But if that's how to find Raxxla, we'll definitely Need it a tiny bit obvious. "We Need to make it at least a tiny bit obvious" - to me this Phrase tells that it hasn't yet been made even a tiny bit obvious. If Raxxla is as far from its main star as Hutton is but doesn't Show up on honk, then don't expect anyone finding it anytime soon.

Raxxla is a travelling planet, so it can be buried in an asteroid belt/ cluster, or off the ecliptic line of a given system...in the black. But I also keep finding threads that state a commander has been through the system Raxxla is in, but never detail scanned any of the bodies. Just simply passed through. I would love to see an official source to that comment, though, because that would be a pretty substantial hint. It would mean there's a high chance that it's not in an non-unlockable permit zone, like Polaris, or in any previously explored system. Including system's like Sol...and that it's probably sitting in a Col, or Alarai system or something like that. None of these supposed hints, though, can I find an official quoting of. Which is kind of disappointing of Fdev. they couldn't just put an official hint on an easy to track source, like Twitter? They have to say these things in some live stream that nobody can see afterward and rely on thousands of people to pass the knowledge on and throw out of context? You have to actually be there to read/ hear these hints to deciper them. But when you got one person saying, "it's within reach of a Cobra MKIII" or "It's in range of a unmodified Cobra MKIII" or "It's reachable by a stock Cobra MKIII" it really screws up the hint. And I have heard all those variations of having been a hint by David Braben, but surprise! no source of where this hint came from.
