So, who's going to continue to Quest in Live, and who in Legacy?

I did ask fo confirmation that it had been recently accessibility tested for both, but don't honestly expect an answer
Elite Dangerous Legacy (3.8) Is Now Available | IMPORTANT RELEASE INFORMATION
Sunya, so sorry for the delay. Are you still having issues? Nah, most of my friends likewise had to wait 10+ minutes for it to begin tracking the install progress. On console and on Steam it all went fine for everyone I know, just the frontier launcher experiencing this delay.

Trouble is, a lot of changes have been made to the game since the Gamma...a lot errors have been corrected, but a lot of errors have crept in!!

Live, new shiny stuff will only be there. Legacy looks dead (or deader). Also having both Live and Legacy for all my accounts will be a bit much.

Would be a drag if Raxxla has moved to Live only and then player continuing in Legacy to no avail...or vice versa for that matter.

Some kind of confirmation from FD would be nice.
