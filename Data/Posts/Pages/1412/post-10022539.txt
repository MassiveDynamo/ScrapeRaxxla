Live, new shiny stuff will only be there. Legacy looks dead (or deader). Also having both Live and Legacy for all my accounts will be a bit much.

Would be a drag if Raxxla has moved to Live only and then player continuing in Legacy to no avail...or vice versa for that matter.

Some kind of confirmation from FD would be nice.
Indeed! After 7 years personal journeying with 4 years Questing I’m getting a tad cheesed off with the current state of things. I’ve done something like over 600 jumps exploring my current theory, so far without success (apart from a suspicious comms facility that nobody seems interested in checking out) and maybe another 270 to go.... Some small successes are what make a game interesting to play, not grind. I no longer have any interest in Thargoid bashing, which seems to be the sole focus of the current gameplay. I have enjoyed Questing, and sharing thoughts with many people here, but am tired of searching for something when I don't even know what it is; FD said it has been in game from the Gamma, but wont confirm its accessibility has been tested and confirmed....ever, never mind for each game update.

However the only current alternative seems to be SC but that’s so poor I dont enjoy it, & unfortunately Starfield is delayed yet again!

Might have to start talking to the grandkids over Christmas!
Wonder what X4 is like?
