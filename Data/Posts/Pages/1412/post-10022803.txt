I am still looking
I was never interested in killing thargoids, even though I built many ships for it and I did kill some. I didn't like it for many reasons.
I am very interested in them, just not in killing them. unless I have no choice.

I want to see whats in the center and I want to know what its all about.
I just suggested to one thread that maybe trying to steal some of the probes from the orthrus could be helpful in getting past the final wave..
Going to keep at it till I figure it out anyway.

that aside, @Jorki, I wanted to help a bit, but Louis Calvert DID,
I am curious, he has posted several times in here to you, is he blocked for you? you never seem to acknowledge his posts to you anyway....
sorry if its none of my business, but I like both his and your posts...
