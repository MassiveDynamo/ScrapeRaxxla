So, who's going to continue to Quest in Live, and who in Legacy?

I did ask fo confirmation that it had been recently accessibility tested for both, but don't honestly expect an answer
Elite Dangerous Legacy (3.8) Is Now Available | IMPORTANT RELEASE INFORMATION
Sunya, so sorry for the delay. Are you still having issues? Nah, most of my friends likewise had to wait 10+ minutes for it to begin tracking the install progress. On console and on Steam it all went fine for everyone I know, just the frontier launcher experiencing this delay.

Trouble is, a lot of changes have been made to the game since the Gamma...a lot errors have been corrected, but a lot of errors have crept in!!

OK doesn’t look like I can find an appropriate 3.8 segment within Support (sure there will be soon) so instead I put something into the 3.8 post to Sally, likely won’t get any attention.

Know its repetition, but the 3.8 situation identities an excellent potential opportunity for gathering additional data.
