The wiki's summary is pretty accurate: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Guardian-Thargoid_conflict



It's likely the reason Thargoids are aggressively anti-Guardian is because the Guardians successfully defeated (some part) of the Thargoid's civilisation, and Salvation used Guardian tech to try his genocide. (Genocide attempt #2 against the same Thargoids).

The reason Guardians aren't around any more is because the AI they made to fight the Thargoids did a Skynet.



Doesn't change your argument, Thargoids/Guardians could well be wrapped up in Raxxla (probably are), just wanted to fill in those blanks for you

I agree with you, but not completely. I'm more inclined to believe that Raxxla has something to do with the Guardians. In The Dark Wheel, the Thargoids are quietly in circulation.

By the way, why don't we have nuclear weapons against the Thargoids?
