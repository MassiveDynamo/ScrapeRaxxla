Now since WE attacked them, with Guardian Tech they already beat and reverse engineered, what.. a million years ago.... Then they now consider us a more serious threat...
The wiki's summary is pretty accurate: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Guardian-Thargoid_conflict

After the war with the Thargoids began, the Guardians were forced to make a partial retreat. They were reluctant to take up arms against the Thargoids and kept communicating with them ... when this proved ineffective they started to use drones – autonomous machines that felt no fear, fatigue or uncertainty. These war machines became highly sophisticated in a relatively short amount of time, and were soon able to identify and target anything that utilised Thargoid engineering. Even more remarkably, Thargoid bio-mechanical technology was engineered to recognise anything of Guardian origin. That explains why, millions of years after the conflict, Thargoids devices still react aggressively to the presence of Guardian technology.

It appears the Thargoids entered Guardian space unprepared for a protracted military campaign, and after facing a relentless onslaught from the Guardians’ war machines they were forced to retreat. The development of the Guardians’ war machines created a schism in their society, which may have seeded the civil war that occurred later in their history.

It's likely the reason Thargoids are aggressively anti-Guardian is because the Guardians successfully defeated (some part) of the Thargoid's civilisation, and Salvation used Guardian tech to try his genocide. (Genocide attempt #2 against the same Thargoids).

The reason Guardians aren't around any more is because the AI they made to fight the Thargoids did a Skynet.



Doesn't change your argument, Thargoids/Guardians could well be wrapped up in Raxxla (probably are), just wanted to fill in those blanks for you
