I wanted to see if there was anything hidden in the Dark Wheel toast to Raxxla. It's a pretty vague clue, so looking at it from a different angle could help.
I switched my language to German and Spanish (from the launcher, options > language, it will take a while to reload) and went to the codex entry on Raxxla again.

Here's the German toast:
“Auf das Juwel, das an der Stirn der Mutter aller Galaxien strahlt! Auf das Flüstern in der Schäwrze des Alls, die Sirene im tiefsten Nichts! Auf der Eltern Gram, der Geliebten Klage und die Sehnsucht eines jeden Vagabunden. Auf Raxxla!”


Then I translated that with Google Translate (anyone speak German? I'd love to know how accurate this is):


Here's the Spanish toast:


And the Spanish translation:



And, for reference again, the English-language toast:


I know we assumed Zeta Cassopeia was the Jewel That burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies. That's because Cassiopeia is the mother of Andromeda, which is a galaxy. However, if the German changes to "mother of ALL galaxies", then it might point in a different direction... Milky Way? The Big Bang? Spanish becomes "jewel that burns AT THE TOP of the Mother of THE galaxies.". I know someone brought that part up before.

Other changes:

Stuff that stayed the same:

Fernnweh, Raxxla and the names from the story are the only words preserved across the languages.
We still have references to the Omphalos (navel? center? specific rock in greek legend?). and something on the head of a mother who has something to do with at least one (but possibly more) galaxies.

Not sure if it was mentioned but fernweh means far away in german im pretty sure
