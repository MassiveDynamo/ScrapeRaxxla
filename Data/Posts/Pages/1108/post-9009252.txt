Well, letâ€™s face it...
Not many documents published by anyone else!
Which is suspicious in and of itself. ;-)

Oddly, I didn't see any Canonn documents referenced there, but might have missed them, have only had a quick look so far. Also suspicious. But then again I am now naturally suspicious and trust no one. Except penguins maybe.
