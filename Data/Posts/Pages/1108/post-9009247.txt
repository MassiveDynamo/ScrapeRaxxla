Well if you want proper tinfoil, and Ive never mentioned it coz its too much tinfoil, the statement 'There will be no clues' is a future tense statement. It allows for there to be existing clues already there in the present or past. But I dont really hold to that view myself, just keep it in the back of my mind to look for any supporting evidence, of which there has been none so far.
But presumably the Codex info for Raxxla and TDW are clues, hence...

Unless they are false leads of course.
