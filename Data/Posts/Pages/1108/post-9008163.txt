At the year from codex 2296 It was 6 big colonies established only. Last one was Archenar at 2292. And in 2296 Marlia Duval was killed.
So that is like 200 ly radius around Sol if optimistic.
But yet again not everything in the original game or books are in this current game, so possible they moved it well far away so it wouldnt be easy to find given its possibilities when found
