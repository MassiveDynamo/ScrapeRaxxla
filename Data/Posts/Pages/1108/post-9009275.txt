Unless they are false leads of course.

In English they are written as 'stories' or 'myths' mostly. The one piece of evidence is a reference to a diary or journal kept by Art, all that proves is that Art mentioned the same myth or story. theres a few 'debunkers' in there as well, its not a gateway to alternate universes etc that are written as more 'final word' to draw a line under and move on. It kind of ties up the old myths, debunks a few, and tries to set the record straight of what we should now believe (as opposed to any old lore or Oolite lore that may have crept in).

Even the DW toast is 'allegedly' that of the DW, same for the Station but thats written as 'probably true but not found' that it exists somewhere.

Not sure how they translate and even in English its subtle, which allows for all sorts of interpretations, but some of it is definitely 'weighted against' and some is 'weighted towards' which seems to imply we are supposed to disregard some as pure myth or story and believe more in others.

What we dont know is how true any of it is as you say. Could be deliberate disinformation but that seems more and more unlikely as time goes by and it is supposed to be taken at face value.
