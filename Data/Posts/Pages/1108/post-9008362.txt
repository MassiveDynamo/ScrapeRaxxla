So, nothing doing at Thor's Helmet, Orion Dark Region, Barnard's Loop Sector, Messier 78, or Flame Nebula area as far as I can tell. Same sectors are still locked (Horsehead Dark Region, NGC 2264, and Col 70). Tomorrow, or maybe later tonight, will check out Running Man and Orion and eventually California and Witch Head. Took some neat screenshots of BL/Orion et al from different perspectives from "behind", or spinward, which I will compare at some point to the Thargoid logos. At first glance, some look similar, some don't, some have some very interesting differences. I also may have gained an insight into why Thargoid ships look the way they do (the blossoming flower and petals etc etc.) but I will save that theory for after I sort out screenshots and can post an image. One final comment though - if it is Barnard's Loop/Horsehead/Orion etc. being represented in the logos, it is likely as viewed from coreward, because as viewed from spinward, except from a few more distant perspectives, you seem to almost always have the band of the Milky Way and its bright lights cutting across it. Also, you often have the Lesser and Greater Magellanic Clouds in the same view as well. Anyways, that's enough space madness for now.
Sometimes I forget myself and look for real mysteries. That's what happened to me during the unraveling of the Guardian's bases. But after that failure (I couldn't collect all the keys on my own from an alleged bug in the program) I keep trying to hit myself over the head.

I do not understand how you can look for something in the game where there are closed areas, and maybe they are just closed to the right time and do not require any permission.

As for the mark Thargoids I'm afraid to get it on his aircraft carrier or a ship, because I think as soon as I get such a mark then immediately come interceptor and suck me all.
