The center of the Thargoid logo is most likely Barnards loop as seen from Cone nebula or perhaps even the cone nebula itself, possible the outside of the logos corespond to the location view of the cone nebula from where each "faction" "Clan" or most likely Hive of that thargoid calls a somewhat home, possible in certain parts of NGC 2264

That makes sense. In my travels the areas where it seemed to match most closely from spinward were the distant views from the Orion Dark Region, which isn't that far from Cone Nebula, for varying definitions of far. I'm just a couple of years behind the times and wanted to check it out myself (plus somewhere I have an image of the Pleiades from a video that looked very similar also, so still hanging on to the remote chance of that theory).

Did you or anyone else manage to get into NGC 2264 or Cone Nebula before they were locked down to check the views?
