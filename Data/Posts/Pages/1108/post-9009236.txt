I do feel if there are clues in game they will correlate once we find them and they will be obvious. I don’t believe MB statement of there being no clues, because 1 I feel he was alluding to the questions being asked of him at that time or 2 that there was nothing to show at that time because it’s could also be a narrative locked item.
By no clues I'm guessing he mean't they weren't going to put anything on the forums or social media or the like along the lines of "have you listened to it". ;-)

Pretty confident as well that there will be some sort of bread crumb trail in game that we can follow, it is just finding the start of that trail and interpreting it correctly at all stages which is the challenge. That and not knowing whether it is behind some sort of lock based on commander status or affiliation/faction or something else entirely that needs to be met before the start of the bread crumbs are even revealed somehow in game.
