Well, I've become pretty interested in this mystery recently, and emailed FDev asking (maybe) for a Christmas hint, here's the response I got back: https://imgur.com/gallery/X3EpE

Why would FDev state the word 'planet' in the same format as that of [RAXXLA]? I think the non-italicised 't' could just be a mis-selection of the text, but curious why they would not just type 'planet' as normal?

Incidentally, for those who like this sort of thing, [PLANET] and [RAXXLA] have the same number of letters... cypher perhaps?
