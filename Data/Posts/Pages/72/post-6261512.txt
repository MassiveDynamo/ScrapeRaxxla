Cool, thanks for the link, I think what's most interesting is the lack of any offical responses - that sort of makes me feel that it's not a mistake...

But still no answer I guess - I don't think they'd have re-named it, at least not without any sort of reference in-game, it's certainly not Epsilon Indi. Zelada would be possible (though it's in the wrong place from what I can tell), but that's also a system of historical interest and is also mentioned in Lore - so either at some point during the 3100-3200's everyone decided to change the system name for a while and then change it back, or they're two different systems.

While it was just that one ED reference I was willing to put it down to a typo or something, but now it's shown up in a few different Lore places then it seems more and more likely the system name is accurate and for whatever reason it's just missing from all the maps.

I tried to make comparisons between FFE maps and ED maps while everyone was looking for INRA bases, to find Hotice, but it basically impossible other than a vague similarity in some star positions.
