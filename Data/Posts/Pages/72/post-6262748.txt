You might be forgiven for thinking this describes Raxxla: "...and even its location is closely guarded. This secrecy is maintained by the EFP using 'misinformation' - there are a great many rumours of its rough location - and they all contradict each other. Only a select few - the members of the EFP - know the truth."

SPOILER









The stuff about it's location being secret is pretty interesting. Does that mean our Galmap is not the standard model? As PF members do we have a special one that muggles don't get?
