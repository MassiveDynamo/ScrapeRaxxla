Thought there were to be no clues? Where did The wheel of time turns crop up? Not read any of that series (though may have read a couple of his Conan books, decades ago), any possibility there may be a clue there?

The wheel of time is from the 'What was lost will soon be found' mission: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=2652622&viewfull=1#post2652622

Pay attention Jorki.
