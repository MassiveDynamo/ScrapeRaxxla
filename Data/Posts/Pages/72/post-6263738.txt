Personally I don't think Raxla is moving through the galaxy. I think it is in orbit, somewhere.

Both the hint: 'The Silent Song Of The Spheres'(most likely a reference to Kepler's 'harmony of the spheres' and the law of planetary motions)
and the hint 'The wheel of time turns'(suggesting cyclic behavior), may point to an orbit.

The wheel of time turns, is a small poem or quote by fantasy writer, Robert Jordan:
“The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.”

Thought there were to be no clues? Where did The wheel of time turns crop up? Not read any of that series (though may have read a couple of his Conan books, decades ago), any possibility there may be a clue there?
