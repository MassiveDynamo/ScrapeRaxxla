Could someone please confirm some details for me?

I vaguely (might have imagined it) remember someone, somewhere, on some thread, saying that Fdev have confirmed there are no hidden systems? I think it was in reference to requests regarding the "Dark Systems" mentioned in several of the novels - I believe that official clarification is that these are not hidden, they're just brown dwarf systems with no planets (or something like that).

If anyone can find the quote, or link to the Fdev comment, I'd really appreciate it - I'd like to check what the exact response is (i.e. is it "no there's ntohing hidden", or "No Dark Systems aren't hidden", that sort of thing).

Reason I'm asking: I've found reference to a system in ED Lore (here's one of the (several) sources) that doesn't seem to exist - the Veliaze system, it's a pretty important place, but the galmap and EDSM can't find it - Either Fdev left it out completely (unlikely). renamed it (but why?) or it's entirely hidden for some reason...

...if they have hidden one system, why not more systems? Could 'Obfuscated' really mean "hidden from Galmap"?

If Veliaze (and maybe Raxxla) really is "missing from the map", are they possible to find with the tools we have?
