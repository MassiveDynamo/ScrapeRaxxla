But is there written somewhere that Raxxla actually does have an atmosphere ?

I imagine that Raxxla is travelling at fixed speed through the Galaxy (will it fall of the edge?). That could also explain DB's cryptic statement "And we know where it is".

Don't think I've seen something about an atmosphere on Raxxla, other than we know people are living there, but that does not imply an atmosphere.
