OK I'm finally ready to start my search for Raxxla.

I've been lurking here since the beginning of this thread, and looking for Raxxla since 1984! To start with I'm following the rift mystery to the Zuhura (not sure if that's the correct spelling!). Then to the edge of the galaxy and clockwise up to the outer rim. I'm doing this in a Cobra (max 35 ly jump range) as Rebecca did. I will post my progress here.

I maybe some time.......
