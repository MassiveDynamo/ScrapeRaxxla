I've got nothing, other than Raxxla is a planet travelling through the Galaxy, just like Jaques. For us to use the portal, this has to be in orbit around Raxxla itself.

A planet travelling faster than light as everything in this game...even light itself
But is there written somewhere that Raxxla actually does have an atmosphere ?
