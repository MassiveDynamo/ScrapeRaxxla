Thanks for seconding the motion. I did have the idea that it was Derthek, Dommaarraa or Delmonte... but wasn't sure exactly. In any case, I know I wasn't just imagining that I remembered it. That was an entirely possible scenario.

Stange that this gets brought up now though, as I'm currently back in NGC 6357, which, if you might remember, was Derthek's space whale. He was convinced there was something there.

If memory serves correct...
Ive done the opposite/equivalent/whatever-you-want-to-call-it of Sol, Alioth, Achenar, Polaris, Varati, and CL Pismis 24 as both cmdr Canonn and Derthek getting first discovered tags in all but Sol's opposite (CMDR Fuchov I believe holds the tags for Sol's opposite)

Ive also done Sol's equivalent in East and West parts of the galaxy if you consider Sol to be in the North. Took just under 2 weeks to circumnavigate the milky while maintaining ~24,000 light year distance from SGR A*

There is definitely a spreadsheet out there of the systems and their neighbors if 1 system wasnt close enough to be the exact opposite. However, anything elite related would have been lost to me after i sold my pc in 2016.

Speaking of which, does anyone know if Derthek is still hunting his whale (NGC 6357)? Only I've noticed that since 2.2, the name is no longer persistent on the galaxy map.

So it was a bug, not a feature, all along. Some things never change hah
