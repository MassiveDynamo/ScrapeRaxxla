Just to theorize a bit:
Raxxla: Place, that isn't a Place. Door, that is also the key.
It is thought to be a rogue planet, maybe a rogue system?

A system in itself is a term we use to name a conglomerate of stellar bodies
in relative vicinity in orbit around a central object. Correct?

What if Raxxla was an unnamed rogue system, travelling through the outer gaps between the galaxies
spiral arms, allowing at certain times (server reboots) to travel and change the place in the galmap.

It would be a place without being a place, since we call a system a place,
which it isn't really.
It would be a door and also the key, to an unreachable region of space,
via hopping into the system and further on.

Does that sound plausible?
