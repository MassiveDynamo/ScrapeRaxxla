I don't recall anything about "in plain sight" or "hidden" to be honest. The only official word I've heard from Frontier is that it does exist in the game and that they won't be giving us any clues about it.
This is possibly a take on the quote from MBs interview after the "there will be no clues" where he says "you have to make things a tiny bit obvious"
