Dear God just read all 88 pages
Firstly I think all the anagram and other kabbalistic musings are way too complicated and heavy on the tinfoil The hints of FD seemed to suggest it was right in front of our face and thus much simpler.
I'm really doubtful its within the bubble. Returning from deep space to recruit for an expedition i would have thought is just that.
Why is nothing more made of "Take a line from Rearte to Riedquat to the edge of the arm? Thst seems pretty clear.
My only other thought and where i don my tinfoil hat relates to in plain sight. That in fact we should be investigating the Elite Pilots of the Federation and not the Dark Wheel. The Pilots Federation Secrecy monuments message is very odd. Not only does it hint at layers to the group, but it speaks of deliberate misinformation being used to hide the 'true' location of the 'Founders World.' In other words the headquarters are located in Shinrata not the actual Founders World.
