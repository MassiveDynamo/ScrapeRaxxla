Not necessarily. Wasn't Lady Kahinas ship found with a medallion with the Dark Wheel insignia on one side? Doesn't she warn of an elite conspiracy?

The "Dark Wheel" medallion first makes an appearance in the fan-fiction short story written as the Children of Raxxla's origin story. The Children of Raxxla are a player group that reached out to Drew Wagar and asked if they could use his character, Salom√©, as a figurehead for their organization. Later, when Drew was asked to come back to the Elite: Dangerous universe to write Reclamation elements of that fan-fiction narrative found their way into the official storyline.

It's important to remember that The Dark Wheel, as an organization, were never limited to the search for Raxxla. Raxxla was just one of the many myths that The Dark Wheel pursued so their involvement or lack of involvement in the Formidine Rift narrative shouldn't be used as an indicator that the Rift narrative has anything to do with Raxxla. There is far more concrete information regarding The Dark Wheel and Raxxla in John Harper's And Here The Wheel then in the pages of either Reclamation or Premonition.
