Perhaps the link as far as location is tenuous, but i wonder if the nature of The Dark wheel and the Elite is not?
I havent read the books mentioned but the lore seems to have moved from them being distinct themes in the game to at least linked. Given 'Salome's' warnings, the obscuring of the Elite, the Dark Wheel, Founders world and Raxxla, i cant help but think there's something we are missing

If FD ever said Raxxla is hidden in plain sight (donâ€™t remember that clue-source?) then it might be in Shinrarta system, or it might be the planet & station shown on the Horizons startup screen. There would have to be a station for the non-Horizons players to access. Is this startup screen the same for Horizons & non-Horizon players?
