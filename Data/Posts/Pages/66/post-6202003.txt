...and that they won't be giving us any clues about it.

At that question asked by DJTruthsayer MB answered: " ... mmmmh ..That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious etc..." which turns this actually to be both the best and unique clue.
But what am I telling you, Doc ? You were there, participating at the interview chat in real time !

I don't recall anything about "in plain sight" or "hidden" to be honest.

Remember that this "celestial body..this place that is not a place..that key which is also the door...the myth" is told to be " obfuscated ..." What I can't determine, is if it is obfuscated because of being far away in the " outer rim" or because some other reason..
I suspect it being in a tiny locked region, maybe not yet discovered.
