If FD ever said Raxxla is hidden in plain sight (donâ€™t remember that clue-source?) then it might be in Shinrarta system, or it might be the planet & station shown on the Horizons startup screen. There would have to be a station for the non-Horizons players to access. Is this startup screen the same for Horizons & non-Horizon players?
