At that question asked by DJTruthsayer MB answered: " ... mmmmh ..That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious etc..." which turns this actually to be both the best and unique clue.
But what am I telling you, Doc ? You were there, participating at the interview chat in real time !

Was I? Things get so fuzzy. I know I tuned into one of his streams live, maybe this was the one? I dunno. Somewhere I recorded just the MB interview part of the show ... need to dig it back up.
