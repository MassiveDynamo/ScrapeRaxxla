Me thinks you are getting things confused. The line from Reorte to Riedquat is about the Formidine Rift not Raxxla. The Rift is solved, finished, done and reheated until it has become shoe leather. Raxxla is a totally different mystery altogether with roots that go back to the original Elite video game released in 1984.

Not necessarily. Wasn't Lady Kahinas ship found with a medallion with the Dark Wheel insignia on one side? Doesn't she warn of an elite conspiracy?
