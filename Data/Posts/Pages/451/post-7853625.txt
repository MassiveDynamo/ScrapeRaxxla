Plenty. Subject to the usual provisos of course!

Will add more details when I’ve got a min.

Off the top of my head;

queens - yes
hive minds - partial yes. It’s not non-local FTL telepathic though. Also is more of an extreme hierarchical style thing rather than a group-mind.
(Though don’t take those as absolute statements. - I’ll fish out the relevant info and update.)


Edit 1 -

From OoTD:

“Each of us has to learn independently: verbally or via direct observation and experience—a clumsy and inefficient process. Oresrians can pass their experiences directly to others of their species. What I show the Oresrians here, every Oresrian will know when they return home.”

- hive mind of sorts, with it being not non-local/FTL. Said by a character, so subject to the usual considerations of things of that nature.

Also from OoTD:

“Culturally they still move slowly by our standards.”

- just for reference. Same provenance as previous quote with associated considerations.

From Galnet article

“There are even rumours that the Thargoids have a collective consciousness or 'hive mind'”

- though this is obviously just a report about rumours, and the following line starts ‘Some of the less outlandish theories...’ so it could be read as potentially just rumour in that context.


Edit 2 -


From Galnet article

“our analysis has revealed some intriguing details about how the Thargoids categorise geographical data. Indeed, it’s entirely possible that their concepts of territory differ dramatically from our own.”

So we can infer that individualism isn't really a Thargoid thing, if they are capable of sharing their experiences directly. I think that confirms that 'Klaxxians' is a human construction and that a Thargoid is more likely to say "We are Klaxx".
