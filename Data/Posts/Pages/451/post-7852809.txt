Iirc, we were told only the ED novels by DW, which follow the ED writers guide, may be considered as out of game canon stuff.
So, GalNet, Codex and the ED novels are our only sources of lore, imho.
And the tourist beacons and ship logs. They are the most important source for confirming the stories from the older games. They can be quite funny, if you know both side of the story.

This story for example, featured in the FFE journals:
FATAL ACCIDENT AT STADIUM
J.J.
Federal ballet lovers bowed their heads in mourning this week after the news filtered through from Yorkville (Ackwada) of the fatal accident sustained by celebrated hover-ballerina, Signora Mia Felicita.
Reports suggest that as a result of gyrophonic failure the air banks used to support the dancer's weight proved too insubstantial and Signora Felicita, only three hours into her first half, plummeted to her death in the audience below. Sadly, it is understood that three members of the audience were also killed in this tragedy since the Signora's costume was of great size and heavily sewn with acubium crystals designed to catch the light.
Amongst the dead, co-incidentally, was included Mr Duke Mastopolos of Mastopolos Mining Inc, Signora Felicita's former patron and the organiser of the performance.
The Times would like to extend its condolences to the dancer's family and to all ballet-lovers throughout the Systems.

And this is from a data log, in ED:
“Corporate Data Log: Seriously, I've got the scoop of the century. Remember in 3252 when Duke Mastopolos was killed in an accident? You know the one - a hover-ballerina fell on him. Anyway, that's not important. What matters is it was no accident. It was his wife, Gabriella Mastopolos, who caused the whole thing. This is massive. A scandal like this could bring the whole company down. Hang on...there's someone at the door…”
