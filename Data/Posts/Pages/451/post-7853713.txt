Just added another quote from OoTD which is more pertinent:

“Human individuality, the family unit: such quaint concepts. She is more than capable of understanding them. Like me, She recognises their irrelevance.”

- Quote is a human talking. ‘She’ is an Oresrian.

I guess it's down to what exactly we're meaning by individualism, etc. For example, while they can share experiences, I don't think we can construe them as thinking as one mind. The experience sharing needs physical proximity which would mean conversely that any Oresrian which isn't in physical proximity isn't 'connected' for want of a better word.

I think we've got to accept that Oresrian/Klaxxian is a human construction to some extent - it's just a 'closest human conceptual equivalent'.

Too many possible options for what the original is, most of which aren't exclusive to each other, to narrow it down IMHO.

I agree with all that.

I don't think we can take the 'xx' as a clue
