I hope your 79LY range Conda has railguns, because there are ghosts over there. If you see a funny looking space rock, haunting blue blobs, nebulae or chestnuts that make noises, it's usually better to shoot them with a railgun first. Last time I visited Formidine Rift I had to shoot several rounds at the Zurara just to make it go quiet.

Orexr. It all makes sense. I wonder if Duval used railguns at them. Why did it look like a waterworld. Or was it John Taylor who did it, that traitor. Where is Veliaze? Do they shoot natives of 3 Alpha Lyrae with railguns? How long will this dream last, I've shot so many of them with a gauss cannon just to wake them up. It's so cold. Wake up! Why can't I remember!?
