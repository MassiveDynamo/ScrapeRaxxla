I was just there, did a complete survey, came up empty. I wholeheartedly encourage you to go do your own research in Crab, and also to read this thread:

The Search for Gan Romero
Good morning all, I'm off to find Gan Romero. I know it's a fool's errand, but I have a hunch. It's clear that Gan is not simply deluded. Who is calling him and what he is delivering are the real question. New Krait MkII, 37.15Ly range with no guardian FSB. Enough materials for 19 75%...

Just did the Bubble Nebula also, I've seen it referenced here in the last day or so. I'm happy to answer questions, though I didn't find much.

Good to know. I'll continue on though as well. When you say a full survey, did you do just they full system, or full nebula? As there don't seem to be too many stars there Im going to try and check them all. Thanks for the link, ive seen this name a lot but havent investigated it yet.
