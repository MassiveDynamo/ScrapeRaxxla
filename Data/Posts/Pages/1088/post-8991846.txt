Starter zones did not exist until very recently though so can likely rule that bit out. There were always certain starter systems (different from the current ones I believe) though, with no access limitations.
Not to mention they are permit-locked. And half are empty, and nothing would make sense at all (I think). I just kinda threw that in so if anyone had thoughts on why that WOULD work, we wouldn't pass over it
