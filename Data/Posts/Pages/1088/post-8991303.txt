The reason it's hard to find the actual asteroids, is because we're dropping at the "asteroid belt region" (remember we're not targeting/locking on the signal source) and this might be the clue for it.... the search area is a flat disc about 650ls long and positioned in between Jupiter and Mars orbits.

If we fly in normal space close enough to the actual asteroid cluster we may find the rocks... or maybe a hidden station, a dredger... but it is worth going there and fly around honking until we find something.

Yesterday I was passing by it again and the speed in SuperCruise started to drop whilst over the Asteroid Belt region (gravitational pull), decided to drop to normal space, but again, the search area is just massive.

So, let's us meet next Sunday and we can focus the search on the Asteroid Belt region.

Cheers!

Asteroid clusters are often way of the disk in the system map orrery. The disk is just a schematic visualisation. There are RL asteroids that are more than 30 degrees of the average plane.
Searching up and down from the disk, may be smart?
