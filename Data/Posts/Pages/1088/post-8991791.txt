If anything is naturally in the asteroid belt, it has to be in orbit. Regular coordinates wouldn't work, unless you can figure out a time variable.

If the three arcs in the Raxxla symbol means asteroids, it could indicate Trojans based on the 120 degree separation? In that case we are one a planets orbit. Not in the asteroid field.

Earth has only two known Trojans. Mars has a handfull and Jupiter has a bunch. Neptun has a bunch to.

My favourite is 5261 Eureka (Mars Trojan L5)

We (or I) don't believe that the Lagrange points are in play so far. There are actually 3 of them on Jupiter's orbit, perfect for the symbol, but searches have come up fruitless so far.
