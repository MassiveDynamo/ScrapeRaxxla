Starter zones did not exist until very recently though so can likely rule that bit out. There were always certain starter systems (different from the current ones I believe) though, with no access limitations.
The division of the galaxy into sectors and the record about Raxxla were not either.

I keep forgetting to ask, how many of these sectors are in the galaxy?
