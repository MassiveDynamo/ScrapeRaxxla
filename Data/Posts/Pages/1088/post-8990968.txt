That would be AWESOME ! Would love to see the Dubious Profit make an appearance !!!

Edit: Although Im starting to wonder if its a hint that the Galactic Summit is in for some unwelcome visitors... (Not just Archon Delane)
The number of goids massing in the Coalsack indicate something is seriously afoot claw? Tentacle? As it is happening at the same time as the Galactic Summit I suspect that is the target, everyone will be massacred and it will be the start of the Major Goid war which humanity will lose and be pushed out of the bubble as foretold by soothsayer many moons ago. Goodbye Aisling! Condemned to a fate worse than death as the plaything of a tentacled fiend? Mental images of Princess Leya in the cave of Jabba the Hutt
Might make RXxla Questing a bit tricky henceforth!
Ooh, that’s interesting. Mistyped Raxxla above and the autocorrect wants to put in Rbxla. What’s that when it’s at home? Is DB a Scrabble addict?
