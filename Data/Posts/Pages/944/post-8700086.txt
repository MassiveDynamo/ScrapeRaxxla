So I've been away for about a year,has there been progress or is it all still tea and biscuits with a side of tinfoil and onion head?
Still just lots of ideas and tinfoil. Little to no concrete progress. The game universe is so big an there are so many places/ways to hide things. Large coordinated efforts seem to be needed to make progress.( if it is possible at all)(Too many variables for a individual cmdr to get clean data/info.)
