So I've been away for about a year,has there been progress or is it all still tea and biscuits with a side of tinfoil and onion head?

Its been fairly quiet but other things or events have woken up and come alive now so we have dragged them in and trying to link them to Raxxla, but at least its new stuff and looks like more to come so be prepared for a wild ride....and some of it might be thats the fun.
