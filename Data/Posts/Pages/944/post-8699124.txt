It’s unlisted currently but I can change that if you like. HD is still processing so it looks kinda bad right now and it’s dark as a result. There was a more complete version of the Barnacle symbol on its nugget as well you can’t see yet but should once HD processing is done. Description of the systems I was jumping in is also in the description.

Thanks for sharing that, I've had three hyperdictions but never seen (or heard about it in other threads) this behavior. Nice to learn about it.
Sorry for abandoning you last night, I was just halfway into the other realm for some sweet sleep. It got to me.
