It’s unlisted currently but I can change that if you like. HD is still processing so it looks kinda bad right now and it’s dark as a result. There was a more complete version of the Barnacle symbol on its nugget as well you can’t see yet but should once HD processing is done. Description of the systems I was jumping in is also in the description.
