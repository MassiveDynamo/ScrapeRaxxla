Hmm not seeing those green glow videos either.

Not getting any green glows in the belt ~1380ls from Sol.

Where are you seeing this sector 16 label? Not sure what the criteria are for getting this to happen. Just so many posts to sift through, but it doesn't matter...

I realized I did, am doing, and will do what happened when the Thargoid interdictions happened. I raced out to the scene, banged my head on the wall hoping for something green, then grabbed some popcorn and watched youtube instead of playing the game.

Sometimes I wish I wouldn't read the forums so I wouldn't know what I'm missing. FOMO is raging lol

Git that green glow. The popcorn is great btw.
