Well I can finally say im a member of the green glow club. Nothing more to add but I caught a bit on video if it helps.. possibly related to a "new contact" appearing close ? or not...
Edit ... well ya the light from the sun seems to move independent of the green glow ... so ya not related.

Welcome to the club!
Your vid is interesting -you were in sector 21 I think & I would say below the light source and it might be in front of you. Can’t read the sol distance but you were near the middle of the belt width so I’d guess around 1380 ls. Can’t see from your vid your orientation -where were the Magellanic Clouds and where was the orbit line of Jupiter?
