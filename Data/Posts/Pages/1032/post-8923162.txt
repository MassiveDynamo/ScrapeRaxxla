Oh yes, this hunt is extremely boring!!!!!
I flew into Sol on 20th December and started to check out the “asteroid clusters” reported by Koben. Saw my first glow during that investigation a few days later. Finally managed to capture some video of the glow on 31st December. In total about 14 sightings and 4 videos in over a month!!! Best day was two glows seen (31 December).
