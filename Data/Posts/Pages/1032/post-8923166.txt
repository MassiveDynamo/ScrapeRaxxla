It strikes me that I and Macros have seen this glow in sector 16, Simulacrae saw it when he was in sector 21, & from what has been said others seem to have seen it in other sectors. So either this is “a journey everyone has to travel for themselves” & it spawns in different places for different pilots, or we are seeing one thing but from different directions. To be able to cross-triangulate that position we need to know the orientation of each ship, so a really useful thing to do when you see it (hopefully have video recording on!) is to select minimum throttle & pitch down through 360 degrees so we can see the orientation of the ship wrt Magellanic Clouds, and also go into the orrery view with Sol selected then zoom in and rotate the view through pitch so we can see the relationship of the ship’s positional dot to the thickness of the asteroid belt. In the orrery view it is shown as a thin flat segmented disc, but in reality it does have some thickness. You can prove this yourself by finding one of the “asteroid clusters” with no body selected, then fly down towards the Magellanic and note when it disappears, then reverse direction and repeat the test.
That's why I was wondering about different locations in the belt.

If this is kind of a map and the three arcs are the belt, there could be three 'open lanes' for the green light?


Just some speculation. The 'map' could represent something completely different.
