In the spirit of investigating TDW - I've been receiving a few random spawn missions from TDW as I've been hanging out in SD just exploring and digging here and there and was offered the latest from a Hidden Contact of TDW via a Mission Beacon.

As soon as I read the message (couldn't accept as the tick was greyed out? Had enough cargo space, and the pads are L at Neumann Camp), it disappeared from my inbox in-game? I captured screen shots of the invite, as I've been burned like this before without proof!

But because I couldn't accept it, I don't appear to have any mission locked in like I normally do, is this expected for this type of USS? Anyone else seen this before?

I plan on getting the fish and dropping them off later anyway to see if anything crops up... but thought I'd poll collective wisdom as well to see if this is just RNG/Bugs.










Seems funny you'd need to be Elite to deliver fish.

Edited:
Found reference to Trading Beacon here - Rare apparently, and no mission? So we'll see...

I think the Elite requirement is a reflection of the quality of NPC assassins the mission incurs that will be trying to prevent your delivery. Is your pilot Elite? If not that would explain why it was greyed out.
