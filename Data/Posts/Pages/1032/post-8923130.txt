Here are the Green Glow videos:
SPOILER: GREEN GLOW VIDEOS




Some Observations:
Entering the asteroid belt during SC causes a known bug to occur in the Orrery System Map, which will display your position incorrectly.
New signals will often be detected but won't show up on radar.

“If it appears, it is always just after the Orrery System Map is closed.” - I’m not convinced by this. It is true that in my videos the appearance closely follows use of the orrery view, but that’s because I’m continually using the orrery view to check my ship position, especially wrt the height/thickness, of the belt since there is no other way to do that. Last Sunday (no video recording) I saw the glow while pootling around in sector 16 but had not used the orrery view.
