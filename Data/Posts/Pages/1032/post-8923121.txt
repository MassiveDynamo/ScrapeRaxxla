One of our guys tried it with almost one of every artefact you can think of on board, no difference in experience.

Thanks to him for trying this. As my original post mentioned I had considered the possible need for an Ancient Relic or Guardian Key from their wiki descriptions, but IFF it is Raxxla then I canâ€™t see them being a requirement for access.
