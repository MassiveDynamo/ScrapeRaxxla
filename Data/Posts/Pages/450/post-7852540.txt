Weren’t Oresrians and Klaxians both mentioned in Out of The Darkness? Believe that’s canon?
Really must get around to re-reading these books.

In Premonition to. The names are 100% lore.

The Klaxians are still a complete enigma though. No one(human) has seen them.
The Oresrians claim that they are nasty, but we don't know.
