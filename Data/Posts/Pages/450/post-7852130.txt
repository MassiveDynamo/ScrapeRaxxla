The name Oresrian isn't used in the journals. There are however indications of two different Thargoid species. One green and one black.
The Thargoids also talk of a third species that is very aggressive.

The name Oresrian was first used in The Dark Wheel(book). Klaxian is a new name with ED.
The Section about the Thargoids in the Holdstock Report deals exactly with this topic.
