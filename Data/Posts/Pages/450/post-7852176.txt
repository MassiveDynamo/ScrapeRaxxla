The Section about the Thargoids in the Holdstock Report deals exactly with this topic.

That section is very speculative. It’s also inconsitent in it’s use of the names.

Oresrians and Klaxians are well established in the official lore books. There is no doubt about the names.
The main problem with the info about the Klaxians, is that it all comes from the Oresrians. There are no independant reports of the Klaxians or their nature.

There are reports of samples from two species in the FFE journals, but that does not seem to have transferd to ED.
