While it is true that the names are mentioned in Premonition, keep in mind how they were mentioned, i.e., in dialogue. People can lie for whatever reason, intentionally or not, or be mistaken:

while I'm pretty sure it's not the case, and these two are the real names, I assume both can change as long as they don't appear in the game.

People can lie, but Society uses the same names as Clarl Linnaeus uses in 'Out of the Darknes'. He has his info from the Oresrians and it's not likely that they would pull the same lie. Linnaeus in cooperating directly with the Oresrians. This seem to go against the agenda of the Club.

If anyone is lying or bending facts, it's the Oresrians.
