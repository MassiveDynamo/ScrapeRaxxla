Too risky I'm afraid. You'll be driven mad by the voices in hyperspace and I wouldn't want that on my conscience. I have to stop my ears with wax in order to survive.

Did you know that if you record the sound of the hyperspace transition then replay it backwards through Audacity, you can hear a voice saying "Stop messing about and just play the damn game".
I never listen to any of that stuff in higher-dimensional space, and so far it has worked brilliantly in avoiding space-madness.
