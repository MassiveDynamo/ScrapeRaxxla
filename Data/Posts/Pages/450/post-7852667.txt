My question is ... who came up with the names "Oresrian" and "Klaxxian" as far as the in-game universe is concerned? Are those the names that the Thargoids use for themselves or did humans apply them? The "ian" suffix sounds like something that humans would append. If you hail from Canada or Brazil would we not call you a Canadian or a Brazilian?

So maybe "Orexr" and "Klaxx" are somehow descriptive of each branch of Thargoid? Maybe a hint as to where they come from? I guess there's no way to know unless we meet them face to face for ourselves (and even then we probably won't live long enough to share the secret ...)
