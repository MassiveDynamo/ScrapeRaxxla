Quite right. I'm likely conflating Drew Wagar's lore which mentions the Oresrians and the Klaxxians with the two species of Thargoids from FFE. So change "Oresrians confirmed" to "Oresrians implied" ... or something like that.

Weren’t Oresrians and Klaxians both mentioned in Out of The Darkness? Believe that’s canon?
Really must get around to re-reading these books.
