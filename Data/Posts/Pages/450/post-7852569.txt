In Premonition to. The names are 100% lore.

The Klaxians are still a complete enigma though. No one(human) has seen them.
The Oresrians claim that they are nasty, but we don't know.
While it is true that the names are mentioned in Premonition, keep in mind how they were mentioned, i.e., in dialogue. People can lie for whatever reason, intentionally or not, or be mistaken:

while I'm pretty sure it's not the case, and these two are the real names, I assume both can change as long as they don't appear in the game.
