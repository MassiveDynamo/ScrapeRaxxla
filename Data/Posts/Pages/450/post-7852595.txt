People can lie, but Society uses the same names as Clarl Linnaeus uses in 'Out of the Darknes'. He has his info from the Oresrians and it's not likely that they would pull the same lie. Linnaeus in cooperating directly with the Oresrians. This seem to go against the agenda of the Club.

If anyone is lying or bending facts, it's the Oresrians.
Whatever his source may be, he himself could be lying/wrong/misguided. But again, I'm 99.9% sure both names are correct, I'm just saying be careful assuming stuff is true just because it's mentioned in a book
