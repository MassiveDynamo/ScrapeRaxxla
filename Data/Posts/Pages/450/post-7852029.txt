Suspect that bit was retconned out. Wish they’d tell us what wasn’t retconned!

I (don't) like how the books that came with the games, that introduced the dark wheel and raxxla, are not considered canon at all.
A bit of a belated comment now, but I think it's worth considering what the reverse situation would represent. It would constitute preternatural knowledge which there's no way that a random independent pilot should have.

The situation's dubious enough with the ED books (and a few other info sources), but at least they're fairly recent.

The things we're talking about generally with TDW are things that by all rights you* should probably have not even have heard of, let alone having an exact factual knowledge of.

(*you being us all in our role in the game / game universe.)

Having the previous stuff as Myth and Legend is a pretty good way of handling the situation IMHO.
