One minor thing:

Where did you get this from? I don't remember any of it in FFE, and a quick search through the journals (via Dream-Ware) didn't return a single mention of any Oresrians.

The name Oresrian isn't used in the journals. There are however indications of two different Thargoid species. One green and one black.
The Thargoids also talk of a third species that is very aggressive.

The name Oresrian was first used in The Dark Wheel(book). Klaxian is a new name with ED.

Quite right. I'm likely conflating Drew Wagar's lore which mentions the Oresrians and the Klaxxians with the two species of Thargoids from FFE. So change "Oresrians confirmed" to "Oresrians implied" ... or something like that.
