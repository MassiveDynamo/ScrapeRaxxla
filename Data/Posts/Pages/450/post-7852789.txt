Greetings fellow CMDRs. I was wondering if there's anything I can help ya with in your search. Currently I'm heading from bubble to the formidine rift on 79LY range Conda equipped with both repair and fuel transfer limpets. If anyone needs help or want me to check some places, I'd be more than happy to do that
