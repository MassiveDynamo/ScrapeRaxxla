Given the nature of the Alliance, comprised of a loose grouping of Independent systems, I'd think a lot of systems would remain independent from it so an Alliance space radius of 50 ly from Alioth seems reasonable for 2015/3301. So if the theory is correct then "Raxxla system" should lie within around 50 ly of Alioth. It would be sensible to allow a bit of leeway on that, so I'm thinking search for all named systems within 55 ly of Alioth and see which names are subanagrams of "Princess Astrophil and the Spiralling Stars"..I only have libreoffice and my spreadsheet programming is abysmal.

The Bei Dou sector corresponds to a 40ly sphere centered on Alioth, so there's a good chance of it representing the original Alliance influence zone.

However, the Old Worlds are fairly distant from such core, as seen here (taken from a full list of Sector 1 systems on the first Elite game - the outlier on Federal space is Erlaza).
