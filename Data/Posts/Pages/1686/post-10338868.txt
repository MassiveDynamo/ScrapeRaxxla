I'm not at all convinced those garden trees are cedars, they look more like cypress trees to me, or more likely columnar conifers - most likely junipers
Cedar: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedrus
Cypress: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupressus
Junipers/conifers: https://www.finegardening.com/article/columnar-conifers-for-focal-points-screening-and-tight-spaces

Edit
Though of course the actual tree type depicted might be obfuscation!
