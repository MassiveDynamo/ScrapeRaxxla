@Rochester Mmm, according to EDSM no cedrus, cedar, cypress or cupressus in game. There is a Juniper, but it's out near Colonia....could the Empyrean go out that far??
In my opinion this construct is a very localised mystery.

The garden elements leave a great deal open to interpretation - if they are actually an intentional clue, it’s equally likely not intended, and likewise throes trees might not be representing something in game, although I do rather like the idea, it could just be a pictorial representation of the theology… eg this circle represents Eden because it’s surrounded by cedars… if they are cedars?

But there are specifically six of them.

And the hexagon points of the logo, must have some relevance in game - surely there’s a relationship?
