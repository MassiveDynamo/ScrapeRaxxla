I took part in the second first search CG. IIRC (I'll check my EDD history after morning dog walk) only two of those Lyncis Sector search systems had wreckage, and one more than the other.

How did you get the last part "the last known trajectory systems"? I spent yesterday afternoon searching Galnet and rebuilding my (long-deleted) Starship One Incident notes. All I could see was that there was a last signal message detection in a system XX 75 ly from Azaleach, which I assume is one of those Lyncis Sector systems.
