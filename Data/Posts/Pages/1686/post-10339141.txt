Locating the passage that noted Cedars encircled Eden. Book 5: Paradise Lost - details the journey of Raphael from heaven to Eden..but doesn’t ever advocate any numbers to trees..but it’s the text I recalled, which identified Eden with being crown on all hills (encircled) by cedars…

‘with cedars crowned. Above all hills’.

This passage describes Raphael as a seraphim, who have six wings… not sure if the number six has any specific relevance here.

Again the garden design, if accurate ; it may only be utilising abstract metaphors to convey a theologic concept and ascribe meaning to the circles, eg this represents Eden… they might not mean any more than that, can’t say for sure?!

Well then, clearly he was a Guardian (definitely focussed on 6-fold symetry!); Thargoids have a prediction for 8-fold symetry!

Han_Zen's theory proven?
