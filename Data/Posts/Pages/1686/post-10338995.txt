I'm not at all convinced those garden trees are cedars, they look more like cypress trees to me, or more likely columnar conifers - most likely junipers

@Rochester Mmm, according to EDSM no cedrus, cedar, cypress or cupressus in game. There is a Juniper, but it's out near Colonia....could the Empyrean go out that far??
