There exists a Dev video of Brookes saying something similar, about being careful about transporting certain illegal cargo in Alliance space, it then cuts to an amusing ‘reaction’ he pulls with a Brookes smirk and appropriate ominous music!

Dev fiction diaries 1 around 7:11.

I've just rewatched that video...interesting he said at 10:22 that FD might start to release more info on the Mars alien artefact....something which never seems to have happened!!

I wonder if he's hinting at 7:11 we need to carry Trinkets in Alliance space to stand a chance of triggering Raxxla/Omphalos??

And separately I'm wondering if the (later deleted) meeting between Mahon and Halsey just before the Starship One disaster was about an alien artefact the Alliance had discovered (i.e. Raxxla). However that itself might have been the intended storyline which was deleted to make Raxxla more of an interesting Easter egg... Halsey later said (or was that further obfuscation to protect the Raxxla secret?) at Vincent's trial that it was Vincent himself who was responsible for the unscheduled diversion from 78 Ursae Majoris towards Azaleach. I think it was Halsey's later request for exploration data that was supposed to lead to the discovery of Guardian sites.

And perhaps amusingly, if Raxxla is in "heaven" (Alliance space) and Achenar is at the bottom of the embedded MIilton cosmology, was MB saying the ED Imperium is the "Evil Empire"?
