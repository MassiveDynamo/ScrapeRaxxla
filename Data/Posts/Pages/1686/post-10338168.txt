And even that one wasn't original - it started out as Federal.

The original Alliance systems were in two separate clusters - one larger around Alioth and one smaller around Lave - and as you expected were very heavily interspersed with independent and federal systems.

A reasonably-accurate overestimate for the original ones would be to check for systems with native non-player Alliance factions.
How do you ascertain if a faction is native & hasn't migrated into system?
EDSM minor factions indicates there are 903 Alliance minor factions, but lots of those are player factions.
Aha- IF could extract (how?) those 909 into a spreadsheet then could filter out the player groups, filter out duplicate home systems which would give the Alliance systems...but I think that would be the current Alliance bubble size, how to check for the 2015 systems?
