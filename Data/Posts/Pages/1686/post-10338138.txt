And even that one wasn't original - it started out as Federal.

The original Alliance systems were in two separate clusters - one larger around Alioth and one smaller around Lave - and as you expected were very heavily interspersed with independent and federal systems.

A reasonably-accurate overestimate for the original ones would be to check for systems with native non-player Alliance factions.
