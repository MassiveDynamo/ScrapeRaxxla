My involvement in Starship One wreckage search was from 29Jan2016/3302 to 04Feb2016/3302 and my flight data record shows some minor differences to the CG and Galnet history I've put together- I'll paste down below in case I lose my notes again and others may be interested. I think the discrepancies are in the CG info which I got from Inara. I was finding Wreckage in the systems I've just mentioned above. Didn't go to Niju and only 2 trips to HIP 3130, so there was likely wreckage there but the systems I concentrated on were more productive.

I'm reviewing this because it struck me that Gan Romero's dreams and Halsey's visions appear to be Guardian-related (FD later fudged it so they could claim the exploration data gathered led to the discovery of Guardian sites). I suspect Raxxla/Omphalos Rift is a Guardian artefact, and the locations (Gan Romero in Vega and the Starship One wreckage area where Halsey floated in her escape pod) are likely to be location clues to Raxxla location...how far does "telepathy" travel?
