Ah yes, that list was in the CG screen at Leoniceno, just seen a pic on that Reddit link.
Looking through my EDSM flight log (EDD isn't showing detail for back then) my memory was at fault...I returned from MA hunting in the Pleiades to participate in the first search CG. Interestingly my log shows I was searching in Daurtu, HIP 36014, Xbal, Lyncis Sector ON-T B3-1/ON-T B3-2/ON-T B3-3 & ST-R B4-3 but I later concentrated down onto HIP 36014 & Lyncis Sector ON-T B3-2/ON-T B3-3/ST-R B4-2/ST-R B4-3, with the majority from HIP 36014 & Lyncis Sector ON-T B3-2/B3-3 . Also I made a few trips to Daurtu, but can't remember if that was for some offload to the mysterious commercial firm competing with the Federal search (think I suspected TDW) or I found some wreckage there, but Daurtu isn't mentioned in that 2nd CG.
