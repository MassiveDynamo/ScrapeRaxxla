Yes, clearly a Coriolis station but has a Talmor Lens.

SYNUEFE UY-R B34-0 4a = Seen you. F you. Why are... Be for... Oh, for a? (kit kat bar? klondike bar? Bottle of eye drops? Wink of sleep?!)

Can't make out the rest of the secret coding on that system name.

I think this particular station may have a real attitude problem though!! [yesnod] (attitude? Altitude?) But I imagine that station has been up for a long time!

Any really old stations with an attitude problem? Sounds like Raxxla to me!
