Looking up Coriolis and found Coriolis effect. Is the Coriolis affect the same thing as that rumor about going around 7 time around a body to find raxxla? Maybe it's describing the effect or something. Maybe Raxxla is somehow related to the Coriolis effect somehow.

Possible directions to land on a very difficult planet? Could this mean we'll find Raxxla when the atmospheric bodies are added? BTW, there is a video in that link showing the effect with kids throwing a ball on a rotating thing in a school yard. Might be relevant.

Doesn't seem likely to me. The Coriolis force is just the effect of moving within a rotating frame of reference.

If you want to experience it in game, try docking in a rotating station with rotational correction off. If you want to see it in effect, get someone else to do it while you watch.
