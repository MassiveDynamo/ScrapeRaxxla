I think that is one of those 3d hexagon stations with a really strained eyeball from looking really far into the distance. That thing hasn't blinked in millennia and it's eye is really dry. That or it's looking into a sun constantly. Hard to tell. We need to send an Optometrist to go check it out.

Yes, clearly a Coriolis station but has a Talmor Lens.
Solved!
