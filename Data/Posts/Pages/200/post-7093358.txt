I disagree with the coriolis bits.



It's never a hexagon. Edit, ok, nvm...



It can be. But I highly doubt this is what's being represented. If it was, there'd be a triangle at the center, no? And you would have to be aligned perfectly, since you otherwise have 7 or 8 edges.

I agree that it's a symbolic representation of something and that the dashed line may very well be symbolizing obfuscation. But why hexagonal, why two circles with one of them split in 3 pieces... I think, as was often the case with symbolic representations of Elite mystery quests, see image below, it's incredibly likely to refer to a specific system.
