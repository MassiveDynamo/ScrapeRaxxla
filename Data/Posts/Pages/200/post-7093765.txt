I noticed something about the Codex icon for Raxxla.

To me, the shape of the guardian beacon, linked above, looks similar to the black portions of the Raxxla icon.

Now, when activated and open, looking from above, they make 6 "bridges", with an 'Ancient Key" being in the center.

What if 6 Guardian Beacons are pointing to a particular system? It could be a mere coincidence, but thought I'd share in case this theory has not been brought up.

Sorry for linking the pictures that way. On a cell phone with struggling connection at the moment, lol.

Perhaps you need to activate a Guardian beacon & then quickly get inside it?
