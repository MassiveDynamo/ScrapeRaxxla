What if 6 Guardian Beacons are pointing to a particular system? It could be a mere coincidence, but thought I'd share in case this theory has not been brought up.

More plausible. Especially if they point to a "Guardian Station", since then everything is in space, which meshes with the idea you could find Raxxla before Horizons was in the game (ie: no surface landings, ergo "Raxxla" cannot be on the surface).


Also maybe at launch the beacons and stations were simpler models (eg: generic nav beacons and Coriolis station), and they've been upgraded since.
