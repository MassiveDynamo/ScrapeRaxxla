Technically, when the station is facing you there are two sides. One with a triangle. Another with a circle opening with the 32 portions around it if you choose to count it that way. It could be symbolic of the station type. Not sure about more than that.

As to the Coriolis affect. I was assuming maybe it was a hint to possibly landing on raxxla and that it would be an atmospheric planet with difficult winds. Maybe requires you to travel down on the equator a long way or use the knowledge of the Coriolis effect or similar to get down to the surface without dieing. Or the key is the key to getting down onto atmospheric planets the easy way or something simple. They said it's not what we think. A key that is not a key. Knowledge to get to it's surface. Knowledge is a key that is not a key. It opens up the gate to another realm. Knowledge is the door. The gateway. And the key! Maybe Raxxla is a riddle! 8o

By technical definition those on the top are always the most knowledgeable. If a group thinks they are on top but aren't the most knowledgeable there are people above them they just don't realize. And those who are knowledgeable are often invisible to those less knowledgeable by definition of that difference in understanding. Without knowledge you simply can't see things. It's the same logical form as people hiding and running things in a way. Knowledge is required to do anything. And all of those things needed for everyone to be alive day to day require people who know and do things which those without understanding of those things often come to know very little about. Especially in an infrastructure like modern society where most people don't have to learn much to get the things they need. At least not relative to what is needed to be known for those things to exist.
