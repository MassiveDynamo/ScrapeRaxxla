If it's a station isn't that how those weird 3d hexagon stations look? Maybe it's a station.


It's not a hexagon, but if you look at it from angles it is a hexagon. A key that isn't a key. If key is a clue. It's a clue that is not really the thing it is. Maybe one of these station is looking at raxxla. And one clue or potential hint was flying a certain direction to get into it. Maybe there is a station that you have to do this to avoid NPC's or gravity wells. Maybe it's the station itself. Can you look up all stations with this design? I wonder how many there are.

Basically, no matter which way you look at this 4 sided station side it will end up with 6 sides... Looks like a purposeful geometric illusion to me. Very odd and coincidental design!

BTW, if you look at those partial circles split up around the opening. There are 24 sections if you split it in two going towards the center. 2x12. If you add the splits from the 4 corners cutting 4 of them in half that is +8 for 32... Very close to the 33 in the picture. And in the same spot around the eye/opening.


BTW, some of the station pics of this type look different. Which station is this? It's the pic from the wiki.
