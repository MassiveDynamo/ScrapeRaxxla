Looking up Coriolis and found Coriolis effect. Is the Coriolis affect the same thing as that rumor about going around 7 time around a body to find raxxla? Maybe it's describing the effect or something. Maybe Raxxla is somehow related to the Coriolis effect somehow.

The amount of deflection the air makes is directly related to both the speed at which the air is moving and its latitude. Therefore, slowly blowing winds will be deflected only a small amount, while stronger winds will be deflected more. Likewise, winds blowing closer to the poles will be deflected more than winds at the same speed closer to the equator. The Coriolis force is zero right at the equator.

Possible directions to land on a very difficult planet? Could this mean we'll find Raxxla when the atmospheric bodies are added? BTW, there is a video in that link showing the effect with kids throwing a ball on a rotating thing in a school yard. Might be relevant.
