Does merope have 1 belt? Does anyone know what the curve meant in the image? Whatever it is, the symbol we now have has 3 of it.

Wait! The center dot could be a planet instead of a star (it's smaller than the usual representation of a star), with 1 moon (full circle) and 3 rings/stations (curves)

But the hex and the beams and the dashed hex...
