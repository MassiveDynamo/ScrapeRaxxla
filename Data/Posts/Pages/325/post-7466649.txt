Reading the wiki again, TDW is searching for Raxxla, so I assume they do not know where it is and are on our side actually, opposed to what is stated in the op of this thread. Or did I get something wrong? So maybe we would have to help them expanding into another system of question in order to uncover it?

Yeah thatâ€™s why we need to find TDW and join them in order to find Raxxla
