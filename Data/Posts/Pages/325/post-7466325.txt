Since Raxxla was not in Elite 1984 I suspect that the systems in the old elite only denote the general location, and may not contain Raxxla themselves. Since there are only a few systems from galaxyies other than 1 (that contained lave) and Raxxla was rumored to be in another galaxy in the Elite 1984 sense. So we should be searching the areas around the non-galaxy 1 systems.

Isinor being the only permit locked system is also interesting.



Totaly baseless ideas ahead:
I suspect the dark wheel base is not in these regions, and is much closer to Sol. Specifically Lacaille 8760. Based on the 'earliest days of interstellar flight' would not necessarily mean FTL flight.(solar sails etc) The stations in the system are named after astronauts, and a interstellar flight visionary. Various bodies in the system were discovered by Cmdr Tionisla (why name a CMDR after an old System?), and Luko mentions Tionisla in relation to the Dark Wheel historically. The system is really close to sol, but was able to be discovered by a player? (Kinda Strange) Since the body (7h) is tidally locked a synchronous orbit would make sense. Detecting the station from real space visually is likely impossible (even know stations are nigh impossible to see. In supercruise that known stations glow, but not from real space.) So we would need to manually fly the orbit in real space waiting for any sign of the station (like a nebulous 'ship scan detected' that might signal the station instance being loaded?) (insane time requirements, or luck needed)

Of course is all this baseless speculation, but wanted to point out that the DW base and Raxxla may not be directly related w.r.t. location etc.
