Okay another post which also coincides with a feeling that I had too: That Raxxla is located in Polaris.
The System is Permit locked so we can't just get inside, but there may be a way to obtain the Permit womehow and we've not uncovered that yet. Dunno if this has been discussed in the thread before.
I noticed that when jumping to a nearby system you can indeed select and target it, just engaging the FSD gets denied.


I have found a reddit thread discussing the topic, really interesting:
https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDange..._missing_raxxla_link_please_just_hear_me_out/

"So we have the Gate (Raxxla in Polaris), the Bridge (Bifrost in Alioth) and the Way (Waypoint in Sirius)."

Also with Alioth, it is the home System of the Alliance as we all know, being controlled by Edmund Mahon, the Prime Minister.
When I checked these systems here: on Inara, some of them were listed as exploited by Edmund Mahon. A connection perhaps?
How can an uninhabited system be exploited by a power at all?

The main problem with Polaris is that every commander that played FFE, went there.

There is an Alien portal there. It's Thargoid and leads to Miackce (possible Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3).

It has all the ingredients, but it would be quite anticlimactic.
