The picture of the Dark Wheel station in the codex is interesting to me.
The star is a very deep red
It looks quite big for something presumably far away
Most 'M' stars are too small to have anything but snowballs

I visited a bunch of K, M, L, T, Y, C stars to check the color. The K, M (Red Dwarf), Tauri and C stars I checked were much more yellow. L and Y were too purple.
The closest match to color that I could find were M (Red Giant) and M (Red Super Giant). They are also quite big.

Based on that, I ran a search on the EDSM data for Red Giant/Red Super Giant WITH a Gas Giant that has at least 8 moons. I found 41 results.
Does anyone want to help check these? I want to try flying around the 8th moon at close range and seeing if anything pops up.

Zaurak - checked: zaurak c 2 h, non-landable icy body, already mapped. mapping & flying around it didn't expose anything
4 Cassiopeiae - checked: 4 Cassiopeiae AB 2 F, G and H could all have a claim as the "8th moon". Mapping & flying around them didn't expose anything
Shui Wei Sector FC-U b3-3 - BCD 1 H already mapped, mapping & flying around didn't expose anything
Smojue TE-I b23-4
Blu Euq FT-K b49-16
HR 6001 - CMDR Edelgard von Rhein checked, found nothing.

Synuefe CA-K b56-8 - M8, 9 H mapped, flew around, nothing
Gru Hypue JY-I d9-90
Synuefai KP-V b49-5 - M8, Mapped & flew around 8 H but nothing happened

Byeia Thai VT-Z d13-0
Prua Phoea XF-O d6-21
Bleia Eohn AU-A b33-3 - M3+ M8
Traikaae QY-M b12-0 - M8

I pasted all these into the galaxy map, they all have population 0 and economy: None.
I'd be surprised if finding their station is this simple (eg, maybe it only appears if you have the invite from The Real Dark Wheel or some special permit), but it can't hurt to rule out the known systems.

FWIW I'm triple elite, king, admiral & allied with TDW and all factions that are known to grant system permits

Edit: Cmdr Macros Black is en route to some (thanks!), added notes with some of the darker colored stars (M8 is pretty dark)

Edit 2:
I ran a query for ordinary Red Dwarf stars + gas giant + 8 moons in the same system and came back with 7658 results, so that's not good.

However, I flew toward a Red Super Giant and a Red Dwarf to see how close you have to be for them to look like the picture:
Red Super Giant (Pegasi 2) - Textures still visible, star is a little too small at about 1000 ls away
Red Giant - Textures not visible until about 25 ls, star is still small until under 15 ls
Red Dwarf - Textures not visible until about 25 ls, star is still small until under 10 lswell the
