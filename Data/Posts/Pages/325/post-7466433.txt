Some random thoughts following some fruitless footling around the core systems...

Art Tornqvist - if not a clue or anagram but an actual in-game character - Art was a shipboard mechanic, circa 2296 based out of Tau Ceti system.

Now do we know of any vessels existing within that time frame setting off from TC?

I'd always liked the idea of it being literal. And there being a crashed vessel some place, possibly containing another clue...
