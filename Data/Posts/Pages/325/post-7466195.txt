I think we should try Tycho's Supernova again... its in the right area off Cass and could have been visible by old Philip Sidney (1572)...

FD 'say' they didnt put it in....https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?p=4890586&viewfull=1#post4890586

But did they really? Most likely they did omit it but when it comes to 'there will be no clues' they cant really confirm it if it were the mystery X loaction...all in all we're all probably in agreement its a non-existant location, but then again its right off the shoulder off the H&S area on the Elysian Shore...

Looks like a nice area, and I still fancy going back to the H&S so I may just have another gander.
