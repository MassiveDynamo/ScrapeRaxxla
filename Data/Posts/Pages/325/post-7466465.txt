Also, now, you don't even need to be single Elite to interact with the TDW faction... do you ?

No you don't. But perhaps being triple elite spawns different missions or something? Has anyone ever tested that?


Also (not having read the whole thread that's just too much) has anyone used the new scanners to check locations were previously nothing was found?
