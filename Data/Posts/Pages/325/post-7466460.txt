Some random thoughts following some fruitless footling around the core systems...

Art Tornqvist - if not a clue or anagram but an actual in-game character - Art was a shipboard mechanic, circa 2296 based out of Tau Ceti system.

Now do we know of any vessels existing within that time frame setting off from TC?

I'd always liked the idea of it being literal. And there being a crashed vessel some place, possibly containing another clue...

I stopped by Tau Ceti because I agree this system sounds fishy.
Its the first recorded mention of Raxxla, so it seems reasonable that whoever discovered it was based out of this system.
Tau Ceti is also the first human colony outside Sol, and had indigenous alien life until the human settlers wiped them out.

"Art" = Arete = Greek goddess of Virtue = "Queen Virtue" from the Astrophil & Stella poem?
or "Art" = "Arthur", as in King Arthur the 'quest for the holy graal' guy?
Tornqvist = "Thorn Branch" = beats me, lol

What's a clue and what's a random name?
