Raxxla my be the doorway to the elder gods, a careful what you wish for myth.
Babylon 5 "Thirdspace" is a good syfy version of it.

Looking at the drawing - Gate is guarded by two stars. One high one low - North and South (Polaris and Sirius). Other things seem largely irrelevant. "Autism alarm" didn't went off.

For the Bifrost to work as in the mythology it needs to be ignited.

Sirius has been known as Lokabrenna ("burning done by Loki", or "Loki's torch"). Who so, the one who bears the torch (Lightbearer = Lucifer) ignites the Bifrost with Loki's Torch to open the gate to Arcadia. Loki is obviously the Nordic equivalent of Lucifer.

For the ones pursuing Egyptian angle - Sirius is associated with the goddess Sopdet... and look at the symbol over her head. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopdet
