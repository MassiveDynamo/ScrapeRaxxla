Hi all,

I am a long time lurker. Somehow is my first post here to,this thread.

Concerning MBs relation to Lovecraft.
I found an interesting comment from him on a book about Lovecrafts Cthulhu Myth.

The Cthulhu Myth sounds quite interesting.

Info can be found here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos

What do you guys think? Is there a possibility that Raxxla and the Cthulhu Mythos are connected?
