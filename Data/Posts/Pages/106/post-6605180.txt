Thanks Han. Did anyone check how much their range increased for jumping? Or does it not increase and you just get the message?

When you get the message far from the jet cones in Sirius, you get no boost at all.
If you enter the cones of Sirius B, you get the normal white dwarf boost.

The message is the same.
