You donâ€™t have to scoop at all. It happens when flying from Sirius to Sirius B and seem to be a bit more frequent flying from B to A.

I does not seem to happen in deep space, far from the stars.

Thanks Han. Did anyone check how much their range increased for jumping? Or does it not increase and you just get the message?
