Thanks Han. Did anyone check how much their range increased for jumping? Or does it not increase and you just get the message?

2 hours ago I used my DBX (58.26 LY base) to supercharge on the white dwarf. Gave usual boost to 86LY - so I was able to one jump to Alioth, no extra effects unfortunately. There must be something more.

I believe there is something in Alioth you need to do first, then go to Sirius instead.
