2 hours ago I used my DBX (58.26 LY base) to supercharge on the white dwarf. Gave usual boost to 86LY - so I was able to one jump to Alioth, no extra effects unfortunately. There must be something more.

I believe there is something in Alioth you need to do first, then go to Sirius instead.

OK, thanks. So it does actually give you a 50% boost bonus - good to know. Might jump in game in a while and try it out.

The plot sickens!
