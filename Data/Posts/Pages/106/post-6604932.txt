I noticed this too, but it only happens occasionally - do you know how to trigger it? Is it just a case of "scooping the dwarf"? Dwarf scooping.... Sounds SO wrong.

You donâ€™t have to scoop at all. It happens when flying from Sirius to Sirius B and seem to be a bit more frequent flying from B to A.

I does not seem to happen in deep space, far from the stars.
