For solid evidence, you're absolutely right but I don't think there is one solid enough.

Solid evidence is the one thing missing from this quest. The closest we come to solid evidence is The Dark Wheel novella which isn't truly considered to be canon (though aspects of that story do creep up in canonical sources).
