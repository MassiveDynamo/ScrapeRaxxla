Didn't some players exploit a bug in which you placed a fleet carrier next to a permit-locked system to buy its data to find out a permit-locked system inside/near the Bubble which matches the description of Raxxla? The one about the moon of a gas giant.

Not Raxxla, you’re getting confused. The Codex says that Lyta Crane (who may not know what she’s talking about, or may be intentionally misleading us) says that TDW stealth station may be orbiting 8th moon of a gas giant, somewhere.

There is sufficient doubt raised by the codex phrasing that I am inclined not to believe it, or it may be a distortion of the actual location. Remember that TDW are secretive and might be expected to put out false information about this.
