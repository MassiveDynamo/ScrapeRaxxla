What does this community feel about the theory that triple Elite is required to find Raxxla?

Do any of you subscribe to that theory or believe that Frontier would have left it possible for even a newbie to stumble upon it?

Thoughts?
I doubt that Raxxla has any form of human population that would let anyone in, no matter what ranks you have.
The Elite requirement in the old lore, is to become a member of the Dark Wheel.
It is still probably true. It may be connected to the Founders permit, for practical reasons.
