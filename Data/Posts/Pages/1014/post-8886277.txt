@dysonl:
IFF true I think it would indicate Raxxla is not a planet. I suspect the real point of TDW Codex entry is to state that an artificial object (e.g. station, satellite, or ship (some of which were reported in old lore to be up to planet-sized, at least for goids, so I suspect Guardian ark ship could be similar), etc) can be stealthed so it would not be detected by a casual scan, not would it show up in the population tab on galmap (assuming it’s populated, I suspect it’s abandoned). Indeed it may be you have to be at the correct location and keep on scanning to stand a chance of detecting Raxxla. Remember that Raxxla has been in-game since the outset, and remember the RNG nonsense that was originally in place for engineers upgrades! I suspect FD won’t have reduced the criteria for Raxxla!!!
