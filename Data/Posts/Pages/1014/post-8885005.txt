FD have said that misjumps aren’t in game. But there are 6 systems with unknown permit in the bubble. Search Witch’s Reach in this thread for the list.

Just a small thought....
First, i do remember Fdev saying that, so i am inclined to agree with you there...
but i have also tooled around with the thought recently...

Hypderdiction by Thargoids... this is essentially a mis-jump, just with an Alien Encounter... but the principal of "mis-jump" would be the same effect, a disruption in the Hyperspace stability and dropping out at an unintended location.... so in principal, there could be somthing similar to a "mis-jump" or Hyperdiction event, that allows access to Raxxla (or the system its included in), but Fdev just doesnt call it a "mis-jump" becuase you need to cause it intentionally to get to Raxxla, therefore is not a "mis" jump....

IDK.... just a thought i wanted to drop in here....
