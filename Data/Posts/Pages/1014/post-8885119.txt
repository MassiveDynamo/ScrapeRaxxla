fdev i think imagined gameplay as if you were playing back in 1994 with no friends or real internet:
You goto systems and consume absolutely all information regarding them before moving on and you are writing this all down in a notepad you keep by your desk (because you dont have multiple monitors or any electronics such as a tablet or smart phone or way to log the information automatically into a database).
You spend time in each one taking missions from factions who ideologically you agree with rather than just looking to make the most credits from system to system.
You investigate every USS and other signal source.
You read the local news and galnet and investigate current affairs mentioned in them.
You only expand your bubble of systems as needed.
You record sounds and video and look for histograms encoded in the background noise just in case with third party tools you purchased or downloaded or were expected to have because that's how games work.
You spend a lot of your time just feeling good about how awesome you are with your notebook filled with perpetually out of date information about markets and faction relations.
You do all of this because you're not aware that it's probably one of the most inefficient ways to gain elite rankings, credits, ships etc. - basically any reward offered in the game

it's weird the playerbase is not doing all of that.
