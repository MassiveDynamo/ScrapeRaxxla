yes, i believee that was either Polaris or LFT 509? I think Polaris if my memory serves...

But the system map was just that, a system map.... I dont believe that it showed any stations/surface sites/or any detailed information about anything within the system, becuase the system itself hasnt been entered and scanned properly...

I might be wrong there, but I believe thats the stopper on the permit locked systems still...
