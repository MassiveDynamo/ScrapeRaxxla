Someone wrote (in this thread?) that FDev mentioned that we don't play the game as expected.
Just going to point out that they were talking about the playerbase in broad strokes, not about how we all play as specific individuals. I know the way I play, and more specifically how I played in the early days of playing, was very much along the lines of how FD had designed it to be played.

That's not had any bearing on finding Raxxla so far, but it's certainly had a lot of (positive) bearing on other aspects of the game.
