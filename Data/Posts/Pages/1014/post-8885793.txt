obviously everything is just throwing ideas out because we have no idea what raxxla even is, much less how fdev decided to hide it and to what level they're willing to provide clues.

If there is 1 thing that is guaranteed. It's that we've put way more time into thinking about this than Fdev put into doing it (putting raxxla in the game). This is being overthought and we need some way to resetting ourselves to thinking about this thru the eyes of how fdev sees their players.
I think we can safely assume that FD values the mystery and legend of Raxxla and the Dark Wheel. I don't think they care if we don't find it. The mystery probably has more value than the actual Raxxla.

The implementation of Raxxla is most likely relatively simple and within the scope known mechanics. The implementation may have changed over the years, as the game has evolved. The location probably hasn't.

FD have later added the mystery of the Dark Wheel station. We have no confirmation yet, that it's actually in the game. If it is, it will not reveal it self to scans (running in minimum power). The same is probably true for Raxxla (obfuscated on the outer rim).

Objects that aren't revealed by any form of scanning are practically impossible to find, without a form map. The Voyagers were found because we knew they were in the game, we knew they were in Sol and they were in the correct RL position. If Raxxla is implemented in a similar fashion, we are a few hints away from a map. We only know it's in the game.

One important piece of the map, is likely to be in the Dark Wheel station. Personally I doubt there is any complex, hidden list of tasks that leads to an invitation there. It will have to be found the hard way, like Raxxla.
