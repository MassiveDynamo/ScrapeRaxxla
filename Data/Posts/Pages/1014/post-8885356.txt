Personally I have been very happy with my hypotheses on these forums, currently working on possible ways to combine results from my two main paths of studies in order to formulate a full, coherent theory. As you see, obviously Raxxla as a base form of linguistically and culturally significant unit can be already traced into Early Bronze Age Pit Grave cultures somewhere around Pontic-Caspian Steppe, and again it very strongly appears in Late Modern Era cultural sediments around Los Alamos, New Mexico, just at the dawn of humanity's first attempts of space exploration with primitive spaceships. However, there exists a 5000 year gap during which humans only had access to ungulate mammal powered wheel technology, and strange waterborne vessels propelled by changes in atmospheric pressure using tensile structures. Thinking about leaving inter-stellar slave trade aside for a while and returning to my old university in Capitol, Achenar and taking a few more courses in Earth Sciences.
