So, is this thread now the home-away-from-home for locked-out independent Rifters? Anyone know why the Formidine Rift thread was locked down (without any apparent warning or explanation)?

Also, was just in Shinrarta where I am allied with the Dark Wheel, and no sign of any of the old potentially Raxxla-related missions there at all anymore (Obfuscated in the Outer Rim, etc.). Anyone know if these missions are actually still available anywhere? Last known sighting?
