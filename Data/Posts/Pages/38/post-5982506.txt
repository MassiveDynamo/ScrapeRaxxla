If he did, he's going to be disappointed. And besides, he says he's 15kly's outside the bubble. Those guys are at least 44kly's...depending on the route.

Also,

In reading through the jv.com thread, it seems a little fishy to me. He claims to have honked the system and one of the planets was named "?". I've never seen a planet named anything after a honk, only "unexplored." Anyhow, passing that, he then says that he scanned it and it was only a rocky world...he seems to imply that it was a landabe world and that he has Horizons but that he was unable to land on it. He later goes on to say that he's 3kly's from the system but that he'll head back there and take screenshots and hot-foot it back to the bubble to tag the system.

Raxxla, an unlandable rocky world? Eh...I hope not.

Sounds like a server connection problem to me. We had a lot of similar occurrences at the beginning of Horizons.
