Well, that would not be consistent with what he says. He actually speaks of a landable rocky planet, which results then unlandable when he tries to land on, (like if he played without Horizons). He says he didn't even know about the Raxxla thing, until an other threader pointed him to the wiki.
Now he seems overexcited. He's going to spend the night coming back to the bubble to save the data. We might, if it's not a hoax, know more in a few hours. I keep surveying that french thread.
