Current speculation on the thread linked off of AndyJ's post above seems to be that all "Founder or Elite" missions were removed when they removed rank requirements from the mission system. It would be nice to have that confirmed, and know whether they will come back. And if their absence might be inhibiting or preventing finding Raxxla (or anything else) in any way.
