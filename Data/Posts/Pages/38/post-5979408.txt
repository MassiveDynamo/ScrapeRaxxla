Tracking Dark Wheel ships leaving Shinrarta Dezhra, and updating this post, not expecting much to come of it. For the most part only wake scanning the one jump out (would be cool if one day the wake said Raxxla), but on occasion I follow along.

Tonight I tracked Elena Markow flying in a Python through 5 systems. Almost lost her at LHS 2313 at an outpost, was lucky to follow an anonymous wake and found her again. One stop was curious, she travelled 317KLs to Crucis Sector DB-X b1-6 B 4, a landable Ice body, and immediately jumped out again. Quite possibly just a random stop in a random system...

Currently she's in supercruise in Crucis Sector HH-V b2-7, and I think that's the end of the road for her, because she's been here for 30 mins just hanging in sc.

Anyway I'll spend some time looking at Crucis Sector DB-X b1-6 B 4, you know, just in case.

Went to Crucis Sector DB-X b1-6 B 4, nothing to see, moved on.
