So, is this thread now the home-away-from-home for locked-out independent Rifters? Anyone know why the Formidine Rift thread was locked down (without any apparent warning or explanation)?

Also, was just in Shinrarta where I am allied with the Dark Wheel, and no sign of any of the old potentially Raxxla-related missions there at all anymore (Obfuscated in the Outer Rim, etc.). Anyone know if these missions are actually still available anywhere? Last known sighting?

AndyJ made an excellent recount of the missions here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=5869706&viewfull=1#post5869706

I'll corner someone from FDev at the Expo and ask [smile]
