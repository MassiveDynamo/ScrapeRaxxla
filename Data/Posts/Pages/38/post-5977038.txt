Anyone else noticed an increase of DW internal reports missions from Jameson to Colonia ?
What could that mean ?

That makes me wonder if all this Jaques failed jump thing has something to do with our concern.
After all, we still don't know what happened there...
It may only be you (in which case I think it is worth following up) or it maybe a side-effect of 2.4 mission system changes and the same for everyone (in which case I think it's noteworthy but nothing special).

So can anyone else check? (FYI I can't, I'm north of Colonia).
