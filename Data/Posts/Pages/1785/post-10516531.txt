So just because YOU never found anything during your apparent "years of searching" then automatically it doesn't exist?!
Yes, that's exactly my opinion bro, but I'm not telling anyone what to believe in, keep your pants down. It's only MY opinion as I pointed out multiple times, no need to get triggered by it lol.

Who's preventing you from posting?
You literary told me what I should or shouldn't post in your first reply to me. But I think enough stupidity for one day, enjoy your search bro, let us know when you find Raxxla...
