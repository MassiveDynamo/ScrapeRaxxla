You should've stopped right there ^.
The rest of your post(s) don't really add much to this thread unfortunately.

Now then, for any fellow current RAXXLA searchers: Has anyone tried placing a 'Thargoid Sensor' into your cargo bay ( anti-corrosive version of course ) and then scanning around some of the rumored/suspected potential systems to see if maybe something triggers?
Mm, we never really had (IMO) a good explanation of what the UA/thargoid sensors were looking for. So maybe it might be worth picking up a UA/TS before trying to drop into the Pareco comet?
