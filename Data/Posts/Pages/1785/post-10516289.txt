Oh dear. I am not a fan of AI, but decided to do another quick search on "in-game (not text) and very hard to find"

And got this:

If something is "in-game (not text) and very hard to find," it would typically be referred to as a "hidden item" or "Easter egg" - a secret object or detail within a game that is not readily apparent and often requires specific actions or exploration to discover.
Key points about hidden items/Easter eggs:

Visual element:
They are usually not explained in the game's narrative or instructions, requiring players to actively search for them visually within the game world.
Challenge to find:
These items are intentionally placed in hard-to-reach areas, hidden behind puzzles, or require specific conditions to trigger their appearance.
Rewarding discovery:
Finding a hidden item often provides a sense of accomplishment or unlocks a small bonus, like a special cosmetic item or behind-the-scenes information.

So, AI-confirmed, finding Raxxla will give us a new Cobra mk3 paintjob!
