I only shared MY opinion on this after years of searching.
So just because YOU never found anything during your apparent "years of searching" then automatically it doesn't exist?!
See that's why i'm more interested in data, determination, & diagnosis than i am of some pessimist's "opinion". But hey that's me.

If you disagree with it it's fine,
It certainly is fine, yep.

if you don't like it it's really your problem, not mine.
lol all of a sudden it's a "problem" to disagree with "Zimous opinion" , eh?
Wow.

This is a topic for discussing matters related to Raxxla,
The title of the thread is actually: The QUEST to FIND Raxxla
Based strictly on your recent posts , it just doesn't seem like you're interested in the topic so much as invested in being a forum contrarian for contrarian's sake.
