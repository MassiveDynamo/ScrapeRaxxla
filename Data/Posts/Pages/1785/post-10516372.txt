It's quite possible that it's in the game, but just locked for the time being
That is exactly what many of us think

Perhaps technical limitations prevented FDev from opening it to the public, or just lack of time and resources.
I doubt it, my guess is they are waiting for a 'trigger'
Zimous said:
But I have to admit, even if it's all just a myth created by FDev to spice up the game lore, it's still fun looking for it (or was in my case)
Exactly

I would much rather have the real thing ingame, or at the very least get invited to The Dark Wheel and be fed leads to investigate
I actually hope we never find it, the journey is proving too much fun

When NASA embarked on research for the first moon landings during those first five years they accidentally invented a shed load of products we still use today.
During the research and testing for Artemis, they and their partners have made some discovery's which will benefit us all even if we don't reach Mars in the foreseeable future.

This thread is just the same, we have read books and researched stuff many of us would have laughed at in the beginning and made discovery's we would not have found if it wasn't for Raxxla.
