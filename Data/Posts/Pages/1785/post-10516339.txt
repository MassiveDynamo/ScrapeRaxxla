Oh dear. I am not a fan of AI, but decided to do another quick search on "in-game (not text) and very hard to find"

And got this:

If something is "in-game (not text) and very hard to find," it would typically be referred to as a "hidden item" or "Easter egg" - a secret object or detail within a game that is not readily apparent and often requires specific actions or exploration to discover.
Key points about hidden items/Easter eggs:

Visual element:
They are usually not explained in the game's narrative or instructions, requiring players to actively search for them visually within the game world.
Challenge to find:
These items are intentionally placed in hard-to-reach areas, hidden behind puzzles, or require specific conditions to trigger their appearance.
Rewarding discovery:
Finding a hidden item often provides a sense of accomplishment or unlocks a small bonus, like a special cosmetic item or behind-the-scenes information.

So, AI-confirmed, finding Raxxla will give us a new Cobra mk3 paintjob!

I have flu so out of boredom had a 40 min discourse with AI, from a totally unloaded context of ‘a place is not a place’… what was interesting was no matter how it was approached, repeatedly it kept referring to John Milton… which considering how it was never a loaded question I found interesting.

Interesting from the perspective of an infinite money-cage, given AI have limited perspective and data and its inability to distinguish real data and build false information.

Its conclusion was it represented Hell in Milton’s cosmos, as all other aspects were physical (which I disagreed with). It continued to disappoint as it repeatedly opted to agree with my hypothesis around Celtic otherworlds…rather than challenge, further evidence of its ignorance of acceptance of any data as data…

Pointless 40 mins of wasted energy, AI as I’ve opinionated is a narcissistic plague which vomits grey data… it will kill us all, and is leading us into the hands of some sinister cabal or sole tyrant.
