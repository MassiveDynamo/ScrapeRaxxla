I doubt it, my guess is they are waiting for a 'trigger'

I actually hope we never find it, the journey is proving too much fun
I disagree about the trigger, in my view it wouldn't be reasonable to hide something no one could find in 10 years time. At this point if there was something in the game which no one had found yet the devs would have acted and done something about it. But I can understand other points of view, it's really depends on what YOU believe yourself or find more probable. There's no wrong opinions here. And even if you don't believe Raxxla is in the game, you can still spend time and effort looking for it when any clues or leads show up. Makes running missions and killing pirates more enjoyable if you have some goals, even if they are very long shots.

But I agree with the other part, I always assumed FDev intended us to get invited to TDW which would then open the doors to different mysteries and at best we would find clues and leads about Raxxla, giving us a bit more insight on it, without actually revealing where it is. Or we would get a tourist beacon with some sort of explanation to what it is, without allowing us access to it.
