Fortunately, earnest/fun players within this massive thread don't need your permission, nor your "agreement", to continue searching for whatever RAXXLA turns out to be.
Again, when did I say you couldn't or shouldn't search for it? I only shared MY opinion on this after years of searching. If you disagree with it it's fine, if you don't like it it's really your problem, not mine. This is a topic for discussing matters related to Raxxla, not a cult where only true believers are allowed to post lol.
