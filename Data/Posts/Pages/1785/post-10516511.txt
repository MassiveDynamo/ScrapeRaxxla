Unfortunately for you I'm not here to only share what you agree with.
What exactly are you "sharing" other than standard forum pessimism? And why are you here? eh nevermind, it's fairly obvious based on your posts.
Fortunately, earnest/fun players within this massive thread don't need your permission, nor your "agreement", to continue searching for whatever RAXXLA turns out to be.

Sorry if I busted your bubble in any way.
You didn't. You can't. No one can. ( except maybe Frontier )
And that's the whole point.

Mm, we never really had (IMO) a good explanation of what the UA/thargoid sensors were looking for. So maybe it might be worth picking up a UA/TS before trying to drop into the Pareco comet?
Couldn't hurt to try. Plus, theoretically , one could logically presume THARGOID sensors might be able to detect ________ better ( or differently ) than our paltry human technology.
Furthermore, from a basic game code design perspective, it's possible there could be some set of parameters necessary that goes beyond just merely stumbling upon X random planet or whatever.
