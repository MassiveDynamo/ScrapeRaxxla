I think you may need to go further back. Lave was the first of the Old Worlds region to be settled and that isn't until 2412. Vega wouldn't be nearly as prominent in that region anyway. Old Worlds are practically in heaven layer of Yggradrasil. There is a non-trivil vertical offset from the galactic disk relative to Sol.

That said, Vega, Altair, and Sirius and a few others of the really bright stars, are functionally at the ecliptic for Sol. The is the plane at which stars appear to spin about the sky throughout the year.

I think 2412 is plenty old enough for the toast. I doubt it dates back nearly that far.
