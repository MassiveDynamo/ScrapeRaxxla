Hey Rochester

Looking at your work I can see you have devoted a lot of time and energy into breaking down the visualisation of the galaxy into the Miltonian model universe.

I have to admit, and this is more of a reflection on me, I’m struggling with the visualisation of it at the moment. I think it needs a few of the points/stars labelled so someone like me can understand it a little better (Sol, Achenar etc) but I can clearly see you’ve spent a lot of time on this.

You should do a YouTube video on it!

My theory was very simple in comparison

It exits here in the thread, in segments and from time to time I’ve attempted to put it together as a finished textural product - but then I find more… it keeps growing or some part need removal because its false.

The effort to build any presentation would likely be wasted, because it is changing, and I always hold its all likely total nonsense the whole process is itself a form of catharsis role play.

Logically a great deal is also built on data built off assumptions of potential concepts of persons no longer with us, I would not be so presumptuous nor disrespectful to promote my ramblings as factual, the reality is far likely more interesting.

My base assumption if true is that the objective likely ought to showcases this construct, because otherwise why go to so much trouble - unless it’s all just imagined and totally nonsense.

I’m not attempting to prove my theory is right, over others; in part it helps me play the game and gives a reason to explore, my tongue is firmly always planted in my cheek.
