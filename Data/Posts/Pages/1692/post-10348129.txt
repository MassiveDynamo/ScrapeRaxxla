@Louis Calvert is the landscape signal expert in this thread and has done a lot of interesting research... Not sure if he's looked at 3D spectrographs...

Might want to read this...
Raxxla Revealed & How to See Raxxlan Aliens (not RP) (serious) (not clickbait).
Edit: 15/5/24 - I'm adding this at the top here because on re-reading my OP I realise that I really buried the lead, and that since I was a bit sleep deprived it's a bit hard to read. I don't want to edit my OP because people replied to it so I'll leave it as is, but this short new intro will...

Thanks for the @

@Merlin StWahgwaan I didn't know that was possible, I'd Love to know more? Maybe that's what I've been looking for. I'll try that, thanks!

EDIt: Reporting back on this. Tried WhiteCap as suggested.

Unfortunately it doesn't so much represent the spectrogram in 3D as it does generate a wireframe waveform using an algorithm based on the audio. So, unfortunately, it's not really useful as what you see is only vaguely related to the sound itself.

However, it was a great idea, and if you find anything similar, do give me a shout
