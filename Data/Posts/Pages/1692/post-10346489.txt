Hey Rochester

Looking at your work I can see you have devoted a lot of time and energy into breaking down the visualisation of the galaxy into the Miltonian model universe.

I have to admit, and this is more of a reflection on me, I’m struggling with the visualisation of it at the moment. I think it needs a few of the points/stars labelled so someone like me can understand it a little better (Sol, Achenar etc) but I can clearly see you’ve spent a lot of time on this.

You should do a YouTube video on it!

My theory was very simple in comparison
