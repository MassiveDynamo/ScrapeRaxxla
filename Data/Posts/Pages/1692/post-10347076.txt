I'm always hoping anything they add will help with finding Raxxla...

But specifically this is a "supercruise" thing, so would be in-system effect only probably, so it likely won't help with exploration on a galactic scale, so if Raxxla is/is in an unexplored location, it's probably not helpful.

However, if Raxxla is indeed in an explored system, even a well explored one, but just far out like the voyager probes, and thus never discovered because ppl tend to not fly 2.4M ls out in random directions for no reason because it takes forever for no pay off... then this very well could be helpful if it allows faster acceleration and/or higher top speed in Supercruise, then getting places, in-system, and trying random long distance in-system searches ect, will become much easier.
Not too mention the benefits of potentially escaping Interdictions and cutting station arrival times ect...

fingers crossed it's somthing actually useful.

But what I really wanted/hoped for when they asked for those Thargoid drive parts, was a better FSD system... ability to make longer jumps without Neutron Boosts... that would seriously help with galactic exploration, but who knows if we will ever get anything like that... being able to plot more than 65ly avg jumps, would be nice while traversing the galaxy...
