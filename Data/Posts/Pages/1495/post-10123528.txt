Why do you think my carrier is named the AOE Dharmachakra? Even then, the ideas actually go back as far as Sumeria.

On a related note:
World Tree == Donar's Oak / Yggradrasil /etc

World Tree should be treated as a parallel mythology to Axis Mundi. That said, we are dealing with a really specific version of the Delphic mythology involving a connection with Dolphins - see https://www.travel.gr/en/arts-and-culture-en/zeus-eagles-to-apollo-the-dolphin-myths-of-delphi/ . This is also why it is important that Janus Incorporated (this is the ultra mysterious J-Corp from First Encounters) is a faction in Delphi. It is also why the Imperials have a presence in the Pleiades by way of Merope Expeditionary Fleet. Everything connects back through Facece and Jaques.

I suppose it may be time to give dear old Dad a visit...
