Has a focused effort been make to explore systems with F class Supergiants ? (Same Star class as Polaris) Many of the odd stars that got added to the game like Gen# +2.12450534 is F class as are many of the surrounding star. Wikipedia has a list of F Class supergiants to check, not all systems seem to be present in game (possibly different names or name variants).

Also the galaxy map does not seem to allow '#' or '&' to be entered into the galaxy search bar, but allows other symbols.
