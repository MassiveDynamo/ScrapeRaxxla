Actually, from the manual from First Encounters. There was a section detailing the major corporations and people of the era. See attached link (file too large for reasons ).

Elite First Encounters-Who's Who.pdf

This document isn't from the FFE manual. It's fan made by Graham Thurlwell and can be found on his excellent Jades' First Encounters Site: https://www.jades.org/ffe.htm

The document (and other info on the page) is very well made and accurate, but it also has elements fan fiction. Jades is his own commander and J-Corp is his role playing corporation.

If anyone wants to give FFE a play-through, I would say this page is a must read.
