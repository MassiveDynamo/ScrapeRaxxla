so some weeks ago I have been told that all the old lore from the old books and old elite games have no meaning for elite dangerous. then in this forum I read about people referring to hints about the search of raxxla related to the old lore.
for me as a new participant in this forum ,it would make things much easier if there would be finally a consensus about what's lore and what's not.
if it's really the fact, that the old elite lore hasn't any meaning to ED than I can easily skip this chapter.
sometimes I wonder if people who still point on raxxla related stuff in old books and games are doing this, because they want to believe this...please ask yourself if you are just doing this to keep up an self created illusion.
As the one who revived most of it, the blame for this lies at the feet of a community that did not want to research the old lore (notably certain mods at Canonn Science who shall remain unnamed). This is despite warnings from Salom√© of the old stories were critical to understand the present. Further, we had key pieces like Lakon Spaceways being from Sol in the Codex, generation ships largely originate from Sol, and Faulcon Delacy and Old Worlds Coalition having strong connections to Sirius Corporation that produced Hydrogen fuel. There is very little in the way of evidence to suggest otherwise. Even the various lessons from Codex entries often involve learning based on the past. The core story is after all is entirely based upon the past being rather intentionally obscured.
