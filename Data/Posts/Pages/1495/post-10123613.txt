Nothing special on it, only standard markings. I tried to short-cut it with the "recharge pistol" in illegal mode (there is a green light reminiscent of "short-cutable" panels on both ends of the barrel) and to cut it open with the plasma torch.

I bought two of them, if someone need one just tell me
