Has a focused effort been make to explore systems with F class Supergiants ? (Same Star class as Polaris) Many of the odd stars that got added to the game like Gen# +2.12450534 is F class as are many of the surrounding star. Wikipedia has a list of F Class supergiants to check, not all systems seem to be present in game (possibly different names or name variants).

Also the galaxy map does not seem to allow '#' or '&' to be entered into the galaxy search bar, but allows other symbols.
I wouldn't say the answer is a definite, yes. However, those do fall into the classification of asymptotic giant branch stars which for whatever reason seem to be particularly important. These are very weird stars between 0.5 - 8 solar masses that can go through main sequence multiple times. There has not been a dedicated effort at the very least. Though, these stars do seem to play an outsized place in key galactic events.
