Question for those who know about the Dark Wheel missions and a good memory.... Were the missions all available at once or was there an order to them? i.e. did you have to do one to be offered the next or were they all randomly available?
They were all visible on the mission boards at the time but back then accepting missions was gated by rank, so you could only accept them if you qualified.
Therefore, all the Founders (those who had backed the Kickstarter to a certain level) could have taken all three at once from day one.

The first triple Elite-ranked player got a special award (and some prize money!) for achieving it and it took him 3 months (this was starting from launch, not the gamma build).

So far as I saw, the missions all showed up randomly. It may (not 100% sure here but fairly sure) have been possible to have two or more of the same type of mission taken from the same place at once, though as the destinations were seemingly random as well, they would (very likely) be to different places.
I'm not sure if anyone ever had all three active at once - triple Elite players were few and far between in the first year of the game, when even single Elite players were rare. Due to their RNG nature, I would think that having completed all three might be enough to trigger something. Who knows what that would have been, though?
(TL;DR no order required)

(re: the stock Sidey - without doing anything, the Sidey you started with was very limited in jump range and could scarcely go the 20LY needed to get exploration data to sell. I don't remember him ever being asked the question, however.)
