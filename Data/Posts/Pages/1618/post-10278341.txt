I suppose it's easily possible The Dark Wheel (or some part of it) did find Raxxla and became the 'shadowy cabal' that uses Raxxla to 'dominate humanity' as suggested in the Codex. It's worth considering we're talking about a thousand-year old organisation of... well frankly, rogues, mercenaries, and killers.
I actually doubt that The Dark Wheel is the shadowy cabal. We know that TDW hadn't found Raxxla in 3300. This was in the guide for the authors. They could have found it later, but that would contradict Rafe Zetters words from the book: "We’ve long suspected that a corps of Elites lives there, and are exploiting the gateway". They’re powerful, twisted men."

I know the book isn't valid lore, but it's the original source of Raxxla. I doubt FD would go against it, when it's easily avoidable by using another shadowy group.
