Missions never do. It's just the mission texts that are significant. You become Elite and then a little more mysterious info is shared with you. I'm pretty sure the SAP8 data crystals were a foreshadowing of the Guardians.

There are probably only a few people, if any in the galaxy that knows the truth about Raxxla. Mission givers and passengers that mentions it, are only retelling rumours. Even the Dark Wheel seen rather clueless. They probably know something we don't, but not much.

I think the codex is a more realistic approach, than the old mission texts. Things may have changed over the years. For example the mission text frase: "A certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key", compared to the codex: 'The earliest documented stories tend to agree on several points, however: that Raxxla is a
definite place, and that it holds a mystical secret.', could be seen as contradictory. The first almost suggests a moving Raxxla, the second strongly suggests a fixed location.
