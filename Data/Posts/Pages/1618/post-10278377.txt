I actually doubt that The Dark Wheel is the shadowy cabal. We know that TDW hadn't found Raxxla in 3300. This was in the guide for the authors. They could have found it later, but that would contradict Rafe Zetters words from the book: "We’ve long suspected that a corps of Elites lives there, and are exploiting the gateway". They’re powerful, twisted men."

I know the book isn't valid lore, but it's the original source of Raxxla. I doubt FD would go against it, when it's easily avoidable by using another shadowy group.
I agree that as far as we know the Dark Wheel splintered due to the fruitless search, but... we don't actually know for sure, just considering possibilities, and FSD might have allowed the faction that continued to find Raxxla finally... who knows?

According to Fdev the books are still canon (Unless they later retracted that statement?).

Consider though: What would the Dark Wheel do with Raxxla if they wrestled it off those that control it? They're a highly secretive group of ruthless murderers, mercenaries and cut-throats... eh, I mean treasure-hunters and adventurers, I'm not sure they'd hand Raxxla to the galaxy as a philanthropic gesture I'd assume if they found it, they'd exploit it just the same as whoever controlled it before - maybe different folks would rise to the top, but... the wheel is always turning, so to speak.
