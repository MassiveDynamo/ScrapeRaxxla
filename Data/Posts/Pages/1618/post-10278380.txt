Have you searched Galnet for "cabal".. it comes up a few times
I have, there's only 7 articles that mention it in all this time. To me, it sadly doesn't look like any of the times it's mentioned are really significant, what do you think?

Edit: I asked ChatGPT how to find a secret cabal, it reminded me that by definition, a 'secret cabal' will be hard to find!
