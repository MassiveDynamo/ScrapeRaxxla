Just clearing up a few things I can see there:
Gabarit is a french term I've heard of for marking clearance or tolerance for a machine part to maintain movement.
UIC is one name for the Standard Guage for railways.
The 50? appears to be a 500 cropped out by the graphic artist blending these drawings together. Either a dimension of clear opening, or some other reference.

The "orbiting" circles are the artist's embellishment of the original hand drafted plan. Note the difference in brightness of some circles vs the rough pen/photocopy texture of the original drawing lines. I can even see where they have cropped out the plans to make way for the ED ships.
Not that I'm ruling out any relationship here, but very likely there is no hidden secret that I can see.
