I understand what you are saying but it's not quite right. If you backed at a certain level in the kickstarter you could get into Shinrarta straight away, no need to grind up to Elite. I honestly believe Raxxla was discoverable from the start.
It was an example.

P.S. At least I personally believe that Raxxla can be found without flying a Cobra Mk 4
