I suppose it's easily possible The Dark Wheel (or some part of it) did find Raxxla and became the 'shadowy cabal' that uses Raxxla to 'dominate humanity' as suggested in the Codex. It's worth considering we're talking about a thousand-year old organisation of... well frankly, rogues, mercenaries, and killers.

Maybe that's why the 'fake' Dark Wheel in Shinrarta (if it is fake as Drew claims he was told) still exists - the 'real' Dark Wheel are doing stuff on/in Raxxla so they either don't care, or can't stop the 'fake' Dark Wheel operating because they're wherever Raxxla is...?

Might be a decent explanation of how the the Dark Wheel Codex can imply the Shinrarta faction isn't fake because it still exists, yet it doesn't seem to function like the covert, small, elite Dark Wheel faction described in the rest of the Codex text?
