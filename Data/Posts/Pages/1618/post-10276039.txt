I dont think this is up for discussion, its always been the case, my mates Sister said her Dad was talking with Fdevs cleaning lady in the Golden Hind round the corner who said she read it on a post it note on Mr Braben's desk next to a packet of Jaffa Cakes.
The only contention was to whether Jaffa's are a cake or biscuit.

SPOILER: SO ITS OBVIOUSLY TRUE
