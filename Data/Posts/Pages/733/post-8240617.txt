I thought the objects were ejected into space and pointed towards the system in question to show you where it is. I think they located them this way.

So if you eject a Thargoid Sensor into space, it'll point towards the system on the left? Is that what you mean? If so that's pretty cool. Do we know what the other two objects are, and have the collective 'we' ejected these into space to verify the right system?

I'm also making an assumption that the left diagram is a single system, with 6 planets and 14 moons? Do we have the name for it, I'd like to check it out if we do. Otherwise I'll keep dredging and eject a few sensors.

To help narrow the focus somewhat, I'm trying to review just the information that's been provided by FDEV to reduce the noise. To that end, I was reviewing the Codex, and noted within the CODEX > Hub > KB > THE GUARDIANS

" To this day, many millions of years after the Guardians disappeared, Guardian artefacts are still able to recognise Thargoid technology, and Thargoid technology still reacts negatively to the presence of Guardian artefacts."

Can anyone who's tested that 'reaction' clarify what happens (if anything)?
