there is only the minor faction and the handful of missions they give out. Then there are the elite dangerous novels..which reference them at times ...these were supposed to be Canon (all previous books are not). But Fdev likes to retcon things without telling anyone at any time for any reason so who knows anymore.

there is also the "club" ...which is sometimes mentioned in the same breadth by people as the dark wheel.. but these are almost certainly separate (though some members may be part of both) groups. "The Club" being a group of influential families or cloned people who pull the strings of humanity from across the bubble to orchestrate their agenda. That agenda being the saving of the human race from extinction from alien threats.

The dark wheel is a secret organization of treasure seekers with deep pockets and likely members in high places (hence their connection to the club). When talking about the game's near recent events, we're dealing with the Club. The Dark wheel has been basically a non-entity since the game began unless you count the books ...but do that at your own peril.
