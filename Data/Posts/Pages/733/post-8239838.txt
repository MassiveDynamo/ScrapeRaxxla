And WHY do UA point to Merope and UP point to Merope5C in particular? Clearly there should be something special in/about 5C, but weâ€™ve searched and scanned it ad nauseam with no findings.

Tinfoil time: lore might suggest that 5C is a thargoid planet-sized ship that has become covered by cosmic detritus over millennia, but surely the fss should indicate that since it can indicate mineral composition and presence of human/other presence?????
Simplest explanation is that Merope is the center of the 135-150ly perimeter that the UAs marked. The message was simply 'This is our space'.
Merope 5C is the reference planet for the planet data that the UP/TP sends out. 1 radius means same radius as M5C. 1 gravity means same gravity as M5C and so on.
Make sense to point to the reference planet.

Why the goids picked that planet for reference is another question? Perhaps it was just the first one they seeded with barnacles?
