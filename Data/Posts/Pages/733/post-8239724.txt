UA/TS can long before anything else. They only do mose code (System/body name and later Ship plot + point to Merope).
Barnacles were next.
Then came the Probe with the sonogram and planet info in 8 bit binary(points to Merope 5C). The bases and links came shortly after.

All the decodable info has been solved. Only more vague questions are unanswered:

Why do the Thargoid objects have a distortion field?
What are the fireflies?

And WHY do UA point to Merope and UP point to Merope5C in particular? Clearly there should be something special in/about 5C, but weâ€™ve searched and scanned it ad nauseam with no findings.

Tinfoil time: lore might suggest that 5C is a thargoid planet-sized ship that has become covered by cosmic detritus over millennia, but surely the fss should indicate that since it can indicate mineral composition and presence of human/other presence?????
