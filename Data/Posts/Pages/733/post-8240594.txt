Do we have any idea how much is required in the way of rescue missions or goid kill vouchers to get allied with PilotsFederation? I’m doing rescue missions in Asterope, rescued almost 2000 people, and have only achieved cordial with Pilots’ Federation Local Branch according to the doctor on the rescue ship.
I believe "PilotsFederation" is a different entity, that exists for purposes of receiving combat bonds from anti-xeno combat. Allied status should be attainable for something between 4-8 million credits, that is a couple of flowerships. There is also a curious decay mechanic, I remember receiving messages for several days in row at one time. I'm not sure how rescue missions work, I believe I have been forbidden from rescue operations after delivering said passengers to alien signal sources instead of rescue megaships, and causing some heart-attacks upon being analyzed by alien vessels. Those events had scientific value, if lacking in humanitarian effort.

Anyway, I have been too busy to attend such matters lately, as I have been studying mythologies of the ancient Hellenistic world further, lately various Rabbinistic segments and non-Orthodox denominations. One curious sect, called Ichthyses, followers of a way (star?), a king, or the anointed (ܡܫܝܚܐ, omphalos?) has caught my interest especially. It is all very confusing though, I believe I may have to study ancient Aramaic and Hebrew languages to make sense of these things.
