UA/TS can long before anything else. They only do mose code (System/body name and later Ship plot + point to Merope).
Barnacles were next.
Then came the Probe with the sonogram and planet info in 8 bit binary(points to Merope 5C). The bases and links came shortly after.

All the decodable info has been solved. Only more vague questions are unanswered:

Why do the Thargoid objects have a distortion field?
What are the fireflies?

Have all the systems in the blueprint like map with the 4 systems been found?

I'm really really sure the thargoid map is half of the galaxy arms with only certain stars present. They are all white/blue/yellow and I think they are the cloud dots you see when using map and turning everything off. I be tyou could align the map by turning only those on and finding stars in the map that make rare formation where there are less stars on the map etc. No idea what that would do though. There is a realy bright star on that tharg map near the center though. It's around the outside of the galactic core and really sticks out.
