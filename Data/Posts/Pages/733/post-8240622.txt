Random "weird idea of the day" (I'm exploring again, so disregard if I'm writing nonsense after letting my mind wander )

I was thinking about our Speed Limit. 2001c , an obvious homage to "2001 - A Space Odyssey"...
Pondering about lore - I also remembered that AI has been banned in the ELITE Universe. HAL9000 anyone?

The reason I kept pondering about it was the sentence "[...]you have to make it a tiny bit obvious".
To me, such details are "a tiny bit obvious".

Another key factor to me is : the Stanley Kubrick movie 2001 - A Space Odyssey has been dissected and analyzed/documented probably like no other SciFi Movie in history.
Thus.... plenty of material to derive hints from, IF there's any merit to that theory.
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_2001:_A_Space_Odyssey )

PS.
My original thought revolved around the Dark Wheel Station.
I went like... if someone at FDev is a Roland Emmerich fan, it could be around a "Moon 44"
( 4 + 4 = 8 for what it's worth xD )
