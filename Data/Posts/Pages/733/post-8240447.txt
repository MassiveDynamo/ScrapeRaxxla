Can someone clear up a question I have about what FD have or have not said regarding RAXXLA/Dark Wheel.
My understanding is FD said no clues in game for Raxxla but there is a little of something to vaguely in game get us on the right track whatever that may be?
But have they ever said anything regarding the Dark Wheel?
Is there a game mechanic in game that leads to the Dark wheel based on what the Codex says that FD acknowledge works as tested?
If a game mechanic was in game would FD not at least have confirmed by now that it at least works after all this time. I would have thought they would of commented on that by now and the silence makes me think that no such mechanic exist for the dark wheel to get in touch with a commander.
Locked systems surely cannot be part of this search for Raxxla, mysterious as they are otherwise FD would surely have commented that the hunt is not possible to complete.
FD said that Raxxla has been in game from the start but have FD be altering the Dark Wheel/Raxxla over time keeping it away from CMDRs discovering it?
Or has Raxxla evolved with cannon over time maybe starting of as a moon or something then altered to a Alien base or Artifact as the game evolved.
I don't want clues from FD but I sure would like to know their game is working as intended if a game mechanic is required as their track record on such things is not great.
