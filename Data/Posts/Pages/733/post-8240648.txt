Well now I'm confused... who's side do I take?!

I was doing some more of my Operation Less Than Three missions for TDW > NUENETS (V886 CENTAURI FUTURE) and receive a follow-on mission to assassinate a pirate from TDW from the very group I just delivered too?!



(and I also received a new tip off mission for HIP 1742 B5a).

I think I'll take the mission to kill the pirate to see if my rep declines for TDW in SD since I've never received an assassination mission against TDW before.

Edited: Took the mission, killed the pirate, TDW faction declined in LFT 926 and I lost a bit of rep. When I got back to SD, I noted that I was no longer 'Legendary' with TDW faction broker offering missions. Wish I had taken a prior screen shot, but after ranking back up to >100% allied this is all I get... I'll have to keep plugging away to see if I get back that Legendary comment.
