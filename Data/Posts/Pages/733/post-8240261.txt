And WHY do UA point to Merope and UP point to Merope5C in particular? Clearly there should be something special in/about 5C, but weâ€™ve searched and scanned it ad nauseam with no findings.

Tinfoil time: lore might suggest that 5C is a thargoid planet-sized ship that has become covered by cosmic detritus over millennia, but surely the fss should indicate that since it can indicate mineral composition and presence of human/other presence?????
This is one of those mysteries i would like to know. I would really like it to have more meaning than just a way for the playerbase to find the barnacles.... And it seemed at the time that there was something we were supposed to find or realize... but it didnt happen... so who knows. Its probably broken now...

I was hoping for another sphere around the witch head nebula but didnt see one. Anyone else look?
