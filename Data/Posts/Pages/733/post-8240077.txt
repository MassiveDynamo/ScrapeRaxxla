Simplest explanation is that Merope is the center of the 135-150ly perimeter that the UAs marked. The message was simply 'This is our space'.
Merope 5C is the reference planet for the planet data that the UP/TP sends out. 1 radius means same radius as M5C. 1 gravity means same gravity as M5C and so on.
Make sense to point to the reference planet.

Why the goids picked that planet for reference is another question? Perhaps it was just the first one they seeded with barnacles?

Possible, but then I’d expect a UA perimeter around every planet having barnacles. And if it was a border marker for goid space I’d expect them along the border of Col70 etc, while the morse code reporting of local system space wouldn’t make sense. Don’t think either of these hypotheses is true, hence I think the reason is something else. There seems to be something special about Merope5c, almost as though the UAs were sent out to detect (coarse location) something that had been lost, while reporting their position and any passing ship traffic (i.e. detecting borders of any alien species they encountered) then pointed towards the general region of the lost object, while the UP did the fine location and pointed specifically at 5c....the pictogram then seems to be relevant to the lost/found object (5c) and the distance to their homeworld (presumably). This all seems to be consistent with the behaviour of goids searching for something significant they lost in the distant past and want to relocate.


Do we have any idea how much is required in the way of rescue missions or goid kill vouchers to get allied with PilotsFederation? I’m doing rescue missions in Asterope, rescued almost 2000 people, and have only achieved cordial with Pilots’ Federation Local Branch according to the doctor on the rescue ship.
