I look forward with anticipation to seeing your pictures and videos of Raxxla!
First we have to see how activate it. There are three highly suspect installations in Sol. Otherwise, I would expect we may have to complete missions through Mother Gaia to get somewhere. The bigger question is whether or not they modified the game mechanics with each major update as new stuff was added. I would though start thinking of space-based trigger events.
