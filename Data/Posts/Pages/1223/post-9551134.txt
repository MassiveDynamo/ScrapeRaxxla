One for the tin foil hats (TDW)
I just stumbled across a book, from 1939, called The Dark Wheel, a "time travel novel, with religious overtones". I'm half tempted to grab it, I'm also half asleep, so I'll think about that some more once I'm fully awake.

Has anyone seen this. This guy found a book called the dark wheel with a 6 pointed symbol.
