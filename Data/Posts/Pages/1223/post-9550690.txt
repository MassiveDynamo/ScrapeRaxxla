We know penelope is a system name. Is her other names like Devereux.
This might be the most obvious lead.

If there is more than one star with each so called person in the story maybe the form a shape or something to give clues. Do we know all of the systems related to the real life author. This seems like something much simpler and realistic for the game devs to implement. We maybe missing the obvious by overcomplicating it. This may be a simpler path. At least to start with.

Phillip Sidney. Aren't these both system names and or NPC's?
I have checked the names again...
No Phillip
No Phillip Sydney
No Penelope
No Isabella
