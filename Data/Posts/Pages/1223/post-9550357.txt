Primary Transportation Authority near Persephone -- I think this might be the "on" switch once we fix the building mistake in Sol with the Talmor Lens

Chamberlain Foundation -- seem to be related to guy who ran NASA's Lunar Science Institute (see https://history.aip.org/phn/11503003.html) - maybe this is the access to the Moon. If you look at the lore, there is a consistent emphasis on mother goddesses. These are often symbolized by the Moon.

Delphi Control Chapter -- perhaps AEGIS has more reason to be Sol that we've been told. Look up "Delphi" on INARA. There is network of these damn things and I don't think that is a coincidence, either.

Conjoint Mathemathics Services .. possibly the beginning of the trail.

Awesome, thanks for that. Currently taking a step back at what has and hasn't been done and attempting to focus all this into what is a 'tiny bit obvious'. I'll be sure to report back here soon. For what it's worth!

The other big question is have the game mechanics for triggering it evolved as the game evolved. That is not something I can say I know but I am going to start plugging away at possible triggers to see if we can open new doors. The Moon is important. I think it is being held off as a reward for figuring this whole thing out. Also, I'd love to know how and why Triton fits into all this.
These certainly are interesting questions. However, I didn't know the moon was permit locked - though I knew Triton was. I'll check next time I am in-game, I happen to be in Sol ATM anyway.

Without a doubt, I sincerely hope that that at some point someone figures out access to Triton, Polaris or any of the other perma-locked systems... They will definitely become legends in Elite!
