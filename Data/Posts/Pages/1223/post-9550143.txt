First we have to see how activate it. There are three highly suspect installations in Sol. Otherwise, I would expect we may have to complete missions through Mother Gaia to get somewhere. The bigger question is whether or not they modified the game mechanics with each major update as new stuff was added. I would though start thinking of space-based trigger events.
I'm interested to know, what the 'highly suspect installations' are in Sol? Old lurker re-lurking so might have missed some important information...
