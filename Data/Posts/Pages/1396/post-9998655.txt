A comparison of 'Elite: The Dark Wheel, by Robert Holdstock' with in-game Lore.
Presented here is my own comparisons. I like to go and check these things myself, so this will have been done before, if there are similarities then that's good
I put this together because of Allen's comment here, got me thinking about the Codex "Princess Astrophel..." line, I always assumed that was a warning to steer away from TDW novella, so I thought I'd check the source text. I was honestly very surprised - especially with further matches to the Codex.

Note: In the following quotes I've coloured words/lines that are an exact, close or very similar match.
"TDW 194" means 'Elite: The Dark Wheel, by Robert Holdstock'

SPOILER: FARAWAY JUMP




SPOILER: WITCH-SPACE, TUNNEL



SPOILER: WITCH-SPACE GHOSTS






SPOILER: "THINGS" IN WITCH-SPACE

















SPOILER: TRANSIT TIMES



SPOILER: HYPERSPACE MIS-JUMPS







SPOILER: RAXXLA IS A REAL PLACE



SPOILER: RAXXLA ALIEN CONSTRUCT



SPOILER: RAXXLA ALREADY DISCOVERED



SPOILER: DARK WHEEL QUEST FOR RAXXLA





SPOILER: MEMBERS TRAINING THEIR CHILDREN















Conclusion:
While I would be extremely cautious mining the works of Holdstock for clues, it certainly seems apparent that the lore around Raxxla, The Dark Wheel, and Hyperspace is dervied - at least in part - from "Elite: The Dark Wheel, by Robert Holdstock". I am surprised by the use of like-for-like lines in many cases.
