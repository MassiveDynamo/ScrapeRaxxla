Just a quick note for people involved, as I've had a couple of queries.

Please don't ask me to be your messenger to Frontier. I haven't worked on Elite Dangerous for a very long time and have no special contacts with the current design and development team. I'm only reading the discussion to help and stay a little involved with the game - warming my hands by the fire of your enthusiasm.

Any queries or suggestions about the game should go through the publicly available contact channels, not through me.
