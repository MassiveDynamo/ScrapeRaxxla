@Suhurrat : I am currently checking out potential gravitational wave candidates and have visited Vela Pulsar, Crab Pulsar and LGM-1 pulsars, and a number of others, in the last couple of weeks. I searched their systems, including a check for invisible “comets” but found nothing. Currently on the way to check another pulsar, only another 250 jumps or so to go!
