I understand. But it's the same pattern of lights, only appearing different because of the super structure in front of them. It's actually just a very simple copy/paste asset but I suspect the art guys thought "Nobody's going to look that closely."

Second account was in a Sol station the other day and I was struck, not for the first time, by the appearance of the interior. It had a set of “pools” linked together in a design which seemed to resemble crop circles. It did briefly occur to me that might be a clue, but then sanity reasserted.
