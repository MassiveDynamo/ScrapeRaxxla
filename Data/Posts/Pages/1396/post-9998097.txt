Sadly alot of Brabens desire for the game to be a stepping stone for people to learn basic science skills they could use to uncover the big mysteries was never realised by the masses.
Imagine if the people who thought they decoded all the Thargoid symbols because they could recognise the Cymatic image in the middle had realised the dashes, arches and 'nothing' they discarded because they didn't recognise them weren't nothing at all but were in fact something (The Pair of interlinked Arches being indicative of 2D representation of Magnetic Field points on a Spherical object similar to how 2D representations of Sunspots magnetic fields are shown. So much information cleverly encoded into things because of sheer genius on the creators part sadly not seen for the sheer level of detail that went into them)
All the sayings of the toast being scientific, geometry and other Gems of information/instructions... The bigger question isnt what is it but really how many can occur at once!.

Yes. Because Science.

The problem is that this is a video game and they provide next to no information on what is a clue to something more and what is just a random effect or texture put into the game. Even with the information they do put into the game, most of it is just random fluff and doesn’t lead anywhere even though in real life it clearly could be investigated further but in this case game mechanics do not allow it.

I don’t blame players for not wasting their time on what would end up being a disappointing wild goose chase.
