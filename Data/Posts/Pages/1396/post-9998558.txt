@Suhurrat : I am currently checking out potential gravitational wave candidates and have visited Vela Pulsar, Crab Pulsar and LGM-1 pulsars, and a number of others, in the last couple of weeks. I searched their systems, including a check for invisible “comets” but found nothing. Currently on the way to check another pulsar, only another 250 jumps or so to go!
My theory is that, most likely, as developments for the elite, all available material was involved. Accordingly, we can roughly assume the location of certain objects. The fact that the siren in the depths is an 80% chance pulsar. Perhaps there should be something near the pulsar or in the system. But do not exclude black holes. Because in a system with a black hole, there may be third-party objects, including pulsars, although holes emit waves. In other words, it is worth looking at the central star and then at the filling of the system. In any case, at the moment that the targoids that the guardians, at least all and the main points next to sol.
