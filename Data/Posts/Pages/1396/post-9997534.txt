For assistance.

In all the discussions I had about the guide material, David Braben never once referred to anything related to Robert Holdstock's DW story. The only references to it in any of those discussions were from Michael Brookes, Me, or T James.
Sadly alot of Brabens desire for the game to be a stepping stone for people to learn basic science skills they could use to uncover the big mysteries was never realised by the masses.
Imagine if the people who thought they decoded all the Thargoid symbols because they could recognise the Cymatic image in the middle had realised the dashes, arches and 'nothing' they discarded because they didn't recognise them weren't nothing at all but were in fact something (The Pair of interlinked Arches being indicative of 2D representation of Magnetic Field points on a Spherical object similar to how 2D representations of Sunspots magnetic fields are shown. So much information cleverly encoded into things because of sheer genius on the creators part sadly not seen for the sheer level of detail that went into them)
All the sayings of the toast being scientific, geometry and other Gems of information/instructions... The bigger question isnt what is it but really how many can occur at once!.

Question: Is the green of the Raxxla logo important, do you all think?
Yes. Because Science.
