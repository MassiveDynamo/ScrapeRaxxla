hate to double post, but i'm curious if anyone finds these images significant. for clarity this time around, this is a top down picture of a Guardian Beacon. again, i have a strong feeling this has already been noticed, so i am curious if this end has been followed in the past. i dont have any explanations or theories yet, but i'd like to know if others think this is a good tree to bark up.

i'm sure this has to have been pointed out a million times already, but this is the first i've noticed... it sure is pretty convincing
