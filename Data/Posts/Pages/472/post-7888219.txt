Wasn't there that system around Heart and Soul nebulae that would act jumpy and disappear in galactic map? It was long time ago but I saw it myself too back then. I suppose it was later accepted to be a bug and fixed.

It used to be that Heart and/or Soul would disappear from the skybox. That caused a bit of excitement!
