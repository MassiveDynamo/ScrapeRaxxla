Here you go. I'm not sure this illuminates anything new, but it looks cool.

SPOILER
When I look at this I see the central three arcs and the outermost blocks rotating left but the dashed line seems to be rotating in the other direction and each dash seems to have a 'hat'. Interesting visual effect, though I'm not sure what to make of it.

The Mayflower 97 would be about 725 LY from Sol in 3305, depending on whether or not it slowed down to send people to Tau Ceti. Draw a line from Sol through Tau Ceti and extend it until it's 725 LY long and where does it wind up?
