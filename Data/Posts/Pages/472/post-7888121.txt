Raxxla Quest progress report

It has been argued in this thread that, since Heart & Soul nebulae were an important part of the Formidine Rift mystery they could not also be related to the Raxxla mystery, since that would put the two biggest mysteries of the game in the same place & surely FD wouldnâ€™t do that? That argument makes a lot of sense, however I wondered if such overlap might actually be part of the obfuscation surrounding Raxxla?

The Exodus Base crashes were repeatable.
A one-off crash that isn't repeatable is probably just a one-off crash.
Sorry.
