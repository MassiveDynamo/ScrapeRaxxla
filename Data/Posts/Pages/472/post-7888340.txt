Raxxla Quest progress report

It has been argued in this thread that, since Heart & Soul nebulae were an important part of the Formidine Rift mystery they could not also be related to the Raxxla mystery, since that would put the two biggest mysteries of the game in the same place & surely FD wouldnâ€™t do that? That argument makes a lot of sense, however I wondered if such overlap might actually be part of the obfuscation surrounding Raxxla?

The tower of stars or white blue thing you experienced just before jumping happens to me somewhat regularly. I've always attributed it to a performance hit of some kind. I see it on both PC and XBox.

Props for the search, though.
