Draw a line from Sol through Tau Ceti and extend it until it's 725 LY long and where does it wind up?

At first I tried the math approach, bookmarked the result and took a bearing from Sol through Tau Ceti.
The bookmarked system, although ~725LY away, was not on the Sol-TC line.
I never was that good at maths and decided to try a different approach - to solve the problem with Blender.
Created the line, elongated it to 725ly and checked the coordinates.
The result left me confuzzled... Blender confirmed the coordinates from my math approach!?
After a short moment of wondering whether I just have a 'kink in my optics', I decided to check coordinates again.
Turned out that they were wrong... instead of x: -0,375 I used -3,75 for Tau Ceti .
Just copy & pasted them from EDSM and had to correct the decimal sign, which I obviously did sloppy, omg.

So lets hope the coordinates are correct now:

-22,77 / -692,76 / -212,57

Nearby systems are:

Synuefe FQ-J B39-0
HIP 8178

I will take a look around as I need some more donation credits anyhow
