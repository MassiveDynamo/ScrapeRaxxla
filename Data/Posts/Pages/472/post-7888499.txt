hate to double post, but i'm curious if anyone finds these images significant. for clarity this time around, this is a top down picture of a Guardian Beacon. again, i have a strong feeling this has already been noticed, so i am curious if this end has been followed in the past. i dont have any explanations or theories yet, but i'd like to know if others think this is a good tree to bark up.
I think that they are visually similar...but I wouldn't put much effort into it. The Guardian Beacons bug me anyhow...they're a bit too "hand wavey" for me. Besides, the Guardians have been "extinct" long before Raxxla was ever a thing.
