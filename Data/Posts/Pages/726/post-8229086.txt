Shame on you! BAD Goblin!

I'm sorry! I tried! But I kept losing track of what where my idea's, and what where just re-hashes of things I'd read, so I gave up and decided to just run with it and see what I came up with!

Brace yourselves, this goes loooooong!

SPOILER: OH MY, BUT THAT IS A LOT OF TINFOIL!
























































































































































































If you read all this - thanks for sticking with it, hope it wasn't a total waste of your time!

Bonus tinfoil:



Am I the only one that sees the Raxxla symbol every time they're in the docking bay...?

PS: It's late, I'm tired, and I should be in bed, so if there's a million typo's, run-on sentences that make no sense, etc, my apologies, I'll try and catch 'em all over time!

PPS: If I suddenly disappear, you know I'm on to something, and the Dark Wheel done disappeared me!
