The “clues” they gave us in Codex are mythology based lol idk what the fuss with pursuing those threads is...

ompholous stone , Delphi, worth the investigation,

but Delphi was the“center” of earth we should be looking at the center of the galaxy , which I don’t think TRUE center is Sag.A (I tried going by the limits of our galaxy map and did determine a center point but it’s kinda rough based on the map edges technically being infinite, would have investigated what I found but it was still 24,000 lys out so wasn’t ready for that jaunt

also stumbled upon “axis mundi”was real excited when I found an unpopulated star system litterally called Axis Mundi but had a pair of stars and degrade emmisions :/

But this is all based of the Ompholus Stone theory. Just felt like the only “concrete” clue to pursue..

I don’t believe in the dark wheel toast anymore because the more I thought about it and others have mentioned...they are in pursuit of Raxxla...why would they know exactly where to find it?

also wondering how it’s even findable, if it’s a super legendary planet or tech or whatever it is, why would it just be a stone throws away, why wouldn’t that be so far removed where no one could find it or use it...

but that’s semi going off the “it was moved” / “evil peeps are exploiting it”

TLDR: I’m back at square one, I know nothing.
