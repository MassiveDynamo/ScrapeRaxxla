The only void-secrets wonderment thread still active is the one with the least amount of data behind it. Thargoids and Guardians forums are on life support, but this one is kickin' strong. What a paradox.

For what its worth, I think there is mileage yet left in Thargoid and Guardian related activities/investigations - i don't know what form that might take, or I'd be doing it already

Though some may have converted to the dark mythological side

I think a certain amount of that is inevitable, given that the Mythologies of Ancient Earth are literally written in the stars we now navigate between.

Some of it even features in the idea's about Raxxla I am incubating*, but in a way that makes sense, I hope - we'll see!

*as for my idea's about Raxxla and/or the finding of, they're not quite there yet - need a little bit more wrangling into shape before I share - though the most probable outcome is that I've duplicated and/or conflated things that have already been considered! I must confess I have not absorbed all 733 pages of this thread!
