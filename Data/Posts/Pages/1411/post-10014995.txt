Thats right mate, I was at a system i went to for "A Jewell that burns ect ect." and i saw when i rotated the gal map 2 more stars appeared next to it, ignored it and move on "DOH" it will come to me when I'm back in game.
Its the trigger conditions that i believe in, hence a few days ago I added an unplotted jump to my list of things i was trying in systems.
The thought was if you can target it manually maybe if trigger a was hit the unplotted jump would do something else.
Maelstrom is a burning Jewel ;-) Caustic burns.
