Well due to there being a (absolutely amazingly cool) terrible war against the aliens on, I'm going to be busy helping to war effort for the foreseeable future I'm sure the next few months / years will potentially yield more things that might be Raxxla clues too - particularly if the Raxxla story is, as I suspect, wrapped up with the Thargoids anyway.

I assume that if Raxxla/Omphalos Rift is in the bubble and it's - for example - being protected by some shadowy cabal - they'll probably want to protect it from Thargoids, so keep your eyes open. Particularly if a faction starts a CG to heavily defend a system, probably worth paying attention to what's in that system.
