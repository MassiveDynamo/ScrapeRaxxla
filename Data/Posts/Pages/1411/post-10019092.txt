tbh unless there are more guardian or Thargoid specific and possibly useful plants, I think it is more about 2 things
1 is make it more rewarding to do, everything in Odyssey except mining and various missions(Horizons style) pays pennies. biology is far more painful to do IMO
2 they tried to make it clear we have things to find. probably not a plant. but you never know. bugs, plants, robots, glowy things, spiders, snakes, devices we wish we had, etc...
