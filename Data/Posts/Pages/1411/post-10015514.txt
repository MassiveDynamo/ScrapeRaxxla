Thats right mate, I was at a system i went to for "A Jewell that burns ect ect." and i saw when i rotated the gal map 2 more stars appeared next to it, ignored it and move on "DOH" it will come to me when I'm back in game.
Its the trigger conditions that i believe in, hence a few days ago I added an unplotted jump to my list of things i was trying in systems.
The thought was if you can target it manually maybe if trigger a was hit the unplotted jump would do something else.

If you run EDDiscovery it shows the history of your jumps, transactions etc etc since the journal file was introduced into the game. I recommend it. It has just been revised for Uodate 14.
