The are currently 5 goid maelstrom’s as of *08/12/2022; as I understand the current situation, of which there are to be 8 planned, I was not interested in their origin points, but their destinations.

We know from FD the craft inside each are ‘looking for something’. It’s up to players to either observe or interact (combat).

If we plot their destinations in relation to each other, do these tell us anything, do they correlate to each other or something else - to which we could rule them out of the quest?

I’m still operating upon the assumption they are not, as Thargoids are octagonal and the Raxxla logo is hexagonal. But any information is good information, especially if one can confirm its relevance.

Key findings:

HIP 20567 - Indra
Coordinates: -2.8125 / -63.8125 / -162.4375
HIP 8887 - Lia Gong
Coordinates: -66.4375 / -144.40625 / -106.28125
Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 - Taranis
Coordinates: 88.4375 / -74.90625 / -12
Oya - Cephei Sector BV-Y b4
Coordinates: -97.8125 / 44.3125 / -83.84375
Cocijo - Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18
Coordinates: 157.28125 / 14.96875 / -103.875

Indra, the Hindu deity an Indo-European cousin of the German Wotan, Norse Odin, Greek Zeus, and Roman Jupiter, gods of thunder.

Lei Gong is the Chinese deity of thunder.

Taranis is a the Celtic deity of thunder.

Oya is a Latin American deity of Storms, wind, thunder, lightning, and the dead.

Cocijo is a Columbia deity associated with rain, thunder and lightning.

Assessment: Currently these maelstroms are all linked via the naming use of a god attributed to ‘Thunder’ (discounting the obvious Thargoid link).

Nothing definitive can be concluded at present but I will keep track of these, and see if the additional maelstrom’s identify any correlation.

Interesting.
