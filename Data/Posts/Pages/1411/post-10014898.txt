I will revert back to one of my first posts here.

I get the feeling that over the years we have taken this and are massively over thinking it lol
Yep! lol.

My path is based on points A - F and i have not found A yet,
That being said, one of the videos you linked on a system being 34km away and being able to jump to it. I have seen that before and dismissed it. as a glitch for multiple stars in the same system. but the system only had one star.
I am now clawing my mind to find where i was, but i went there from a theory regarding Raxxla and the first line .
Martha's Pulsar does that.

Not the same system you mean though. Same effect though isn't it? You can hyperspace jump between two systems that occupy the same space.

I think it's a good demonstration of the fact that hyperspace jumps can be used to hide stuff really easily because it's all baked into the game engine.

So, personally, I think really what we're looking for is a set of 'trigger conditions' and once met, we'll just hyperspace jump to Raxxla. That's something we know can be done in the game engine and we know that same system works for Hyperdictions. My assumption is that's what all the clues are, they are pointing us to A) Hyperspace, and b) a set of trigger conditions.

Recently I had hoped that by doing a really simply 'top level' reading of the Raxxla Codex I might be able to find the trigger conditions, but that just led me to Delphi (as it has so many people!) and I'm not sure what could be next, so... dead end lol.
