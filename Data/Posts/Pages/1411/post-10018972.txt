yes, I read a bit more into what fdev hinted at than what I am seeing so far.

there are the caustic generators or as I call them thorngoids
they do seem to follow you, surround you.
leave you alone if you are polite....
many other regulars in the Maelstrom too, most of the time seem just like Odyssey foot soldiers, confused, lost and not sure what to do...

sadly this part shows very well on foot. watching an ally you are meant to kill, walk back and forth looking for the enemy which is you, a green colored ally.
at times they vibrate from short movements

I am seeing much of this in the regular Thargoids inside the cloud.
they only actually bother me if I shoot the thorngoids.

if does fit what fdev said, but its a veggie, its a perimeter mine launcher with ai(maybe)
really hard to get close unless they do the getting close. otherwise they go boom a lot.
the regulars are constantly going up to them and scanning them.
if a thorngoid launches its corrosives at something, another regular shows up to stay by its side till it feels better, it seems.
some die, some just curl up till they feel better(I guess).

I am only interested in getting to the center, so its mostly peaceful
all I can say so far about it is, its really fast.
seems like it and its thorny friends don't want me any closer than 7km, so far.
it is very turbulent and very corrosive the closer you get.
not used to that kind of turbulence..I don't have an anchor for my ship ??? hmmm

But, I also don't think whatever it is isn't wanting anything from me.
time will tell.

I bet the Orthrus is a better bet..or one we have yet to find.
