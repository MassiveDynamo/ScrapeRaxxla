yes, 6 armed jack shaped
I think it only propels from 1 arm, not sure on that yet but as long as I have watched one I have only seen it propel from 1, the same over and over.
they are just like jacks..the kids tiny toy jacks..
they change color and flash rate of the lights along the arms and a huge bundle in the center according to excitement level..
pretty sure some of the white is shards and corrosive mechanism.
space porcupine.

SPOILER

turns out they can propel from any arm.
