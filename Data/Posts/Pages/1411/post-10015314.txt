Just remember that Pulsars are only pulsars, when seen from earth. Most neutron stars have the pairs of rotating energy beams. Only those that rotate in a plane that intersects earth, will be observed as pulsars. In a different system, the list of pulsars would be different.

Also Cygni X-3 is probably unreachable, even by fleet carrier. The data in EDSM has been submitted by someone during a beta. They were manually placed there, by devs.
Cygni X-3 looks explored: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...-space-exploration-cygni-x-3-revealed.545566/

Would look nice on a bucket list.
