SPOILER


This makes me think of the Jewel Box star cluster (NGC 4755). It has an A-shaped asterism where the star at the tip is HR 4887 (not a very interesting system from EDSM).
.
As with the Formidine Rift mystery, even working out what is and is not a clue feels like a formidable task in itself. (Speaking of which, I don't have the Zurara or Teorge logs in my Knowledge Base in beta, so I wonder how much else is either missing or being held back).
