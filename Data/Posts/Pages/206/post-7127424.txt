The first paragraph of the Raxxla entry in the Codex reads like one of the treasure hunt CGs. I'd wait until release before looking for anything or trying too hard to infer a meaning, not least because wordings etc. might change.
.
There is also a mention of something later on in the Raxxla Codex (to avoid spoilers I'll just use the initials O.R.) where the O. is also mentioned in the Codex entry for something else (should have screenshotted it, forget whether it was The Dark Wheel or one of the Corporations, maybe Wreaken). Again, I want to wait until release because there is too much placeholder stuff in general and everything is subject to change.
.
I don't have much confidence in my ability to make any sense of this, just as I know there's no way I'd have solved the Rift mysteries (where Drew pretty much had to wave a flag and shout 'over here' for them to get solved in time). All I feel that I'll be able to do is keep an eye out for any beacons or listening posts and see what Codex entries I get. Putting something in the Codex requires you to scan it somehow, with a discovery scanner or the new Short Range Composition Scanner, so there must be something, somewhere, that needs to be visited.
