Operation Less Than Three is progressing: benevolent missions have gone to 23 systems, 49 factions, in which I have 36 Allied, 6 friendly, 4 cordial, 2 neutral and 1 unfriendly relationships.

And only lost one Federal Corvette.

LTT 5212, Gnowee & LP 908-11 seems to be high on the faction favorite list for TDW.

LTT 5212 has 5 factions, and 4 factions for the last 2 system were benevolent missions have been sent.

Hey Macros,

I don't have the in-game time to be able to assist materially with verifying 'Operation Less Than Three' personally, however I have been keeping a rolling list of factions that The Dark Wheel has missions for/against for a while now to see if I can collate any data points that might help narrow the focus a bit.

I'm trying to verify if there are a select few factions that remain on their constantly 'active' mission listing so I can focus on these myself.

I thought it might help you out a bit as I started this before your first posting about OL3.
