Operation Less Than Three is progressing: benevolent missions have gone to 23 systems, 49 factions, in which I have 36 Allied, 6 friendly, 4 cordial, 2 neutral and 1 unfriendly relationships.

And only lost one Federal Corvette.

LTT 5212, Gnowee & LP 908-11 seems to be high on the faction favorite list for TDW.

LTT 5212 has 5 factions, and 4 factions for the last 2 system were benevolent missions have been sent.
