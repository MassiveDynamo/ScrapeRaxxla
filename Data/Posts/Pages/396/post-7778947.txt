How could I repeat what you see?
I was flying from SD to Delphi, I’d have to look at my video to see which system jump produced it. But I decided there could be clues in the hyperspace jumps and began taking a recording and then went back and watched it frame by frame. Saw that.

It doesn’t break any of the parameters stated so far. It’s in the game. It was at launch. It’s a gateway to somewhere/something. It’s a place that’s not a place. And the whole TDW toast can be interpreted as no matter where you go, you see it. I think Raxxla is in witch space. That picture looks like a planet up against the boundary of the witch space tunnel. It almost even looks like there is an opening in the darkness to the right of the sphere. As if it’s an opening to normal space dimension with the darkness pouring out. They’ve said it’s going to be slightly obvious so I don’t see it being hidden behind SO much math puzzles.

I’ll get the systems I was jumping between on here ASAP. Although I couldn’t replicate this exactly.
