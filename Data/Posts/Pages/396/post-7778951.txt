Impossible to see what you saw. You need to highlight and point out what you saw. The quality is really bad, sorry to say.
Then again, it's currently impossible (due to mechanics) to escape a in progress jump. So I doubt any of objects, 'stars', gas-clouds, nebulas, or whatever you see there is a representation if anything ingame.
If you've explored out there in the void you may have noticed that the sequence bears no resemblance to where you are.
The jump-sequence is a 'transition loading screen' put in place while the next system and it's data is loaded.
You can clearly see a dark sphere on the very right side, center height. Sadly the console video capture kills the quality. Here is what I’m talking about zoomed in and brightened up a bit. It’s not crazy to say it looks like a dark planet or moon. With an opening in space to its right. Could even argue it looks like light is coming in through the opening and hitting the sphere.
