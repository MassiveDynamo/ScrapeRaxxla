I literally posted a screenshot of what appears to be a dark planet in witch space and no one acknowledged it. Beginning to doubt the productivity of this forum lol.
Impossible to see what you saw. You need to highlight and point out what you saw. The quality is really bad, sorry to say.
Then again, it's currently impossible (due to mechanics) to escape a in progress jump. So I doubt any of objects, 'stars', gas-clouds, nebulas, or whatever you see there is a representation if anything ingame.
If you've explored out there in the void you may have noticed that the sequence bears no resemblance to where you are.
The jump-sequence is a 'transition loading screen' put in place while the next system and it's data is loaded.
