To be perfectly honest with you i was doing a little fishing hoping to get a rise out of one of the Devs so maybe they might throw us a crumb or two. I don't know if Raxxla is real or even what it is i just know i'm tired of following this lead and that theory and it not bearing fruit, i wasn't trying to put people off looking for it for without those people we'd never find anything and i'll never truly give up either until it's found or Fdev tell us it was never in game.
It was a poor attempt at humour on my part. However, unlike the examples I gave, which as far as I'm concerned don't exist, I think there is a good chance Raxxla does.
