You can clearly see a dark sphere on the very right side, center height. Sadly the console video capture kills the quality. Here is what I’m talking about zoomed in and brightened up a bit. It’s not crazy to say it looks like a dark planet or moon. With an opening in space to its right. Could even argue it looks like light is coming in through the opening and hitting the sphere.
Well, the sound graph (lower right) looks pretty "agitated". If no other transitions have that dark blob, I'd check all the systems in-between those two.
