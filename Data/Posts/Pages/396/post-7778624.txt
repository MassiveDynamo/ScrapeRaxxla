You're being a bit defeatist. What about all the people looking for things like the Yeti, Atlantis, Noah's Ark, King Solomon's Mines, the Holy Grail, Bigfoot, the list goes on. They have been searching for decades, centuries even. And they are looking for all these things on ONE PLANET!
Don't count on finding Raxxla anytime soon.
To be perfectly honest with you i was doing a little fishing hoping to get a rise out of one of the Devs so maybe they might throw us a crumb or two. I don't know if Raxxla is real or even what it is i just know i'm tired of following this lead and that theory and it not bearing fruit, i wasn't trying to put people off looking for it for without those people we'd never find anything and i'll never truly give up either until it's found or Fdev tell us it was never in game.
