Just noticed something funny in the list of original game systems. No systems start with F,H,J,K,N,P,W,Y.(8 letters) Those are numbers 6,8,10,11,14,16,23,25.(adds to 113, a prime.) That is only 18 letters of the alphabet. Does this have to do with 8-bit games. Maybe two 8-bits with an extra bit each.

Maybe the lost 9th galaxy consists of all the systems with those letters as the start! 8p

BTW, got alt tabbing up minimally. I should finish with the checklist of systems for the last 4 galaxies if nothing else gets in the way.
