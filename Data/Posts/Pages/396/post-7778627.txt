Operation Less Than Three is progressing: benevolent missions have gone to 23 systems, 49 factions, in which I have 36 Allied, 6 friendly, 4 cordial, 2 neutral and 1 unfriendly relationships.

And only lost one Federal Corvette.

LTT 5212, Gnowee & LP 908-11 seems to high on the faction favorite list for TDW.
