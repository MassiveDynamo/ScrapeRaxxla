The Dark Wheel has somewhere, according to the Codex, a stealthed toroidal space station orbiting the eighth moon of a gas giant; they claim to have lost Raxxla in the past-pretty careless if you ask me. Thereâ€™s nothing much to miss out on lore wise -it may/may not show up on fss/dss & possibly has to be found visually. So fly over to any eighth moon you come across, turn on night vision, have a look around, and tell us if you find it.

I checked a couple of systems out towards Beagle Point on DW2, needless to say I have nothing to report!

Some people have compiled a list of such systems from EDSM & are searching in the bubble. Of course it may not be in the bubble......or it may be....

They never lost Raxxla, because they never got there. When Jason Ryder was killed, they lost their only member that may have known the way to get there.

They lost the map, not the place.
