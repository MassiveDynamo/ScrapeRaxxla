I see AEGIS is now in the Orion nebula, at the Orion Tourist Center. Previously this was just one lone asteroid base and two factions, Orion Tourism and Save Space Party. That's all changed now. Been calling it for a long long time, once activity in Orion occurs, something big is gonna happen not long after. See, Orion nebula, and Barnard's Loop are in the center of Orion's Belt, which are the three stars Mintaka, Alnilam (Epsilon Orionis in Elite) and Alnitak. See for yourself. And we know that the Great Pyramids, and a few other pyramids around the world are for some strange reason aligned with Orion's belt. Why? Well no one really knows. BUT, we do know that according to the Alien World, the Oisir-Raxxla had the Egyptians build those great pyramids, and that they were going to be a fully functioning Talmor Lens', which was gonna keep the Oisir-Raxxla moving on their merry way of conquest across the universe, but that they built them wrong in Egypt and ended their mission forever as a result. This inching closer and closer to Barnard's Loop is breathing life into the validity of The Alien World.
Posted are 2 screenshots. One of my YT vid where I deleted my 3x Elite original GURU-951 Account at the Orion Tourism Center (Go big or go home), and the second, a secretive invite that took place at the same exact location a few months later, but for GURU-95i, which isn't even the reincarnation of my original acct, but my alt altogether. It all just leaves me with a big smile, and a scratching of my head. Cheers. o7
