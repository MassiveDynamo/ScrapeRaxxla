The north pole of Saturn is actually quite close to earth's north pole. It's in the far north of the cepheus constellation, at about 85Â° declination.
I think the NGC 188 cluster is the closest interesting location. That sits high in the galactic plane, but has become reachable. You might need a fleet carrier to get there?
