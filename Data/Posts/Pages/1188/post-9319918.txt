Hey, I'm reading through Sagitarius Eye #36. Can anyone clarify this claim about Raxxla being within the range of an unmodified Cobra MKIII? In range of the craft from where? Is that meant to suggest that Raxxla is somewhere in the initial Pilot's Federation introduction systems that we're locked out of after leaving, or that if you can somehow get to Sagitarius A*, then from there it's within the range of a Cobra MKIII?
