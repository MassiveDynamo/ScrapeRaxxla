Yes - the only downside towards any theory concerning Saturn and it’s hexagonal poles is that they are not replicated in game.

But is there sufficient competing hypotheses to warrant that it ‘is’ the poles of Saturn? Just because something is not confirmed in game (Sols asteroids) doesn’t mean FD haven’t included them within the mystery.

One has to take on FD MO of external information and practices to unlock game based elements, so it’s not outside the boundaries of possibilities. Again playing devils advocate, because it’s almost certainly not, because it’s not in game.

Being scientific ought we also include theory which could be in game but FD simply haven’t put them in either due to poor implementation / lack of scientific understanding or that at some point, FD will flip a switch and bingo, Saturn has a hexagonal pole… here be Raxxla… FD just turned it on?

Again evidence of FD inconsistency in both a ‘scientifically accurate’ galaxy (not) and their inability to answer simple questions and stipulate what is / isn’t in game.

Do we have any confirmation off FD concerning such inconsistencies involving Sol?

Is it worth seeking FD confirmation on this via a ticket - why is the pole of Saturn not showing it’s hexagonal pattern (quote dates when it was first observed aka 1980s Voyager probes onwards…).
