Nice spot!
Of course it’s not official! Here’s where that competition started

Unfortunately there seems to be a limit on viewing unless you take out a subscription!

And here is a NYT vid - @2:25 “Jewel in the crown of the solar system”



Unfortunately there appears to be no Saturn hexagonal storm in-game
Edit: tried slow approach at both poles. Now trying at Neptune.

I was waiting for the Jorki response the Twitter post from Braben’s account mentioning Saturn I thought was interesting as he quotes the hexagon, so we know he knows about it and the naming competition reference is from 07, so plenty before the game launch. Something that can’t be ruled out in terms of timeline, but I knew someone would check it out nearer sol than me at the moment…Thought it would be interesting for your Saturn theories!
