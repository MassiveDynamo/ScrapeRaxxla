Hey, what if
You know what's really bugging me about this, in my primordial initial ventures into the exploration of the Raxxla myth, is the notion that the developers are insisting that it is in the game and that they aren't giving us any clues- which would, sort of by definition, mean that anything currently within the game about Raxxla could potentially be poppycock- including its existence. Like a mobius strip of nothingness
