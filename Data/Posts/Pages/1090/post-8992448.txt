Commanders,

Regarding CMDR Guru951's latest statements - As a former member of the (now disbanded) 46&2 group, I would like to apologize for all of this. I'm currently trying to understand what determined Guru to behave this way, as he has disgraced our group, abandoned his brothers and continues to torment seekers with misinformation and delusions.

From what I've managed to piece together, Guru did indeed NOT uncover anything of note, let alone the greatest mystery there is (RAXXLA).

For now, all I can recommend is steering clear of CMDR Guru951, and anything he has to say or offer.

This is some pretty harsh libel if you ask me cmdr. I've followed @GURU-951 videos for a good while and though entertaining and at times informative, I've never seen him personally state that any of his theories or discoveries were successful in finding Raxxla. Only that they were his own theories and subsequent results of him testing them. Peer review and testing is the cornerstone of scientific study when looking for repeatable results. I've never had the feeling that he was a cult leader or that I was being brainwashed.

Maybe it's like the jedi mind trick and only works on the weak minded .

Either way Guru is a stand up researcher and I've learned significant information from his constellation tours and other similar info he's put out and worked on.
