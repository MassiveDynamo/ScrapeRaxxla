We don’t know that Raxxla is an asteroid in Sol! That’s what theorising suggests, but we will only know that when (and if) we find it and it’s an asteroid and it’s in Sol!

If you have a theory you need to try to disprove it as well as prove it!
lol, jus' me instigating
And absolutely, constantly trying to disprove. I want results, not pure speculation!
