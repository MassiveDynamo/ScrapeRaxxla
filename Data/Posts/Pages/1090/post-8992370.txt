May I ask what's your localisation of the game ?

There is that system... like 4000 Ly right over Sgr A*.
Can't remember its name... Ophiuchi ?
Yep, V2 107 Ophiuchi
Ophioukhos; "serpent-bearer", ...meh...
main is a K star in ED
Unreachable, it was, iirc...
It may have changed since I was near there..



EDIT: forget it... still unreachable. My memory is becoming as solid as Pa's...

Serpent?
Doc ! Could be related to Ouroboros/TDW/Raxxla ?
Doc ?

The darkwheel logo is ouroboros, im sure you know the meaning, what i surmised is the orphicus region, checked some in game systems in the region but nothing in the systems that are in the real system, some which are not In elite, you also cant find anything orphicus by name in elite.
