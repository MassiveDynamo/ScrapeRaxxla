Excuse me, are there a lot of spiral stars in the game?
This is almost impossible to say as the term spiraling could reference WR stars IRL or the way neutron stars look in game or potentially how stars in the skybox look when filtered through a black hole's lensing effect. Not to mention the 99.98+% of the galaxy that remains unseen
