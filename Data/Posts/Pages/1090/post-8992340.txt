I dont think guru has found anything yet, so pre mature congratulations are not needed, even i hunt for raxxla and the darkwheel but im not going to say i think i found it until i have found it and documented evidence, will raxxla be end game for the Player? Will it be a faster way to traverse the galaxy? I hope it is a gateway/galatic highway with some kind of den utopia in its system, like a station with every ship and module with a base 20% discount plus elite discounts we are missing something here.. meanwhile fdev are laughing at us! Finding it will be a million forehead slap moment all around the world heard from the furthest corners of the earth to the ISS! Maybe something is hidden in the name? We have poems, we know about deplhi and greek mythology, i tried searching RA 20 LA as xx is 20 but nothing interesting, maybe finding the darkwheel is step 1, but nothing says the darkwheel know raxxla and its location. They just have a phrase, nothing else, both raxxla and the darkwheel are extremely hard to find as each other but considering delphi and all around maia, asterope, atlas, all that area us special due to the activity there, thargoids, mega staions, col sector 70 which is a huge permit locked area, the biggest in elite and also arpund Pleiades is the most stunning part of the galaxy! The bubble is second to that area, its a disctraction... the rest of the universe is pointless including colonia! Raxxla is NOT in colonia, it has two engineers that's it! You know your obsessed with this when you have dreams of finding raxxla!
