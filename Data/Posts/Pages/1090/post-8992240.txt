Correct, but if we are talking about space-faring technology it follows that thrusters to stay in an otherwise unstable orbit would be a trivial point, I would think?

Also, cool calculator
Well, if Raxxla is a Guardian ark ship, as per my theory, then it will have been in Sol for millions of years so possibly no thruster propellant left!!
