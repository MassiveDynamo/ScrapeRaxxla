Silly question, but has anyone taken the Raxxla image from the Codex and the Dark Wheel image from same and tried overlaying/superimposing them in various ways to see if anything interesting might come of it?
Just for kicks.... Nothing obvious to me... anyone?
(And looks like even less when they are the same size)
