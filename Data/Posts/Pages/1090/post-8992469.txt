It is definitely creative. No one seems to have mentioned that the pattern within the area of the ouroboros and over the Elite emblem is

Also I believe the image is associated with the Children of Raxxla player faction and not The Dark Wheel.

Ya I think it all stemmed from the fact that the dark wheel logo is something we were hoping to see earlier with all the faction logos... but it didnt materalize and Drew in his Salome story had an emblem(?) with the dark wheel logo on it left on Salomes ship.... So I think someone (see below ) decided to create what they thought it should look like (Edit: Looks like he had it for his player group from even earlier)... The ouroboros was already a popular contender for the dark wheel, But the adding of the cropcircle was awesome - And ya The Children of Raxxla had started around that time and I think adopted it.... I of course could have this all wrong as I never got involved in the COR group but thats what the cobwebs between the ears are telling me...

I (leader of the player group, The Dark Wheel) designed it. There is no hint in the picture itself to anything related to the UA.
The Dragon symbolizes strength and wisdom.
The Ouroboros symbolizes the infinity of time and space, as the Dark Wheel once did and is currently searching to regain it's former glory and to reclaim Raxxla.
The circles represent the constant presence and motion of Raxxla across time and space.
I'm pretty sure you know what the Elite symbol represents.
Our ideals are embodied in this account's signature (read the definition and read the novela), as is the method for joining us.
