Do we know when the SD DW missions stopped?
Has anyone kept a log to confirm the date when the missions were last offered?

Isn't the FP accurate on this ? Anyway Macros knows best.
(when 2.0 Horizons was released; iirc)

and, august last year:
6. Will the “Founder or Elite” missions ever get added back into the game?
Nothing to talk about on this right now.

Didn’t think to check the front page, doh! Thanks for that reference. So they disappeared around 2.0 when ranked missions were apparently redesigned. Sept 2017 FDev Adam said they should be still available, then FD said “Nothing to talk about on this right now.”

So my hypothesis that their disappearance was related to the salt farmed after the Salomé event is disproved, since that was well after 2.0. Science in action!

However, if anyone does want to go, head for Tau Sagittarii and keep going. It's not actually that long a trip because the declination means you'll punch through the bottom of the galaxy and run out of stars fairly soon.

Starter waypoints (Wow! points?) on what shall henceforth be known as the Sol-Sagittarii Line:

Swoilz DA-Y b33-3
Aucoks KO-N c8-4
Drojaea PM-Z b2-0
...etc.

Ah, he’s a tricksy one!
Not been the same since the Cassiopeia Expedition debacle!
