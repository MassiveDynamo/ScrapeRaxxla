With the exception of Brazil, all serious coffee drinking nations are up north. Finland is no. 1, with 12 Kg a year in average consumption. Go Finland![up]

With that amount of coffee inside, just try stopping them!

Edit: mmm, that makes me ponder how much I get through...(TBC)
edit2: science experiment conclusion- I’m not far behind at 10.585Kg
(3 mugs/day*2 scoops/mug*365 days). In reality probably a little higher as very occasionally I’ll have 4 mugs in a day. But never after 15:00; I have enough trouble sleeping (I blame my bad back, due to gardening! )
