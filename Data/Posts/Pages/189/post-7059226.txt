Do you really want to go hunting for something that may not exist (WOW was never repeated, may have just been a plane or satellite, or noise, or a hoax), & has nothing to do with Raxxla (1: it was RL, nothing to say it has been simulated in-game; 2: it’s not in Holdstock’s or FD sources). Not trying to dissuade you from having fun, just think it would perhaps be more appropriate to pursue it either in the Alien/mysteries/tinfoilery [alien] thread or set up a new thread for the purpose.

Good luck, think I’ll pass!

I think Jaiotu was just trolling me

However, if anyone does want to go, head for Tau Sagittarii and keep going. It's not actually that long a trip because the declination means you'll punch through the bottom of the galaxy and run out of stars fairly soon.

Starter waypoints (Wow! points?) on what shall henceforth be known as the Sol-Sagittarii Line:
