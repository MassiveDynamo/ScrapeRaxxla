FORMIDINE RIFT MISSION 5/6

Expedition Log 07/10/3270
"I'm scared... help me someone... I can't bear another jump. The lights in witch-space are coming for me. The lights... always the lights... they're calling to me... a siren song... I must join them..."

Hmm ..sirens
I noticed, when I do jump, all stars along the way fly-by as lights. Could it be that "sirens" ? >:
