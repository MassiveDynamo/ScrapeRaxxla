Could it be that "sirens" ? >:
Is witchspace the deepest void ?
Lore says 'witchspace is haunted.' Could then be anything from jack-o'-lantern to ghosts and dragons ?
Would be cool, but just space madness, I am afraid.
But I still bet Raxxla is somehow related to witchspace, hyperspace and so (Oolite's concept and my own interpretation of the Icon). Just my feeling. But.. is it FD's feeling ?
Not sure at all.
