FORMIDINE RIFT MISSION 5/6




Hmm ..sirens
I noticed, when I do jump, all stars along the way fly-by as lights. Could it be that "sirens" ? >:
What else is odd is that if you go to areas you know there are no stars those lights are still there. The question is is this laziness on fdevs part or intentional? If it's on purpose maybe we have to look for things in witchspace as a hint. I know I've seen an odd formation in the Orion nebula hot dog that was a clear triangle of stars. I think you saw it if you went back too. Like there are fixed things in the void when jumping.
