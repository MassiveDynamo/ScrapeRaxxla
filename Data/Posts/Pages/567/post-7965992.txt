Well, from tech point it's just "please wait" message while client/server loads stuff. Maybe it is done by showing stars with x100000000 speed + random. So it is different a bit on each jump and looks true hyperspace.
But I doubt they could encode there anything.

ALso there is related question - can they add star systems as they wish or cant ? If they cant - then no point to search 3 "raxxla stars" ....because, do you really think they could make toast for 3 already existing stars? >: I wouldnt do that. I would place 3 stars in configuration I need.
