No. "Solve triangle" means find all angles and sizes but giving some.
My code above was trying to find somethign like "Perpendicular bisectors"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection#Line_segment_bisector

which is "the center of the circle through the three vertices" which is equal remote point from 3 others points. But ...wiki shows particular one on surface, in 3D for given triangle can be many including that one which is on triangle surface.
That's true but if all you have are three points, only the solution in the plane is relevant.
Until you have some distances or more points, that's all you can get.
