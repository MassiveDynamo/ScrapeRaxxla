No. "Solve triangle" means find all angles and sizes but giving some.
My code above was trying to find somethign like "Perpendicular bisectors"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection#Line_segment_bisector

which is "the center of the circle through the three vertices" which is equal remote point from 3 others points. But ...wiki shows particular one on surface, in 3D for given triangle can be many including that one which is on triangle surface.
