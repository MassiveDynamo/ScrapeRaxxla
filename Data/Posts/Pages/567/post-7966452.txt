Has anybody ever asked David Braben, or anyone from FDev for that matter, if Raxxla is even reachable in the current game?

We need to find out some key factors here. As fun as tinfoil-hatting is, I'm really wondering if Raxxla or anything else related to it is actually "in the game right now" physically.

If yes, then we know that it's likely in a permit-locked area; meaning that we still have a mystery on figuring out how to get these permits still anyway.

If no, then it's just the gen ships all over again. The whole "they were there the whole time but actually not" is getting old, I'm sick of the magic switch.
See the OP of this thread.
