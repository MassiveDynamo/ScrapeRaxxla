That intresting, so expeditions in FR ...all 4 were slaughtered by thargoids it seems ...usual weird sound & power loss.
So that means they came from that direction? Then why humanity were trying to run there too ? And ye, I would like to find origin source of them as well ...

The Zurara was slaughtered by humans.

It's almost like DrewW had some storyline left over from the original Rift mystery so he used it up when it was retconned into a Thargoid thing, even though it doesn't make any sense in the new context.
