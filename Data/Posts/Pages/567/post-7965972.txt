That intresting, so expeditions in FR ...all 4 were slaughtered by thargoids it seems ...usual weird sound & power loss.
So that means they came from that direction? Then why humanity were trying to run there too ? And ye, I would like to find origin source of them as well ...
Remember, "In FR mYsTeRy, no Thargs, no Raxxla, no antigravity" DW was warned by MB. FD reserved (well... not sure about antigrav if reserved or pointless in ED..)
