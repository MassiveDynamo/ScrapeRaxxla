Only just realised that if you do not surface probe (oooh er mrs) rings around stars they do not register as discovered.
I was messing about and decided to scan a ring around a Brown Dwarf - came up as discovered new steller object (with hotspots).
So, what if the Dark Wheel is not just a rubbish name from a 1984 free novella?
What if the Dark is a dull star, low luminosity.
And the Wheel is a ring around it?
And in that ring is a space station (signal only discoverable if you surface scan the ring around the star a bit like hotspots)?
And that space station is the Dark Wheel home?
Then I sobered up.
Seriously though, has this been explored as an option?
