Rustle of tin-foil....right I'm ready...

Just visited a system where the last GG & 1st moon were mapped by 'Psiren Farseer', had a tourist beacon as well but that was 'recommended' by a Commander.

Is Psiren Farseer a player or a clue? Felicity talks about getting you out into the 'void' and now maybe an offspring is called 'Psiren'? Im on Xbox so have limited scope to check players, can anyone check if these people are real or Fdev planted?

Is the Commander who recommended the Tourist spot real or is that a plant?

I dont know whats real any more.

Felicity Farseer’s wiki says she’s based at her father’s manufacturing facility, but no mention of his name.
