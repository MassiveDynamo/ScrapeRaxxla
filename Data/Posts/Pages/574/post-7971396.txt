Damn ..russian is translated in multiply, like "the grief of the fathers". In russian that may mean grief of all prev generation who are fathers for current one.

For 1 parent there are plenty of myths. For example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major - there are mother & son there.
Looking at this from greek myth.. The epitome of parents grief is the story of niobe. The epitome of lovers woe would be pyrramus and thisbe. - Another way would be to look at going to the underworld... For parents grief we have persephone and the reason for the seasons. For lovers woe.. Orpheus failing to rescue eurydice. What do all these have in common?... Death

That and the recent article make me believe that if i had to asign locations to segments of the toast...parents grief and lovers woe would be tionisla to me.
