I might be going space crazy, but what if clue number 1 on the trail is right under our noses:

Venus is the brightest planet in the night sky from earth. You could say its the jewl that burns brightest.
In the legend of Tanhauser, Venus constantly whispers in his ear. In greek mythology, some believed Aphrodite (Venus) a siren, rather than a goddess.
After her son (Aeneas) died, she was so grief stricken, she asked Jupiter to make him immortal. Aeneas wife (Creusa) begged him not to return to the fight in Troy, saving his life

I know that above, I am overlapping Greek and Roman mythology, but Venus and Aphrodite are usually considered the same being, told from different angles.

So I am thinking, Venus, in Latin, means lucifer, or morning star. In Sirius, we have the planet Lucifer. I know its well explored and there is even an engineer there, but Sirius also ties in nicely with ED lore, and the ability to cover things up. Even the club used them, didn't they?
