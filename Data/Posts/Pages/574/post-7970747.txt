I often thought the DW was an asteroid belt but the continuing lore is of a disused space station so I keep it on the back burner

think the system was Col 285 Sector VU-M c8-1 but not 100% sure as not in game, can check and edit if wrong. was a weird system in that iirc all of them had been discovered by same person then A4 & A4a were mapped by Psiren Farseer but no others, most including A1 & A2 and moons were mapped by same person and A4 2-4 were mapped by same person. So Farseer seemingly went straight for the A4 & A4a only, wondered if it was dev testing the mapping gear out for example or whether it could be anything. One day Ill learn how to post screenshots from XBox.
