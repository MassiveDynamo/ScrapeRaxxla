Is it all related to this ( https://www.sharoma.com/frontierverse/wormholes.htm )?
I have actually long suspected that the "Witchspace tunnel" is, in fact, a wormhole as it mimicks traversal of a wormhole nicely. You even get the blue flash at the beginning and space folding upon itself as you are ejected at your destination. The blue is from light being concentrated at the entry point as a tunnel is punched through the fabric of space-time. The collapsing on itself is the tunnel unfurling into normal space-time. The effect is most noticeable if you watch at about a 60Â° angle relative to the Witchspace tunnel.
