I vaguely remember a livestream where asteroids were discussed, possibly in the context of a question about Raxxla, and the devs involved seemed to look at each other & someone commented something like “you’re in the right ballpark”....

Anyone remember this and can point me to the livestream vid?
I recall it, but the context was different.

It was a live stream, possibly involving mining, FD did these ‘Ed learns’ type vids where a Com Manager tags along and tries different things etc usually with a player group ( if my memory is correct?).

In this instance in was subterfuge (in my opinion) and at some point they basically said (naively) - ha got you now where’s Raxxla, to which the FD employee essentially (in my opinion) brushed it off very well and politely counteracted it with charm and or sarcasm.

He was (in my opinion) being flippant.
