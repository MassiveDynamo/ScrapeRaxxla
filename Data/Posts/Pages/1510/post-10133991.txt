I think Witches Reach is some Fed navy thing. At least there were Fed Navy convoys with UAs onboard, entring and leaving Witches Reach on mai 4th 3301. The first or second UA were liberated close by.
Mmm, just remembered my hypothesis that PF is run by a Guardian AI...so maybe Witches Reach is reserved for a future storyline.....
