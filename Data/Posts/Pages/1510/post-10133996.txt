I'll be honest. There have been years long debates on that here and at Independent Raxxla Hunters discord on that subject. The sonnets are possibly one of the better candidates out there. That doesn't mean others haven't been posited. I am pretty sure we haven't actually settled on a reliable answer to that question.
So, could be this a good point to start? I think that sometimes going back on your steps it's the right thing to do.
Maybe before going on we should focus on answering this question....
.... Or maybe it is under our nose and we cannot see it because we have too many theories

Thanks for the replies anyway!
I will continue researching on the "child story" subject.
I will let you know if I will ever find something.
