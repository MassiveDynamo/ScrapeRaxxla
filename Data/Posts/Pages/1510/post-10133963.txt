Hello,
after 1 year of wandering between a lot of conjecture, hypotesis and through the black,
I find myself again thinking about RAXXLA.
I'm not a veteran player as I found out about the game about 2 or 3 years ago and as I have not much time to spend exploring the universe unfortunately. The day I found out about RAXXLA I was pretty interested and curious so I started doing some research and I "spiralled down" this immense puzzle.
Anyway, I was going through the forum trying to find some information about the "child story" Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars and
the only thing I succeded to find was about the sonnet by philip sydney "Astrophil and Stella" (here the sonnets).

I would like to know what the actual "child story" is about!
If there is some writings or a link to something that tells this story I would be thankful (1510 pages of forum are not an easy reading).

I do not expect to solve the mystery because obviouvsly everything I can think it already have been thought before but nonetheless, without knowing, sometimes I find myself trying to keep the pace with what has been found out until now. Some day we will know for sure what is all about.
The only thing that makes me laugh a little but curious nonetheless is that this mystery has gone for so long that whatever it is, it will not be up to expectation (I hope I'm wrong and maybe I am beacuse FD has already satisfied a lot for me).

Sorry for the long message,
Hope to find what I'm looking for
