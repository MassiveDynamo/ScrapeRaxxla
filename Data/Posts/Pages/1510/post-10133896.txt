Adding to wormhole idea:
Believe it is canon that Thargoids use wormholes.
Megaships, capital ships, fleet carriers I believe have text somewhere stating wormhole is the traversal method.
Guardians I believe says something roughly to effect of being able to alter space for more rapid transit (same basic idea).
CMDR ships have lots of interesting details about FSD functions in the varying engineering data.
