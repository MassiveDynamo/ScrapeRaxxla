Let's just say for now: 3301 may yet crack a few more things and I'll reveal more if some testing yields positive results over the weekend....

I suppose I owe y'all an explanation for my cryptic as hell posting...

Idea is still coming together but I do believe Raxxla might just share a common origin with another mega-mystery: Cicada 3301. Presently compiling information to see if headway cannot be made on the apparently stalled Cicada 3301. I think a framework may be possible to get the unsolved pages deciphered but like Raxxla the odds are not good. Nonetheless, this game and its' crazy mysteries may have gotten me involved in more mysteries. Fun times.
