Does anyone know how to get the forum to not break the link from Wikipedia about the esoteric programming language Brain f u c k? I mean it is part of the game yet it broke my link.

No, there aren't spaces and it is a single word in Wikipedia. I had to write it that way so it wasn't auto-edited.
Not a direct link, but easy enough to navigate

esoteric, minimalist programming language
