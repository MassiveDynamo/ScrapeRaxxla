I would like to know what the actual "child story" is about!
If there is some writings or a link to something that tells this story I would be thankful (1510 pages of forum are not an easy reading).
I'll be honest. There have been years long debates on that here and at Independent Raxxla Hunters discord on that subject. The sonnets are possibly one of the better candidates out there. That doesn't mean others haven't been posited. I am pretty sure we haven't actually settled on a reliable answer to that question.
