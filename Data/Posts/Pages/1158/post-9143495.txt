Great point about New Horizon
Thinking about horizons...some thoughts on New Dawns as well...

New Dawn station at Ceos helps solve UA damage (wont mention the sheer number of stations with horizon in them)
Arissa crowned emperor... today a new dawn broke (and ya dont forget all the Emperors Dawn stuff)
Colonizing Colonia ... a new dawn
New Dawn Collection Stolen... beginning of Winking Cat thefts (yes I believe he was winking at us for a reason)

Seems like "new dawns" happen with big events... also some connections with the Empire

The capitol of the empire Achenar - aka (i checked, searched for HD 10144 and it took me to Achenar) ... Achernar. ( the end of the river)
being the celestial river (Po i suppose, or in India... or numerous other rivers apparently according to Brown). Associations with Phaeton and possibly the Eleusian path of souls... need to look into more.

Reminds me the of the Path of Souls is created by the ... which incidentally is what New Horizons was studying...

So I find myself back at (worth a peruse I think)

Described by as the intersection of two circels ( remind you of anything the winking cat might have ?)

The two circles being the milky way and the ecliptic .... (saraswati (celestial river) and(?))

Might provide a direction for someone to head in sol... or maybe its just pointing at the Pleiades

I'm a bit curious to why they chose the X towards Taurus/Gemini? The milkyway is almost not visible in that direction. The X in Sagittarius is far more visible.

The ecliptic crossing the Milkyway fits nicely with the name Raxxla. Milk in Greek is Γάλα. Putt a couple of Xs in the middle (there are two crossings for the circles) and you get Γάxxλα. That's not to shabby.
