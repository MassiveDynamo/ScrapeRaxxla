Hi, I've been reading through a few pages here and there. Many interesting theories and ideas!

I was wondering how likely it is that finding Raxxla is tied to discovering something with a specific ship. Would it be possible to limit finding answers to a parameter like that?

Welcome

Yes its possible but probably and hopefully unlikely, theres no lore reason for it unless it only has small landing pads. I think if anything its more probable it could be found in any ship, including a basic Sidewinder with A rated FSD, it may just take longer. Excluding players is not really the Frontier way but there may be some pre-requisites we just dont know.

Just saw this in a post on reddit, haven't read through the whole thing, but seems to have connections to Raxxla. If it's been seen before, please disregard, but I thought it might contain something useful...?

Its one of the many theories floating around, I think on that particular one you have to make up your own mind whether its useful to us or a Doctor though. That particular person has a history of certain behaviour and just leading people with vague clues though. It seems they have a small following now. Just be wary is the best advice, but thats the same for anybody on the internet, no matter how charming or convincing they may appear they may not be who they appear to be or who they believe themselves to be. Tinfoil is great but delusions are often dangerous.
