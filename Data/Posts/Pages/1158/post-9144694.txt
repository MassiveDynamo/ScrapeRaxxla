LS on Thursday, on Twitter they are asking for Qs, this one popped up, totally irrelevant to the subject and the guest ofc but can anyone confirm that this was said at some point? As in remember who said it or provide a link?
If this is true that means you need to either jump very deep into the galaxy (Fuel scoop and highest sidewinder engineering would be the ly limit) or it is a near very distant star in a system where a sidewinder would just about run out of fuel getting to it..... speaking of which, everyone's trying Sol what about that free anaconda? does travelling to Hutton orbital bring you towards sol? its the furthest star I can think of and I would say a nightmare in a sidewinder, fits in line with the old lore also
