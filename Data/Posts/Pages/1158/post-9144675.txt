Played around with stelarium on lunch .... Ya I forgot the Greater Mystery of Eleusis is set around the Autumn Equinox and the new moon. So I assumed around Sept 6 for this year... and looks like the cross would be in Gemini.... The closest thing to a dawn star would probably be Regulus?. Anyhoooo will play more tonight.
