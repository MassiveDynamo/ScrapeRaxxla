RE: New Horizons.

Nobody found it yet or is it in Sol? iirc last time I was there was 3 Voyager POIs, maybe one of those was supposed to be NH? Aint been for ages though so dunno if its still there or been corrected if it was or what. Just seems strange if nobody has yet found it. If they have and its a POI or whatever then just ignore this post.
New Horizons probe is in Sol (was there last night). FDev officially announced it was in the game in April 3304. Not sure if it was added around then or the got tired of waiting and were pushing the players to find it. The major commonality is they all had a flyby at Jupiter. I think the Voyagers were there since the beginning but I have no proof either way on New Horizons.
