RE: Hidden objects in Asteroid Belts

Noticed this tonight, not a new LP but hidden in the belt B2. Theres an extra circle / shade around B2 like with Planets with Rings, possibly showing theres something there, compare it to A1 also on screen and notice the extra / difference. Might fit the 'tiny bit obvious' bit but havent been back to Hesperus LPs to check if same there or not.
