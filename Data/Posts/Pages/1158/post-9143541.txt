I found a potential commonality that would explain all three ancient probes being included (a common flyby of Jupiter). Going to make sure New Horizons doesn't in fact act in the same fashion as an unregistered comms beacon just in case. There is an unregistered comms beacon orbiting Europa and the Moon so definitely checking the one at Europa and will probably revisit the one at the Moon. My deep suspicion here is that the storyline involving the Thargoids may go back to Sol at its very start. The beacon in Lave that states "first recorded interaction with Thargoids" comes across as a propaganda piece to hide something that happened back in Sol especially as their was an assassination in Beta Hydri to stop the spread of information about the Thargoids (and I believe the Federal Intelligence Agency (FIA) was responsible).
