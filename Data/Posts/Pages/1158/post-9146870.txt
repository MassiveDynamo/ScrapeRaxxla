Just saw this in a post on reddit, haven't read through the whole thing, but seems to have connections to Raxxla. If it's been seen before, please disregard, but I thought it might contain something useful...?

Anything on Reddit should be treated with utmost caution! It has often been a lair of trolls and hoaxers.
