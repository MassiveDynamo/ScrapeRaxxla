I'm a bit curious to why they chose the X towards Taurus/Gemini? The milkyway is almost not visible in that direction. The X in Sagittarius is far more visible.

The ecliptic crossing the Milkyway fits nicely with the name Raxxla. Milk in Greek is Γάλα. Putt a couple of Xs in the middle (there are two crossings for the circles) and you get Γάxxλα. That's not to shabby.
Love the milk angle !

Not sure if they are doing some archeoastronomy there?... I seem to remember that last time i looked at this - the X was in the old constallation of the Field (spring equinox). And the equinoxes tied to a path to heaven/hell (so ya two X's) - Assuming something like Persephone/Orpheus path - also of course the Spring equinox and planting season - hence the field. I think even the Pleiades were possibly acting as the morning star and associated also with start of good sailing? ... Will have to do more digging
