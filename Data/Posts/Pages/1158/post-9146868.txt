Hi, I've been reading through a few pages here and there. Many interesting theories and ideas!

I was wondering how likely it is that finding Raxxla is tied to discovering something with a specific ship. Would it be possible to limit finding answers to a parameter like that?
Anything’s possible, but IMHO limiting Raxxla to a single ship type is unlikely.
This is an urban myth that surfaces occasionally. It seems to be tied to either (a) some loose thinking around the original Dark Wheel novella by Robert Holdstock, where the hero stole a Cobra from Tionisla Orbital Graveyard (sadly not implemented in ED), or (b) even looser thinking which involved an old comment that Drew Wagar‘s Formidine Rift mystery could be found in a short range ship. One of the FRift abandoned station logs (see Canonn website for info) describes a female (Sidewinder if memory serves) pilot returning from her mission to find the parent Anaconda destroyed. It is supposed that pilot was Rebecca Weston, the old lady in Drew’s two ED novels Reclamation and Premonition and who apparently managed to return safely to the human bubble. There is nothing in the lore that ties the search for Raxxla to a particular ship type.
