For all we know they could really have been Raxxlans
Well, quite.

And a similar point from a slightly different angle - where did we get the name Raxxla from?

Guardians - just a name Ram Tah thought was appropriate, not the ‘Guardians’ actual name for themselves.

Thargoids - a name that comes from a very early close up video of an alien ship, in which some thought they could make out the letters T H A R G, and others swore it was just people seeing shapes in meangingless scratches. Again, almost certainly not what the ‘Thargoids’ actually call themselves.

So where did the word (or name) Raxxla come from?
