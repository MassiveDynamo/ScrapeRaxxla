If we believe Rafe Zetter, Raxxla is a planet and it has an alien construct. In ED the word 'construct' is used as a name for the Guardian AI.
I'm not a native English speaker, but to me it feels a bit odd to use that word for a virtual entity. It doesn't feel like a coincidence.
It’s a tricky one. It does kind of mean something that’s been ‘built’ rather than something that has grown or developed naturally. So ‘artificial’ can be seen as integeral to ‘construct’ and thus extremely fitting for an AI.

The thing for me was that the term wasn’t used in the logs from the first Ram Tah mission, and then suddenly started being used heavily in the logs from the second.

One other difference though is that the logs from RT1 generally pertain to AIs in their virtual / network-based form, whereas the logs from RT2 generally pertain to AIs with a slightly more corporeal presence. So it could be a reflection of that.

It could also just be different writers, and use of a term that’s a bit fashionable. (Was watching S2 of Altered Carbons and the term ‘VR construct’ was used a fair bit.)

Nevertheless, it’s still definitely very suspicious the sudden use of it in ED given the Raxxla connection.
