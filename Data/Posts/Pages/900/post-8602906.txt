We could all submit articles, back in the day.

Yeah, I know people could submit articles back in the day. My point's just that Jaiotu appear to have had one published where he's the one who's written what Ricardo Bentonio said. Which makes it seem like something slipped through somewhere.

Anyway while we're on the subject, can I just say a big thank you for that article of yours! At that time I was still playing without using out of game info sources, and in retrospect I can safely say that articles like that made a massive difference to the game for me, and I think it would have been a very different (and much lesser) experience if they hadn't existed. And that one of yours was of particular significance, and even if I'd forgotten who'd wrote it, I remember the body of the article well! So thank you, it's always been much appreciated!
