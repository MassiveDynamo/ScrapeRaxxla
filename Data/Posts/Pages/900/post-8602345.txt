If we believe Rafe Zetter, Raxxla is a planet and it has an alien construct. In ED the word 'construct' is used as a name for the Guardian AI.
I'm not a native English speaker, but to me it feels a bit odd to use that word for a virtual entity. It doesn't feel like a coincidence.

But I think all that old lore has been retconned out.
I’ll tell you when I find it!
If I’m not killed by the lizard people!
Whatever happened to Ricardo Bentonio??
