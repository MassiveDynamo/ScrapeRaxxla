Ah, the “planet with an alien construct that is a gateway to other universes” may well have been retconned. Since FD have said on several occasions there are no other galaxies implemented in ED then it seems to me certain that this has been retconned. Though I could believe Raxxla is a gateway to a planet in its own special instance, which would not require any other galaxy. Might be treasure stuff on that planet, might not...
Other galaxies meant something different to Rafe and Alex. They had eight 'galaxies' that were open to anyone. This is may also be significant for the 'mother of galaxies' line, in the toast.
Rafe never actually mentions 'other galaxies'. It's just 'other universes'. That is a bit more vague. It could be literally different universes, but it could also just be somewhere very different.

Personally I suspect that if the construct could be virtual, the other universes could also be virtual. If AI kills of their masters and escape, there is really no reason for them to settle in the physical universe.
