So what are people researching/actively searching for at the moment in terms of Raxxla/DW/Anything else related....

I'm still hoping Fdev will confirm the LFT 509 and the mysterious Hip 34104 being outside of the system marker and non-selectable.... So it can be ruled out as a possible Dark Wheel location.

Bug report here if you haven't seen/tried it (if not please add to the bug and vote for it!)
