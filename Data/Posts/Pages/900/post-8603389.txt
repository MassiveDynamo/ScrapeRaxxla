So what are people researching/actively searching for at the moment in terms of Raxxla/DW/Anything else related....

I'm still hoping Fdev will confirm the LFT 509 and the mysterious Hip 34104 being outside of the system marker and non-selectable.... So it can be ruled out as a possible Dark Wheel location.

Bug report here if you haven't seen/tried it (if not please add to the bug and vote for it!)

Well on the DW invite....I am on the last leg of my trip around the rim. Trying to decide if I should come home and fight the good fight for TDW or scratch that itch and do a zig zag across the galaxy, so I can sell UC data from every galactic region to TDW in 1 hit. Yes I know galactic regions didn't hit until way after Beta (Beyond actually I think) but it's still my only chance to scratch the itch. Cant see myself doing such a trip again...
