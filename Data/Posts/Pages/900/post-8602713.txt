Ricardo Bentonio is an FD created character. He first came to atention during the Starship One incident. Then he showed up again, to organize the leap year CG.
I think he still stays in Kruger 60, but it’s been quiet for a while.
Well that’s what I’d suspected but then I saw this Galnet article:

Galnet News | Elite Dangerous Community Site
community.elitedangerous.com

Which is labelled as a freelance article, and attributed to Jaiotu’s character.

Which seems to indicate that that particular article was done by Jaiotu, hence me wondering if the others might have been as well!
