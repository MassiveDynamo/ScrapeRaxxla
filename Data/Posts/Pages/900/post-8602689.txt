Dunno, but I did find out he wasn’t one of Drew’s creations! (I asked in one of Dreams streams.)

Was actually looking up that Lizard Galnet article last night, and spotted another Ricardo Bentonio article with the name cmdr Finn McMillan as the sign off for the article. Which unless I’m much mistaken is actually @Jaiotu !

Was it you behind those all along @Jaiotu ?!
Ricardo Bentonio is an FD created character. He first came to atention during the Starship One incident. Then he showed up again, to organize the leap year CG.
I think he still stays in Kruger 60, but it’s been quiet for a while.
