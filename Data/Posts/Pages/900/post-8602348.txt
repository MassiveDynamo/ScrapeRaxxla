No, I’m not sure of anything about lore any more, I’m totally confused! Yes, I agree, we should read the Codex and Tourist beacons (& maybe the Galnet archives ) and take that as the current lore. But my memory is failing a bit in old age so I tend to remember older stuff better!
What we know 100% about the lore, is that the ED book authors had no knowledge about Raxxla. The writers guide had no info of Raxxla and the subject was of limit.
Raxxla is the stuff of legends and hints are most likely to be found in the books that preceded ED and were available to FD when they constructed the mystery.

The Dark Wheel is by far the most likely candidate to contain something useful. Imprint, Stories from the Frontier and Further stories from the Frontier, may also be useful to read.

The in-game stuff is of-course the primary source.
