Just finished Duke rank, now 5 more for Feds >:

Got 3 tip off messages during. Did 1 - found crashed ship with thargoid sensor there. Also could access and read ship's log. After relog it says "data encrypted" again.
So we can conclude all those crashed ships around may tell stories by "tip off" when you have key for 1 read.
Then I returned back to station where I got that mail, surprise - I could sell "intelligence data" there. I'm swear I had nothing before. So I think that was imperial spies who hired me.
Ship is at ALRAI SECTOR BR-Y D72 A2 A
