But I think all that old lore has been retconned out.
I’ll tell you when I find it!
If I’m not killed by the lizard people!
Whatever happened to Ricardo Bentonio??
Dunno, but I did find out he wasn’t one of Drew’s creations! (I asked in one of Dreams streams.)

Was actually looking up that Lizard Galnet article last night, and spotted another Ricardo Bentonio article with the name cmdr Finn McMillan as the sign off for the article. Which unless I’m much mistaken is actually @Jaiotu !

Was it you behind those all along @Jaiotu ?!
