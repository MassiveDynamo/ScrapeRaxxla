Other galaxies meant something different to Rafe and Alex. They had eight 'galaxies' that were open to anyone. This is may also be significant for the 'mother of galaxies' line, in the toast.
Rafe never actually mentions 'other galaxies'. It's just 'other universes'. That is a bit more vague. It could be literally different universes, but it could also just be somewhere very different.

Personally I suspect that if the construct could be virtual, the other universes could also be virtual. If AI kills of their masters and escape, there is really no reason for them to settle in the physical universe.
On the galaxies front, I spotted an interesting little snippet in the Elite manual the other day, which I couldn’t remember particularly taking note of before.



Can’t remember if the particular text has been posted before or not.

Slightly open to interpretation, but could be read as confirmation that the systems in Elite were limited to just Galcop systems (or Galcop systems and systems Galcop maintained those mentioned links with, anyway.)

Edit - I might be misremembering, but I think you might have said similar before about the systems from Elite, @Han_Zen It’s just that particular piece of text that I can’t remember being posted before.
