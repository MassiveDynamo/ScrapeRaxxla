Well that’s what I’d suspected but then I saw this Galnet article:

Galnet News | Elite Dangerous Community Site
community.elitedangerous.com

Which is labelled as a freelance article, and attributed to Jaiotu’s character.

Which seems to indicate that that particular article was done by Jaiotu, hence me wondering if the others might have been as well!

No. They would have been labeled freelance.
We could all submit articles, back in the day.

I even had one publiched my self:https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/57c7fe999657badb5446a7f6
