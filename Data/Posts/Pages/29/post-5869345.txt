Jackie Silver would know if it fits the proc. generation naming pattern, or if it's an anomaly. I'll ask him.

Edit: Had a look myself and Phooe bRA XX-L A76-0 is a bit different from the others as this is a T9 star type. The rest are Ys.

Jackie Silver says it's not that unusual unfortunately. Still, in the spirit of no stone left unturned, I'll bookmark it and have a look on my circumnavigation. Reckon I'll be in the vicinity in Jan. 2018.

Are these worth checking out? I'm in Colonia now...and a bit bored.

Please do, CMDR.

We eagerly await your news on Raxxla [smile]
