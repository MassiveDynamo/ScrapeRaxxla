I did searches like that to. That's why I could find a system rather quickly. I use this page, for sector names: https://cim.sotl.org.uk/elite-dangerous/

Edit: I found three more 'RA XX-L A' systems:

- Ooscs bRA XX-L A7-0
- Dryu bRA XX-L A7-0
- Hypao bRA XX-L A7-0
and the first one
- Phooe bRA XX-L A76-0

I think these are the only systems with 'Raxxla', in the name.

All the systems are in the same part of the galaxy, past Colonia.


Probably not important, but it was fun that there actually were a few systems that fit.

Jackie Silver would know if it fits the proc. generation naming pattern, or if it's an anomaly. I'll ask him.

Edit: Had a look myself and Phooe bRA XX-L A76-0 is a bit different from the others as this is a T9 star type. The rest are Ys.
