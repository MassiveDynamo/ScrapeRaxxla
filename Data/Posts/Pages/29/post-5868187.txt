It's been a long time since I've seen the missions mentioned in the OP. As far as I can see there's nothing special about the current missions (all factions) from Jameson Memorial than in any other system/station. Only minor curiosity is that I haven't seen any missions from other systems to Shinrarta Dezhra.

Elite & Founder missions are still on the mission board, they're just 'ordinary' missions.

So perhaps FD took an editorial decision to postpone the Raxxla story arc for a while.
