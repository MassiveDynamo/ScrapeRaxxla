Thanks to you for the transcription, Macros. Much more intelligible for me now.
May I, respectfully, suggest you put the link on the FP in the quote "Strongest indications for the existence of Raxxla ...]" for newcomers?

Agreed - This is a good idea...

I did searches like that to. That's why I could find a system rather quickly. I use this page, for sector names: https://cim.sotl.org.uk/elite-dangerous/

Edit: I found three more 'RA XX-L A' systems:

- Ooscs bRA XX-L A7-0
- Dryu bRA XX-L A7-0
- Hypao bRA XX-L A7-0
and the first one
- Phooe bRA XX-L A76-0

I think these are the only systems with 'Raxxla', in the name.

All the systems are in the same part of the galaxy, past Colonia.


Probably not important, but it was fun that there actually were a few systems that fit.

I still maintain that it's located much closer to the bubble, Since it was reachable hundreds of years ago with the earlies jump drive tech, long before the rest of the galaxy was explored...

I wonder if our cultists friends have a church in Colonia ... They might want to take a look at these. [yesnod]

They have some fast movers in their ranks, that's for sure.

I don't trust them to tell us until they have made a movie about it, though.

Nope, no church, or any official presence in Colonia (Assuming you are talking about CoR). We are as in the dark regarding Raxxla's location as everyone else, hence the participation in the thread! We do have some prolific explorers in our ranks though.

The second we get movie rights signed I'll let you know Han lol
