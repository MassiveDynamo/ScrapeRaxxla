Reminds me nostalgic times when I was mapping EAFOTS KE-Y and EAFOTS DO-O R systems...

I did searches like that to. That's why I could find a system rather quickly. I use this page, for sector names: https://cim.sotl.org.uk/elite-dangerous/

Edit: I found three more 'RA XX-L A' systems:

- Ooscs bRA XX-L A7-0
- Dryu bRA XX-L A7-0
- Hypao bRA XX-L A7-0
and the first one
- Phooe bRA XX-L A76-0

I think these are the only systems with 'Raxxla', in the name.

All the systems are in the same part of the galaxy, past Colonia.
SPOILER


Probably not important, but it was fun that there actually were a few systems that fit.
