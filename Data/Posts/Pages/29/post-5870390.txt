Raxxla will be show up eventually. What the old Elite mission text tells us, is that several organisations are actively looking for it. Non of them have found it so far.

I don't think even the 'real' Dark Wheel knows how to get there.

If I were to guess, I would say that Raxxla has some kind of connection to the Guardians and the Mars relic.
Same here, that thing never leaves my mind.
From time to time, I return to Sol, and against all odds, start searching around again...looking for a clue, anything that sticks out.

why is Triton permit locked, why...why [where is it]
