Apologies if this has already been discussed, but I was just offered the following mission from Galcop Colonial Defense Mission on Dervish Platform in the Ogma system.

Appears to be a tourist beacon half way between the Heart and Soul Nebuli.

Apology not necessary but these are a known item. The staging posts were setup by Salom√© over a year ago. I think mostly to give us players something to do while Drew Wagar was in contract discussions with Frontier

They are now just ordinary tourist beacons.

+1 for keeping your eyes open for clues though!
