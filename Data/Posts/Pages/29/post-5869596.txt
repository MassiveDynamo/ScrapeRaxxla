Jackie Silver says it's not that unusual unfortunately. Still, in the spirit of no stone left unturned, I'll bookmark it and have a look on my circumnavigation. Reckon I'll be in the vicinity in Jan. 2018.

We eagerly await your news on Raxxla [smile]

I'll have a look when I get home tonight and see how far off they are...look to be around another 20K from Colonia.
