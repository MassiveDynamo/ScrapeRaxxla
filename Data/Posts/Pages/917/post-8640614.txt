Project Dynasty logs may indicate Thargoids, or something else (Guardian AI perhaps?), or space madness, or the attacks by the hexedited minions of The Club, or detections of other ships/Zurara since each group wasnâ€™t aware of the existence of the other Dynasty groups- Zurara tried to contact the other Dynasty groups (log or Premonition? Cant remember) which may have been interpreted as an alien contact. Insufficient evidence to decide, other than FRift is on the way to Bovomit which has been locked since the outset and is therefore suggestive.
Conflux Beta 1/4. Btw, number is wrong here -- by date it is last. Maybe something
