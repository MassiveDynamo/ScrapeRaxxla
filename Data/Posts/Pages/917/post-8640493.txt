+/- same distance point should be somewhere in guardian sector. Going there to check, as calculations aren't exact...and maybe wrong. Wana measure on map.
Ok...not sure, here I found center of outer circle around triangle assuming Y coord is same (it's almost same for that 3 stars), so line must go perpendicular to plane and through this point. Maybe some errors present:
