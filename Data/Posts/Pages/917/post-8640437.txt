hmm ..just 1 more idea...
Omphalos means "center of world". Center means equally remote from something.
Somebody above said about princess with black eyes. Let's assume this center is double bh too.
So now we need 3 source points.
We have 3 expeditions sent out. Each expedition has 4 planets.
Lets suppose, Fr expedition we want "alpha" site, as it matches 2nd part of toast.
So now we have 2 x 4 sites left and 2 parts of toast. Ideas?
