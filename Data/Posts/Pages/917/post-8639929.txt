EXCEPT in the Codex there is the rather woolly “Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed.”

We only know (currently) of Thargoids, Guardians and Guardian AI, though I expect there may be some more alien races appearing in due time. IMHO if there is such an alien artefact then it is more likely to be Guardian than Thargoid.
Why more likely guardian?

Is it because of possible tie in with marshian relic and if that had been thargoid they probably would have exterminated us before interstellar travel was even a thing??
