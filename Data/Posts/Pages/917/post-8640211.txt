Why more likely guardian?

Is it because of possible tie in with marshian relic and if that had been thargoid they probably would have exterminated us before interstellar travel was even a thing??

Mmm, partially but not consequentially....
The way I interpret the game lore and Galnet hints, in the distant past the Guardians visited the region of Sol on their hunting parties, and may well have seeded Earth (so I wouldn’t be surprised if humans are descendants of Guardians) and left the Mars artefact. It will be interesting to (hopefully) find out eventually what it is!

Guardians rather than Thargoids because Guardians were engineers with technology based on manufacturing, whereas Thargoid technology is based on re-engineering extant species of life that they capture; Thargoid technology is more organic than Guardian. So I think any Omphalos Rift alien device would be Guardian not Thargoid. However with a proviso....I’ve always thought that the “fireflies” associated with Thargoid artefacts & barnacles may be a lifeform that exists partially in hyperspace.
