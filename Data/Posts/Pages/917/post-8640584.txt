You're far more optimistic than I...but even if there were to appear more alien races, with GalNet dead, how would we know?

Don’t be silly...
When they appear and wipe us out, because all aliens are nasty, violent, aggressive....it’s the meme!
Or is it a trope?

And I suspect Galnet will reappear with the next expansion.

But there are several remote areas locked for future expansion that seem unlikely to be goid or guardian- related. E.g. Bovomit & the ones the far side of Sag A* on the way to Beagle Point.
