Conflux beta 1/4 says about interdiction like thargoids do. It is wrong numbered too, it is 1 but last by date out of 4.
Also somewhere there "Colonia" station got "mail-functioned" hyper drive.
Did anybody tried tharogids sensors in that area?

I just finished carrier load out for 23000ly in 1 way, so thinking where to go. However, I was on Conflux 2 days ago on normal ship to read that logs finally.

Jaques station ended up in what is now Colonia because his planned jump to Beagle Point (fairly sure its in the Wiki) was sabotaged by UA bombing-the UA were already aboard....” then they sing and then they come”...
