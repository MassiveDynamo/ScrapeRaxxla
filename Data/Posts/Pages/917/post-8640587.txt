Ya ive suspected this is an explanation for why the UAs knew morse... all those escape pods....

They may have reengineered navigation beacons, but yes they captured loads of escape pods. I suspect when the invasion happens next year we may well recognise some of the attackers!

Come to think of it there are a few faces I donâ€™t recall seeing for a while: Lord Zoltan, Dommarraa, SpocksOddSocks, Ninja Penguin..
Something smells fishy! Is that a goid?
