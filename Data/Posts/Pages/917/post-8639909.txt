In the Codex there is no link between the Thargs or the Guardians and Raxxla, there is a link between Dark Wheel and Raxxla.

EXCEPT in the Codex there is the rather woolly “Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed.”

We only know (currently) of Thargoids, Guardians and Guardian AI, though I expect there may be some more alien races appearing in due time. IMHO if there is such an alien artefact then it is more likely to be Guardian than Thargoid.
