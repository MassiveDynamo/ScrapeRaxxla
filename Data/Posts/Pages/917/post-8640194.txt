I always related Vagabond as something tying in to Norse, since the mentioning of Sirens too. But this is also because of a popular Raxxla quote. The day Michael Brookes said that bit about the journey he was wearing an Yggdrasil tree shirt.

Odin was a Vagabond. There is a system called Odin's Wisdom and a region called Odin's Hold. Could be either a very specific or general heading. I doubt it would be as easy as the system.

Do you suppose any if the old Trinkets or Sap 8 cores play in anywhere? It's kind of weird those just suddenly became irrelevant. Trinkets are super rare too.

You might be interested to read my Ygdrasil-related hypothesis :
