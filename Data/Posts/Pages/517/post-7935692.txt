I don't think you understand those tools

1,1,2,3,5 are just the first five numbers of the natural fibonnaci series.....

if you put the binary for 'darkwheel' in as a (decimal) seed in the fib generator, the output is:
1346269
2178309
3524578
5702887
9227465

for the next five numbers from that tool, but given the seed is much longer, I suspect it is limited to short numbers and not really giving the correct answer....
