So many ideas and we still have not found anything. Another question is: When FDev put someting like Raxxla into ED , I suppose they want this thing to be found. (Hopefully) Otherwise it would not make any sense. So do they really want people to study greek mythology or whatever to find someting in game? Or is it something much simpler than that? I'm still playing with the old systems from elite. 31 systems from map 1. 1 System each from map 2, 3, 6 and 8. Focusing only on the map number, we have 1,2,3,6,8. or 1,3,6,8 or 1,2,6,8 because Atius can be found in map 1 and map 2. Not a fibonacci sequence but again I ask myself: Why would some game designer do this? So I still think we should not leave out the systems of the original elite. What do you think?
FD want people looking for Raxxla, they don't want them to find it, because we all know what happens when we find the thing we've spent years looking for!
