Playing around with converting.

From txt to binary to Fibonacci number.

Tried it with the word of course = Raxxla
Fibonnaci give me the numbers 11235

Checked in EDDB
Checked in EDSM

And the strange thing is that the word = "The Dark Wheel" give also the Fibonnaci numbers 11235

Might be too simply and totally unrelated.
