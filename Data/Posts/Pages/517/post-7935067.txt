Imho, finding Raxxla through astronomical alignements and so doesn't really match with that personal journey description.
I keep thinking you have to do "something special" to get the TDW invite and then you'll get a "path" to follow for finally finding Raxxla...
Just sort of playing the Alex Ryder character. Get into TDW, then find Raxxla. As your father and Rafe Zetter told you.
