Going back down the WHAT is Raxxla road....I know the codex says it could be anything from an unremarkable moon to a state of cosmic enlightenment, but those who have read the books tell me if old lore states explicitly, that Raxxla is a planet? I did read The Dark Wheel, but I was about 12 and I can't remember it very well!
Try http://www.elitehomepage.org/dkwheel.htm from Ian Bell's page. You might feel what it's like to be twelve again. A wonderful Novella and one that got me into Sci-Fi period!
