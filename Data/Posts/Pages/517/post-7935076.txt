Going back down the WHAT is Raxxla road....I know the codex says it could be anything from an unremarkable moon to a state of cosmic enlightenment, but those who have read the books tell me if old lore states explicitly, that Raxxla is a planet? I did read The Dark Wheel, but I was about 12 and I can't remember it very well!
The question is, "What has FD done with the original concept of Raxxla" ?
The RH's Raxxla, is said to be a planet with a portal to others universes, already discovered and inhabited by 'twisted' men .
I don't think we should take account of the "Alien Worlds" Raxxla.
EDIT: Now, the "RH's Raxxla" is also the "FD Raxxla", at the time of Elite.
I hope they kept the original concept of Raxxla for consistency.
