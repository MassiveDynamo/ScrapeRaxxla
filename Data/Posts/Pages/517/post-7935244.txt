Going back down the WHAT is Raxxla road....I know the codex says it could be anything from an unremarkable moon to a state of cosmic enlightenment, but those who have read the books tell me if old lore states explicitly, that Raxxla is a planet? I did read The Dark Wheel, but I was about 12 and I can't remember it very well!

There is only one book that mentions Rxxla and can be deemed lore for ED, and that’s the original Holdstock’s 1984 TDW novella; however I’m fairly sure that has been discounted as canon by FD. Therefore on lore grounds we have absolutely no idea or even grounds for guessing what Raxxla is in ED!

Drew Wagar’s Oolite fan-fiction novellas (definitely not canon, though good reads) had Raxxla as a moon of Lave that could migrate through hyperspace due to some machine (& therefore kept faith with Holdstock’s description).

I think the Codex provides some clues to where & what; Tyko is working on it. As to what happens when we find it-I’m sticking to my “TPIDRRC” hypothesis.
