One thing I am finding in Van Maanen's star system is almost continuous "Warning FSD operating beyond safe operating limits" announcements. I though FD had fixed that bug ages ago? I'm 100kls away from the White Dwarf
Same thing happens in Sirius. Seem to be a white dwarf thing. Never seen it in a NS system.
