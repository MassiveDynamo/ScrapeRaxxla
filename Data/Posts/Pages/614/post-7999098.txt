I think Iolanthe is referring to the evil navy brew, not coffee in general.

Still harsh though. Bad coffee is way better than no coffee.

Mm, not so sure. I’m a bit of a purist. Freshly ground and filtered Americano for me, no milk or sugar, preferably from Columbian beans. My son got me some El Salvador beans for my birthday; ok, but not the same...️
