Hey all,
Been away for a fair while, its good to see this thread still alive and well, love it. Last I was here the Dark Wheel toast was the in thing, trying to be deciphered and theories spun from that.

In my interests of being lazy and trying to avoid scanning through 200 + pages here (which I may do anyway) whats the latest in these parts? has there been any more 'official' hints? breakthroughs?
it still is just now there's a schism between people who think it means different things
