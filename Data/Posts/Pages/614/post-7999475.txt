I don't know where MB had the original drawing from, Pa. I just assume he drew it or had it drawn following his instructions.
Not Cthulhu himself who appears, but Hastur the Unspeakable, jumping out of Carcosa, Aldebaran, with his servant Byaykhees. As I said in my original post.
Some differences between the drawing and the actual tattoo he shows are because it wasn't fully finished when the pic was taken, I think. You can see the St Michael (Brookes ?) flamigera sword blade not yet drawn. And the trumpet-angel above him is wingless.
The key is on the upper left corner, at the entrance of the Underworld. Where it has to be inserted ?.
Imho.
Oh, right ! It isn't on the actual tattoo ! Why ? Not yet drawn ? mmhh...
No keeyyyyy !

Ah, went back a bit further and found the reference to origin of the tattoo picture
UA Mystery thread 4 - The Canonn
Found the story behind the image of the tattoo and the blog: http://thecultofme.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/the-space-inbetween-preview.html Something to do with impossible forms and mathematics... triangles forming pictures? ;)

Seems like he was going to write a book about it. Must have a read!

Edit: there’s a t-shirt! http://thecultofme.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-space-inbetween-t-shirt-now-in-black.html

Edit2: can’t find the book, perhaps he never finished it?
