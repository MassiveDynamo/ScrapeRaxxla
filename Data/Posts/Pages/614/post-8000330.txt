Ah, went back a bit further and found the reference to origin of the tattoo picture
UA Mystery thread 4 - The Canonn
Found the story behind the image of the tattoo and the blog: http://thecultofme.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/the-space-inbetween-preview.html Something to do with impossible forms and mathematics... triangles forming pictures? ;)

Seems like he was going to write a book about it. Must have a read!

Edit: there’s a t-shirt!

Edit2: can’t find the book, perhaps he never finished it?
