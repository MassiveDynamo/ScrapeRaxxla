I actually came to it from the other direction. After the Rift finished I had no active goal, so I was wondering what to do. Since the thing that makes ED special for me is the 'real world' galaxy, I hit upon the idea of visiting all the catalog systems in the game. So I fired up Wikipedia, picked a constellation, bookmarked all the listed systems (not just the alphas, betas, etc - all the HIPs, HDs and HRs) in it and headed out. I'm currently heading back from completing my 19th constellation.

It was only subsequently that I realized that this goal could conceivably overlap with the 'journey' needed to find Raxxla. I'm closing in on my 1,000th HR system, so my fingers are firmly crossed at this point
Aren't some of those stars blcoked out by permit sectors though? I remember not being able to get all of Orion because all the permit zones and not being able to get where I was trying to go in either direction except to turn around and go back the way I came.
