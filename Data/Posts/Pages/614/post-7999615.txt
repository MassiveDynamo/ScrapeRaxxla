Aren't some of those stars blcoked out by permit sectors though? I remember not being able to get all of Orion because all the permit zones and not being able to get where I was trying to go in either direction except to turn around and go back the way I came.

Same problem I’ve had out that way. There’s an awful lot of permit locked stars ️
