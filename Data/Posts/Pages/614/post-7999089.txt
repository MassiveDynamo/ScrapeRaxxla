Can't help you there. I was so many times told that the witchspace cinematics is just a loading screen without any significance that I came to believe it...

Scytale. I’ve had a look at MB’s tattoo pic, & it seems to differ from the one (penultimate pic) in whatever he is holding in your post. So I was wondering where he got the picture for his tattoo from (is it really Cthulhu? I know nothing about Cthulhu!!!) and what changes were made from the original (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tYpdWTjEDYE/VRqOFFrKwOI/AAAAAAAACf8/TtLh0gjmuhQ/s1600/Small+res+file+for+Fb+uploads.jpg) tattoo pic as found via Simulacrae’s repeat (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/ua-mystery-thread-4-the-canonn.195658/post-3114710) of MB’s original post in the UA Mysteries thread (ah, happy days!).

And I can’t see where the key you mention shows in his tattoo pic.
