Scytale. I’ve had a look at MB’s tattoo pic, & it seems to differ from the one (penultimate pic) in whatever he is holding in your post. So I was wondering where he got the picture for his tattoo from (is it really Cthulhu?) and what changes were made from the original (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tYpdWTjEDYE/VRqOFFrKwOI/AAAAAAAACf8/TtLh0gjmuhQ/s1600/Small+res+file+for+Fb+uploads.jpg) tattoo pic as found via Simulacrae’s repeat (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/ua-mystery-thread-4-the-canonn.195658/post-3114710) of MB’s original post in the UA Mysteries thread (ah, happy days!).

And I can’t see where the key you mention shows in his tattoo pic.
I don't know where MB had the original drawing from, Pa. I just assume he drew it or had it drawn following his instructions.
Not Cthulhu himself who appears, but Hastur the Unspeakable, jumping out of Carcosa, Aldebaran, with his servant Byaykhees. As I said in my original post.
Some differences between the drawing and the actual tattoo he shows are because it wasn't fully finished when the pic was taken, I think. You can see the St Michael (Brookes ?) flamigera sword blade not yet drawn. And the trumpet-angel above him is wingless.
The key is on the upper left corner, at the entrance of the Underworld. Where it has to be inserted ?.
Imho.
Oh, right ! It isn't on the actual tattoo ! Why ? Not yet drawn ? mmhh...
No keeyyyyy !
