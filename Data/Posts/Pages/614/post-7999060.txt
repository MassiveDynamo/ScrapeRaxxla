Thanks Han_Zen. Enjoyed that short story!
If I ever get around to coding a ship’s computer in VoiceAttack (akin to ANNA for SC) then I may well name her Iolanthe! Except what’s she got against coffee???
I think Iolanthe is referring to the evil navy brew, not coffee in general.

Still harsh though. Bad coffee is way better than no coffee.
