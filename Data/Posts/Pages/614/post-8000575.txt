The Codex is the key vs there will be no clues
The toast is the key vs there will be no clues
The toast is seeped in parallels to ancient Greek / Persian creation myths vs its just human behaviour making patterns, incidentally heres a pattern made from Pink Floyd songs.
Pink Floyd is the key vs was just pointing out out human brain draws patterns, its the way it organises things subconsciously, nothing to do with Floyd (but still worth sticking an album on while playing)
Dark side of the Moon has been disproven - there is no dark side of the moon (as it says on the album) but theres a side we never see from Earth so 'dark' to humans as in unknown as in Dark Ages (before satellites and orbiters)
DB actual quotes have been sourced and quoted accurately with proven links - hasnt actually helped at all but did take a surprisingly long time to stop the mis-quotes
DW quotes have been sourced and linked inc 2 retellings of the same event which has caused confusion but probably just memory or similar - nothing deceitful or underhand intended, no obfuscation intended
MB quotes have been found and scrutinised to some new excitement from us who never knew about them - doesnt give any real info as usual
Salome has been solved - no myths or legends involved, just human over-complication getting in the way, see above about Pink Floyd. Was immense fun while it lasted
Diversions have been offered by a mysterious ship exploding for 'no reason' in another thread, kept me occupied for 2 days anyway - probably not Raxxla
NPC have been to flight school and demonstrate some amazing flying synchronisation at various random points in the game, Nav Beacons and intsallations and some planetary installations and just randomly - exciting when it happens and you think it means something, until you've seen it 50 trimes at various points and realise its just flight practice for the NPC Display Team (its the programming that makes NPCs stay in certain zones at times so they fly in formation within it is all, I saw 3 flying round and round one of the Hawkins Gap sites as they were restricted to a very small airspace)
Myths / total exaggeration / total lies have been debunked - 'Someone honked it and moved on' has been buried like it should have been long ago with no source ever
Lave 2 has been confirmed as Lave 'missing' moon - don't know if you knew that 2 years ago or not?
Some have started to focus on the 'challenge' set by the DW and are trying various herculean feats to see if they get anywhere - eg mapping all the Constellations visible from Earth, trying to get various permits and ranks and unlocks. basically doing what us humans do, poking and prodding until something happens up or goes bang and then we say 'Right, what happened and can I repeat it?' ie learning
GaNet has been reduced to accurate 'factual' stories only - some story driven or parallel but it hasn't really kicked into gear yet, or its found the Park gear and its staying as it is now....to be confirmed either way by GalNet articles.

And thats about it, so probably not much headway but a lot of fun and distraction along the way
