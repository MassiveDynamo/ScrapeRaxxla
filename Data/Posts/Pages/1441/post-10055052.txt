The Scriveners Dredger was last seen in Oochost PC-C c29-0 (where it was the subject of the 'ownership debate').

If you put Oochost PC-C c29-0 and Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 (where the Scriveners Dredger was first spotted) into Galmap, you can see a potential 'direction of travel' vector. Might not mean anything, but I'm making the following assumptions
I kinda like that idea, it's something to look into. Hence why I was just down there and poking around a bit. DSS & FSS'ing. Nothing of interest so far. I may go back down there now and try following the path a bit.
Thank you.
