Were you looking for Seo Jin-ae too?
That too And all the other missing persons (other narratives) as well as looking for changes in missions, USSs, factions ...
T Tauri, Hind Mind. Proteus + Hesperus + missing dredgers (Scriveners), Ring Mine, 2Mass J03291977+3124572, Orion University leftovers (anything related to Orion in Oochost PC-C C29-0, places myths realted to Orion, due to the Orion nebula).
Now back at Wregoe HV-Z b15-0 to grab some logs and re-check the audio from the broken generators (there are some voices in the background at some interval).
Then I'll swing by Outotz ZC-Y c28-2 to have a look at the Wrecked Megaship.
The Tinfoil hat has 6 layers these days.

Generally just playing the game
