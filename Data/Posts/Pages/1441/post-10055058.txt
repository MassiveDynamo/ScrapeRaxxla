A few years back (more than 5 now!) I did a POI for the GMP covering what had been discovered by players about Guardian space and (possibly) Thargoid territory at that point.

It’s been slightly superseded now, but still might be worth a read for anyone who wasn’t around (or heavily involved) then.

(I hasten to add that there’s nothing in it that I think is Raxxla related, so this is really just for general interest as the topic’s been coming up a bit.)
