Cmdr @John [Panzertard] Stoutbeard has posted (many thanks!) on the alien architecture thread about the PF promotion message:
Alien archaeology and other mysteries: Breaking News, Theories and Tinfoil Hattery
The Quest for Raxxla thread would like to hear from anyone participating in the Thargoid War effort if they get a message saying they are now Allied with “PilotsFederation” (or similar) with a screenshot so we can be sure of the message spelling. In addition we also need to know whether they’re...
forums.frontier.co.uk

So it seems this Allied PilotsFederation reputation change message is still happening, despite the disparate spelling of Pilots’ Federation in the Shinrarta Tourist Beacons being “corrected” a while ago.

@Rochester do you remember when the spellings were corrected? I seem to remember you challenged Support over the issue a while ago, & they responded IIRC the TB spellings were valid, but they were “corrected” shortly thereafter. My own message was received during the 2020 Lockdown when I killed many Thargoid Scouts with resulting damage to my hands so I can’t forget it.

So, two years (?) later and the message is still occuring. Is this a bug or evidence of a silent progress tracking mechanism? IMHO if I were correcting a bug I’d attempt to correct all manifestations of that bug, not just in the TB. Are there any other tests we might conduct to verify this is a real effect? Or progress with the other possible factions within PF?

If there are multiple PF factions implemented then I believe it is highly likely one of them is the Dark Wheel that we should be befriending...
