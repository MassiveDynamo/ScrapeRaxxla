It just isn't fun when you are forced into a position involving defending ideas that may or may not shatter deeply held personal narratives of other CMDRs
It was never the intention, but I can relate. It's a little bit how this works when we're on a public forum, presenting ideas in open.
I try include a reminder that I don't attack the poster, but perhaps I disagree with the something in the idea/thesis/theories.
There's no real argument or debate if we don't question each-other ideas, picking out flaws or get better explanation to get a better understand. Picking out flaws & improving the strong points or rejecting the idea is what moves us forward.

But it shouldn't have to lead to 'defense' postings.
We all have different points of view, different baseline for our understanding or beliefs. Thus it leads to questions.

There is no right way (yet), ergo no wrong way
