TB0250 in Shinrarta explicitly says “There are also known cliques within the PF (The Dark Wheel is probably the most famous) that have their own agendas.”

So is this a definite clue that we should be looking at the different spellings of PF as representing the different factions? I suspect so. But I don’t understand why one of these factions was promoted to be a superpower. Is this in itself a clue? As I said I don’t understand the sim so cannot make any inferences on that.

Yes, there would definitely be conditions to be met in any Raxxla storyline, and finding/befriending Dark Wheel seems likely to be a key condition in that. But I seem to recall that DB is supposed to have said anyone can find it if they honk enough, which if true (I’ve never found a source reference for that) might mitigate against a complex sequence of conditions. I suspect it might be that the Dark Wheel storyline (if it still is/ever was in-game) is just another set of clues and the location may therefore be found by a “fairly simple” interpretation based on the Codex information, but is obfuscated by a RNG scan mechanism. I.E. you have to be in the right location and spam the scanner button until it appears. That would seem to fit with FD’s design philosophy
