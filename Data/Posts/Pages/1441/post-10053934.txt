Sorry, not what I intended to give that impression. I just think it was written for a different time, a different purpose for the other versions. For us when we played the other versions, that universe we played back then. I just don't have enough faith or capacity to sort out the 60% (or some other number) that may be correct.

I don't think FDev retconned anything. I just think they didn't have the capacity & resources to consider all the older lore (and 3rd parties) to make it fit with the new versions.


Very true, I think we do just this. We share information, discoveries and insights. It would be a bad thing if we all had only one theory and followed only one narrative.
Hence, I respect to what you do, with your way. And appreciate what you share with us.
Some of us just filter the information in a different way.

PS: I'm not trying to convince you to change your mind, it would be counterproductive for what we're trying to achieve - please stick with what works for you. Ok?

It's all good. It just isn't fun when you are forced into a position involving defending ideas that may or may not shatter deeply held personal narratives of other CMDRs. If we help each other, I think it is best to point someone in the right direction unless you know of obvious potential counterpoints and even then explore those ideas while respecting another CMDR's viewpoint. No one here wants to make this less enjoyable for others.
