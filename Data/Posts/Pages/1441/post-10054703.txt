Anyway, at the moment studying the lore, codexes, books, etc whilst I try to figure out where exactly this all takes the narrative for Raxxla. The third species bit is curious as is who was behind Soontill. Soontill per my scan of the system had trace amounts of Technetium. The fact Polaris may well be the same poses some interesting questions. We have the ingredients necessary for Holdstock version of Raxxla. Perhaps there is a lot more that can be fed into locating pieces of Raxxla. I need a bit to think on how all this interlinks. No clues and yet at the same time they are kind of buried everywhere. Ah the joys of gaming's most enduring mysteries. Clearly, brainstorming is in order.
