the first time the white stations were mentioned here(recent months) I had only heard a bit about them.

the info that was just put in here about the palms seems kind of relevant.
I did not know of them or why the stations were relevant in any way.
not counting the wiki's, because they get filled in as time goes by and things get found
where did that info come from?
the entire story of the white and why, not just the palms, or is that the actual reason behind the value of those stations?

I wonder if any have been fed to any thargoids yet.
part my fault for ignoring rares as much as I have.

so many items in this game, so many ways to test things.
