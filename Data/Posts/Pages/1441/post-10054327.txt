Discussion and questioning of each other’s ideas is the whole point of this thread. Nobody (apart from FD, and I’m increasingly unsure about them) has a clear view of the whole truth of the game. Individually we have our own interpretations, views, thoughts, concepts, ideas of the very few nuggets of information we have been given. Collectively through honest friendly discussion (& the occasional friendly argument) we may approach the “truth”. This is the way!
