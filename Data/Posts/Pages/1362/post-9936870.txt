EDDiscovery has just had an update. Discovery Observer - Find interesting bodies out there in the cosmos. 60+ built in searches for things like close binaries, planets within rings, etc. So sounds like it will replace EDObservatory.
I was looking at it a while ago but didn't quite seem 'updated' I will definately take another go. My biggest issue will be solved once I have migrated to PC from console and can actually use the journal "live" as opposed to sync'd to inara / eddm and then back to my pc where I can track the journal with the apps.
