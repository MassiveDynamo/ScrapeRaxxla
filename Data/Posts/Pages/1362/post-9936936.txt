Well, Ive wondered if the point of MBâ€™s tattoo was to emphasise the journey to Eden/Paradise Lost & Regained (didnt Milton also write Paradise Regained?). The message being whatever journey/mythology you want, you end up at the destination....
Which would take me back to my Alpha Centauri/Eden hypothesis (search this thread); but I searched for comets in ACent last week (see my sheet) but couldnt detect any-however when I was out at Eden a year so so ago I kept seeing npc appear out of nowhere which on current form seems often to be comet positions. Is there a way the search method perhaps is not detecting all of them? Maybe a physical range limit within system?
Big system. Could something silently orbit Proxima at an indecent distance? Theoretically, could a station directly orbit a star? Something nobody notices?
But it is a fairly scouted system, from eddb.io :
24430 ships passed through Alpha Centauri space, including 108 ships in the last 7 days.
14 ships passed through Alpha Centauri space in the last 24 hours.
