Trinkets we’re very recently identified via FD (in this thread) to be linked to the ‘story’ tied to those old DW missions out of SD, which are now confirmed as removed. Although still an active commodity FD confirmed trinkets were just a curiosity at best, they may turn that ‘story’ back on in the future.

What that all means is still open to interpretation, that’s not for us to rule out they don’t have another function, although FD hasn’t alluded this, it’s a presumption…

To aid our collective foolery regard’s audio being located, please record it, so it can be reviewed, tested and replicated and compared.

I’d test them myself but my PC is in dry dock and can’t record audio on console, at least not as well as one can on PC.
