well, as I tried to indicate by my post, it sounds like 1 is trying to converse in english
it sounds like at least 2 groaners communicating with each other in the same groan style.

and yes, I have the recordings I described. otherwise I would not have bothered to describe what I heard.
I spent way too much effort over the years pasting images and video's in the forums and it changed again and again.
point is, I put text in the forums. anything else I create or find or whatever can be shared but not by me fiddling with 3ed part sites to put a link here.
discord works.

Want to add, the reason I do it my way now instead of years ago. I was busy. Others were doing this. Others gave up. Most with words of discredit to fdev for broken things. also the removed things. (removed, possibly for a reason we have to discover, maybe someone triggered the next stage and walked away)
I do it because I do not believe them. Definitely don't believe in them or their style or methods.

I have uncovered and done too many things myself that others said can't be done. to believe what they have said.
And there are things to find, still.
I spend much effort trying to discover how certain things interact or react. more along the lines of exploding things....a few stations I would like erased....
I do spend most of my time on my BGS, even though there is no point. it is hard to break a habit that is a habit.
my time between helping my npc's and other stuff , I spend trying to find new ways to do things or get things, etc...

team effort is required. I am a bad team, but I tend to never give up. And I like helping.
and it would be nice if all my carriers and vast collection of ships didn't get blown up any time soon. and my npc's.
