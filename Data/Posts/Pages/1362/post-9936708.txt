The thing i love and hate about this hunt is the lack of info, i mean your brain will literally make anything work in order to justify your time

But on that note, those trinkets - are they what the things required for The Dark Wheel missions you can no longer get?
If it is your thinking, i like your thinking that it was a hint, after all they were treasure hunters. But once again a hint to what, float the Galaxy with a hold of things in hope of something...
