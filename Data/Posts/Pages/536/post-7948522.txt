Not a bad theory, generally, but a couple of comments:

1. Neutron star cones are a relatively late addition to the game - much later than the 'Door that's also a key' phrase in the mission text. That doesn't mean there weren't plans to add the cones from day 1, but it would mean that Raxxla wasn't reachable in the initial release.

2. Secondly, the 'Raxxla was visited but not honked' statement is an urban myth. There's no evidence that anyone from FDev ever said it, only references to references to someone who heard it from someone else.
1. It was never stated that raxxla was reachable. This was assumed and then everyone starts acting like it's a fact straight from the horses mouth.

2. Regardless of it having not been confirmed by FDev, it has equally not been denied. Meaning that there hasn't been any statements either way about this. Making it northern true nor false.

Or both true and false until someone opens the box and confirms the existing state of Schrodinger's Raxxla system
