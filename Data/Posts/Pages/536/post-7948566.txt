I think that could fit with "door that is also the key."
I've said this before but it surely was lost in the flow of this juggernaut, so I'll say it again. For what it's worth, I think the language from those missions has been de facto ret-conned. New players have no knowledge of them in-game and to use them as a key would be unfair to them and flies in the face of what FDev are trying to accomplish with the Codex. Obviously, one is free to do as one chooses, but for this CMDR, the only thing that is cannon for me now is "It's out there and we know what it is" and whatever is in the Codex. Everything else is vapid speculation.
