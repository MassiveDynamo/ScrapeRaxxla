I have a idea, wander through it with me- Simple old me is still just pondering the "gate that is also a key" line. Considering the mythos states there's no concrete evidence on what Raxxla even is...

You know, a gate that's also a key- that kind of sounds like a Neutron Star. You have to fly through it to get supercharged, right? What if there's a system only reachable from that one star? It would be both a Gate and a Key.

Raxxla could be that star... or the destination System, or a planet or moon inside said System. I mean, do you charge up on EVERY Neutron you come across, especially if your next system is only a small jump away?

OR- Is it possible for the game to be programmed that Supercharging from one specific star overwrites your navigation and forces you to jump to a specified system? Maybe one you can't normally target otherwise- like one without a star at all?

What if the only star in the Raxxla system collapsed into a Black Hole? Imagine jumping there (by my suggestion or any other means) a few years ago, early on in ED, and arriving to "no" star? Honking, and if you didn't have the old-school Advanced Scanner, seeing nothing because everything was over 250k LS away (or w/e intermediate range was)...

An inexperienced player might assume they'd encountered some kind of bug in the procedural generation and just leave. I know someone was quoted at a Lavecon saying players have already visited the system, but Raxxla went undiscovered.

I mean, there's a simple elegance to it, right?
