Wow... Anyone tried to get friendly with those Severian and Maxx, just to see if they are real players or what ? Looks like an FD's eye wink, to me.

About jump range, Cobras, etc... I am not sure that Rafe Zetter's assumption that there are "evil men" already inhabitating Raxxla is a substantial evidence that Raxxla has already been discovered by Humans.. Jason Ryder seems to have been in possession of some info about its location ( what has been lost will soon be recovered-map-Omphalos?) but we don't know what kind of ship he was going to use for his expedition. What was the max ranged ship at that time ?
