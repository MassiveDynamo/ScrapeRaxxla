Good point Sir! I hear it lots but never seen any evidence for it. Is it a myth, based on Jason Ryder's ship? (No proof he ever reached it, even in old lore I believe)

A lot of information is bandied about based on what people believe was said in livestreams, but there is no evidence. This “Raxxla can be found in a 30 ly Cobra” seems to be another unsubstantiated urban myth which crops up on this thread frequently. I think it is actually a misinterpretation of two things-this Quest for Raxxla (“there will be no clues”) and the Hunt for the Formidine Rift mystery; I believe that Drew Wagar said that the latter was findable with an unengineered Cobra implying 30 ly range or less (note that Rebecca in that storyline had an ancient Cobra).

Be that as it may, all the Raxxla Quest facts that we have evidence for are listed by Macros on the first page of this thread. If anyone can prove the origin of any such statement then I’m sure he’ll update that first page.
