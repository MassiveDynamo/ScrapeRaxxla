Just tossing ideas out there, but what about going to a places where certain objects line up? I think that could fit with "door that is also the key."
I started thinking about that a couple of months ago when I thought I found a couple nebulae that lined up with the LMC/SMC. Turned out it's just bad eyesight.

SPOILER

Those are two Nebulae above Odin's Hold. They're not as close as I originally thought, but pretty close.
