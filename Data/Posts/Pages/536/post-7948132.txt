Also, if you keep on my train of thought- It's claimed that we've been able to reach Raxxla in a Cobra3 since the beginning of the game. That means no engineering or jumponium. We know exactly the max range of a Cobra3. Are there any Neutrons within a plotable distance of the original starting System?

Is the math on Supercharge a set calculation? Is it always "+X Ly"? Does it vary by Star? Is it a percentage boost calculated on top of your current range?

Let's say I'm on the right track, and you can only reach Raxxla from a Supercharge- If you can get to that Neutron... you're still technically reaching Raxxla in a Cobra.

Now let's think about this as well- let's say its a star you could only reach via Supercharge, and you actually jump there...
"Omg, I found it! The third planet is Raxxla! Omgwtfroflcopteraghbddhvcscvjigb!!!"

And you chart that whole system. Congratulations. But then you go to leave... . You can't jump to any other Stars. Everything is too far. Your only option is to to get back. goes your Cartographic Data, and proof you discovered anything.

Which would also mean the statement "The system has been visited, " is true as well... especially back before engineering and jumponium synthesis was possible for our return trip.

If we can calculate an accurate Supercharged Cobra range, and there are candidate Neutrons in the right areas- we could figure a Superjump sphere around them, and then see if anything is particularly out of the way inside it...

Point of order!
WHo's claimed that we've been able to reach Raxxla in a Cobra3 since the beginning of the game???
