Thanks Edelgard. Your and Han_Zen’s comments are interesting. Just a corrigendum- the wake supression technology was Metadrive’s, obtained through murder of the Metadrive CEO and financial manipulation by the Club and given to Bill Turner (via Sirius Inc) to finalise. Clearly the Club want to hide their trail when they exit the bubble leaving the rest of humanity to fend for themselves against the Klaxian hordes.
Small point.
It was actually Raan Corsen that delivered the Meta-Drive papers to Bill Turner. Sirius never managed to capture him.
