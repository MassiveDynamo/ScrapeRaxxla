UPDATE: For those working on Operation Less than Three

With my limited time in-game, I've been focusing on performing only "Founder or Elite" (FoE) recommended ranked missions from Shinrarta Dezhra \ Jameson's Memorial station. I've only completed 20 missions to-date, without a duplicate. It's only a small sample, but seems promising.

Of note:
Missions always seem to be transporting non-leathal or helpful goods (Agri-Medicines, Evacuation Shelters, Basic Medicines, Uranium?, Consumer Tech, Performance Enhancers, Reactive Armour)
They pay way more than is needed I.e. $6M for transporting 180 things to station in one hop, and 2,000 LS away from system entry point.
A single faction may have multiple Founder or Elite (FoE) missions, even to the same location, however each one has a different 'goods' to be delivered.
If another mission for the same faction appears, with the same goods to be delivered, to the same location as a previously completed FoE mission, it isn't ranked as FoE. It may appear as Elite, but not FoE.
When I completed the FoE missions for the current favourite factions of The Dark Wheel, I got completely left-field missions for factions that I hadn't seen in a month or two.

So nothing concrete yet, but I'll keep plugging away, and keeping track of data. I just thought if anyone else is doing something similar they may have noted interesting things like this too. Remember, this is a work in progress, any data helping prove/disprove my findings is always welcome!
