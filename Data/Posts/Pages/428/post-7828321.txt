Ah, we’re talking at cross-purposes. I thought the conversation had digressed onto how rogue planets might be formed IRL, but from the above you’re still talking about their appearance in-game. My bad!

In-game I imagine Stellar Forge would have a process to generate a random number of them as exotic star systems and insert them into random positions in the galaxy, presumably as an A? Type system (though there might be a dedicated naming method for them, we haven’t tried looking for that!) because of their low mass.
Ah, yeah, I was talking both IRL and in-game.

With the stuff I was talking about, I was thinking of how the Stellar Forge models RL, and how rogue planets might be generated by it as part of that without the need for any additional processes. Can’t really see any reason why it wouldn’t work hypothetically, but then that’s still very much speculation as it’s dependent on details of how the SF works.

Anyway, like I say it’ll make for a good question to put to someone with the relevant knowledge in FD if the opportunity arises!
