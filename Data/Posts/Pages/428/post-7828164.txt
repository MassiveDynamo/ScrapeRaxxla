Yesterday we discovered a new kind of family entertainment, and it is quest room. Two adults and two daughters, 15 and 16 years old. We were in Berlin, click here. We got there occasionally, first, we wanted to visit a different quest, but something did not work there. So we did not have much choice and agreed to go where they could accept us. The younger daughter has an experience of harry Potter quest, but for us, it was absolutely new. We should admit that maybe we are new to it and cannot evaluate it properly, but it was very impressing. It is a great idea for family rest and just for leisure time.
