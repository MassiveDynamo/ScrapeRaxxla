Something else I have not seen posted is an accurate definition of “fernweh”. The codex describes it as a desire to see what one has never seen. Yet the true definition is a desire to travel to a place far away from home. It’s actuslly the opposite of homesick. We know that Raxxla is often heavily coupled with misdirection so this could be an instance of such. Secondly, I think that the signal detected near the core is still one of the best threads to investigate since very little to none has been resolved.
