Of course, Fernweh is the German for Wanderlust, so if we take the DW toast, and put it through the same process, but use the German variant of the cyper and then pop it into Google Translate, you get:

"It is the nlbic acid glycol sulphate onsd juice kvylve kj nfprkeiz! I'm not a fan of this movie, so wzear vk xyr ziluijg rspi! Xyr leyjrk'f cvpjj, liquid pvaii'f ssl, fru gje fjeiaern tj fhn zhlesbjh ojeigo. Xv Weokhe!"

Interesting that some of it translates. Probably coincidence.....or maybe we are on the right lines, but just not quite there?

I'm not convinced that Raxxla is obfuscated by anything as simple as a cipher on the Codex (and honestly, I'd be hugely disappointed if it was).

We were told there would be no clues, and yet here we are, trying desperately to find clues.
