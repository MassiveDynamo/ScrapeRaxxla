Probably searching for patterns that are not there, but "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" is also in double quotes. Run that through a Beaufort cipher with "FERNWEH" as the keyword. Now take the results and stick it into Google Translate. It detects it as Igbo (Nigerian) and translates it to: "Welcome to Zyonhutjaq Monnz"

Zyon is used as a synonym for Jerusalem.

A couple pages ago, somebody was asking where Jerusalem would be in space (I cant remember their lead) but they got knocked down with "In Jerusalem " and left it.

So I will ask myself - Where would Jerusalem (or Zyon) be in the Milky Way? Any ideas?

Of course, Fernweh is the German for Wanderlust, so if we take the DW toast, and put it through the same process, but use the German variant of the cyper and then pop it into Google Translate, you get:

"It is the nlbic acid glycol sulphate onsd juice kvylve kj nfprkeiz! I'm not a fan of this movie, so wzear vk xyr ziluijg rspi! Xyr leyjrk'f cvpjj, liquid pvaii'f ssl, fru gje fjeiaern tj fhn zhlesbjh ojeigo. Xv Weokhe!"

Interesting that some of it translates. Probably coincidence.....or maybe we are on the right lines, but just not quite there?
