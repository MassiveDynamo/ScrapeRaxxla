I think the most fitting for the spiraling stars, would be the different pole stars: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_star

If you pick any one of them and watch it for 25,770 years, you will see it spiral slowly out to about 40° declination and back in to the center of earth's axis at 90° declination(The Ophalos point / Axis Mundi). All of them will move in this extremely slow spiral.

This would also fit nicely with Vega as princess Astrophel, as Vega is a historical north pole star.

I think it just means the galaxy. 'Spiraling stars' being stars arranged in a spiral, rather than moving in spirals.

However, an example of a star which does follow an actual spiral would be one gradually falling into a black hole. A decaying orbit forms a spiral path.

stares hard a Source 2 again
