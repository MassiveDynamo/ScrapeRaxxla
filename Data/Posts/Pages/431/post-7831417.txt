I know there is a good chance you are right here....I hope your not!

There is part of me that still thinks it's on New Thebes, which has an atmosphere, and that's why we cant fund it.

I have no problem with different opinions, including we might not be able to get there yet.

My frustration came from the fact that, on this thread, we are all working hard, sharing ideas, having fun, playing with everything from Greek myths to ciphers, and I personally don't believe that "your all wasting your time" style comments would arise from people who are using this thread in the spirit in which it was intended, or had any goals other than spoiling other people's enjoyment

Yeah ... I just had someone post a comment on my YouTube channel the other day blabbing about how Raxxla is a fake, blah, blah, blah. I usually react the same way each time I encounter this: I ignore and don't respond.
