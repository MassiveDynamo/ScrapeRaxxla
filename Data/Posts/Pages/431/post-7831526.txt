“Every star in the night sky exists in Elite: Dangerous” — Braben

... I may have found something interesting but I won't have a chance to get into the game for several hours to verify it for myself. I'll have to fire up my frame shift drive and Hiciacet's python script and find out if there is a star sitting where I think it is. I can't find it in EDSM by its real-world name(s) but maybe Frontier has just given it a different name. Its part of the Teapot asterism: Alnasl AKA Gamma 2 Sagittarii, 10 Sgr, LTT 7181, HD 165135, HIP 88635, 2MASS J18054848-3025265. The Teapot asterism is also home to Tau Sagittarii which is the closest visible star to the source of the Wow! Signal (which you've heard me opine about tracing the signal as a possible beacon for Raxxla).

Edit: And, lo and behold, there is Alnasl in the lower left quarter of the image yelboc just posted!
