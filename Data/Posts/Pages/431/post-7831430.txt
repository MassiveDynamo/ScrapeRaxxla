I think the most fitting for the spiraling stars, would be the different pole stars: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_star

If you pick any one of them and watch it for 25,770 years, you will see it spiral slowly out to about 40° declination and back in to the center of earth's axis at 90° declination(The Ophalos point / Axis Mundi). All of them will move in this extremely slow spiral.

This would also fit nicely with Vega as princess Astrophel, as Vega is a historical north pole star.
Spiraling stars? North star? Just point your camera at Polaris and set it for timelapse:
SPOILER
Of course the ultimate spiraling stars orbit around Sagittarius A*:
