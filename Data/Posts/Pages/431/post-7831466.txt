Spiraling stars? North star? Just point your camera at Polaris and set it for timelapse:

Of course the ultimate spiraling stars orbit around Sagittarius A*:

All stars move in circles seen from a defined view point. Spiraling on the other hand suggests a movement where the next revolution is larger or smaler, depending on the direction. Either that or a movement perpendicular to the rotational direction.

The Cambridge dictionary defines a spiral as: "a shape made up of curves, each one above or wider than the one before"

In earths sky, only the stars that are on the 'pole star circle', will make a complete spiral that reaches the axis mundi. All the others will have a smaller and a larger circle, but they never become stationary in the sky.

The northern pole star circle.
