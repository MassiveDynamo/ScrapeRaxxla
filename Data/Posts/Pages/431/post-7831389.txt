It's true, I'm actually Drew Wagar and I got David drunk one night on peach schnapps and he told me where Raxxla is. When you find it you'll see it tagged by Cmdr Salome.

Honestly, I'm glad I've finally admitted it. Things all got a bit meta when I was talking about writing about myself in the third (fourth?) person on a livestream a while ago.

And at least I can get rid of this stupid penguin avatar.

Some of the above may not be entirely accurate.
But the penguin is definitely stupid.
