Think someone posted that saying on this thread last year, but couldnâ€™t come up with the source vid. I did a bit of Googling but couldnt find it. Maybe another urban moth?
Unless I dreamt it (possible) I think I heard/read it first hand. I don't tend to place too much weight on what others say! Fairly sure it was related to Raxxla, especially as I feel it was 2014/15/16, but of course can't be sure.
