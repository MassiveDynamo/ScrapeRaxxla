what i do find interesting about Jaques Station is this:

Jaques Station's jump from Gliese 1269 to Colonia covered a distance of 21,890.11 ly, which is the longest single recorded jump made by a human vessel in Elite Dangerous.

Which seems to say that depending on the "hyperdrive" used, and enough fuel on board, excessivly long individual jumps, are TECHNICALLY possible in the game. Thuogh it would seem only for Jaques Station at the current time.

BUT that would lead back to my theory weeks ago, that Raxxla (if a planet or station) or TDW Station, maybe also have "hyperdrives" of some sort that have not been told to us, and that those locations could be "moblie" in the sense that on a regular basis, they switch or alternate between a handful of systems.
