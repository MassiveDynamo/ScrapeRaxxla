While we’re reminiscing about FD sayings...I remember Michael Brookes saying something about things being hidden off the ecliptic cos people never look there. Couldn’t find it via Google Advanced Search. Anybody else remember it/got the reference? I think it was in one of the old UA and alien mysteries (Canonn) threads.

It would be a worthwhile, but full-time, occupation to document all the FD “hints” from over the last 5 years!!!
