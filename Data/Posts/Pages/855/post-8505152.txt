I don't want to start any rumors, so this is also a question for the old-timers. I seem to remember that there was once a rather "official" statement that they liked the idea that a lone wolf would solve the mystery. - Is there any truth to the memory or did I get something wrong in my head over the years.
But if I remember it right, I would consider the new initiative to be at least questionable...

Might be FRift, might be Raxxla,I vaguely remember it too.

However the initiative (apparently) started off trying to get TDW membership via BGS play, and now according to OA’s video it’s all about Raxxla. Someone’s got hold of the wrong end of the stick. According to Codex TDW don’t know where Raxxla is and are still looking after hundeds of years...can’t have been looking very hard!
