It will be interesting to see what happens with that initiative, but playing that sort of BGS machinations needs a lot of players and I cant help but think that recruitment to TDW should be feasible by a single player. And I suspect (although the Codex seems to link them), that finding Raxxla is not dependent on recruitment to TDW (who apparently may not know Raxxlaâ€™s location).
It all adds interest to the possibilities...
I don't want to start any rumors, so this is also a question for the old-timers. I seem to remember that there was once a rather "official" statement that they liked the idea that a lone wolf would solve the mystery. - Is there any truth to the memory or did I get something wrong in my head over the years.
But if I remember it right, I would consider the new initiative to be at least questionable...
