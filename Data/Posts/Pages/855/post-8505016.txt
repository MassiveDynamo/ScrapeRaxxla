I don't want to start any rumors, so this is also a question for the old-timers. I seem to remember that there was once a rather "official" statement that they liked the idea that a lone wolf would solve the mystery. - Is there any truth to the memory or did I get something wrong in my head over the years.
But if I remember it right, I would consider the new initiative to be at least questionable...
I'm pretty sure that comes from the Formidine Rift thread, with Drew Wagar saying that a single player could solve it/find the mystery in the Rift.

Good luck searching the Void, simulacrae (and anyone else daring the 55 KLY journey). I went out there about a year ago to survey a sector called Phaa Chrie, as I thought it might have been a reference to 'Far Cry' or perhaps the cry of sirens... . I never found anything relevant but there are certainly some pretty impressive sights to see out on the Rim.
