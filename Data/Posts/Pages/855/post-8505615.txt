My memory is David Braben answering a question in an interview (not sure whether text or video) by saying something like "it would probably take lots of people working together to solve it, but in a way I quite like the idea of a single cmdr managing it on their own".

But of course I could easily be misremembering.
This rings a bell for me but I'm sorry that I still can't put my finger on it. ... Might also come from the rift story.
