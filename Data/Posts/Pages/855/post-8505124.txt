I don't want to start any rumors, so this is also a question for the old-timers. I seem to remember that there was once a rather "official" statement that they liked the idea that a lone wolf would solve the mystery. - Is there any truth to the memory or did I get something wrong in my head over the years.
But if I remember it right, I would consider the new initiative to be at least questionable...
My memory is David Braben answering a question in an interview (not sure whether text or video) by saying something like "it would probably take lots of people working together to solve it, but in a way I quite like the idea of a single cmdr managing it on their own".

But of course I could easily be misremembering.
