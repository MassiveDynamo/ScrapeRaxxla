Aside from the previous elite games, is john jameson a character in any of the books and what all do we know about him? Im only familiar with a few logs that give some references but aside from that i know nothing. Could anyone be so kind as to fill me in? You can send me a direct message if you'd prefer

Lave Revolution mentions that Walden had a chance meeting with Peter Jameson in 3125 when he was buying a Cobra Mk3...

The book doesn't have any Jamesons in it but it does have Watt Tyler... aka Commander Javelin Saunders making an appearance.... the once leader of INRA counterintelligence from FFE (believed to be dead), who was blamed for the assassination of Mic Turner and might have been responsible for the sabotage of John Jamesons ship , as well as a host of other things (Mycoid?)... in Lave Revolution he sabotages the destroyer Yamorro during the battle for Lave Station ...
