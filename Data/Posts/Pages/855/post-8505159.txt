My memory is David Braben answering a question in an interview (not sure whether text or video) by saying something like "it would probably take lots of people working together to solve it, but in a way I quite like the idea of a single cmdr managing it on their own".

But of course I could easily be misremembering.

Think someone posted that saying on this thread last year, but couldnâ€™t come up with the source vid. I did a bit of Googling but couldnt find it. Maybe another urban moth?
