While we’re reminiscing about FD sayings...I remember Michael Brookes saying something about things being hidden off the ecliptic cos people never look there. Couldn’t find it via Google Advanced Search. Anybody else remember it/got the reference? I think it was in one of the old UA and alien mysteries (Canonn) threads.

It would be a worthwhile, but full-time, occupation to document all the FD “hints” from over the last 5 years!!!
I remember this one. It was when he was a guest on one of the Thursday evening livestreams with Ed Lewis, whom I think was exploring near Sgr A* / the Galactic Core at the time. I think he might also have made the comment about the infinite range of the ADS making things a bit too easy in the same livestream.
