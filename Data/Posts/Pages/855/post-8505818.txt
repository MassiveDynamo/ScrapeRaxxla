Unless I dreamt it (possible) I think I heard/read it first hand. I don't tend to place too much weight on what others say! Fairly sure it was related to Raxxla, especially as I feel it was 2014/15/16, but of course can't be sure.

If you can find the reference I, for one, would be interested. We need to get these utterances properly documented!
