Aside from the previous elite games, is john jameson a character in any of the books and what all do we know about him? Im only familiar with a few logs that give some references but aside from that i know nothing. Could anyone be so kind as to fill me in? You can send me a direct message if you'd prefer

See the tourist beacons list third tab
(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eu30UyjpQrWexAglwD1Ax_GaDz4d7l8KD76kSzX4DEk/htmlview#). I seem to remember one of them said he was the first Elite commander? Or was that one of the other Jamesons? And there’s the Jameson crashed ship logs that tell about the Thargoid delivery mission (see Canonn site if you haven’t been there; its a good place to get rare data mats for engineering!)
