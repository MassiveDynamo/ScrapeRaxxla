I'm half way through my survey of Phaa Chrie sector in The Void and am currently planning to head home in two week's time. My play time has been erratic but I've averaged over an hour a day for the last couple of weeks, so there is likely to be more to find but I should have visited all the B stars in the sector by then. There is one neutron star system that is helping me to reduce my travel times. I'll gather my findings for a more detailed report when I've turned the data in (if I survive) but here are the highlights for now:
Brightest star: There is a B8 IIIa star that is the only luminosity class III star I have yet seen here. Nothing of note in this system (or the neutron star system).
Biological sources: So far I have found two systems containing surface biological signals but no Notable Stellar Phenomena. One of the biologicals was Crystalline Shards and there were three moons with multiple (4+) sources, whilst the other was Rubeum Bioluminescent Anemones, which were confined to a single signal source on a single planet.
Earth-like Worlds: 3 (one discovered and mapped already)
Ammonia Worlds: 5
Other: a class I gas giant with an orbital eccentricity of 0.9800
