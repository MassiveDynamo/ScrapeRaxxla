Wookey...

Wookey hole...

Hole...

A hole is defined by the absence of something...

A hole doesn’t exist in it’s own right...

A hole is a place that isn’t a place...

So it is in the Rift!!!

(Or The Void. Or Hawking’s Gap. Etc. Etc.)



Edit - realising that some probably won’t have heard of it, I’d better just clarify that Wookey Hole is a place!
