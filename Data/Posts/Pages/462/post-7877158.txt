Reporting in on the crane constellation:

All systems listed in the Wikipedia article have now been checked. Systems with GG8's were scanned and 8th moons mapped including moons of moon options. The eigth moons were eye-balled with polar and equatorial orbits to look for any moving objects around them.

Sadly nothing of interest found. No systems matched the LYTA star types and no T type stars were found at all.

The S-type star in pi-1 gruis was interesting as its very large making its disk clearly visible upto 1000ls and the correct colour for the DW codex image, but no GG8 in that system

Some stars are not in game under any name I could find for them. They are:
BC Gru
CE Gru
RZ Gru
U Gru
WASP-95

I suspect the reason they are not in game is that they have no established distance from SOL in RL astronomy. Also WASP-95 may have been added to the catalogue after ED was launched.

Another theory bites the dust !

Special mention to CMDR Honeydapooh who had covered most of the ground after I first mentioned this theory. Thanks for helping drive this forward. There were still a couple of systems left to be checked though.

Annexe:
From here:
whats the significance of Lyta Cranes name? Its definately odd - do we look for L-Y-T-A systems in general? Do we check out the lyra constellation too?
It didnt take long to search a constellation list - should we set up a project to map all constellations between a group of comdrs?
S-type stars - there are lists in RL astronomy that might be worth exploring. Work for DW search has concentrated so far on EDSM listed systems.
other coedx possible matches - RL lists there also..
