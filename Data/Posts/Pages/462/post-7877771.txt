Wait! You're THAT Peter A Carter? Lol, there's one of your books lying around in our office somewhere

Edit:
Thankfully it's not the one I'm using as a monitor stand
Yeah. I'm the database Pete Carter, not the kids books Pete Carter. Although I was thinking about writing a childrens book next. What do you think of "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" as a title?
