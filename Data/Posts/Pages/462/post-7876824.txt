Problem with exotic stars is that we’ve never seen one to date so we don’t know what one would look like in real life. That means elite dangerous has a version of what it believes one to look like, therefore we may be after a wild goose chase :/
Exotic Stars is a catch all term - it encapsulates anything outside of the known star types. It’d be risky to treat it as though FD have a single look in mind to cover what could be a large group of objects.

Also there’s a good chance that they just have the Exotic star class there to cover the possibility of RL discoveries so they can be added to the game and/or for general future additions to the game.

(I’m not saying there’s no value whatsoever in looking though, just to be clear.)
