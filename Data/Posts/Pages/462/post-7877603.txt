Ok, I know if I mention ciphers one more time....but....."a door that is also the key" could "door" be a cipher key?

No idea about localisation on these old missions.

Just came to me as I was jumping through AUCOKS and thinking "that sounds like a cypher output that I disregarded at some point".

Which reminds me....if you put fernweh though a German variant Beaufort cipher, using raxxla as the key, you get weokhey, which (with space added) is an anagram of "who key" or "how key"
