I've seen interesting features like that on plenty of occasions - but on investigation there's nothing significant.
I think it's shadows - sometimes they show up at altitude but kinda disappear as you get lower, maybe because they get smeared out.

Yes I agree, but it was the “triangular feature” at the bottom end of the linear feature that made me think of Guardian archeological remains.
