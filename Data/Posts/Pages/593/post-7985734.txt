Well, given that quantum physicists have allegedly found error codes and handlers built into the universe, our "real" universe could be a high simulation, similar to the ED universe. Now THAT is total emersion!
We need those guys on this thread. Lol

So if I have this right...we are actually in the 'matrix' right now and Raxxla is in the real world (probably in Cambridge), or is the real world, when we somehow remove the Omphalos Rift glasses? Now that answers all the questions, and the 'stick your fingers in the socket' is a clue on how to blow the circuitry and force us into real life. Aha!

i have noticed some radio chatter when using the FSS on Outposts today that I haven't noticed before, probably just missed it before but could be something in this line of thinking about 'sirens of the deepest void'.

Has anybody actually confirmed/tested that there is no cheese in the moon? I think we have proved what is there in terms of minerals etc but not sure anyone has actually applied the cheese melt test method to rule it out. I saw something a while ago with a Mr Wallace and his assistant Grommit where I think they found some Wensleydale but that may have been a statistical outlier.
