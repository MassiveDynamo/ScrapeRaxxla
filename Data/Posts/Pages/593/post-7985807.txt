Dunno ..heard nothing on map. FSS'ed stars sound different. D-star is something like "elf music" of high frequency, my old ears barely hear it. NS are human whispering + thargoids sound - 1 by 1 ... Other stars just like drums.
Actually it has been so long since I played I think I might have screwed up, and the music is on the System Map for each distinct type of star and planetary body, but I could be wrong there also and it may be on the Galaxy Map as well. Han Zen or someone will jump in at some point and correct me. Too much Lavian brandy and time spent listening to Unknown Artefacts and wandering the Formidine Rift with space madness, now at an advanced stage, along with memory failure.
