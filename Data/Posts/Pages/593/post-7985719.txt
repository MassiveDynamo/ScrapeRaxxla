Only visual evidence in Galnet is 20 SEP 3302 President Jasmine Halsey talking about a place of paradise though this might not be Raxxla a lot people have thought she might have seen it.

And again 25 May 3305 Which we can only assume Gan Romero the mechanic who stole the ship which match the stories that President Halsey described in her dreams based on the journal Romero kept.

Again this is all speculation and possible lies due to the Club influence of the Galnet narrative. Only question is how far does the Club wanna lie or are they willing to sprinkle some truths for there own agenda.

Based on the description of the place Halsey describe this could correlate with the codex of Raxxla

El Dorado, Atlantis, Kingdom of Prester John were all considered places of paradise.
