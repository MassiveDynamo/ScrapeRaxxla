Is it the same music if you zoom into it on the Galaxy Map? (Or out if you are Han Zen). All the systems have music on the Galaxy Map. I haven't really played since they introduced that FSS mini-game/time sink thing other than trying unsuccessfully to get any of it to work for a brief, drunken period of time. I'm taking a wild guess they reused the same music.
Dunno ..heard nothing on map. FSS'ed stars sound different. D-star is something like "elf music" of high frequency, my old ears barely hear it. NS are human whispering + thargoids sound - 1 by 1 ... Other stars just like drums.
