Raxxla is were it always has been never left the Lave system... just theories and stories obscured it as well as a permit-lock! Crater on Lave 2 is (looks like a wheel) when night vision is of its a Dark wheel a place that isnt a place...a door that is also a key! That wheel is the door and the key to to Raxxla.Think it was in one of Drew wagers books...we were told were it was we just didnt listen thats why there will be no clues because they gave it us on a plate...we have just got to figure out how to get in (thargoid sensor may have something to do with it)
