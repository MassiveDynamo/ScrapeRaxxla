Btw, white dwarf plays music ...8-0 ..if u FSS it. BPM 17113-A this one ...it's pure D.
Is it the same music if you zoom into it on the Galaxy Map? (Or out if you are Han Zen). All the systems have music on the Galaxy Map. I haven't really played since they introduced that FSS mini-game/time sink thing other than trying unsuccessfully to get any of it to work for a brief, drunken period of time. I'm taking a wild guess they reused the same music.
