The mapping is important - if it already reveal structures as science centers then there is chance it can reveal the Dark Wheel station too. Visual checking is good.

And I think it is useful to check Orrery for uncommon orbits. For example some more complex systems have main sequence star orbiting as child primary/parent star. I always recollect this red dwarf in Maia. Orrery is very useful in such case.
