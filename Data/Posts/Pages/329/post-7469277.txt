I'll check HR 6001 next time I log on. As for narrowing down the list, I would suggest the following criteria:
This being said, a red dwarf system would need the gas giant to be so close to the star that the station would be more easily found by passers-by (unless it was a very distant secondary star). Red giants would also attract the attention of explorers. From that perspective, it might be fruitful to search for systems where the gas giant with 8+ moons is close to a star other than the primary, especially in those thousands of systems with a red dwarf primary star. The catch here is that if the gas giant does orbit a star other than the primary, then the initial search needs to cover star types other than type M in order to find which have red dwarf companions!

Thanks commander! I put you down for HR 6001.
My search was just for a Red Giant/Super Giant in the same system as a Gas Giant w/ 8 moons. The Red Giant doesn't have to be the primary.

However, checking all the stars on the list via Galaxy Map shows that none are M9. The darkest giant is an M8, and that is still very orange.

I'm refining my search to take temperature & size into account.
