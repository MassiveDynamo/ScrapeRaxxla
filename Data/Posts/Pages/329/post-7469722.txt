Just to be clear, for the people who are going down the list of 8ths... ysll are looking for stations with your eyes, not your scanners, right? The way i understand it, we are looking physically for points of light. Like we'll have to drop close and fly the rest of the way if we find it.

Yes, going to every potential moon and doing full circle around it trying to see faintest station light. So far, no luck. Moons are too far away from star to be able to produce anything similar to Codex image.
