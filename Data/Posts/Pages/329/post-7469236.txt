The thought has been occurring more and more to me that the Omphalos Stone might be the Martian Artifact. Maybe it's a key that opens up the Omphalos Rift, the gateway at Raxxla? If so, then finding Raxxla could be just the start - activating the gateway might be tricky if it's not already open (or might we need to shut it?!). Chances are that the Martian Artifact is the most heavily-guarded object in human-occupied space (unless that 'winking cat' thief has it on their hit list). Right now, I don't see how to follow-up on this hypothesis, so I'm wary about following this line of thinking too far.
