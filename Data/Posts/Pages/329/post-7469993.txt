Question for anyone who has managed to read the sonnets that may be related to the Raxxla codex entry. Taking a step back I think I’ve been looking at things too fragmentedly. Assuming Omphalos and Astrophel and the Spiriling Stars to be different clues.
The Omphalos Rift is said to be mentioned in several stories which seem to originate in an unnamed book that bares a resemblance to the children’s book “Princess Astrophel and the Spiriling Stars” (I think we often forget the Princess part, dunno if it’s significant tho.) so it would seem that we are to look for a mention of an item of significance, power, Magic etc within the works for a clue(s). Has anyone found mention of an item matching that description within the sonnets?

Well, there's Cupid's bow. And Sonnet 13:

Phoebus was judge between Jove, Mars, and Love,
Of those three gods, whose arms the fairest were:
Jove's golden shield did eagle sables bear,
Whose talons held young Ganymede above:
But in vert field Mars bare a golden spear,
Which through a bleeding heart his point did shove:
Each had his crest; Mars carried Venus' glove,
Jove in his helm the thunderbolt did rear.
Cupid them smiles, for on his crest there lies
Stella's fair hair, her face he makes his shield,
Where roses gules are borne in silver field.
Phoebus drew wide the curtains of the skies
To blaze these last, and sware devoutly then,
The first, thus match'd, were scantly gentlemen.
