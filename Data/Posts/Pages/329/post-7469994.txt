That is what mapping do too - that medical centers, science centers, satellites and similar structures are on orbit of the planet and visible in navigation after mapping. We found this behaviour when searching in the bubble.
Theyâ€™re there after FSS scanning. No need to map. (Also they should show up within a certain distance anyway, usually 1,000 ls.)
