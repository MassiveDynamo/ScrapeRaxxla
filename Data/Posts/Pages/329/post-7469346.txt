One part of the mythology states that Chronos swallowed his childern and Rhea hid Zeus somehwere ( can't remember off the top of my head) wraps Omphalos stone and was given to Chronos who had swallowed the stone assuming it was Zeus.

Other parts said that Zeus release 2 eagles to fly opposite directions until they came back around. Then Zeus threw Omphalos stone into the sky to see where it would land. When the Stone landed on Delphi Zeus had declared that Delphi was at the center of the world (navel of Earth)

Funny thing is if this all has to do something with the Guardian Ancient Key being needed for all of this. I can only assume considering how the Thargoid Sensor worked to find certain things.
