Thatchinho: Maybe you are right and I just didn't see it before. I remember only that after probes finished scanning I got "human" signals to top right info box - place where I usually have list of "geological" POIs. So I checked navigation panel and found for example that medical centre or satellite (not small satellite but some quite big orbital station).
