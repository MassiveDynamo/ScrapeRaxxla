In a "galaxy-centric" point of view:

Omphalos is the "center", then Sgr A*.
Black holes like the stars. They swallow them. So, Astrophel. (Yum !)
All the stars are spiralling around.
It's also some kind of rift through the space-time tissue.
It also can be viewed as the brow of the MW.
Raxxla burns as it orbits close Sgr A*. (Some physical phenomenon due to the BH "moving" the space-time and therefore giving energy to the bodies orbiting close to it.)

Why can we approach BHs without danger, in ED ? Because we must be able to find Raxxla eventually.

'Where are we placing Raxxla, Mike ?'
' Mmmh... Must be somewhere iconic. What about inside a BH, Dave ?'
"Sgr A*, then ! "

"Where is Raxxla ?"
"Oh, it's IN the MW."

You bet it is... [haha]
