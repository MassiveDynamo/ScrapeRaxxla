Assuming there would be no unnecessary mentions in the Codex;



I think this part states that old Raxxla lore has been ditched, Raxxla is no longer a portal to parallel universes, but several parts of the old lore are still legit and have some clues. So Omphalos Rift is no longer relevant imho.

Potentially I suppose. But idk why they would add new items to old lore in order to discard it in the same breath. Omphalos Rift, Astrophel and the Spiriling Stars, concealed hints and the author of them are all new with the release of the codex. I personally doubt it’ll lead to another galaxy, but parallel dimension isn’t the same thing. Could be that it puts you into another instance all its own with stuff in it that you can’t access or lock onto via the galaxy map.
