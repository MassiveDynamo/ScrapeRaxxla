Assuming there would be no unnecessary mentions in the Codex;

Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described
as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universe can be accessed. These details
however, were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to children's story Princess
Astrophel and Spiralling States, and soon lost credibility. Undaunted, some Raxxla
seekers insisted that the stor's author had cunningly concealed facts about the
mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to see.

I think this part states that old Raxxla lore has been ditched, Raxxla is no longer a portal to parallel universes, but several parts of the old lore are still legit and have some clues. So Omphalos Rift is no longer relevant imho.
