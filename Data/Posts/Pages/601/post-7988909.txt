I forgot to mention all planets are wheels circling around the invisible sacred fire, which Earth too, must circle. One merely reaches to catch a glimpse of royalty through a hole where the spoke would be. This is also why the Earth doesn't fall down unsupported, as quite evidently, there are no giant tortoises.


SPOILER: SACRED CYCLES

(Edit: I don't visit the Sol system very often though)
