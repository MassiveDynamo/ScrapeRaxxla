@Macros Black - Still on the hunt for a NS binary, in close proximity to each other, near Sag A. Trouble is, although I'm pretty technical in my own little field; sound, video & general internet type things, are not remotely my bag quite honestly (I'm getting old!), and playing on PS4 certainly doesn't help. Before I invest a hugh amount of time, are you (or anybody else) able to work with the following format, to pull out some useful comparisons? I know that the current raw form will not be much help, without somebody more capable than I lending a hand...

This also got me wondering....The radio source found 1kly above Sol that didn't "quite" line up with Sag A* - I wonder if it could originate from this massive (seemingly largely unexplored) field of neutrons?

Check out recent expedition waypoints. On DW2 there was a double, or triple, NS system (memory going!).
