Is everyone else scanning every “H” moon they find?

Scanning or mapping?

I always scan catalog systems and sometimes I'll do others, depending on what's in the FSS spectrum. Since I discover bodies by parallax then I only know there's 8 moons when I've done the fly-by so I'm probably missing a whole bunch.

I'll map an H moon if I find one that's an HMC.
