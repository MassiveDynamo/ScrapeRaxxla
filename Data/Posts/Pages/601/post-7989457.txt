Giant gas and 8th moon Lunacy? Try applying the (alchemical) principals of the Farmer's Almanac to hair care and only cut it when the Moon is 3rd quarter waning in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces) and ideally trine (120+/-6 degrees) Sol to encourage moist and healthy roots (ooh er!) so it stops falling out.

Macrocosm, microcosm, as above, so below. Probably also good for Norwegian carrots.

There is an idea. Does britain have an equivilant to the farmers almanac. Maybe they took a page out of that book. Maybe it can lead the way.
