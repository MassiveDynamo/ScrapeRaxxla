In Hecata system we have planets "Harrison XIII" and "Tomie" ... + there is beacon "jewelled rings".... anything pops in mind?
Ok..nvm...beacok says "Cmdr Cannon" ... guess player's named beacon.

Also there are 7 systems locked with undiscovered permits near Sol: https://ed-board.net/en/?m=permit
4 of them are locked by pilot's fed & 3 are not known.

Intresting old vid about "witch reach" system, that time u could open sys map yet
