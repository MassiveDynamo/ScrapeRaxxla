That would do me! Hmmm. Maybe a waist reducer would help as well!
Resist the urge to break-fast until after lunch, and the beer probably isn't helping much.

Giant gas and 8th moon Lunacy? Try applying the (alchemical) principals of the Farmer's Almanac to hair care and only cut it when the Moon is 3rd quarter waning in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces) and ideally trine (120+/-6 degrees) Sol to encourage moist and healthy roots (ooh er!) so it stops falling out.

Macrocosm, microcosm, as above, so below. Probably also good for Norwegian carrots.
