1. Mission #2 "Obfuscated on the outer rim" (The Call to Adventure).
The Call To Adventure is the first step of the Heroes Journey mono-myth as presented by the worlds leading mythologist, Joseph Campbell.

I instantly bristle at any such statement. Who voted him the world’s leading mythologist? (Wasn’t J Campbell perchance??) Is there a Royal Society of Learned Mythologists to form an appropriate professional body? What is their Continual Professional Development plan? How was the vote conducted and who supervised it? What were their credentials for that supervision?
