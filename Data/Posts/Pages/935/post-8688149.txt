Well a society of mythologists is plural, whereas I'm stating him top dog as a sole individual. I'm really not sure who gave him the rank, or if I made it up.
However, I would like to counter by asking; considering his apparent and obvious mastery over the understanding of comparative mythology, and as a pioneer of the Hero's Journey mono-myth, which is studied by academia globally, is his rank as top dog (given he is clearly understood worldwide as a master of it), or not absolute top dog, relevant to the evidence put forward?

Just read his wiki page and fair play, probably deserves the title or perhaps "most famous mythologist" ;-)

Died October 30, 1987 (aged 83)

Damn.... can't ask him to solve this one... ;-)
