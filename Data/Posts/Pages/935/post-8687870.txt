I've been sifting through this thread for lots of very curious ideas. One I thought of was that it could be a play on the old term 'Rax'
1. to stretch or extend
2. to reach out
3. to pass or give (something to a person) with the outstretched hand; reach "rax me the salt"
4. to strain or sprain
So maybe they are just reaching for an Excel file?
Alternately, FDev are stretching this mystery into infinity
