I instantly bristle at any such statement. Who voted him the world’s leading mythologist? (Wasn’t J Campbell perchance??) Is there a Royal Society of Learned Mythologists to form an appropriate professional body? What is their Continual Professional Development plan? How was the vote conducted and who supervised it? What were their credentials for that supervision?

Well a society of mythologists is plural, whereas I'm stating him top dog as a sole individual. I'm really not sure who gave him the rank, or if I made it up.
However, I would like to counter by asking; considering his apparent and obvious mastery over the understanding of comparative mythology, and as a pioneer of the Hero's Journey mono-myth, which is studied by academia globally, is his rank as top dog (given he is clearly understood worldwide as a master of it), or not absolute top dog, relevant to the evidence put forward?
