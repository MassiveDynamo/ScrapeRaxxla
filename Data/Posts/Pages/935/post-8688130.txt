I liked Djidjel’s post yesterday trying to decode the name. I suspect the end character A might indicate Raxxla is, or is at, the primary star, which just leaves RAXX. I tried to decode this yesterday, using ROT1-13, then used the code workbench with Holdstock, Braben & a few other things as the key but didn’t come up with anything.
hope you tried "Fernweh" and "Farsickness"
