Please don't take this as an insult.
If I cannot engage you enough to look beyond the first line, than I have failed, and my discussion and presentation of what I perceive to be possible clues, cannot be heard, or understood.

I like all clues/theories/suppositions/assumptions/hypothesise - especially with Pink Floyd in the background ;-)

Keep going!
