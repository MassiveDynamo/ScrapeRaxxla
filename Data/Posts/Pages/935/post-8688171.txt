Just read his wiki page and fair play, probably deserves the title or perhaps "most famous mythologist" ;-)

Died October 30, 1987 (aged 83)
Damn.... can't ask him to solve this one... ;-)

Ah. “Most famous” is a bit different from “the world’s leading”!
The former suggests a greater proportion of the lay (unqualified in the field) population was aware of him than other practitioners in his field; the latter suggests his recognition as a leading practitioner by a body of learned professionals with a scheme of peer review and professional development.
Bit like comparing The Sun with The Lancet

@guru: don’t know, didn’t get past the first line!

I support the cause of space whales, certainly in any confrontation with petunias....
