Sorry, I meant who has discussed this topic already and where ? OP is suggesting this in his post.
I have several times, in this thread and even in the old Rift thread. Didn't come up with anything particularly useful.
The problem is that there are a bunch of ways to give coordinates and quite a few ways to represent numbers as letters. On top of that comes possible negative numbers and decimals. Even origo is unknown to us.

Even if we go with Sol as origo and only whole positive numbers, it's hard. Is R=18 and A=1? If so, is RA 19 or 181?

It quickly becomes very complex, without anything else to correlate to.
