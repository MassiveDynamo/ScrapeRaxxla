Alternately, FDev are stretching this mystery into infinity

Thats kind of the funny thing, fdev have done very very little. Our imagination has done it all. We have one Codex entry and a linked one in the DW entry and thats basically it. Some missions that disappeared almost certainly referred to it but they just stopped.

Also just to remind that the name Raxxla was in use before its use in ED. So if the name is a code or clue in itself it is a ret-conned or contrived code, not the original intention. Dunno if that helps or hinders? May mean it was forced into a certain system, may mean a system was especially created to match.
