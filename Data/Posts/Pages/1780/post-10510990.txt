If raxxla has been in the game since the beginning, then it has been in pareco since the beginning, and the "raxxla lore" was added to codex to push people in the right direction. Were things like ToHF available in the beginning? Because if not, then they can't be a requirement for access
TOHF and SAP8 were.

The surface mission you did to get the message wasn't because the surface wouldn't have been accessible, but possibly they could have added extra hints like that later so long as they aren't absolutely necessary to the solution (or possibly the precise mission type isn't important, just completing it is)
