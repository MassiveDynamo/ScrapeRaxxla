So that's the next step then! Do the mission, get the "elite" onscreen message,and go honk the comet. But .... I've done that already, lots of times, but maybe I wasn't close enough to the comet when I did it
I honked each comet I visited several times; from the phrasing of that alleged DB quote it might be that it is the time period between honks which is the trigger- several players honking at shorter spaced intervals rather than in synchrony? But if so I'd be disappointed in that the hints we have (e.g. "personal journey") imply it should be accessible by a single player. So maybe honking is not the answer (it is an unsupported rumour). But now do you know you managed to drop into the comet instance?

So maybe carrying something in the cargo hold? TOHF is the obvious one, but could be anything.

I think Raxxla access could well be related to a mission. The hint that TDW in SD is a front and in Elite Reclamation that the real TDW is more a network of factions to me suggests that possibility, taken in conjunction with DB saying that we weren't playing the game as FD had expected (see my FD Quotes thread-link in my signature); he also hinted that missions were intended to guide us around the bubble. So, maybe there is more mission play before Raxxla is accessible?

Edit
Just a thought, but if the "elite" message you got (you said you're Master in Combat but what are your trade & exploration ranks?) was TDW recognition perhaps youve got to do more missions for them? The screenshot you posted from the comet (have you managed to get that to reappear for yourself?) said comet Faction ownership was New Pareco Green Party.... it's possible that might changewith time or for each player happening on the comet.
