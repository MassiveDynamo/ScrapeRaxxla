If raxxla has been in the game since the beginning, then it has been in pareco since the beginning, and the "raxxla lore" was added to codex to push people in the right direction. Were things like ToHF available in the beginning? Because if not, then they can't be a requirement for access
Han_Zen has a much better memory than me, but I think they were in-game from the outset.
