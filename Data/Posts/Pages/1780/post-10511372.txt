So that's the next step then! Do the mission, get the "elite" onscreen message,and go honk the comet. But .... I've done that already, lots of times, but maybe I wasn't close enough to the comet when I did it
Did you find the system you asked about a couple of years back? The one you don't remember where it is but you're sure the icon in the nav panel looked like a strange dotted hexagon? You told a story about flying VIP passenger missions into deep space:

"...One time, I honked a system and checked my nav panel and there was a symbol i didn't recognise. I think it was a dotted hexagon. It was described as an exploration opportunity in the pop-up... It was something like 300,000ls away, and i didn't have the time or patience to check it out...it was a nav panel icon, so thin lines. like the "unknown signal" square, but a hexagon instead.... so actually - like the middle of [the Raxxla] icon. like an engineer symbol but flat side down rather than point down. of course, my memory could be wrong.
