said comet Faction ownership was New Pareco Green Party
This is possibly just defaulting to the system jurisdiction. Looking back at the EliteBGS archives
- Pareco & Co up to about August 2018
- New Pareco Green Party to mid-September 2018
- back to Pareco & Co briefly
- then the (newly added) Pareco Science Institute PMF takes over from mid-October 2018

NPGP weren't in charge long, but maybe happened to be when the screenshot was taken?
