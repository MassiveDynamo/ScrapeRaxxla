hey @Jorki Rasalas !!! i was looking back thru this thread, and you almost came up with the same answer as me, almost around the same time https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-9888855 hahahahah what are the chances
Great minds think alike!
But you are the only one to highlight the relationship to Polaris!

it is just one of the many possible hypotheses we've explored during the last 1780 pages...just one of the better ones perhaps!

But as I said before many people have dropped out at the Pareco comet, including me, but nothing happened. So if it is the Omphalos then maybe it needs something else to open it (TOHF???), or maybe it has to be done when the stations are in a hexagonal formation? or ....something else. The trouble is we have possible clues in the codex how to find it. But nothing as to how to open/access it.

The only possibly related thing is the reported conversation with DB about Raxxla , which you may not have seen:
it’s been reported (but no supporting evidence has been found) that DB was interviewed in an early livestream (when the ship’s scanner came in three grades, basic/intermediate/advanced) where someone asked him about Raxxla and the answer was:

DB: "- It would be more likely to reveal itself to a group of players."
Interviewer: "- How so?"
DB: "- If you are at the right place and you scan it enough..."
Interviewer: "- Advanced scanner or the basic one?"
DB: "- Basic scanning is enough."
Interviewer: "- But you have to be Elite..."
DB: "- You have to be Elite."

So maybe a group need to drop into the comet at the same time and all honk in synchronism??
Edit
I think if one person is successful in dropping onto it then others should be able to home in on their beacon to get into the same instance....
Why you'd have to be Elite though I dont know...maybe it triggers severe combat
