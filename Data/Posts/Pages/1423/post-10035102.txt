Currently, not certain what I'm doing, mostly just exploring within the Bubble. I did visit all those known Gen Ship locations just to get the codex entries (something about having the logs in game makes it feel more immersive than reading them online, even without listening).

Anyway, I thought I'd give a heads up that a couple of them were already uncomfortably close to the Thargoid warzones. So anyone still wanting to collect them in live might want to do so soon.

As an aside, it looks like quite a few of them are similar distances from Sol as the Maelstroms seem to be posotioning themselves. Likely a coincidence/unrelated, but you never know.
Probably not an issue for us given we had fuel scoops by the time of the Federal response to the Mudlark extinction (2323) per Logistical Nightmare beacon in Beta Hydri and rapid expansion didn't start in earnest until 2230. Between this and the beacons and system description in Sirius, I would say fuel scoops were a thing before we ever left Sol. Raxxla, is likely well outside of human space. Even the official narrative on hyperspace technology has always had any Witchspace traversal took seconds. It was getting around the destination system that was a problem ( see Drew Wager's hyperspace lore video ). If my guess that the Soontill Relics cover story contains kernels of truth about the Raxxla system in order to be believable enough, it would put the minimum distance to somewhere between 1000-2000 LY given the location of the nearest Guardian sites and possibly a great deal further. Access to fuel really is the only good limitation we have.
