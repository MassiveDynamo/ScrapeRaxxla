If you do anything like this, your best bet is First Encounters journals. The entries contain both the Universal Cartographics name schemes and older schemes. Be wary, ad the names are not always right next to each other in the same entry. Sometimes you had to use additional context to connect dots. Manuals also cover name schemes employed by each game. Unfortunately, each power has their own naming schemes. The FE journals are very lengthy. Additionally, the Frontier gazetteer is helpful but it appears several systems have entries for separate eras of their history where name changed repeatedly. If you haven't been to Andceeth (the first interstellar banking capital) you will notice the old news systems are referenced. The messiness comes from the political upheaval over the centuries.
