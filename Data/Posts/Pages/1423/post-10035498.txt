Where is Raxxla?

I asked ChatGTP - https://chat.openai.com/chat (signup required):

Where is Raxxla?

And the answer:
Raxxla is a mythical place in the universe of the Elite Dangerous video game series. It is said to be a hidden world or secret location that holds great power or treasure, but its existence and exact location are shrouded in mystery. Some players believe that Raxxla is an ancient alien artifact or a mythical planet, while others believe it is a secret society or an elusive conspiracy. The truth about Raxxla remains unknown, and many players continue to search for clues and explore the vast expanse of space in the game in the hopes of uncovering its secrets.
