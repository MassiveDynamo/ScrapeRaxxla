According to myth of The Dark Wheel they found Soontill but not Raxxla. The Ryder brothers (sons of Alex Ryder) had split up with Oberon wanting to find Soontill (supposedly) believing it to be more important. Neptune on the other hand thought nothing other than Raxxla itself was worth it. Soontill according to the legend was loaded with Thargoid relics and technology. The wiki actually does a pretty decent job at explaining it all: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Soontill

TL;DR: Soontill was the cover story used in order to claim Raxxla has not been found though it probably had by the time Jason Ryder's ship is destroyed in the first novella as he mentioned it to Alex Ryder during shoving him into an escape pod. The major problem with the story of Soontill is the star is too warm and the planet is utterly unlandable. Even the asteroid belt isn't really that big. Also, there was no brown dwarfs in the system labeled as Soontill and Technetium should not be possible in systems preferred by Thargoids (especially given its' radioactive nature and relatively short half-life of 211,000 years and very low production rates in AGB stars).
