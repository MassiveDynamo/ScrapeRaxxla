Having trouble finding Thargoid Probes, have been looking in NHSS Threat 4 and sometimes get a Sensor but no Probes yet. Tried looking for Thargoid Orthrus in Thargoid Alert systems but hardly any signal sources present at all,
Same, same! Sensors are ten a penny but really coming up short on Probes. You used to be able to get them around Ammonia worlds too but I haven't seen one of those for ages
