Test job on a 400 Ly cube with 96514 systems currently running at 0.08 s per outermost loop and accelerating.
Actually, we know where to look. We are looking for rumors of Guardian presence. We already have rough locations via Codex Map rumors. Given the rumors of Raxxla's connection to Saramandara Pearls, I'd be checking any globular and open clusters in regions of Guardian presence. We know where. Let's just finish it already.
