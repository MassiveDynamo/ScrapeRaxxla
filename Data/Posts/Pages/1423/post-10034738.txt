Could you go over the connections between Soontil and Raxxla? I feel like I missed something.

From what I saw of your post, you were showing that Soontil wasn't Thargoid and was likely Guardian - something that could be possible indeed.

I'm not sure though how you get from there to any conclusions about Raxxla, what's the link I'm missing here?
