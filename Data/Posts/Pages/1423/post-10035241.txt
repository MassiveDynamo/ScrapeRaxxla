Having trouble finding Thargoid Probes, have been looking in NHSS Threat 4 and sometimes get a Sensor but no Probes yet. Tried looking for Thargoid Orthrus in Thargoid Alert systems but hardly any signal sources present at all, so I'm back in Delphi again. Banging my head against my own hypothesis of a myth is one thing but against RNG, sometimes you just do not win. Will try again tomorrow. If no luck then I might run the race anyway and see if something happens upon docking at Donar's Oak.

One thing I have noticed in my travels today in the Delphi system, which might just be space madness, is an abundance of Norse-themed NPC names. I've seen a Ratatosk (as a ship name) and a NPC called Vanir.

Lying down and coffee, maybe cake, is needed.
