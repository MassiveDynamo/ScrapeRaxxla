According to myth of The Dark Wheel they found Soontill but not Raxxla. The Ryder brothers (sons of Alex Ryder) had split up with Oberon wanting to find Soontill (supposedly) believing it to be more important. Neptune on the other hand thought nothing other than Raxxla itself was worth it. Soontill according to the legend was loaded with Thargoid relics and technology. The wiki actually does a pretty decent job at explaining it all: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Soontill

TL;DR: Soontill was the cover story used in order to claim Raxxla has not been found though it probably had by the time Jason Ryder's ship is destroyed in the first novella as he mentioned it to Alex Ryder during shoving him into an escape pod. The major problem with the story of Soontill is the star is too warm and the planet is utterly unlandable. Even the asteroid belt isn't really that big. Also, there was no brown dwarfs in the system labeled as Soontill and Technetium should not be possible in systems preferred by Thargoids (especially given its' radioactive nature and relatively short half-life of 211,000 years and very low production rates in AGB stars).

Soontill is just a prop in a story. FD didn't allow authors to do anything that involved Raxxla. Soontill was made up as an alternative mystical location because of this limitation.
I doubt that there is anything important to find in the novels written for ED, at all. The authors were kept fully in the dark, when it comes to the Raxxla mystery.
Unless FD fed them info they didn't know was about Raxxla, there aren't any useful hints in the books.
