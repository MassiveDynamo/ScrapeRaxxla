Pretty accurate I'd say. Although, I wouldn't rule out Frontier then using the stories to develop ideas in game that related to narrative elements of the books and creating a Raxxla narrative that incorporated some of the ideas.
This is hard science fiction. The dystopian elements are there, though it isn't always obvious how much they play a role. In the game's first year we had numerous news outlets then they were gradually shuttered with varying excuses. The Pilot's Federation has near absolute control at this point and if you haven't been to Shinrarta Dezra you owe yourself the trip. Even if your are suspicious of how much usefulness the books can be I'd like you consider the history of the Elite Universe and remember just how much different the media environment used to be from how it is now. Also, do yourself the favor and read, "Language as the “Ultimate Weapon” in Nineteen Eighty-Four".

By all means, don't take my word for it either. Do your research and make your own mind. After all, I am the betrayer of the powers that be if what I have said is even so much as a half truth. Mr Stroud, after all only wrote the part about a certain propagandist by the name of Dr. Hans Walden so his perspective is certainly worthy of consideration.
