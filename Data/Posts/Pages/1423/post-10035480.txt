Soontill is just a prop in a story. FD didn't allow authors to do anything that involved Raxxla. Soontill was made up as an alternative mystical location because of this limitation.
I doubt that there is anything important to find in the novels written for ED, at all. The authors were kept fully in the dark, when it comes to the Raxxla mystery.
Unless FD fed them info they didn't know was about Raxxla, there aren't any useful hints in the books.
Pretty accurate I'd say. Although, I wouldn't rule out Frontier then using the stories to develop ideas in game that related to narrative elements of the books and creating a Raxxla narrative that incorporated some of the ideas.
