Legacy Codex

OK so some time ago Cmdrs asked if the Legacy version of the Codex would ever be amended, as in that narrative content would be removed, or edited. So I popped in a Support ticket.

I kept it simple, not drilling too deeply into Raxxla nor DW specifically; so they did respond, stating that the Legacy Codex will not be updated, and yes the codex does contain a mixture of narrative elements.
