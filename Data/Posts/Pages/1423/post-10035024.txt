Currently, not certain what I'm doing, mostly just exploring within the Bubble. I did visit all those known Gen Ship locations just to get the codex entries (something about having the logs in game makes it feel more immersive than reading them online, even without listening).

Anyway, I thought I'd give a heads up that a couple of them were already uncomfortably close to the Thargoid warzones. So anyone still wanting to collect them in live might want to do so soon.

As an aside, it looks like quite a few of them are similar distances from Sol as the Maelstroms seem to be posotioning themselves. Likely a coincidence/unrelated, but you never know.
