"a place that is not a place" could be interpreted as a point...

This concept is often referred to as a "Non-Place" and is unfortunately vague and subjective. A place that is not a place could be a point, witchspace, a story, a fictional location in that story, your mind or even a holographic projection. Context would be important in helping us to decide what this "place that is not a place" actually is.
