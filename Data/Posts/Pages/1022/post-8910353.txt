Essays on issues of liminality in relation to poetry, popular and canonical fiction, racial, political and experiential marginality, etc., by Philip Sutton (Madrid), Tony Lopez (Plymouth), Esteban Pujals (Madrid). Manuel Aguirre (Madrid), Paul Giles (Cambridge), Isabel Soto (Madrid), Gwyn Thomas (Bangor), and Mary Farrell (Castellon). These essays, authored by scholars both from within and outside Spain, represent an exploration of thresholds and issues of liminality in relation to text. Philip Sutton ("The Textual Mutation of Liminal Attributes") theorizes the relationship of liminality to text and its reception. Tony Lopez ("Innovative Poetry in English") and Esteban Pujals Gesali ("The unjustified margins of poetry and Ian Hamilton Finlay's p@st-oral sign") present language as a mediating threshold in contemporary poetry. Manuel Aguirre ("Narrative Structure, Liminality, Self-Similarity: the Case of Gothic Fiction") shows Gothic to be a liminal genre on various levels. Paul Giles ("From Transgression to Liminality: the Thresholds of Washington Irving"), and Isabel Soto ("Crossing Over: Langston Hughes and Lorca") subject the writings of canonical authors to the refracting lens of the limen. Gwyn Thomas ("Your Margin Is My Centre") questions the geographical and political marginality of Wales vis-a-vis the West. Mary Farrell ("Fractured Frames: from Memory to Memoir: Perec and Kingston") shows how the book may be used to frame an existence 'on the margins' and thus to give meaning to a meaningless experience.
