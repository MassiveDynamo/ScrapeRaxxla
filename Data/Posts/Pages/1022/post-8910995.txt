The first thing I did after getting x3 Elite was get allied with all of the corporations that are mentioned in the codex including Wreaken corporation (or at least the ones that exist in game). There is a few posts in here from me around that time and my exploration of their stations and the strange hydrolic function of the rear of the space stations in general. I went Raxxla mad looking at them in various stations etc and I still think theres something strange about how they look like they could open up (see below)


We've all seen this before, Right under our nose?

This is a hinge, I don't care what anyone says


Does this move?

Those antenna have always bothered me , they seem very modular, like they should do something. Well they do. Most stations emit a series of tones that can be mapped in a spectrograph. They are non repeating to my knowledge.

Ive checked stations that are burning and I haven't herd a signal. Hard to get a recording as you cant sit on the pad. I dont think I any in Achenar , might be a fed thing. Not really sure yet to be honest , dont have a large enough sample size.

This is not really news but I have not herd a solution to what the signals actually are or could mean. I was thinking call signs for ships leaving or arriving , maybe trade data.Those seem underwhelming.

At the start I thought they were written letters , but after doing some magic computer stuff they seem much more refined. One of them kinda reminds me of the cover of dark side This one is unsolved in my books. These could also be the "number stations". Not to be confused with those beacons that gave out the morris code way back.

Door that is also the key?



Seriously look at all those pistons and hinges.
