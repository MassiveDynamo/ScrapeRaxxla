You're correct, however that doesn't mean TDW isn't meant to be a step on the road to finding Raxxla. Just because they can't locate it with their knowledge doesn't mean we can't when in possession of the same knowledge. For all we know, FDev might actually require us to establish a connection with TDW.

I think it's important to consider any step in Raxxla's general direction a successful maneuver. Finding TDW would be a huge discovery and at the very least we could introduce new theories or eliminate old ones.

I agree with all you say here. Its always been aparent that the next clue may well come from TDW's archives. My point was that we can't expect the toast to be a map to Raxxla since they themselves don't know where it is. They may know what it is, ofc.
