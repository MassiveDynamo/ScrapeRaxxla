So I think with the toast we must remember that it is the toast of an organisation that has not found Raxxla yet. It can't therefore lead us to Raxxla (I also find it unlikely to lead us to The Dark Wheel, just because its in the wrong codex for that).

So what it tells us can be no more than vague hints and may describe TDW attitude to Raxxla. So for instance it might be something like this:
'Jewel that burns' [jewel=Rax itself] 'on the brow of the mother of galaxies' [its near the centre of the galaxy/in the northern half of the galaxy/or some-such]
'The whisperer in witchspace - siren of the deepest void' [its a hyperspace tech/gateway/etc. and its a powerful call for explorers (like the sirens)]
'The parents' grief and the lovers woe' [we've lost compatriots and family in its pursuit - a ref to previous lore]
' and the yearning of our vagabond hearts' [and we've turned our back on the world looking for it]
There are many ways to slice it, but knowing that they don't know where it is sheds a different light on the function of the toast.

You're correct, however that doesn't mean TDW isn't meant to be a step on the road to finding Raxxla. Just because they can't locate it with their knowledge doesn't mean we can't when in possession of the same knowledge. For all we know, FDev might actually require us to establish a connection with TDW.

I think it's important to consider any step in Raxxla's general direction a successful maneuver. Finding TDW would be a huge discovery and at the very least we could introduce new theories or eliminate old ones.
