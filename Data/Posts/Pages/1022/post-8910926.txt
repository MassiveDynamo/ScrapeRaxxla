So, referencing my previous "Phantom Star" post, I have the following idea, and the Phantom Star fits perfectly with the Dark Wheel toast because it apparently only exists in witch space, like a siren in the void, but when you try to fly to it in super cruise, nothing is there.

Let's try to triangulate the position of the Phantom Star by doing jumps around Two Ladies and its neighbouring systems, noting where the phantom star is relative to the destination star. Then look for 2 stars that you can line up, so there's a straight line from the starting star to the destination star through the alleged position of the Phantom Star. We'd probably need a few reference stars to line up, perhaps we need a system with 3 stars in a certain constellation which we need to line up with the destination star?

Then, after doing the jump I expect that the FSD locks onto the Phantom Star, not the destination star, and accordingly throttles down.

Edit: The Raxxla-logo also kind of looks like a stylized hyper jump, with the 6 outer polygons kind of extruding, a black dot possibly for the Phantom Star and a ring for the destination star?
