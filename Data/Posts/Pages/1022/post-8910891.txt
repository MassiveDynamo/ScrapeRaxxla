Ok, here's an observation regarding the FSD-jump animation/sequence.

So far I assumed that the whole animation is just a visual effect that is always the same; well with the exception of stars passing by, which I assumed are fluff (since the animation takes as long as the network request for the target system takes).

When finally arriving at the destination you see the target star and you might see a few more stars close to it. I assumed that multiple stars meant that the system will have multiple stars and it seemed to be always the case.
When visiting the "Two Ladies"-system I noticed an orange star very very close to the single star in the Two Ladies-system. I kind of assumed that Two Ladies references the two big gas giants. I repeatedly jumped into the Two Ladies-system, and there was always a second star very close by. I also assumed that it could also be one of the other star systems close to Two Ladies. Also I noticed the "phantom star" to be visible at other single star systems, but it wasn't as close as in the Two Ladies-system.
