A passing thought, but one I cant pursue at the moment-the RSI definitely interferes with engineering!
Needs someone else to check out this hypothesis!

Shinrarta Dezhra -
As well as PF & TDW, Lori Jameson is also locked away here. Is this the real reason for the lock & the old “TDW elite requirement” taken from Holdstock is obfuscation?

In-game description: “Lori Jameson is one of the great granddaughters of John Jameson, the most famous Pilots Federation member ever. She is an accomplished explorer in her own right and has developed various techniques for improved automated systems. Her facility is popular with those seeking to prepare their ships for extended operations in deep space, and she makes sure they have pleasant surroundings while they await their upgrades.” Peter Jameson, the first Elite pilot, is also an ancestor. Don’t have any reason to believe either of them is related to TDW, but there is a niggling doubt...

Rep with engineers is built by crafting modules with them. Is the TDW test to maximise all her blueprints with her? All my ships are engineered to the max (well, life support to her L4) via several different engineers, but dont think Ive made use of all her engineering blueprints....
