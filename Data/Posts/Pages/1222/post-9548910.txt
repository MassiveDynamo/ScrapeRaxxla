Mmmm,
“For Elite: Dangerous, he wrote six guidebooks that inform the fictional narrative within the game”
Allen Stroud - Wikipedia

Allen Stroud's doctoral dissertation (and yes I have the full thing) is part of my evidence for the new theory. His doctoral thesis is on both a game called Chaos Reborn and Elite Dangerous (they borrow heavily from each other in terms of lore and world-building concepts). Stroud is likely the master lore writer for the past-3300 for Elite Dangerous. I am not sure how much he helped with the lore past that point but he was extremely involved in getting the foundational lore established.
