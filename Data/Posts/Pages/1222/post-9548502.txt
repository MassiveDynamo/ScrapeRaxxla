Interesting, I have a feeling this would fit nicely into what I am working on at the moment. I will definitely add these to my reading list. That said, the reason Dark Wheel has ties to the Raxxla myth is they were able to get their hands on artifacts that hint of its' existence and saw things that don't fit otherwise. Everything is inter-connected very deeply. I just wish I had more time to do so and I am still not sure I can give it the justice it deserves. I've only seen the inactive state. At this point, I merely have an idea of what we are dealing with and even that is awe-inspiring.
“the reason Dark Wheel has ties to the Raxxla myth is they were able to get their hands on artifacts that hint of its' existence and saw things” - - - what is the evidence for this claim?
