Allen Stroud's doctoral dissertation (and yes I have the full thing) is part of my evidence for the new theory. His doctoral thesis is on both a game called Chaos Reborn and Elite Dangerous (they borrow heavily from each other in terms of lore and world-building concepts). Stroud is likely the master lore writer for the past-3300 for Elite Dangerous. I am not sure how much he helped with the lore past that point but he was extremely involved in getting the foundational lore established.
Where can the Allen Stroud's doctoral dissertations be found?
