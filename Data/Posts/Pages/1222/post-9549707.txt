I did read about Astrophel and Stella which was written by Phillip Sidney. And his life contains all about the lovers woe and parents grief.

"No one since 1935 has seriously doubted that Sidney intended the first readers of Astropil and Stella, whoever they may have been, to link "Stella" with Lady Rich. The exact nature of Sidney's relationship with the famous beauty is another and much more ticklish matter ..."[11]

I made extensive search in their names and children but nothing come up as intresting. But I can have made an error somewhere down the way.
We know penelope is a system name. Is her other names like Devereux.
This might be the most obvious lead.

If there is more than one star with each so called person in the story maybe the form a shape or something to give clues. Do we know all of the systems related to the real life author. This seems like something much simpler and realistic for the game devs to implement. We maybe missing the obvious by overcomplicating it. This may be a simpler path. At least to start with.

Phillip Sidney. Aren't these both system names and or NPC's?
