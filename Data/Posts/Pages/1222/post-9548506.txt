I’m neither for nor against such claims
(I’ve long thought that MB’s “there will be no clues” was very likely a huge tease with lots of clues available but not highlighted)
but I want to see the evidence to back them up!!!

P.S. I’m currently working on a new theory of my own, based on “a tiny bit obvious”

P.P.S. I see from the latest newsletter that a recent Twitch stream discussed the Azimuth storyline...perhaps a hint that there may be another instalment due soon?
