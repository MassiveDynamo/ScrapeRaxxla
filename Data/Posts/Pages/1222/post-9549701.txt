I think the name
simulacrae said:
you mentioned earlier the waters of shintara and why the name change/difference? Was wondering about that … tara (indoeuropean) star… also related to mother goddess /sea goddess

Tara
'Tara' published in 'Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'
link.springer.com

the is also princess… interesting

If we look at the explanation of shinrarta dezhra name… the shin is supposed to mean life. So possibly we have “water of life star” …. Or “water of life mother” ?

just spitballing…

I think the name for shinratra whatever is player named. So, unless it was purposely named by the player(which could always be the case.) it's not necessarily relevant. This is the internet so a lot of things are possible.

That means anything besides it being water may be irrelivent. So it may only be useful as a clue as water or water named after the system generaically. Disasociated from the actual word shinrarta whatever.

Unless the player is on the inside or they made him pick a name in some manner. It is still always possible for that to work out though. The more details you know the more ways there potentially are per circumstance. it could be easy or very hard to impossible. Or impossible to avoid.
