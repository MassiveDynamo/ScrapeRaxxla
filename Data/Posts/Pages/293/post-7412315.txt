There is part of me, that I often have to ignore, believes that Raxxla does not actually exist (or only exists as a legend). The reasoning being that, if it were ever found, it would actually ruin the game for many players. Even in a full sized galaxy, the risk of it actually happening would still be too great.

I'm given to the belief that it is in Frontier's best interests to ensure that players don't find Raxxla anytime soon. As long as Raxxla is out there as a thing to be found then it will remain a draw to keep drawing a certain kind of player into logging into their game. I personally wouldn't put it past Frontier to hide Raxxla away in some permit locked sector of the galaxy ... maybe Raxxla itself isn't permit locked but all the stars within jump range of it are?

An interesting thought ... didn't David Braben or Michael Brooks say that there would "be no clues" to help us find Raxxla? The addition of the Codex along with entries for Raxxla and The Dark Wheel are proof that this statement only meant that there would be no clues outside of the game itself.

I see the quest for Raxxla being given more clues down the road as parts of future game content. Content that will eventually gain the attention of many of our fellow players. Content that will eventually lead Raxxla.

One thing I know for sure: Raxxla WILL be found. I can't imagine Frontier passing up the headline in all the gaming media: 25+ year game mystery finally solved.
