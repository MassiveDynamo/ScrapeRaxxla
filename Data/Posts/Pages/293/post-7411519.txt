Commanders, there's been a recent Galnet article speaking of a station that was attacked, but the station was designed to be undetectable. Perhaps this could be the station The Dark Wheel used? I haven't been to this location so it depends on if it's the eighth moon of some unknown gas giant, but perhaps there's something we could learn from a station like this.
