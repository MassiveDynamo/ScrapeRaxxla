5) it's something that both CMDR Guru and someone in FDev said -> reaching Raxxla is a personal journey [...] i.e. Go to Nyse, follow child 3 times clockwise then 5 times counterclockwise and then the gates of heaven will open.

CMDR Guru last words were that he cried (in RL) at the end of this ordeal, and then in-character he seems to have committed suicide (account disappeared). And following Child 3 times, at 500k LS each, would be madness-inducing, so if this is the type of "personal journey" we can expect (along with having to study cryptology and knowing how to do sound spectograph analysis), then I guess tears of madness and suicide make sense.

From a more pragmatic point of view, Raxxla has been described as "the greatest treasure of the galaxy" in this thread (by us); if it's only available AFTER you've won the game, then that's a bummer. By the time you become triple (quadruple) elite, have ally status with PF and DW and who knows what other factions (Nysa Brotherhood, for example, boy does that suck at 500 k LS for each mission hand-in), be capable enough to take on a wing of 4 elite NPC's flying Anacondas, in a Cobra (CMDR Guru's last screenshot), and who knows what else... who needs Raxxla's riches anyway?

And let's not forget that the real treasure is always "knowledge". Several movies about that, including an Indiana Jones one, I believe. I think that's what CMDR Guru was crying about.
