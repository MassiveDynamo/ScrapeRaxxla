I found the roots of Guru's last screenshot and that marked name Alexander. The roots are going from Egyptian hieroglyphs. Commonly it have right-to-left typing. So look here:

It is Alexander the Great 's name typed using hieroglyphs. It is not Raxxla even if read it from the end but very similar.

There was two Alexander's sons: Alexander IV and Heracles (not Hercules). And there are alone systems with lonely star (Heracles) ingame. Then the constellation too and the sector of unnamed stars... Too many objects for my mind.

P.S. Alexander IV 's Russian Wikipedia page have (I don't know why it is) hieroglyphed personal name as "Son of Ra" that imaged as No! I don't mean Donald Duck and MacDonald!

So not related at all, ok.
