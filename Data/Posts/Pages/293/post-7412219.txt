Spoilers for 'And Here the Wheel" below:
SPOILER

0) The number of factions with the ability to defeat 'stealth' tech, and have the reach to knock off a secret facility in Sol has got to be a very short list.
1) It does not specifically state that it was a Fed Military site, or a Corporation.
2) The hint that it is on Earth's moon (Lunar) may have been used in a general sense to indicate the surface of a moon.
3) Maybe this is related to the Halfnium and SAP 8 core containers. (A huge stretch, but both have commonalities in advanced power generation etc)
4) Maybe they are similar bases on Triton thus the permit lock?

I happen to be nearby so I will have a gander in Sol and Eta Cass.

Edit: Unregistered comms beacon orbiting Luna does not appear to have changed (at the very least the section i checked corresponded to the old message), but the time of the start was 15 minutes later by my clock. 45 vs 30. The transmission lasted ~12 minutes.
The orbital stations checked so far (out to mars high) have not spawned any seemingly related missions.
