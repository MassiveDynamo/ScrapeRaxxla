There's a lot of sense in what stg213 says. Tourist beacons were not in the game from day 1, but there might be something similar. Michael Brookes was adamant about there being no second galaxy (at Fantasticon three years ago), although things may have changed since he left the project.

If I wanted to hide something in Elite Dangerous, I'd do it the way Voyager was for a long time hidden in Sol: put it in an easy-to-visit system, but a Hutton Orbital distance from the jump-in point, and make the "thing" only appear on the Nav Panel when you're within 1,000 LS.
