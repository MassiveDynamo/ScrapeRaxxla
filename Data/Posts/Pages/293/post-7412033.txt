Has anyone been to Luna to check this? It would be nice if it was a clue, but I think many galnet posts have not been implemented in-game

I don't think this article is a clue however, it does show that in game and now lore they have the tech to prevent detection. What I took from this, is that would rule out the possibility of being able to just FSS a system to find Raxxla and you would need to as they say have the Access Codes.
