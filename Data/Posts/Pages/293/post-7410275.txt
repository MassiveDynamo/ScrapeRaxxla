There is part of me, that I often have to ignore, believes that Raxxla does not actually exist (or only exists as a legend). The reasoning being that, if it were ever found, it would actually ruin the game for many players. Even in a full sized galaxy, the risk of it actually happening would still be too great.

I think if I ever found it I would keep the how and where to myself. I might say I found it, and offer some spoiler free proof. But I think youâ€™re right to a point. If it were public knowlage and became easily acessable to everyone. It might ruin it.
