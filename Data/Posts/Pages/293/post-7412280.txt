Just for fun: Some thinking about Raxxla logo and hieroglyphs:

Star, Crescent moon, "half-month festival" as a half of Star+Crescent

Are you remember the central part of Raxxla logo?

Sun and three crescents around it... Mmm?.. System with three moons? Too easy. May be the half of the half of the half of the Sun... Oh... I want to sleep.

The standard astronomical symbols are based on the hieroglyphs for some objects:

The circle dot is the Sun. Not any sun. The asteriix is for all the other stars.
The cresent is our moon, Luna.
