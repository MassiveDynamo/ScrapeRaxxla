It's like pushing your bike 20km instead of riding it. - Just to be consistent.
I'm not disciplined enough for that.

After letting down the tires and locking the breaks on.

Parallax discovery works great for bodies on the orbital plane, within 10,000 Ls of the primary star. When you're looking for icy moons around a brown dwarf that's 250,000 Ls out, they show up as one tiny grey pixel when you get within about 500 Ls.

It's not 'discipline', it's willful masochism
