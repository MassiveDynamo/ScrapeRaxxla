I suppose that without the 2 crashed condas, the sensor, and the strange npc behaviors, I'd be inclined to believe that you are right. I guess you had to be there. I'm not suggesting that the key to the puzzle can be solved there, just that it may have been confirmation that it was the right spot to be at the time.
