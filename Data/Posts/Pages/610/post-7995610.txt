My deepest respect for still doing parallax "scanning" systems. – I mean, I started ED (late beta) without knowing too much about it, only because of my memories of the original Elite game. And I very well remember my fascination when I noticed some spots moving against the backdrop while cruising in a system. Until then I expected to have only a skybox around me. But the crazy guys from FDev put me in a simulated system of celestial bodies. How awesome was that! But now it's sooooo easy to avoid that effort, achievements became so cheap. Why bother any more? Sorry, enough lamenting…
