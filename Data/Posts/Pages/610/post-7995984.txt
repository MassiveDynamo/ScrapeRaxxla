I suppose that without the 2 crashed condas, the sensor, and the strange npc behaviors, I'd be inclined to believe that you are right. I guess you had to be there. I'm not suggesting that the key to the puzzle can be solved there, just that it may have been confirmation that it was the right spot to be at the time.

Was the 'strange NPC behavior' in SC or a USS? There used to be all kinds of USSs that had a bunch of slow moving ships in them - not sure if they're still around. 'Ceremonial Comms' was one of them.

The crashed 'Condas are, I believe, associated with tip-off missions.
