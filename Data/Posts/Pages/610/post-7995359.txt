But when "in time" means ~200 years for the galaxy, will it really be fully mapped in time?

Nebulae, star sausages and anything else you can see at a distance will always be a magnet for explorers and will be fully mapped long before we've even got a single percentage of the galaxy scanned. The huge density of red dwarf stars around the core will stay sparesly covered.
