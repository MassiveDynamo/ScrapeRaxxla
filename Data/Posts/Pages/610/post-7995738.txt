Meera? Allow me be too "straight forwardish" in language things. Is it Mira? Omicron Ceti? Binary star system with red giant and white dwarf with huge accretion disk that spiraling around the second star. Not in the game of course.

And what is meaning of Singh name? Hero?

P.S. It's just a coincidence (or how it's naming). In this game so many cultural references... And sometime it looks like linked to something important.
