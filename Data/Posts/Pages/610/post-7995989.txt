Was the 'strange NPC behavior' in SC or a USS? There used to be all kinds of USSs that had a bunch of slow moving ships in them - not sure if they're still around. 'Ceremonial Comms' was one of them.

The crashed 'Condas are, I believe, associated with tip-off missions.
Edited the post and added the screenshots. But it was in SC. The thing was their speed. It was like they had 2 pips to throttle and they never broke formation.
