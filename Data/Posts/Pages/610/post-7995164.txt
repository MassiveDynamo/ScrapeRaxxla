I mean mapping in particular. Like when we had no probes, just scanning them was basically capping it off for tagging, but with the probes it's kind of a refresher to it all.
In time though, even places as large as Orion will be fully mapped.
But when "in time" means ~200 years for the galaxy, will it really be fully mapped in time?
