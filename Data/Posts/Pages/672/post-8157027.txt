yeah, the first message and the attachement are not from the same guy. the first message is like the delivery guy, and he had an "attachement" letter with him, that came from an unknown friend, that didn't want to reveal his identity. and it's in the attachement that the juicy, dark wheely stuff happens.

has anyone tried killing a thargoid with a sidewinder? lol that could impress our little "friend" who knows!
