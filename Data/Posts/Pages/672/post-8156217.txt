LOL! Entertaining as ever, but you do real-eyes the pole star changes due to axial precession, right?
Yes, there are considerable obstacles for a modern era mythopoetic traveller, as most of the relevant sources are well over a millenium old, and they sometimes describe events several millenia back. Then it is possible one haven't been to the Sol system for a while, being thousands of lightyears away, and yet the light bends as if you never left. It's all very puzzling. Some people believe the pole star mentioned in the ancient texts could in fact have been Alpha Draconis. I asked my yoga instructor about this later, being an amateur astronomer himself (due to the star density in Kashyapa, that close to the core, you see stars practically all the time), and he sent me this motivational video and told me to focus working with my sore back.
