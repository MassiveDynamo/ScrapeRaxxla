Very brief (shortest one I could find) overview on ancient structures with links in the description to more details on using cycles of precession to link them to the constellations and more importantly when those star patterns matched the layout of the structures on the ground. Randall Carlson highly recommended.

He and Graham Hancock have also been on the Joe Rogan podcast multiple times. Well worth a watch.
