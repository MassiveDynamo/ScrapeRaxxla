i think the dark wheel is special as a minor faction and that it wont expand and wont be eliminated. Pretty sure people tried since day one and found that out early on. Could be wrong on that though. ...since i stopped caring about minor factor expansion/retraction when it became apparent that it didn't matter really who's in control. So ...like after PP was released and it became apparent that they'd never implement pp collapse and powers in general would not have any real impact in the game.
