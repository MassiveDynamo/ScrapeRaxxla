anyone knows about this hidden text message in the game manuel that is accessible from the launcher? the message seems shady, and could be from the dark wheel itself. and who is this supposed "friend"?
SPOILER: MANUEL INTRODUCTION MESSAGE
"We find them, and then we test them. Consider this your test"
"impress me, perhaps you'll learn more"
