The test will be administered discreetly and only once passed will the DW reveal themselves....is the current lore I think

Administered doesn't sound like something you can do without it being given to you first I don't think. Doesn't mean there isn't pre-requisites, like the engineers, but the test is probably something else...mind you the eng. test is go fetch me some XYZ and only Felicity is stretching, or maybe its just coz shes usually done with less experience to the game, her test just seemed more challenging to me and involving (new aliens etc).

The fact that nobody has been given the test, or they aren't willing to talk about it (unlikely) or they've failed (possible?) is disconcerting?
Personally I'm finding Palin/Chloe quite tough. Only barnacles I've found have had no flowers/meta alloys.
Will head back down to witch head when I'm done in the galactic core I expect.
