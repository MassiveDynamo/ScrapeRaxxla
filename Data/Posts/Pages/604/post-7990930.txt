Personally I'm finding Palin/Chloe quite tough. Only barnacles I've found have had no flowers/meta alloys.
Will head back down to witch head when I'm done in the galactic core I expect.

Then buy your MA from the surface base in Maia (presume they’re still for sale there). You can then get the sensor fragments from one of the nearby crash sites (HIP something or other), they’re halfway up a mountain but roll down, then you shoot the UA to get the fragments, then relog to get more, repeat until you have the required number. Get extra for guardian engineering. Seem to remember Exigeous or Down to Earth Astronomy has a short youtube vid on it.

Edit: was going to call in on Chloe recently on way back from last deep black trip for a cup of tea/ brandy and a chinwag, I still have 5 fragments in my tote bag, but decided to hang onto them for a while. I already have the l5 dirty drive blueprint. Not really sure why she set up shop all the way out there. Location seems a bit vulnerable to future goid reprisals....

Addendum: sat chilling, listening to Cerys Mathews’ show (recorded from this morning) with some cool jazz, digesting my lunch, but really need to get back to tidying up the hedges, mowing and dethatching the lawn, then walking the dog. No rest for the wicked!
