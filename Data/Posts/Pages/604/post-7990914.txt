The test will be administered discreetly and only once passed will the DW reveal themselves....is the current lore I think

Administered doesn't sound like something you can do without it being given to you first I don't think. Doesn't mean there isn't pre-requisites, like the engineers, but the test is probably something else...mind you the eng. test is go fetch me some XYZ and only Felicity is stretching, or maybe its just coz shes usually done with less experience to the game, her test just seemed more challenging to me and involving (new aliens etc).

The fact that nobody has been given the test, or they aren't willing to talk about it (unlikely) or they've failed (possible?) is disconcerting?

If it’s “discretely administered” we probably won’t know we’re being tested until we’re told we’ve passed. The question to be answered is why nobody has passed it to date, or if they have why haven’t they told anybody about it...I think it’s the former and that’s related to DB’s “and we know why they haven’t found it” comment.
