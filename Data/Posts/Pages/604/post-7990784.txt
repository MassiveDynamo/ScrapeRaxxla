Has anybody seen this in other sectors? The beams of the NS visible for the last 3/4 seconds of the witch space tunnel?

Yeah, I've seen it a couple of times - I just associated it with longer loading times (see also: rotation).

It's also worth noting that seeing the destination star during the hyperspace jump was a graphical upgrade that happened sometime during Season 2. The earlier versions of the transition didn't show it.
