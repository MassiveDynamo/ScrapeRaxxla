YOU disappoint me when not assuming, after all these years, how teribble my Englich is, Pa !
Make a small effort and try to understand the writing of a Spaniard who speaks English like a French cow bred in Switzerland, please ! (Brexit delights.. pfff...)
I meant investigate the whispers we can hear when in witchspace !

I agree with Pete, your Englich is better than mine compadre
Hablo Español aqui! Tambien vende Raxxla, con churros! Un carajillo por favor!!
But still, investigate the whispers isn’t the clue, it’s to the whisperer; I think that’s significant.

I have a new hypothesis with a different slant & seems to answer all parts of the toast, and possibly the other FD “non-clues” but it’s going to be a while until Tyko can test it to my satisfaction, probably not much flying this week.
