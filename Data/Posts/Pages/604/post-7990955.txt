Reviewing (very) old posts, I didn't find what Raxxla is but MB said what it is/was not. (Nov 2014)

'What is the founder's world name?'
'Founder's World'
'I'm a tiny little bit disappointed they didn't call it Raxxla '
'Raxxla is something different ' (< MB)

Are we going to keep looking for a planet ?

We know why it hasn't been found is fake news/urban myth. He never said it. We debated this a couple dozen pages ago and the interview was posted.
There is just a DW's report of what DB told him (July 2014). I can't imagine that it's a lie. Can you ?

What I am not so sure about, is this statement from another "witness" of that famous BAFTA...
'He ended up talking with Drew and a group of others in the bar afterwards. My hearing is awful at the moment so I sat out, but Drew told me a few little details after - in particular a little teaser about the location of Raaxla...'
(Note the very convenient typo )
