YOU disappoint me when not assuming, after all these years, how teribble my Englich is !
Make a small effort and try to understand the writing of a Spaniard who speaks English like a French cow bred in Switzerland, please ! (Brexit delights.. pfff...)
I meant investigate the whispers we can hear when in witchspace !
Stop with the no anglasie! Your English is better than mine most of the time!
