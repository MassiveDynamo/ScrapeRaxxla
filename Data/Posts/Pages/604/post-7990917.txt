If it’s “discretely administered” we probably won’t know we’re being tested until we’re told we’ve passed. The question to be answered is why nobody has passed it to date, or if they have why haven’t they told anybody about it...I think it’s the former and that’s related to DB’s “and we know why they haven’t found it” comment.
We know why it hasn't been found is fake news/urban myth. He never said it. We debated this a couple dozen pages ago and the interview was posted.
