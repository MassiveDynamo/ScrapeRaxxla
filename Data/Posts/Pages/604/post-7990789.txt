Horizons is required for planetary landings.
Mmmmh... Horizons may be required to find Raxxla since it has been released. Or did I miss some FD specific statement about this ?
"We know why Raxxla hasn't already been found", they said in 2014. I bet they knew. Horizons not yet been released !
But you very well may be right. It's just that I can't see another Exploration activity demanding skill and courage other than these landings...
Navigation skills ? Like hardcore Explo ? meh.. Cmdr Allitnil would already have been invited, if so. (Doc failed as he missed Cass A, and so did The Boss because finding the Smurf's Galaxy doesn't count )
The Dark Wheel lore (novel) only tells of combat skills to become "one of ours", though.
EDIT: I know ! You have to FSS and DSS a huge system, like a hundred bodies, in the shortest possible time !
