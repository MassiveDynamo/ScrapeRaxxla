Geez.. Brit's Magaluf Spanish.. But not bad at all, though, Pa !

Mmmhh.. Listen to and understand what the whisperer says in witchspace and you'll have clues about him. Perhaps.

I’m quite rusty now, but I like Spain, did have a Spanish girlfriend for a while, and got a distinction in Spanish GCSE at the age of 50, though actually learnt to understand the lyrics of salsa music (I was a keen salsero, before the aches and pains got too much). Nowadays I’m just into coffee and brandy, so a carajillo always goes down well!!
