'Do you know where it is?'
'No, do you or have we lost it?'
'We've lost it, what we gonna do?'
'I know, lets set it as a 'test', anyone who can 'find' it for us can 'become a member' and we, ahem, always knew where it was, you see?'

'Thats gotten far more complicated than Raxxla now, even I don't know!'
