Ah, I still count Pluto!

Mmm, seem to remember musing (during FRift days) about Persephone being the wife of Hades god of the Underworld, & the (Ishtar’s? My memory is hazy) journey to the Underworld being the basis for Salomé’s journey to enlightenment (discarded crown, etc).

Now if Raxxla is “a door that is not a door, a lock that is also a key”, then is the Underworld cropping up again?
