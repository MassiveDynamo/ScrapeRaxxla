Within our world, it does not.

Ah, I still count Pluto!

Mmm, seem to remember musing (during FRift days) about Persephone being the wife of Hades god of the Underworld, & the (Ishtar’s? My memory is hazy) journey to the Underworld being the basis for Salomé’s journey to enlightenment (discarded crown, etc).

Now if Raxxla is “a door that is not a door, a lock that is also a key”, then is the Underworld cropping up again?
Hard to say, really. My bet is on Lovecraft as It fits the themes far too well.

A place that is not a place could mean a location with no recognized owner. Also, we know Raxxla has/is a gate to the Multiverse. What if Raxxla is a living thing, allowing all who wish to view/visit the Multiverse free access? It views none as it's 'owner' while the 'Corps of Elites' view it otherwise.

They kill all who seek it because there is no other way to deny access... It's quite literally Yog-Sothoth (or something like it), as he is 'a door, but also the key' and 'a place that is not a place'.
