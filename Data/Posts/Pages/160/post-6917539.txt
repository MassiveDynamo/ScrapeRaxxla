Sure thing ! Everything's there !
Bottom right corner looks quite interesting... It's almost as if it's ment to end right there... The forces of good and evil fighting each other, though not quite defending their own gates as they seem to be heading toward the glowing 'eye' being guarded by a tentacled, fleshy horror amongst others. Multiple entries, one goal... Raxxla?

Assuming that's it, it would be just off the head of the dragon. Maybe it's off the head of Draco? Just past Thuban...?
