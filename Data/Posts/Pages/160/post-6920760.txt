The zodiac constellations can be seen when viewing the map from Sol, maybe a couple more as well. Seeing this, I decided to begin my journey to scan all 12 zodiac constellations, as well as a few more. Including Orion, Draco, Ursa Major and Minor. Could the constellations be the road map to Raxxla? To the Polaris Permit? Polaris is the tip of the handle in Ursa Minor. That will be the last jump I attempt. I'm currently using wikipedia to find the stars and am half way done. I'm working in a clockwise direction through the zodiac and can complete about 2 constellations a day. There are quite a few systems involved that are in permit locked areas. This has been a huge task and a very interesting learning experience.

Well ... if not Raxxla then perhaps the constellations will lead us to Earth ...
