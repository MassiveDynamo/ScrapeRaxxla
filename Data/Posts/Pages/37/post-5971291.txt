2. There is no reason to believe that The Dark Wheel have found Raxxla. Alex Ryder apparently discovered evidence that Raxxla was real but apparently died before he could pass on the details. The Dark Wheel, led by the Ryder family, continued to look for it until the quest tore The Dark Wheel apart and Neptune Ryder formed The Circle of Independent Elite Pilots and went looking for Soontill instead.
I thought it was Oberon Ryder who formed the Ciepers and Neptune stayed with the Dark Wheel.
