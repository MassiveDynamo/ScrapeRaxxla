Well it is all guess/theories up till now, but for sure it will not be a landable planet if we have to believe what has been "confirmed" till now, as it should have been in the game before Horizons. Meanwhile I am traveling to two almost exactly opposite systems to Sol, with generally the same kind of star... who knows..
They never said it was accessible...
