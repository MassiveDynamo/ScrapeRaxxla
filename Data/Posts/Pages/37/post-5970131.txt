I was reading through the op and was thinking about the assumptions about Raxxla. Do we assume anything about how we will know if we have found it? It will be named Raxxla? We will or will not be able to land on it?
One would imagine it to have structures on it, perhaps even visible from space. If The Dark Wheel is there now, we should be attacked upon entering the system.

Well it is all guess/theories up till now, but for sure it will not be a landable planet if we have to believe what has been "confirmed" till now, as it should have been in the game before Horizons. Meanwhile I am traveling to two almost exactly opposite systems to Sol, with generally the same kind of star... who knows..
