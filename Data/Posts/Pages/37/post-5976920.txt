which seems far too close for an hyper-aggressive warlike species to be just hanging round not attacking.

It is a staging area, basic war strategy. Hide your forces in a secret locked sector of space so the enemy cannot see the size of the incoming army, and to give the element of surprise when attacking. Didn't you meatbags read Tun Szu's Art of Space War? This allows the Klaxians to punch a hole in your defenses and spread behind enemy lines to inflict the most damage during the surprise attack.
