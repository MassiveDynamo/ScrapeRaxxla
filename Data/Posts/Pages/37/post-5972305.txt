Since we're talking about permit locks...what's the deal on those? I didn't even realize until a couple of months ago that there were vast areas of the Galaxy that were locked behind unobtainable permits. I assume the obvious answer is that FDev is saving them for future development, but is there an "in-game, lore-ish" explanation?
