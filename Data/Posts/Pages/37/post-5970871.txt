I haven't forgotten either. It's not something I would bring up on there myself though as a lot of stuff in Premonition doesn't seem to have filtered over to a lot of the playerbase yet.

I suspect it was the Oresrians they encountered. It was on this side of Col 70 which seems far too close for an hyper-aggressive warlike species to be just hanging round not attacking. Also, there's obviously some form of complicity somewhere in the permit locking, which wouldn't really stack up if it was Klaxxians (why would they pay any regard to our permit locks?), but would if it was the Oresrians and it was essentially an agreed holding area while this initial preparatory stage is underway.
