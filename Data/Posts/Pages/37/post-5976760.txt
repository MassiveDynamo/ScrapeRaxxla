I am not worthy.
I made easy Billions smuggling slaves and drugs. Exploiting Ceos, Sothis, Quince, Robigo and Wu, and now Rhea. Transport CGs with a 800 tons tradeCutter , the Maria la gorda (my stepmother's nickname [haha]). Always reaching the top 10%.

I am not worthy.
Raided so many poor refugee's T9's fleeing to save their families, just to salvage their materials. Exploited moon bases which have constant respawn of rares. Massacred thousands of brave NPC Cmdrs in CZ's who were just fighting for freedom, a better life, a future for their children, or simply for putting some food on the table. Vaporized uncountable sympathetic pirates in HazRES who didn't be aware of the badassness of my combatCutter, the Gom Jabbar, and were only asking for a ridicule small share of my vile wealth.

That, I am worthy.
Explored half of the Milky Way. From Bovomit to SgrA*. From the outer rim to Colonia. Spent weeks mapping a large part of EAFOTS and the surroundings of COL70. Visited the top and the bottom of the galaxy. Comets were my travel friends
and nebulaes my resting place.

Therefore, my excellent fellow threaders, have on me some

for my recent achievement of triple

Explorer Forever !


Lavian Brandy might have been more appropriate, but I never turn down a free drink. Congrats. One left to do now...good luck with that one! haha
