My take is all we're seeing now is orisians teaching/evolving us in how to fight thargoids, as well being weapons balance testing by fdev. Then they annoy the klaxians and the locks come off while the orisians zip through the bubble and split up heading for conflux, hawkings, formidine and maybe even colonia all for the sake of ironic symmetery.
Yeah, I similarly suspect that this is the start of our training by the Oreserians. Operation Human Shield isn't going to work very well for them if the shield can't provide substantial resistance.

Can't really see why they'd head off to our escape sites though. What's your reasoning behind that?
