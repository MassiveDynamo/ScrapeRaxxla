Be honest though.... Nobody really wants to find raxxla. Because you know, deep down, that it isn't going to be satisfying.

The amount of time spent placing it is a tiny fraction of the time spent by any single person looking for it and creating clues and backstory where none exist.

Raxxla can never be more interesting and beneficial to the game and its lore than while it isn't found. It becomes cancerous once it is because it will require content that doesn't exist, all players will hate it for different reasons, and it can no longer inspire players.... And there is nothing that can replace it.

So for fdev's sake... Hopefully it is never found.
