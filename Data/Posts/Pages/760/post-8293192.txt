Hmm...watching new video (russian):

It's about "zone of life" in galaxy scale. he says, that is area where star's rotation speed around core is equal to spiral sleeve's rotation/move speed. So star remains inside sleeve (co-rotation zone).
And well, basically, my round trip shows that right part of Galaxy, which is heavy infected by life is in this zone (mostly)...
Interesting, if FD knew that or just model made this result.
