Raxxla is a certain celestial body, The Myth, but also a place that isn't a place.
A scientist may assume it's kind of a Black Hole... (As many players already stated and investigated)
But any Buddhist here to really enlighten us ?

Ironically you're not far off a mark with the Buddhism comment. My first impression of the "...place but not a place" statement has always been simplistic. It's a place (or type of place) you know about, but you don't know it's a place.

An example of this logic would be Witchspace. It's a place, but we don't think of it as a place you can go to or as a place that holds much significance. Along the same line of thinking, Raxxla could also be an undetectable planet, since it's a place but you wouldn't KNOW it's a place without being able to scan it.

Possibly a contorted way of looking at things, but riddles of this nature often have simple conclusions that subvert expectations by virtue of being obvious when you think about it.
