Have we considered the possibility that Raxxla is related to Guardians? Have we looked into the shape/size/location of Guardian ruins as a potential clue? I couldn't help but notice that the center north structure resembles a key. And the border is a hexagon. And even though it's pushing it with this one, the bottom left pattern kind of looks like an orbis station.
