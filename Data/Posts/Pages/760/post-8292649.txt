There has only been 15,320 posts on this subject before this one. I am sure you are 90% closer to finding raxla. This means it should be found by the time another 1,532 posts are made. Mind you if I am wrong and you are only 10% of the way there then expect another 132,000 posts before you achieve this goal.

Every journey begins with but a step and it is the steps between the first and last one that define the journey. Follow your nose and you will always see where you are going.
