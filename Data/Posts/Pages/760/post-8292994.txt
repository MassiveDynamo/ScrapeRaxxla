Opportunity missed (again) FDev! Imagine it knew where you were going and offered missions to that location, even if it was outside the 20LY typical limit. I'd really like to grab missions along a travel path I've already set and pop in at stations along the way to help systems further along with specific cargo needs etc.

Instead, I'm regularly jumping from one side of the bubble to the other with no cargo or missions.
That’s not an opportunity missed. It’s an opportunity that still remains.

The mission board is essentially just a ‘push’ function using public information on you (as a pilots federation) member.

It’s essentially the inverse you want, where there’s a ‘pull’ function based on non-public information which you might choose to publicise, such as your intended flight path. Essentially you advertising your services, as opposed to looking at a list of contracts that others are advertising.

That side of things requires action on your part, the mission board does not. It’s a different thing.

It’s come up before, particularly in terms of passengers, but you could always put a suggestion in for it, as there’s no guarantee it’s on FD’s radar.
