That’s not an opportunity missed. It’s an opportunity that still remains.

The mission board is essentially just a ‘push’ function using public information on you (as a pilots federation) member.

It’s essentially the inverse you want, where there’s a ‘pull’ function based on non-public information which you might choose to publicise, such as your intended flight path. Essentially you advertising your services, as opposed to looking at a list of contracts that others are advertising.

That side of things requires action on your part, the mission board does not. It’s a different thing.

It’s come up before, particularly in terms of passengers, but you could always put a suggestion in for it, as there’s no guarantee it’s on FD’s radar.

What they ^^ said...

Have mentioned it in more detail in several places where it doesn't appear to have gained traction...

Seems possible air traffic controller systems might have a flight plan requirement to dock or leave?
