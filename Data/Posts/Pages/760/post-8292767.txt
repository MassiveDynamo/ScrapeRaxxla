Does anyone have a 'full' faction bar for Federation/Empire/Alliance? I think I have federation, but I'll need to check later in-game to be 100%. Don't think I have Empire and certainly not alliance.

I wonder if this is how we might get a DW invite? Take a passenger into the Universe and get a follow-up to drop on a TDW station?! One can only hope... as I've never received a chained passenger mission, never!
Superpower rep doesn't work like that once you're Admiral / King, it kinda fluctuates around 75%.

I've Allied with all the engineers in the bubble but not Colonia and didn't get a TDW invite thus far...

[Edit: Also got most, if not all available Federation, Empire and independent faction permit locks.]
