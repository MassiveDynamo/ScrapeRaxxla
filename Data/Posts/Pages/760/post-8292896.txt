This week I have mostly been plodding round the Pleiades tracking down and solving all the Beacons. I have found over a dozen abandoned or attacked settlements, been hyperdicted another half dozen times, accidentally boosted into a Tharg just before shutdown and upset her and got away with 28% hull and also just about kept Aisling happy for another week so I could get that last size 8 Prismatic in a desperate race for funds before the clock ran out.

Now have 2m in the bank and a 26m rebuy so that's fun, bit more wary of other players now but nothing to report.

All the Pleiades beacons (and I think I got them all, I been literally everywhere, 1st mapped a couple too), all point to Thargoid activity, some to INRA and Thargoid. None seem to hint at anything else. All the 'strange lights' are related to Thargoid so far.

Theres plenty of mysteries in this game but none lead to Raxxla so far.
