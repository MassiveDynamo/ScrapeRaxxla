Just came XTE J1748-288, it is 163.xx sols masses ... still no heat until u hit excl zone. This is biggest one I met except Sag A*
Also there is cool bug ... once u engage from ...u have thing to align, u aligned, and stopped drive ...well ...because it does not work immedial and overheat( I think u need rotation match too) ... so any next time u engage - that align point is not shown any more ....guess urself
If somebody can repeat near heavy objects (starting from planets) - plz make a tickets separated to fix it. Also I would put rotation bug .... i dont need rotate (around symmetrical axis of ship) to engage in direction.
