I lost my cowboy hat made of foil, if someone finds a request, bring it to Rubigo.
Analyzing the report of the holdstock, a lot of things haunt me ... The toast itself, is it the whole card? I think not, it is too banal and simple, but even if it is a card, it does not give us anything. We will find out all the points, and then what?
We were told everything was too obvious to give clues, but nonetheless, we have clues in the form of a toast and the history of the game. here the most important thing is not to mix up the plots, what we are doing successfully ... They told us that we would read the news between the lines.

The first line of the toast directly points to one of the three systems, tau, sol and achenar.

Second line, whisper, siren. in fact, any satellite transmitting coordinates is suitable for this, or you need to fly outside the system and stop and hear a call.

The third line deserves special attention. Why is everyone stubbornly ignoring the obvious? They come up with Stella, the cupid, but no one absolutely wants to see the obvious. This is the Ryder family. And what a coincidence in Sol is Oberon and Neptune.

Going back, what do we do with this information? Saul seems to have been examined up and down. Maybe action is expected from us? but which ones?
Since I am at work and if you read up to this place I have a request, try to destroy an unknown satellite or voyager, maybe this will give something.

think that's all?
Suppose the first line speaks of sol, the second will speak of Nefertim or the system between sol and Nefertiy, the third line of lave.

What do you think?
