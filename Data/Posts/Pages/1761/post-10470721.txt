Mmm, how do you personally define progress in this quest?
That's an interesting question actually . ...hmm... Well, i would say, for example, threads/posts like this--> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...can-every-system-within-200-ly-of-sol.531480/ ... But otherwise, any theory or search or evidence or something-to-rule-out-something-else ( aka intel ) would be considered as progress. Slowly but surely, it's about the collective accumulation of DATA.

I would hate this thread to become unhelpful to people searching...
Well , in my case, if you noticed i still helped him in my above reply.

My only polite request ( i can't "demand" anything since i'm not a Mod ) was to please stay on-topic for the betterment of this thread ( aka The Greater Good ) .
