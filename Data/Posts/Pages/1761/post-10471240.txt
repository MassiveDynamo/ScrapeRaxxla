ED absolutely did not have anything resembling space fog at release. I don't even think the game can do a planet in space fog, now.
Not sure if it's even a thing in the universe. One would think that a planet's gravity would pull in a cloud of gas, rather quickly. If it does exist, it's probably a very temporary situation.

I also think it's quite clear from the missing explorer picture that what we see, is atmospheric fog. The pilot is close to ground and the fog covers the view of another planet, just over the horizon.

I can’t confirm what that image is intended to be directly, but I agree, your correct that such space fog would not necessarily ’follow’ a body, it ought to get absorbed through gravity surely, most likely over time as a ring?

In game these are separate POIs that arrived with the Codex, if this is representative of Raxxla it identifies a hand crafted location that’s unique.

However I suspect this is not.

The gas is more likely framed with the bodies behind it in the field of view, they likely are not in an orbit.

In my assessment it’s in space, as if you play with the saturation on a hi-res version of the image you can see a few stars shine through it.

The illumination artifice is blocking some aspects of the bodies behind it, so much so I presume this either identifies a large distance separates them, or this is a composite?

Personally I think this might just be stock imagery?
