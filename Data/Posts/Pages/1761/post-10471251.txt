I can’t confirm what that image is relative to but your correct in that such space fog would not’ follow’ a body, it would get absorbed through gravity, most likely over time as a ring?

In game these are separate POIs that arrived with the Codex, if this is representative of Raxxla it identifies a hand crafted location that’s unique.

However I suspect this is not.

The gas is more likely framed with the bodies behind it in the field of view, they likely are not in an orbit.

In my assessment it’s in space, as if you play with the saturation on a hi-res version of the image you can see a few stars shine through it.

The illumination artifice is blocking some aspects of the bodies behind it, so much so I presume this either identifies a large distance separates them, or this is a composite?

Personally I think this might just be stock imagery.

Id agree. Perhaps I phrased it badly, but I dont think Soontill was surrounded by/embedded in space fog, IIRC (& brain +stomanch are both woozy-think thedog & I may both have norovirus ) the planet became visible through the fog, i.e. situated behind it - see book chapter 20. Id also agree this seems to be used here as a stock photo for the Halloween treasure hunt, which makes it use moot in the codex.

Edit
Sorry if that's off-topic!
( Apart from MB (Elite Legacy) the book authors knew nothing of Raxxla in ED, so I dont see how that pic, nor Soontill, can be relevant to Raxxla. Inferences can be drawn from the Codex about the TDW/CEIP, but inferences aren't proofs. Moreover IMO Lyta Crane is very suspect as a source of info on TDW)
