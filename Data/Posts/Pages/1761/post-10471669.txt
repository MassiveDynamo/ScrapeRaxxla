ED absolutely did not have anything resembling space fog at release. I don't even think the game can do a planet in space fog, now.
Not sure if it's even a thing in the universe. One would think that a planet's gravity would pull in a cloud of gas, rather quickly. If it does exist, it's probably a very temporary situation.

I also think it's quite clear from the missing explorer picture that what we see, is atmospheric fog. The pilot is close to ground and the fog covers the view of another planet, just over the horizon.

The missing explorer image is a recycled cropped version of the codex image showing a Caeruleum Lagrange Cloud - introduced in the Beyond Chapter 4 update.

This means it can only be in space as there were no atmospheric planets at the time of taking this screenshot.

Depending on the camera settings used to take this image, it is likely a foreshortened zoomed view to capture the planetary bodies in the distance.
I would imagine you can only achieve a shot like this at the L1 or L2 points nearer to the bodies.

Note the image dates are during the beta phase of Chapter Four prior to release.
