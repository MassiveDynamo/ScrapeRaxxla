Speaking of Sol:

I've been searching loosely to find any investigations into the asteroid / planetoid 15810 Arawn.
If it exists in ED this object would have been detected by now so I'm not holding much weight to it. It orbits between Neptune and Pluto and would easily be picked up by FSS.
It just caught my eye as I was reading up on Arawn.
