Id agree. Perhaps I phrased it badly, but I dont think Soontill was surrounded by/embedded in space fog, IIRC (& brain +stomanch are both woozy-think thedog & I may both have norovirus ) the planet became visible through the fog, i.e. situated behind it - see book chapter 20. Id also agree this seems to be used here as a stock photo for the Halloween treasure hunt, which makes it use moot in the codex.

Edit
Sorry if that's off-topic!
( Apart from MB (Elite Legacy) the book authors knew nothing of Raxxla in ED, so I dont see how that pic, nor Soontill, can be relevant to Raxxla. Inferences can be drawn from the Codex about the TDW/CEIP, but inferences aren't proofs. Moreover IMO Lyta Crane is very suspect as a source of info on TDW)

Personally, I think Raxxla is a body with a ring.
