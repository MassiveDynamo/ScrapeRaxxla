Well , in my case, if you noticed i still helped him in my above reply.

My only polite request ( i can't "demand" anything since i'm not a Mod ) was to please stay on-topic for the betterment of this thread ( aka The Greater Good ) .
@Macros Black , as you are listed as the poster on page 1 for the opening post and in my opinion defining the purpose of the this particular thread and therefore rules of engagement...

Which were (From the 1st Post - Jul 20, 2015):
"This ship log will be used to document the assumptions, facts, theories and efforts surrounding Raxxla, with the ultimate goal of locating Raxxla. All commanders willing to join are most welcome."

Any issues with efforts highlighted as potentially being significantly off-topic?
