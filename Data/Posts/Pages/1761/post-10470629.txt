Im over a planet. Ive DSS'd it, there's supposed to be one biological, but I cant see any marker to that on the surface nor in the nav panel.
As far as i'm aware, 'biologicals' aren't shown as "markers" listed within nav panel. Instead, look for the BLUE patterns on planet/globe. Whenever you have time, you should probably check your in-game Codex--->Pilot's Handbook , and/or see this related Exo guide--> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/exobiology-a-2023-updated-guide.615722/

Am I doing something wrong?
CMDR, any chance you could please stop posting your personal off-topic stuff ^ here in this RAXXLA thread? Please?
Some of us notice a new post pop-up and actually think it might be a new discovery or a relevant clue ( progress ) .
