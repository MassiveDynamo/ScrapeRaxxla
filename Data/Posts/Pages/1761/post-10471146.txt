Dont want to spoil the book plot (it's really a good read!) but IIRC:
SPOILER



But in the book the planet Soontill was hidden by a "space fog"...the in-game system bears little resemblance to the book's description (apart from a large planetary surface artefact, supposedly the crater from the superweapon effect). This has led some to speculate that the Soontill system itself is not the correct one, however I suspect it is more likley that FD werent willing/able to support the book description accurately. IIRC the cloud effects came in only a couple of years ago, long after book release.
ED absolutely did not have anything resembling space fog at release. I don't even think the game can do a planet in space fog, now.
Not sure if it's even a thing in the universe. One would think that a planet's gravity would pull in a cloud of gas, rather quickly. If it does exist, it's probably a very temporary situation.

I also think it's quite clear from the missing explorer picture that what we see, is atmospheric fog. The pilot is close to ground and the fog covers the view of another planet, just over the horizon.
