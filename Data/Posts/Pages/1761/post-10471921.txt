Been looking to this section of sky for a while and thought similar theories about a roadmap. Lots of interesting names and candidates to look for, but cant wrap my head around what may be a clue or not. I have my own reasons to believe RAXXLA is located in this portion of sky.
I am starting to think the Raxxla Codex's path is:

Brow of Cassiopeia (start) > jump ( i think 6 times, in a specific pattern/order) > and the parents grief/lovers woe/vagabond hearts is telling us the system with raxxla is a system in the area between Cassiopeia (parents grief), Andromeda (lovers woe), and Perseus (vagabond hearts)
