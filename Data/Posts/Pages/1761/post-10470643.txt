Thanks, Ive clearly been out of the loop much longer than I thought-planetary poi used to be marked by orange circles and labelled in the nav panel. Or is this because I'm now playing Odyssey instead of Horizons, which is what I thought I'd selected?

I'm exploring the system where my current Raxxla hypothesis leads-any difference in what I expected raises a flag for investigation.

Mmm, how do you personally define progress in this quest? Ive been Questing since 2016 and haven't yet managed to define that satisfactorily

Edit
I think I'm fighting off a bug. Having had an exceedingly sore throat & temperature thursday/friday, bad headache since yesterday, upset stomach today. So I'm definitely not firing on all cylinders. Clearly Ive been running Odyssey today instead of Horizons. I shall take another couple of Ibuprofen!

However this thread is very friendly, it's the cameraderie that has made it a success. We dont know what we're looking for, where it is, nor how to recognise it if we do stumble it. So we generate a lot of discussion about all sorts of things.
