thats connectivity issue afaik...
But disappearance of the game menu from the Escape key at the same tIme seems to suggest a game bug, & not connectivity issue which is pretty good normally for me (125Mbps ethernet). Connectivity problems normally come up as Beige Cobra or similar weird codename. Since I was playing in Solo and just trying to start up fsd for in-system travel shouldn't have required any comms...the system would already be loaded in my PC.

I’m remembering DB’s chortle when he said “that’s a strange one, is Raxxla in-game? of course! but you dont know what it is”...I wouldn't put it past him to implement Raxxla as a joke bug!

I’m also remembering the BSOD when we first encountered the FRift bases which didnt load as they should have.

I’ll retry, still in the same system, probably after lunch. Copawlot is eyeing my ankles hungrily.

I dont seriously think this was it. Looking at the dots of the logo I suspect it’s hidden 556656 ls out in deep space!

Edit
The system was Persephone. The bug didnt happen again.
