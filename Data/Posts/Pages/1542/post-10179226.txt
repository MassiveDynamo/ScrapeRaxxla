The funny thing is Orbis is not the even the oldest station type - and it isn't even close. The discrepancy is almost 500 years.

From Brewer Corporation codex:



As best I can figure, there is no Orbis nor competitors to it until the mid-3200s. See Nostrum Incident at bottom of Brewer Corporation codex that occurs in Tau Ceti.

Also, I have bad news on Timothy Brewer...

From "All that Glisters..."





So, Timothy Brewer is a complete fiction with the inventor being Jacques ("the supplanter"). Conservative estimates places Jaques at nearly 600 years old at a very minimum at the present time. This jackass has been on the radar for Alliance Interpol for a while since we have jurisdiction of the Old Worlds Coalition region.

This, also means Facece has another alias - Vetitice.
could also mean topaz in Phekda or ayethi, but Phekda has an interesting description regarding generation ships etc and was actually named topaz as a system name before being changed around or before Horizons and still shows it as a system name if searched ;-)
