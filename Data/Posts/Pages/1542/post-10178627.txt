The FC sensor bug-FC were able to sense inside permit locked systems, the permit was never dropped. Dont think so for Polaris, though think one of the other locked systems had 8 moons. Search in this thread or google it. Probably on Reddit somewhere.
Wasn't it HIP 22460 which is currently infested with ticked off Thargoids? I think the system had the Overlook Flight Operations Carrier.
