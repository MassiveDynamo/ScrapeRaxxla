Yes, I think thats the one cis there was a lot of chatter about it being TDW HQ, but no evidence, & no permit.
This simple post really highlights for me just how big this game really is. I thought I knew all the things and then I hear about Witch's Reach. I plop over to EDSM and search for it, thinking "I can easily answer this for the raxxlachaps." EDSM doesn't have a record of it? Ooooooo....mysteries intensifying! So then I do a quick googley and find out that Witch's Reach, along with three other systems have a unique permit. I find a thread from 2015 about it. So here we are, eight years later, and no one's figured it out (or else it's just still handwavium locked) - AND - I knew absolutely nothing about it. And I even know about those two "security" permitted systems that are equidistant from SagA*.


Boggles the mind, it does.
