I don't quite understand the meaning of the words : original group.
And now ...
I think this being the original members: Alex Ryder, Raffe Zetter, and a handful others. It honestly sounded like Elyssia Fields was possibly brought into the organization. Of note, when Alex Ryder meets Elyssia Fields she asks if he has a speech function like she was expecting an android/cyborg which is curious in itself.



I'd also like to mention the story that Alex Ryder mentioned about Teorge better matches with Lave and Colony Ships Hershel and Oberon. So, there may be some weirdness about WHO settled Lave. Was Lave a clone colony from the beginning? Is this why the Feds have such strong rules regarding genetic manipulation and cloning?

NOTE: There is not one single body in Teorge that would support life. Lave, however is not terraformed and naturally supports life.
