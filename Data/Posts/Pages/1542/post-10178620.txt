Going off at another road again having done some random searching on my phone in the hotel last night, didn't the Polaris system get accidentally revealed at one point?
Was the ringed planet (B1??) shown to have 8 moons? did anything come from this?
Obviously its locked again now.

The FC sensor bug-FC were able to sense inside permit locked systems, the permit was never dropped. Dont think so for Polaris, though think one of the other locked systems had 8 moons. Search in this thread or google it. Probably on Reddit somewhere.
