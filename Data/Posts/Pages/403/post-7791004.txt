I was curious to see if I might see something Raxxla-related in the patch notes from Gamma, and sure enough, buried way down in the list ... "Secret added". Lots of people in the comments seemed to suspect that it meant Thargoids, but since the Thargoids didn't show up until much later, I suspect it was Raxxla (whatever that may be). I think it's neat that they put things like that in the patch notes. I think I'll continue to look over the more recent patch notes to see if any clues might be lurking about.
