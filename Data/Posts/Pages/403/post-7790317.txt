You can transform Lennox into Raxxla with a Vigenere key gwkkxd. But it's not that, it just sounds like Lennox's DBX may have had something in the logs that even he didn't know about, and Romero saw it during maintenance, and caught the fernweh.

Mmm, with his recent episodes of sleep disturbance with intense dreaming, and periods of distraction, I think this is more likely mind control/hexedit related, or even AI construct; hadnâ€™t been looking at Guardian relics/blueprints/ materials recently had he? Expect a storyline in about 2 years...
