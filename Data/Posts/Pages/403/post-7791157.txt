Probably it was in this thread already. This logo of Raxxla looks like triple aspect of Hecate who often was imaged as a triple woman figure. She brings the light by holding torches. Also same visual and back was for Artemis, Persephone and Eileithyia (Ilithyia) who lights the dark for the children. There are two systems with this names but no any variations of Eileithyia.

P.s. My bad English's joke: Ilithyia - Elite(yia)

I am pretty sold on Hecate ( ya some of this has been gone over before.)

Yup - The strophalos or circle of hecate is very similar to the inner part of the raxxla logo. ( circle with three arcs)

A door that is also a key.... Hecate is a goddess of gateways/ transitions and key bearer....

From the bits and pieces of the Chaldean Oracles it depicts Hecate as something of a conduit between realms...

This gets into Neoplatonism and Starts me on the song of the spheres and sirens ...
Check this paper out: "Sirens: From the Deadly Song to the Music of the Spheres. Homeric Readings and Platonic Interpretations"

To tie things up we go to the Myth of Er from Platos Republic where he describes the gates of hell. (and talks about Lady Fate, which to be honest I thought Id hear more of)

Here is an interesting paper talking about "PLATO’S X & HEKATE’S CROSSROADS ASTRONOMICAL LINKS TO THE MYSTERIES OF ELEUSIS

well atleast its giving me some new ideas on where to look...
