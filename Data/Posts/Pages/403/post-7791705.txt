I am pretty sold on Hecate ( ya some of this has been gone over before.)

Yup - The strophalos or circle of hecate is very similar to the inner part of the raxxla logo. ( circle with three arcs)

A door that is also a key.... Hecate is a goddess of gateways/ transitions and key bearer....

From the bits and pieces of the Chaldean Oracles it depicts Hecate as something of a conduit between realms...

This gets into Neoplatonism and Starts me on the song of the spheres and sirens ...
Check this paper out: ""

To tie things up we go to the from Platos Republic where he describes the gates of hell. (and talks about Lady Fate, which to be honest I thought Id hear more of)

Here is an interesting paper talking about "

well atleast its giving me some new ideas on where to look...

Do you realize there is a system called hecate. I just got it in a tourist trip mission. It has multiple water or earth like worlds or something and tourist beacons. I think we need to go over all the tourist beacons and do tourist missions and then look at the clues. That is the other place there are written word clues.

Hecate may have been the one with the lovers destination where people propose. If a person doesn't accept it could be the lovers woe etc. It matches up. I think the hints for the clue are located in all the tourist beacons. It's just a journey to get them all and find the clues. They interestingly enough added the raxxla clues and the ability to see previously scanned tourist beacon and other data in the same patch. I don't think it's a coincidence.

FYI, I think this game was made after braben went on a long holiday and then decided to put it in a game.
