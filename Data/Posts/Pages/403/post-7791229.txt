The thing to remember about the Codex is that it exist in-game as a feature that our CMDRs can access from their cockpits.

To place any meaning in the particular logo that was chosen for the Raxxla entry in the Codex is to assume that whoever designed the Codex's interface in the game universe posseses some kind of knowledge about Raxxla that allows them to say, "This circle, nested inside a hexagon is intrinsically representative of Raxxla".

I find it far more likely that the icon is completely arbitrary. Lacking any other graphical representation for Raxxla both the fiction in-game curator of the Codex and Frontier Developments have opted for a more-or-less random collection of geometric shapes and cobbled them together to create an icon simply out of the need for us users to have something inside the codex to select when accessing the Raxxla entry. Trying to assing any hidden meaning behind the image is probably a waste of energy. Even if the image somehow contains a deeper hidden meaning it is unlikely that we'll be able to decode that meaning without the right context.

On the other hand ... the lack of any serious leads toward locating Raxxla makes it irresistable to speculate on even the slightest piece of evidence.
