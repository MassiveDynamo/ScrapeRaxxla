The three segmented lines could stand for the Hilda asteroids where you have clusters separated by 60Â°:

And as mentioned, the green glow also occurs when close to a BH, so perhaps it's the Omphalos which might be a wormhole?

Yes, if it exists then Omphalos must be a wormhole (gateway; place that is not a place) to Raxxla so it might well use the same mechanism as a BH, though I've dived over a hundred BH, and seen more, and discovered a few, and never seen any green glow attached to them. So it could be what you saw was the refracted light of something else seen via the gravity well of the BH.
