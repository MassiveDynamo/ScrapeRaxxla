I also had a thought.
do we really want to find raxxla?
if it is in deed some sort of intergalactic jump gate, this implies that not only can we go there but others can come here.
if we turn this on, we could be faced with an invasion.
perhaps that is the reason for the thargoid attacks. they simply dont want it activated. maybe they are trying to protect us from our own arrogance
