Interesting thoughts there. I did wonder how the “Song of the Spheres” might fit in, but unfortunately I’m not musically gifted. I did also like the possibility that MB’s back tattoo was a major clue & that led me onto my earlier Paradise Lost/Alpha Centauri/Eden hypothesis; hadn’t thought of your interpretation. I still think the 3 crossed lines in the Raxxla icon indicates several of the asteroids; the dotted hexagon as an engineering drawing convention indicating “hidden” hadn’t occurred to me either, but might be a better interpretation than mine of 33 Polyhymnia, although I still like the fact that she is depicted as finger to lips & wearing a cloak which does suggest stealth. In the end it would be interesting to hear from FD what their thinking was in constructing these clues. It might be that they were well aware of the multiple possibilities & thought they all applied.

But I’d urge people to wing up and search the outer edge of the asteroid belt in sector 16 with coordinated scan honking. I still think that green glow I spotted was Raxxla/Omphalos beginning to instance and there is more to see. I might search further but try a more agile ship than my exploration Phantom. But at the moment after a month of searching I’m RNGd out.

The three segmented lines could stand for the Hilda asteroids where you have clusters separated by 60°:

And as mentioned, the green glow also occurs when close to a BH, so perhaps it's the Omphalos which might be a wormhole?
