I also had a thought.
do we really want to find raxxla?
if it is in deed some sort of intergalactic jump gate, this implies that not only can we go there but others can come here.
if we turn this on, we could be faced with an invasion.
perhaps that is the reason for the thargoid attacks. they simply dont want it activated. maybe they are trying to protect us from our own arrogance

Depends on how true the info is given to us maybe no one is there or shadow organization keeping anyone who approach it or from leaving with the info or not. At this point it don't matter with the Thargoids nipping at our heels. It can be the Club who are the ones benefitting off of Raxxla for all we know and it's possible why the got so much power and influence. It's best to discover and make assessments as to what is going on and find a connection to what is happening within the games lore.
