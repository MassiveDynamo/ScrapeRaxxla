Yes, if it exists then Omphalos must be a wormhole (gateway; place that is not a place) to Raxxla so it might well use the same mechanism as a BH, though I've dived over a hundred BH, and seen more, and discovered a few, and never seen any green glow attached to them. So it could be what you saw was the refracted light of something else seen via the gravity well of the BH.

My current bent related to wormholes has been to reconcile a Raxxla Wormhole with current wormhole theory - I imagine that if they do implement it - they will try to follow those conventions. Which is why I like the Omphalos as some sort of object that contains "Exotic Matter" which would possibly open the wormhole and help keep it open while traveling through it. I am also thinking that the "Song of the Spheres" is possibly alluding to the use of Harmonics to stabilize the wormhole.
