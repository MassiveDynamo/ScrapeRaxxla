Yes, if it exists then Omphalos must be a wormhole (gateway; place that is not a place) to Raxxla so it might well use the same mechanism as a BH, though I've dived over a hundred BH, and seen more, and discovered a few, and never seen any green glow attached to them. So it could be what you saw was the refracted light of something else seen via the gravity well of the BH.

But there's a difference: A BH only shifts the wavelength / bends light that is local to the current system. A wormhole might connect two systems, so you might be getting light from the other system's sun, therefore the "glow" (here the big assumption is that FD would implement such detailed effects).
I still need to get my Sol-permit, so I can't investigate it currently :/
