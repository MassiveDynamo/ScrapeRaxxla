Do you know what is this? I saw it on your videos too.
Looks like comet. I was flying in Sol asteroid belt, dropped off super cruise and it was on the screen. It faded away after few seconds.
SPOILER: IMAGE

Well, Han_Zen mentioned Halley’s Comet in Sol. There are some comets in-game but I don’t think FD have got the visuals sorted. There realistically should be quite a few comets in Sol. However I suspect what you’re seeing there is your engine exhaust/faster-than-light trail after you’ve dropped out of supercruise and turned around; it dies away after a few seconds.
If you saw it on my videos it was definitely my exhaust/trail.
