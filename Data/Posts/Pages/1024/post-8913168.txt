But there's a difference: A BH only shifts the wavelength / bends light that is local to the current system. A wormhole might connect two systems, so you might be getting light from the other system's sun, therefore the "glow" (here the big assumption is that FD would implement such detailed effects).
I still need to get my Sol-permit, so I can't investigate it currently :/

Though there are no green stars.
