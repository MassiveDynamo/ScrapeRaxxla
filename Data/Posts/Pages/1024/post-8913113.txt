last night a theory came to mind.
how do permit locks work.
what i mean is how do you prevent someones engin from moving a ship to a chosen location. it didnt make sense. imagin your car not being able to drive you to a city just because you dont have a permit. how ro you do that.

a network.

your engin is connected to a network that can prevent it from activating without a permit.

the guardians built a huge network through the galaxy.
what if the fsd drives are based on guardian network tec.
who controls the network and therefor the permits.

this begs the question, can we subvert or break free from this network? can we build or find a fsd drive that will allow us to go where we want.

if raxxla in behind a permit lock, one we can't obtain. perhaps the way in is to find someway to break out of the network that locks us out.
I think the key to this may be the thargoids.

they may have already found it and the reason they attack people with goid tec on board is they dont want us to find it. it may also explain the attacks on stations. they may be looking for those humans that control the permits. the humans that know the location.
