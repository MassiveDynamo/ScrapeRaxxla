I had a sudden thought this afternoon, wondering if I’d fallen foul of light reflected from/passing through the atmosphere of Venus, but after checking that this afternoon, and screenshots from earlier days of this search I’m confident that is not the case.

Bought and engineered an Eagle this afternoon, more agile than the Phantom. Spent a few more exasperating hours in sector 16 fruitlessly hoping to get Randomius Factoria to sort out the RNG!
