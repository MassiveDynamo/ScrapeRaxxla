I hope Raxxla is in game and is found by someone who has put the work in rather than someone just tripping over it. Sadly I highly suspect it's hidden behind an unobtainable permit lock and will only be unlocked in future content or if and when player numbers drop to an all time low to draw lost commanders back in, a sort of safety net if you like
