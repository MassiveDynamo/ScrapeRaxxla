In fact, I just got my surface scanner out. The centre of the logo IS the surface scanner. Either that, or the artist had just been scanning a planet before he came up with a random shape pattern....but I rather go with the former
if i assume that in fact the center logo is a surface scanner, then the way i interpret it is like this :
SPOILER: INNER LOGO
1 - Surface Scanner Lines.
2 - A Planet.
3 - Something On A Planet.
4 - ?
does this mean that Raxxla is a Something that is Scannable on a planet? that is if we assume that this interpretation of the logo is true.

Edit 1: Maybe 4 is simply the "instance boundaries" in wich the Planet Exists? in wich case, if we take the rest of the logo in consideration(the 6 triangle pieces). maybe we could say : 6 pieces are required, to enter the instance/system in wich this planet exists, on wich we can scan the supposed Raxxla object?
