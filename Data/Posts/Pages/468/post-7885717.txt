In fact, I just got my surface scanner out. The centre of the logo IS the surface scanner. Either that, or the artist had just been scanning a planet before he came up with a random shape pattern....but I rather go with the former
Or it could be a set of instructions, a treasure map. From the starting point, Tau Ceti?? Sol?? SD? Go to the 6th closest star, and then go to the 33rd object in that system and get your surface scanner out.

I really wish I hadn't had a moment of madness, when I decided to take a 31 ly Beluga on a DW passenger mission to Empyrean Straits when I have a 60 ly ASP and a 65 ly conda in the hanger. Sigh. I could have been back by now, to play with this. As it is, I'm still 380 jumps from Shin. Sigh
