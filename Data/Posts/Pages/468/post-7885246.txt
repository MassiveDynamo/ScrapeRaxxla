greetings to you all, raxxla seekers.

i only recently started getting interrested in Raxxla. and been reading this thread a bit. i didn't read all of it, so if this has been pointed out previously, i apologise for repeating it.
i've been looking at the codex logo lately, and i cant help but see a box inside a box. and 6 fragments.
SPOILER: RAXXLA LOGO

so i did some paint overlaying.
SPOILER: RAXXLA LOGO MODIFIED
i named the fragments from 1 to 6. if you pull them together to the center, they form a perfect box and deductively Raxxla is inside?
what could the 6 fragments be? 6 clues? 6 keys? 6 missions?
also what does the supposed raxxla inside look like? is it familiar in any way?

here is the final result without all the lines.
SPOILER: FINAL LOGO WITHOUT LINES

just some random tinfoil hat thoughts
