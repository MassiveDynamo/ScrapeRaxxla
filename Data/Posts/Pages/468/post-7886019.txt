if i assume that in fact the center logo is a surface scanner, then the way i interpret it is like this :
SPOILER: INNER LOGO
1 - Surface Scanner Lines.
2 - A Planet.
3 - Something On A Planet.
4 - ?

does this mean that Raxxla is a that is on a ? that is if we assume that this interpretation of the logo is true.

Yes. I think my working theory (in part because of this, and in part because of the DB discussion last night) is that Raxxla is not a planet. I think it might be the Martian relic, which was found 16 years prior to the first Raxxla reference, giving the rumour time to spread. If this holds up, we could be looking for a crash site. Maybe the ship was transporting the relic, and the relic burned through it, causing it to crash. (Like thargoid - or perhaps simply thargoid). The ship could be called Andromeda, or similar. Then we would have the jewl that burns bright on the mother of galaxies......????
