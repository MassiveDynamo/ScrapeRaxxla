Me too. My personal belief is that it's in-game, near, or in the bubble.

I think that it's on the "8th moon of a gas giant", but that the gas giant and/or moons are not shown on a scan. Who would notice a missing (hidden) planet or moon? For example, it could be on our doorstep: Just "a little further" past Hutton Orbital. Who would ever look out there?

I think Raxxla will probably turn out to be some sort of alien artifact in orbit around (or on) the moon, which is the entrance to 1 or more new galaxies. That would tie in nicely with the original story.

I don't have the patience to find something like this, but I hope someone does!
