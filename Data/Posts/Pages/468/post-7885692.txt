Look at the centre of the logo. It could well be a depiction of the surface scanner, from commanders PoV.

There are 6 large symbols and 33 "dash" symbols. Could this indicate that we should use our surface scanner in a system where we are surrounded by a 6 stars and 33 orbiting bodies?
In fact, I just got my surface scanner out. The centre of the logo IS the surface scanner. Either that, or the artist had just been scanning a planet before he came up with a random shape pattern....but I rather go with the former
