I'm not making any assertions either way, just pointing out that we actually have no confirmation that Raxxla exists as something in game. I think that, should Raxxla fail to exist as a physical entity in game, there would be no lies on part of FD at this point.
We actually do have confirmation that Raxxla exists as something in the game. Any time you access the Codex you are presented with Raxxla, as something, in Elite Dangerous. It exists as an entry in the Codex which is in the game. Part of the mystery of Raxxla is the question of whether or not it actually exists and, if it does, what is it? Up until someone actually finds Raxxla we will have zero evidence to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it exists. For those that don't believe it exists ... that is perfectly fine. There are plenty of other things to do in Elite Dangerous that don't include hunting for Raxxla.
