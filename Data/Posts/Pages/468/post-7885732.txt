Or it could be a set of instructions, a treasure map. From the starting point, Tau Ceti?? Sol?? SD? Go to the 6th closest star, and then go to the 33rd object in that system and get your surface scanner out.

I really wish I hadn't had a moment of madness, when I decided to take a 31k ly Beluga on a DW passenger mission to Empyrean Straits when I have a 60k ly ASP and a 65k ly conda in the hanger. Sigh. I could have been back by now, to play with this. As it is, I'm still 380 jumps from Shin. Sigh
Hold on!!!! "She claims she's found a map to some pirate stash, and all I have to do is loan her my ship to go dig it up. Maybe we should go find Raxxla while we're at it!" Maybe the logo really IS a map, with Tau Ceti as the starting point????

This would also be "a little bit obvious!"
