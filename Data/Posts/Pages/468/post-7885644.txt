Prester John as that is much less well-known than the other myths it is mentioned alongside, which makes me wonder if there is also a clue in there somewhere.
I doubt (or more so hope) that the mention of Prester John is intended to simply illustrate that Raxxla is elusive. If there are clues hidden somewhere in that old legend then the problem becomes one of trying to sort out just which version of the legend those clues are hidden in.
