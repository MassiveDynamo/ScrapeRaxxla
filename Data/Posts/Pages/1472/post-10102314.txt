Yes It gotta be close.. my guess is below 100ly. If something is so hard to find it cant be below 10ly since there is more ship flying now than in the begining of space travel. And If some of this ships found something then it has to be on a planet(in plain sight) or in the void between stars. Most likley very close to Tau ceti.
It said the ship was based out of Tau Ceti not in Tau Ceti. Assumptions can and will bite you. There is Colm Tornquist (possible relative and name was modified over the centuries) that works for the Imperial Herald and reported on events when the Imperials briefly lost Facece in 3302 to an Independent faction named Allied Facece Order in February 3302. The based out language is unfortunately the devil in the details. Speaking of which there is that pirate stash mentioned in the journal that mentioned Raxxla. Well, there is something that may be hit and needs a lot more checking out (Pirate's Cache POI in Synuefe QA-U d4-27).

Sol -> Synuefe QA-U d4-27: 670.58 LY
Lave -> Synuefe QA-U d4-27: 755.23 LY

Even Sol -> Achenar is 139.45 LY and we made that trip with pre-hyperdrive technology since Mayflower 97 (first generation ship) goes Sol -> Tau Ceti -> Achenar.

Assumptions end badly. Find something to anchor and test ideas. We do, in fact, have the tools to do so.

A Pirate Cache can be found in the Synuefe QA-U d4-27 system on body A 1.
