Yes It gotta be close.. my guess is below 100ly. If something is so hard to find it cant be below 10ly since there is more ship flying now than in the begining of space travel. And If some of this ships found something then it has to be on a planet(in plain sight) or in the void between stars. Most likley very close to Tau ceti.
So there is a classic phrase that some have already found it, but did not understand what it is.

In any case (I have written before) if it hides the Dark Wheel, etc., then the planet Raxxla must have another name on the star chart.
