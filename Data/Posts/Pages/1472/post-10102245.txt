I suspect it is partially based upon the writings of Holdstock, but maybe not 100%, wouldn’t that be too obvious?

I suspect, as @Allen Stroud alluded that M Brookes would have wanted to honour the Holdstock source material, but I presume likewise it may have been expanded upon, to widen its context, mould it to the current lore.

I don’t believe we can ignore the pre-ED lore completely, nor other works by the writer, but at the same time I would not want to treat it as written in stone gospel.
I'm sorry, I have a different opinion. Since the novel was not a separate work I treat it as a Codex in ED.
