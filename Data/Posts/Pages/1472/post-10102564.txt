Greetings, Cmdrs.
I have a question about TDW Missions.
Several weeks ago I went to 9 Puppis, where I noticed that I am already allied with TDW.
I accepted some missions, which I finished. After finishing the missions I accepted at the station when flying in SC I notified message in the chatbox, mentioning that it was hard to find me and "this is not our war.". The ships the went high wake. I didn't had an wake signal scanner equipeped, so I flew to my FC to equip the scanner. Since than I am working on to trigger this messages again.
What I realized is, that I have read this messages some years ago when I was running ED on Xbox. But I thought that messages were procedual generated and I still remember how I said to myself "I gonna care about the signals later, guess the messages are procedual generated.". So years passed, I had a break from ED due to the console drop, moved on to Geforce Now, went to 9 Puppis like I said and then these messages I noticed some years ago occured again.
So my questions is:
Do you know about this?
Are these messages procedually generated or is there a link to the dark wheel and is there a way to trigger this event somehow?
I did some research via chatgpt and got answered that it's definitely possible to trigger some DW Events in game. But I know ChatGPT sometimes isn't very accurate.

I hope you can understand my question, English isn't my native language.

EDIT:
I am mentioning "this is not our war" cause in the web I read in the description of a known player driven faction (which will not give informations or deny any informations about TDW or Raxxla if beeing asked) that this statement is somehow similar to their statement in their description.
