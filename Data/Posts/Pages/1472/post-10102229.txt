Assuming that The Dark Wheel 1984 Novella is the basis for Raxxla in Elite Dangerous: I think this is the case based on a lot of the evidence presented by so, so, so many people here on this thread.
I suspect it is partially based upon the writings of Holdstock, but maybe not 100%, wouldn’t that be too obvious?

I suspect, as @Allen Stroud alluded that M Brookes would have wanted to honour the Holdstock source material, but I presume likewise it may have been expanded upon, to widen its context, mould it to the current lore.

I don’t believe we can ignore the pre-ED lore completely, nor other works by the writer, but at the same time I would not want to treat it as written in stone gospel.
