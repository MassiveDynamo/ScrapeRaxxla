Lave was a dictatorship before Walden took over. It was a dictatorship in Elite, that starts in 3125. TDW novella is not dated, but it's assumed to be set before 3125. Mainly because they use Faraway in the novel and that is not in the game. Thargoids are active in Elite and are mentioned in the novella. This should put the events in TDW to relatively shortly before the game.

The dating is not that important, as TDW is not canon. It's more of a legend, within the game. I suppose we can consider it about as accurate as 'based on a true story' movies.
Citation please (and no Walden is not an acceptable source).

All available evidence suggests both the Old Worlds Coalition and Galactic Cooperative were unshockingly cooperatives. Dictators historically have twisted the perception of the past in order to further secure their grip on power. Further, the misinformation campaigns often start before they are in power. If it was an external source to Lave, it might have credence but we don't have anything like that to my knowledge. This is after all the unmitigated ass of a human who hoisted the term Thargoid on humanity when the region survived the "First Thargoid War" when the region was explicitly banned from having any military by the Imperials following the Morten-Marte Incident in 2498.
