What currently keeps me wondering is Galnet. I mean there is a full fledged Alien invasion underway with a new frontline at CE Bootis, a meager 30ly away from Sol. Yet nothing. One should think the federal navy should be issuing something.

Other thing some guy in a german forum wrote that when using the fss on a BH after 10-15 seconds one can hear words. Didnâ€˜t try that as of yet. Do we have any knowledge on that?
