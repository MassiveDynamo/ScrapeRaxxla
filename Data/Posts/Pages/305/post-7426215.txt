Delphi Planetary landing 0,0 is a bust

Enterable with an active map room. Some are collapsed and non enterable. I was just thinking since Omphalos is mentioned and Delphi has been renamed at the same time, the thargoid base is really the only thing there that would point us ‘somewhere’. The Omphalos rift is supposedly housed at Raxxla, and the only other Omphalos connection we know of is Delphi. Thinking maybe Delphi will at least point us in a beginning direction if there’s coordnance to be had from the base there.

I went to the coordanites 0,0 and there is nothing there. I am going to check out the Thargoid base now.
