Sounds logical and believable, though wasn’t aware Elyssia was cybernetically enhanced. Is that from the original novella? Dont remember it.

Wondering now if there might be a link to Jaques???? Who I think is the only other character known to be cybernetically enhanced.
It’s something Drew said in his lore questions thread. See a few posts back:

Not sure on the Jacques link. Personally my take on it is more that we’re just not particularly aware of any other cyborgs rather than there being some special connection between the two we do know of.
