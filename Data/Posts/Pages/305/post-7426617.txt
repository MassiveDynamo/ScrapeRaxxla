This is probably also obvious, but some of the large ground stations are also a circle with a dot in the middle. That could make the middle of the Raxxla image a ground base with a system map reticule around it.

Here's another fun idea. I just found the anteres wreckage and tourist beacon. It has the actual ship parts in space. Has anyone tried to piece it together and forensically make a model of the ship to see what it looked like? Maybe it give some info to something. Don't know how to do it but I bet someone out there would know how. I wonder if it actually has a unique build or if it uses another ship type. I can't tell from the wreckage so far.

NVM, I'm starting to think it's random debri or an anaconda hull... That would be a cool way to make hints for stuff though. Do any of the shrip wreckages give any unique info like that? there could still be hints iside the wreckage. maybe something that doesn't belong if it or others are put together correctly.
