I'm currently heading out in SC to genship Phanes in a Diamondback Explorer. There is no blue ring showing on my radar. I have the default ED colour scheme.
Edit: dropped out of SC. Still no blue ring.
Perhaps it's ship specific?
I have to admit it's not there for me right now, in a Krait II. Not in my Python cockpit.
Anaconda however, I have this ring in quite many of my pictures. Haven't found a picture without it.
SPOILER: BLUE RING
