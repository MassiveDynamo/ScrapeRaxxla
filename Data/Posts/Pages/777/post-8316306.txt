Perhaps it's ship specific?
I have to admit it's not there for me right now, in a Krait II. Not in my Python cockpit.
Anaconda however, I have this ring in quite many of my pictures. Haven't found a picture without it.
SPOILER: BLUE RING

Ah yes, just checked & Fi5hBoN3 was also flying an annie, ship-specific then!
