DB talks about similar but not DW. That PF recruited from Deadly & dangerous as only a 'kill counter' not a 'skill counter'. Pretty sure its repeated on a beacon somewhere, thought it may be SD.

DB comments may be in that video that confused us, the one about flying a British Navy flag but not being Navy.

Only references to DW recruitment iirc is the Codex saying some believe pilots are sought out, some that's its a family tradition, some that parents keep their children away from it due to danger....keep it open fdev, keep it open.
