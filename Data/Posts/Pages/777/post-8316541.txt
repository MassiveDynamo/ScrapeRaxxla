Hey, @Macros Black

OT for the actual search, but am doing some fixing of a few links that were broken in the forum change.

Went to the FP of this thread as I knew there were some links that were in the right format there, but spotted a couple have the same issue as mine, so just thought I'd drop in how to fix them (also posting in the thread just in case anyone else needs to know).

Ones that are in the old format no longer work, and will just link back to the FP.

Example of old format below:



The fix is to drop the '#' and add a '-' between 'post' and the post number.

See fixed version below:



Hope that's useful!

FP updated. Please let me know if you find any other broken links on the FP.
