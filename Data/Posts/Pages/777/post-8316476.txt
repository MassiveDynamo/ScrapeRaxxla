Nicely spotted.

Could do with someone with VR to check and confirm, but that looks to me like the blue circle is on the 'dashboard' and not part of the radar projection.
It is, I have both VR & TrackIR. I would say it's a feature of certain ships. I'm in the conda now.

In the station, nothing on sensors due to station menu, but the ring is still there.
