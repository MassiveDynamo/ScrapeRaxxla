Solved on the other thread - Looking for Mermaids, its normal blue ring on radar, screenshot shows it docked with blue ring.

Was a bit of fun anyway, amazing what I notice sometimes and ask 'has that always been there?'

I'm currently heading out in SC to genship Phanes in a Diamondback Explorer. There is no blue ring showing on my radar. I have the default ED colour scheme.
Edit: dropped out of SC. Still no blue ring.
