I was more wondering if velour and velorum were the same word in essence. Sometimes they are just different variation of the same word. Velorum/vela constelation looks like a sheet of fabric or instance.

Vela (constellation) - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org

Velorum is the sail of a ship. That could easily be the same word origin as the velour fabrics name. Or even the same fabric at one point.

I think velvet is from deer skin. It may be next to a deer or animal that produces velour or similar. Older sails like viking sails might have used such a fabric. I think they may have coated them in skins if anything.

Sail | Types, Uses & Benefits for Watercrafts | Britannica
Sail, an extent of fabric (such as canvas) by means of which wind is used to propel a ship through water. The first sails were most likely animal skins that were used to harness wind power for rafts or boats consisting of a single log. The next probable step was the use of woven reed mats stretched

I was going to ask if vela was related to the golden fleece it is. Not sure if the golden fleece flying with the ram has to do with sails or not.

Sea silk was produced in the Mediterranean region from the large marine bivalve mollusc Pinna nobilis until early in the 20th century. The shell, which is sometimes almost a metre long, adheres itself to rocks with a tuft of very strong thin fibres, pointed end down, in the intertidal zone. These byssi or filaments (which can be up to 6 cm long) are spun and, when treated with lemon juice, turn a golden colour, which never fades.[3]

Sea silk has been suggested as an interpretation of the nature of the golden fleece that was sought by Jason and the Argonauts[8] but scholars reject this hypothesis.[9]

He was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcos.

Absyrtus - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org

Absyrtus was the son of Aeëtes, king of Colchis and a brother of Medea and Chalciope. His mother is variously given: Hyginus calls her Ipsia,[1] Hesiod and the Bibliotheca call her Idyia,[2][3][4] Apollonius calls her Asterodeia, a Caucasian Oceanid[5] and others Hecate,[6][7] the Nereid Neaera[8][9] or Eurylyte.[10][11]

Iolcus - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org

Along with the Golden Fleece, Jason brought a wife, the sorceress Medea—king Aeetes' daughter, granddaughter of the Sun, niece of Circe, princess of Aea, and later queen of Iolcus, Corinth and Aea, and also murderer of her brother Absyrtus, and her two sons from Jason. She is a tragic figure whose trials and tribulations were artfully dramatized in the much-staged play by Euripides, Medea.

Goddess of boundaries, crossroads, witchcraft, and ghosts.
In the post-Christian writings of the Chaldean Oracles (2nd–3rd century CE) she was regarded with (some) rulership over earth, sea, and sky, as well as a more universal role as Savior (Soteira), Mother of Angels and the Cosmic World Soul.[6][7]
Symbol Paired torches, dogs, serpents, keys, polecat, daggers, and Hecate's wheel.
Parents Perses and Asteria

She was known as the goddess of mastery of the seas, or power over them—particularly external factors like the winds or rising of the constellations. An older, relatively minor deity, her role in most mythology is as the ancestor of other gods.

Thespius's daughter is also named Eurybia. She bore Heracles a son, Polylaus.
