Does anyone know if the greek named system near sol and alioth etc are named from the star database, named by fdev, or player factions. They seem to be placed in a particular fashion with some related names being placed near each other. Most of the names from greek mythos are included, but some are left out for seemingly no reason.

Looking back at the dark wheel novella Greek mythos is mentioned in relation to Elyssia Fields.
Relavant passage:
" 'Trader Fields', she said, and touched the heel of her right hand to her left shoulder by way of salute. 'My given name is Elyssia. Elyssia Fields.' She smiled again. 'My brood mother's little joke. She discovered Greek mythology at age 9 when she was incubating her first cluster.' "

Some version of the elyssian plain of greek mythos may be what raxxla ends up being?
