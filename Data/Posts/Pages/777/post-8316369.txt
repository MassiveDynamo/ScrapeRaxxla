Perhaps it's ship specific?
I have to admit it's not there for me right now, in a Krait II. Not in my Python cockpit.
Anaconda however, I have this ring in quite many of my pictures. Haven't found a picture without it.
SPOILER: BLUE RING
Nicely spotted.

Could do with someone with VR to check and confirm, but that looks to me like the blue circle is on the 'dashboard' and not part of the radar projection.
