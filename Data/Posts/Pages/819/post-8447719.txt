I might buy one in the future after they've been established for a while. As it stands I'm not much into mine grinding so I might mine two or three times in like 3 or 4 months. someday I hope to have enough to buy my own personal fleet carrier but I'm probably just going to interact with one that our Squadron leader will get and we will maintain as a group.

Of course it is a nice idea to have mobile outpost for the Squadron in deep space if we go on an excursion somewhere
