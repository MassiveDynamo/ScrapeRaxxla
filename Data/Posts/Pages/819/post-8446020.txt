I agree and in that vein of thought I think almost all info needed (if there is any) is available in-game or in the game Universe (game, books, forums, Twitter & FB etc). Or at least 'a tiny bit obvious' where to look if not.

Remember Salome was bleeding obvious if we hadn't spent 2 years looking into our souls for the solution. A quick crypto search on the internet gave about 70% chance it was a type of Rail Cypher, which it was.

I just look at the rest as a nice distraction and a chance to learn something from somebody Id never have a chance to meet or talk to in normal life.
