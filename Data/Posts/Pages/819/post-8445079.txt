It was old russian book, about fly to Venus & victory of communism. Damn, they had academician on board instead spaceman, any way. On Venus they found huge bacterias, among other huge grows, which were same single-cell, but more then human-sized
So are you sure your breakfast is not from that book ?


P.S. Why you involve myths there you ignore other cultures. For example, slovenian ones. But I saw names of old gods (before Christ) there too. I'm pretty sure other cultures are presented as well.
Oh that book sounds interesting. Actually I have posted about Slavic and Baltic mythologies on several occasions, The eye of Perun, Buyan island, Alatyr stone, stuff like that. Mythological birds. I'm quite interested in prehistoric cultures around Eastern Europe, the development of Indo-European languages, interactions with nomadic steppe cultures, up until medieval times. Last few days I have been studying Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum by Adam of Bremen, written somewhere in the 11th century. Did you know the Danish had to claim sovereignty over Greenland because the earlier Norsemen, had any of them survived into early 18th century, would not yet have gone through Reformation and would therefore still remain Roman Catholic, and that would just have been horrible?
