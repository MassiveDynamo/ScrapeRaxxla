I think there are quite a few pointers in this direction. The problem is what the hell is the mid-way between Cygnus and Aquila?
Is it in 3D or 2D? Is it between Deneb and Altair or between the closest stars? Is Vega a key to the mid point?

The midpoint in 2D (earth sky) could well be placed on the RA 20h line (RA XX), so that may help a bit. If that's the case, we still need a distance.

That does seem suggestive.
