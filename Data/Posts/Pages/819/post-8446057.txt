not sure if it was ever translated, since it is pre-2ndWW book I think. But you can try to google.
I think you mean these giant microorganisms. Bright pink and purple balls and cylinders of iridescent, viscous gelatin substance, outer skin is wrinkly. Merry creatures really. I'll admit to you, I had one for breakfast. They taste like blueberries.
