Oh that book sounds interesting. Actually I have posted about Slavic and Baltic mythologies on several occasions, The eye of Perun, Buyan island, Alatyr stone, stuff like that. Mythological birds. I'm quite interested in prehistoric cultures around Eastern Europe, the development of Indo-European languages, interactions with nomadic steppe cultures, up until medieval times. Last few days I have been studying Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum by Adam of Bremen, written somewhere in the 11th century. Did you know the Danish had to claim sovereignty over Greenland because the earlier Norsemen, had any of them survived into early 18th century, would not yet have gone through Reformation and would therefore still remain Roman Catholic, and that would just have been horrible?
In russian:
Title: "Астронавты Вселенной"
Author: "Владимир(1st name) Николаевич (2nd) Владко (family name)"
not sure if it was ever translated, since it is pre-2ndWW book I think. But you can try to google.
