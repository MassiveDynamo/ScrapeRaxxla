I think you mean these giant microorganisms. Bright pink and purple balls and cylinders of iridescent, viscous gelatin substance, outer skin is wrinkly. Merry creatures really. I'll admit to you, I had one for breakfast. They taste like blueberries.

Damn, you found exact picture I had in paper book Can't find it, so got electronic text only lately

That paper book had 2nd novel of the same author, about early Italian fascism. Some scientist there made super tank, got a crew, and was killing government soldiers. Like captain America. Sad story though, he lost in the end. Machine was named "Lucifer". I think that story proposed "shields" 1st evere time in history. Machine could reflect shoots using magnetic field. They lost when soldiers used plastic bullets.
