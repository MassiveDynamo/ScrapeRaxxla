Got a Video/pic example??
Iâ€™m currently at work but I can try to describe it. when you are in fss mode and you have the tuning slider at the bottom, above that but below the target star( black hole) there is what to me looks like a audio wave signal that looks similar to the ship signal thing on the bottom right of the hud just above where it shows if your mass locked.
