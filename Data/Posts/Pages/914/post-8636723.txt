Sympathies! But look on the bright side-you don’t need to hire a Halloween costume!!
I used to like the heat, but in my old age I find 22 to 25C nice and anything higher too uncomfortable.
The forecast for here was 32C, but my patio thermometer is currently saying 37C, in the shade
I shall be sleeping downstairs on the (leather) sofa again tonight! I know I got some sleep last night because I woke in the small hours with a cricked neck...but I’m pretty sleepy today.
