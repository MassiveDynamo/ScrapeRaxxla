I've found an odd planet. When using fss on the system, fss would find the planet but I could not focus on it or discover it until I got closer.

Turns out to be a landable terraformable metal rich world, which is mildly unusual in it's own right.

Flew around it a couple times and when in orbital cruise, the orbital lines of other objects jerked rapidly, which I dont remember seeing before, as per vid clip below.

Anybody seen anything like this? I might just be going space crazy. I have been in the black a long time now!

Yes, fairly sure I’ve seen that. Presumably a bit of instability in the math of the orbit markers together with your relative motion vector, possibly combined with a bit of graphics card overheating?
It’s damn hot Smithers!
