Interesting, never realised it was there! Any way of analysing that signal? Is it part of the BH audio? But if it were why is the BH the only object type that shows such a signal? Hawking radiation representation perhaps?
The whisper? Side though, has anyone run the fsd jump audio through a visualiser?
