Interesting, never realised it was there! Any way of analysing that signal? Is it part of the BH audio? But if it were why is the BH the only object type that shows such a signal? Hawking radiation representation perhaps?
I think just part of BH visalization. For any other star we see "true" image. For BH is none. So they just made something cool loking.
Also that circle on 1st bh was pulsing ...from center to border it was going thin blue circle. Not too often. Like once a minute or so.

Also presence of circle may be because of distance. 1st was 120ls, 2nd was 2000+ls.
