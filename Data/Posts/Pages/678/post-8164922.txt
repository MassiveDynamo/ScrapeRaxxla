Are you referring to this article, http://www.viewzone.com/browndwarf.html? If so, this piece predates the WISE results/conclusions by about 4-5 years. We can allow some artistic freedom for the ED universe to fit the narrative, I'm just saying the IRL data doesn't support the existence of Nemesis.
We know FD most likely can't change any of the orbital bodies "without destroying the galaxy", so if it's in the system since launch it wouldn't have been removed.

Ah yes, your quite correct, WISE seems to have disproved the Nemesis hypothesis. Iâ€™d got the dates swapped in what remains of my brain. But, as you say, it may (or may not) have gone into the game design.....
