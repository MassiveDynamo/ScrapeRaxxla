As I understand things Wise didn’t disprove it, just changed the probabilities. A group of Spanish astroners quite recently think they’ve found Nemesis, though I think there is still some argument over whether it is a brown dwarf or expanding supernova remnant- see my earlier post. FD aren’t going to continually change things in-game, at least not for things that may impact important storylines.
Are you referring to this article, http://www.viewzone.com/browndwarf.html? If so, this piece predates the WISE results/conclusions by about 4-5 years. We can allow some artistic freedom for the ED universe to fit the narrative, I'm just saying the IRL data doesn't support the existence of Nemesis.
We know FD most likely can't change any of the orbital bodies "without destroying the galaxy", so if it's in the system since launch it wouldn't have been removed.
