For me I could not see them using the FSS and they did not appear in the Nav panel at all so I couldn’t even try dropping into them sadly. I even tried detailed surface scans of the planets and rings but couldn’t find anything.

The system I was looking in was BD-12 1172.
Might be a new bug? I was out there in early October and don't recall having any problems finding them.

[Edit: They only show up in the nav panel. Got any filters applied that might be stopping you seeing them?]
