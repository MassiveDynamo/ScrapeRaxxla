Its in our history, first discovered by Voyager.. There is I'm guessing a station or something in orbit there.. Some type of a clue? alot of the Lore has roots back to movies and Saturn in movies usually was a type of star gate or jump point.. or station.. I'm going back there soon to continue the search around it..
