going back to my suspicion for raxxla as a planet, following that screenshot of the supposed translation 'mistake' in the russian version of the codex, where it states "the legendary planet raxxla". here is something i found that support's it too.
apparently, someone asked frontier for a "christmas hint" and received this message:
SPOILER
It may be a typo/not relevant, but ‘planet’ is italicized as PLANET (T is not italicized). Searching for ‘PLANE’ takes you to the LAVE system.
so, not only they did a "mistake" in the russian translation version by stating it's a planet, but also here? what are the odds? hmmmm

source of the image is from this text document, in page 14:

t is quite interesting that searching for “Plane” in the galmap takes you to Lave.

Also brings back memories of reading the Oolite saga, a set of fan-fiction books written by Drew . Great books, and definitely worth a read, but do bear in mind they are not considered official lore.
