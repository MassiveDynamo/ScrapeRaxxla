Might be a new bug? I was out there in early October and don't recall having any problems finding them.

[Edit: They only show up in the nav panel. Got any filters applied that might be stopping you seeing them?]
It is a really cool little system isn’t it? I wasn’t overly unhappy to head back out there to be honest, just a little disappointed the NSP never appeared.

I have never applied any filters ever, but I will double check next I’m on.

NSPs- yeah theyre bugged, not showing where they should be or for me showing 4 different types as scanned/discovered in Codex when visually they are all obviously the same type and sometimes in the same POI.
A shame, I was really hoping to see some of them as they were one of the coolest exploration features (in my opinion) added during my break from the game.

Hopefully they are fixed soon to be more reliable.
