Well....way back when, when all this was still roads....Lave 'lost' a moon and many thought the missing moon may be Raxxla (in some kind of weird orbit maybe or maybe cast out somehow)…..now Lave 2 is the missing moon and it has come back (not sure how its currently explained, think a mix of confusion and mythology leading to a missing moon that never was)….so it has been a possibility before...iirc it doesn't actually say who holds the permit when you get too close though

Almost certainly not Raxxla for other reasons but they could all be lies told by The Club through every source we have...
