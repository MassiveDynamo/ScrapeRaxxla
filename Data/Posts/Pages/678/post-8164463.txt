@guru - during kickstarter players could name some NPCs, I assume the ones we recognise are those or joke ones put in by Fdev. Ive seen a lot of British politicians from the 1950s - 1990s a)s well. Apparently Mrs Trellis from North Wales is out there too and shes from a Radio show in UK, if anybody knows where Raxxla is and has forgotten, its her

So raxxla is at Mornington Crescent then !
