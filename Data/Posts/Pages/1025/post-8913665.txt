Draw a line between them. See where that points

There's nothing on the line. Nothing.

But there is something weird about all the systems which relate to Egyptian mythology/gods. Let's take the Isis-system.

The planets are named Isis 1, Isis 2, Isis I, Isis II, Isis III, Isis IV, Isis V, Isis VI, Isis VII, Isis VIII, Isis IX, Isis X. That's right, arabic and roman numerals are mixed and what should be "Isis 3" is actually "Isis I".

But wait, there's more!
Isis VI and Isis VIII have identical mass and radius
Isis VII, Isis IX and Isis X have identical mass and radius
There is definitely something weird going on.
