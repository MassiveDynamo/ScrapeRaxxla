In SOL yesterday/today between SOL & Pluto, 1504Ls from SOL, no green glow detected.

Edit: yet

I spent around 30 days searching & only got about a dozen green glow instances in total, and only managed to capture video for 4. Talk about hen’s teeth!!

Edit: But I think you need to be at the right place on that 1504 ls radius circle from Sol to stand a chance of it instancing, and even then it seems RNG-controlled so it’s really frustrating. Make sure you’re in sector 16, about 21,255 ls from Pluto, within the thickness of the belt - you need to check in the orrery view where your ship’s dot is shown; the line of Jupiter’s orbit should be curved downwards a little with Pluto below that.
