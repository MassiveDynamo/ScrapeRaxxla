There's nothing on the line. Nothing.

But there is something weird about all the systems which relate to Egyptian mythology/gods. Let's take the Isis-system.

The planets are named Isis 1, Isis 2, Isis I, Isis II, Isis III, Isis IV, Isis V, Isis VI, Isis VII, Isis VIII, Isis IX, Isis X. That's right, arabic and roman numerals are mixed and what should be "Isis 3" is actually "Isis I".

But wait, there's more!
There is definitely something weird going on.

Are they arranged as co-ordinated sets - i.e. at 120 degree intervals? If so then that's a possible stable arrangement. Still spooky though

[Edit]: Isis IX appears (somewhat briefly) in the official novel "Docking is Difficult", which might go some way to explain it's Hand Authored oddness..
