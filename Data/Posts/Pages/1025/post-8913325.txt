well, I've been dropping hints for a month now & it's time to pass on my latest hypothesis re Raxxla. I think it's my last! It does answer many of the points made recently. Up to you whether you believe it or not.

An extremely intriguing read, I'm definitely on board with experimenting in the Sol system. About a year ago I spent some time there exploring the idea of The Hero's Journey into the Underworld and also experienced anomalies. If I'm remembering correctly, I was getting heat warning messages far beyond the sun (near Neptune and Pluto) and observed visual oddities as well. At the time I assumed these were bugs, but perhaps not? I'll be heading to Sol tomorrow, we'll see if anything comes up.
