well, I've been dropping hints for a month now & it's time to pass on my latest hypothesis re Raxxla. I think it's my last! It does answer many of the points made recently. Up to you whether you believe it or not.

I've always liked the idea that Raxxla may be in Sol. I've never really considered the asteroid belt, but I lke it.
In ED the asteroid belt is listed with a total mass of 0.0553 Moon masses. RL data lists about 4% of the mass of the Moon. That leaves room for an object about the mass of Ceres.
Ceres was of cource possible to land on in FE2/FFE. In ED it's not there. I don't know why. It's well above the minimum radius of 135 km, that seems to be the min limit in Stellar Forge.

The asteroid belt orbital inclination in ED is set to 4° (ring in Orrery). Real asteroids are distributed with up to 40° inclination. It might be an idea to go of the plane to check, as well.

I'm uncertain about the DB quote. It doesn't quite work out to have an 'Elite requirement' in Sol. There is no gate-mechanic in the game to use there. Having the object (Raxxla) not spawn for non Elites, would be to silly. Non silly Elite gates in the game are basically limited to Shin Des, missions and potentially the Dark Wheel.
