wings didn't exist in the game when it was released, raxxla did. Wings can't be a trigger.

I'm not even sure missions really existed at release - i forget how missions were back then but i know missions started off being extremely primitive - which is saying something given how simple they still are.

The wake scanning idea is the only idea i think that has teeth in hiding a system if you were going to hide a system.

Though, if fdev were keen on hiding systems that way, i would think they would have used that method in many other situtions so that the gameplay surrounding finding and exploiting those hidden systems can be utilized by players in general and expand the gameplay the game has available. Especially since that would be an interesting and effective game mechanic when the game has so few of those. I'd imagine they would implement dark systems / rogue planets etc that way and offer certain larger risk/reward scenarios not available elsewhere.

There would be too many opportunities to squander it on just one thing like raxxla.

So it's my professional opinion that raxxla is hiding via a means common to how fdev hides things in general. No special one off trigger or method.
