You can create the same thing by dropping out of supercruise but tbh it's damn near impossible to see your own. Have a cmdr drop out of SC on your wake and watch behind them. So I would assume this anomaly is some form of wake drop residual


Edit: the way I recreated this anomaly might have been in multicrew also as it has that 3rd person exterior view in the gunner role
