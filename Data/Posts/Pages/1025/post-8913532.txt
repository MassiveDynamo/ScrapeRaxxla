I proceeded with my investigation of the "missing star" in the "Two Ladies"-system. I asked myself, why is that system called Two Ladies? It's right in the middle of procedurally generated names and it's close to the starting region.

Well, a quick look in Google gives two possibilities: It's either the name for two Egyptian goddesses, or it's a very very weird musical piece from 1972. Which one is more probable?

Here's the Wikipedia-page for Two Ladies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Ladies

To make it short: The Two Ladies are the goddesses Wadjet and Nekhbet. Wadjet btw means "the green one", which is kind of interesting since we are talking about green glow... And they are represented by a cobra and by a vulture...
So, what about Wadjet and Nekhbet? Well there are two systems with those names, they are very close to each other (1.19 Ly).

So this begs the question: If the Two Ladies both have already their own system, why is there a system with the name "Two Ladies"?
Is it possible that it actually references the musical piece? Here's the Youtube-link:

And here's a part of the lyrics, which I find very interesting:

M.C.:
I go out daily to earn our daily bread.
But we've one thing in common
GIRL 1:
He,
M.C.:
She
GIRL 2:
And me,
GIRL 1:
The key,
GIRL 2:
The key,
M.C.:
The key.

And then further down:

M.C.:
We switch partners daily
To play as he please,
GIRL 1:
Twosie beats onsie,
M.C.:
But nothing beats threes.
I sleep in the middle,
GIRL 2:
I'm left,
GIRL 1:
And I'm right.
M.C.:
But there's room on the bottom
If you drop in some night!

That sounds like a hint, but it could also be just a crazy coincidence. But why name a system "Two Ladies" and at the same time name two systems after the two goddesses?
