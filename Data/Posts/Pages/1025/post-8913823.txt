Nope, here is a video though. I have another one that i'll upload that shows what it is. Tomorrow though , I'm going to keep you all in suspence until then. Seriously its nothing crazy , totally a bug in the game.

And just so im not posting fluff in here

I was thinking about how to get to an unlisted system, that wouldn't show up on galmap, and not be visible in the nav panel. It would have to be by wake scanning or transactions from a mission. There is also a new CG that encourages scanning for data.
