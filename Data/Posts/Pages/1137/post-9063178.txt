The Shakespeare & Wordsworth Connection:

Jewel that Burns on the Mother of all Galaxies - Romeo & Juliet (well its on the head anyway)

"O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
Her beauty hangs upon the cheek of night,
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear"

or











(OK so that bit is Wordsworth not Shakespeare)
* Whizzing rocket...emulate a star - Spiralling Stars?)

Lovers Woe - Romeo & Juliet
Parent's Grief - Hamlet / Othello / King Lear or Antony & Cleopatra when she says




Cleo likens the Asp about to bite and kill her to a baby suckling making her the grieving parent

Vagabonds - The ruffians sent after Macbeth's enemies and the witches, went on quite the trail
Whisperers in Witch Space - Witch Space is literally the space on the moors where the Witches meet, Whisperers are the witches casting their spells
Sirens of the Deepest Void - Midsummer Nights Dream




(OK so thats actually Wordsworth again not Shakespeare)

As you can see I know very little about Astronomy and this thread was getting heavy

Mmm
Sirens of the Deepest Void - might be The Tempest rather than Midsummer Nights Dream?
