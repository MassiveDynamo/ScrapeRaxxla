Looking at the Thargoid Pleiades Complex … from an archaeological perspective… since we don’t really understand what is going on there – per custom; it must be a Ritual Complex.

It appears to have aspects of a Sacred Grove - it is tied into the Harvesting of Meta-Alloys from Barnacle sites but more so, it has a series of interesting spatial relationships. The connections between the Structures and the Importance of Merope (specifically Merope 5c) and the “Cosmic Axis” between Merope in the Pleiades and what we suspect to be the Thargoid Homeworld in Col 70, seem to point to this as a major focus of both industry as well as potentially spiritual aspects to Thargoid society.

Studies have been conducted on the life-patterns of the “skimmers” at Thargoid sites however results are inconclusive and we are waiting on a definitive study to finish its way through the review process. A proposal to study Human/Thargoid interactions has been put forward – especially on how Aegis is relating to the Thargoids. Someone in Aegis decided to name their base of operations in the Pleiades “Delphi” - Is this indicative of a similar Axis between Sol and the Pleiades? Or that at least a perception of one exists within the Aegis organization? Perhaps a detailed sociological study of individuals within Aegis will provide some insights.

And looking forward – It appears we will soon be able to leave our Scarabs and do some proper hands on research at site. Hopefully we will be able to discover more aspects of these structures and their interactions. And maybe at some point Aegis will finally let us grid up some proper 1x1s for a test excavation.
