Sirens of the Deepest Void - might be The Tempest rather than Midsummer Nights Dream?

Confession time. I haven't read The Tempest and had no idea whether it was a metaphor or a description so couldnt pretend or use it.

Iâ€™m still plumping for a Guardian ark ship named Raxxla that visited Sol, & maybe is still in the vicinity.

Maybe the Artefact is the tip of the Spoiler and the whole thing is buried under space dust that now looks like a planet?

Do we have any if it was removed from Mars / original location or its still there? I dont recall anything.
