Youâ€™re making some pretty wild assumptions with no evidence to support them.
Not no evidence.. there are tourist beacons in Tau Ceti (established 2296) that establish hyperspace capable probes left Sol before the Generation Ships and the Mars Artifact discovery date was 2280. There is more than enough time there for what I said to have happened and those probes would have gotten past the current Bubble. Additionally we did calculations over at Canonn that put some of the earliest generation ships at a travel time of around 1,200 years for an 11.94 LY journey. That works out to 9% of lightspeed. Most of the evidence that leads anywhere is based on what the information implies (often from multiple sources to get comparison dates of events).
