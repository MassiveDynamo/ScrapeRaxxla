That said, I like your theoretical approach, but the cost and schedule part of your funding submission is a bit weak. Rework that and I think it would be a lot stronger. Maybe find a community partner or two to bring in on it as well? ;-)

Dont worry - in order to bring costs down we are bringing on a bunch of enthusiastic students from the Far God University. They are all very gung-ho and thankfully at the end of the Excavation - we offer them up to the Thargoids as a sacrifice. Its a win-win !
