Looking at the Thargoid Pleaides Complex … from an archaeological perspective… since we don’t really understand what is going on there – per custom; it must be a Ritual Complex.
I just created some more coffee objects in space, thanks.

For my sins, I work with archaeologists (sort of, indirectly, and have been on a few digs/surveys and actually got my hands dirty once or twice ) and here at least, the standard custom when they don't know what is going on is to call it "linear stone features", and make fun of other archaeologists (usually from certain other countries, not naming names) who would call it a Ritual Complex.

That said, I like your theoretical approach, but the cost and schedule part of your funding submission is a bit weak. Rework that, get some more post-processual stuff in there and I think it would be a lot stronger. Maybe find a community partner or two to bring in on it as well? ;-)
