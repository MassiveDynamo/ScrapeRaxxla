Not no evidence.. there are tourist beacons in Tau Ceti (established 2296) that establish hyperspace capable probes left Sol before the Generation Ships and the Mars Artifact discovery date was 2280. There is more than enough time there for what I said to have happened and those probes would have gotten past the current Bubble. Additionally we did calculations over at Canonn that put some of the earliest generation ships at a travel time of around 1,200 years for an 11.94 LY journey. That works out to 9% of lightspeed. Most of the evidence that leads anywhere is based on what the information implies (often from multiple sources to get comparison dates of events).
I think the assumptions Jorki is referring to - correct me Jorki if I am wrong ;-) are:
1. That they observed Raxxla via hyperspace probe
2. That it was a huge gateway
3. That it was full of alien ships
4. That the Mars artefact was identified as being from one of these same type of ships

All of which there is no evidence for. That doesn't mean it isn't possible, but without evidence they are just assumptions.
