In the beginning I thought the toast was a poetic description of a system(s), after flying all over the galaxy and hunting down dead ends I believe the toast is more simple than all the tin foil added. The toast may just be a description of the galaxy itself and the life of an explorer. The jewel is is Source 2 in Sag A, the whisper is the farthest star from the center, and explains the life of an explorer who never returns home from their voyages and the those they leave behind in their pursuits. Not a map or clue to find them.
My gut is that it describes the myths involved and the area of the sky to look (basically lays the groundwork for the search). The Raxxla Codex tells you how to take that groundwork and find it. Yes, still working on calculations (apparently 3D coordinate systems have appallingly complex formulas involved). I goofed the first attempt at number crunching but know what I did wrong. I will try to finish up today between doing technical support issues.
