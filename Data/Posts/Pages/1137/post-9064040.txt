Dont worry - in order to bring costs down we are bringing on a bunch of enthusiastic students from the Far God University. They are all very gung-ho and thankfully at the end of the Excavation - we offer them up to the Thargoids as a sacrifice. Its a win-win !
As long as they aren't being paid - perfect!
