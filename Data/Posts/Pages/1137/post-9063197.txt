Tell me, then, what terrified humanity so much they threw it in a vault on Mars, prayed its civilization was dead, and vowed never to speak of it again? Do you honestly believe that the Guardians would have provoked such a response from the Sol government? Personally, I'd be overjoyed if as a species the first advanced life detected was intelligent and like the Guardians.
Nope, it is totally your assumption that the Martian Artefact was buried in a vault based on human terror at finding it/what it revealed. There are other possible reasons, especially human greed (which fits original novella lore)
I’m still plumping for a Guardian ark ship named Raxxla that visited Sol, & maybe is still in the vicinity. And their AI is behind the Pilot’s Federation.
However Guardians were hunters & bred prey species for sport, so humanity might have been/be one of those!
