Well... In all your posts you say that Raxxla is the thargoid machine but you don't take into account that Raxxla exists since the game's launch. The whole thargoid thing was included in a later update, so this theory doesn't make any sense. The moderators have closed all the posts you have previously made because they were already bordering on madness and now you come to post the same trash here.
I did but like how many other ppl are wrapped up in their own theory they failed to see. That. I literally said raxxla is 3 things.
1.conciousness
2.device or key
3. Door gateway and or actual physical planet.

I said it was all three! And you need to understand the device is on the queens neck for a reason and the jewel that is on her brow. That is why I literally was having brain anerism to explain something so obvious. But right it's tin foil not science. I'm just going to act like I did no science or are you not appreciating other forms of science? Like archiology? Hmmm I sound pretty spot on.
