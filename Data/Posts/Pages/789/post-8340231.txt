will try!
Up to 56% Dangerous. Saw a Reddit post saying highest rank rate for combat was at an Anarchy in Outbreak-fly to checkpoint & massacre all the elite local police vipers. But seems a bit non-pc to me. Might try it, after your High Res suggestion. Think you have to let police soften them up then finish them off to get the kill. Got a nicely engineered Corvette, not all that fast but very robust!
Funny you should mention the Federal Corvette, here's some PVE builds I tested: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-785#post-8320359

I do enjoy the sound of those multi-cannons...
