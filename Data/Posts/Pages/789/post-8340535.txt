Funny you should mention the Federal Corvette, here's some PVE builds I tested: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-785#post-8320359

I do enjoy the sound of those multi-cannons...

Thanks Macros, will read with interest later over coffee, after self-isolated walk in park with copawlot!
Here’s my current build https://coriolis.io/outfit/federal_corvette?code=A0putpFklndzsxf57o7o0v0s0s12120404040404040404B05t3i1K1O1K1Km92d2b2b1F3x.Iw18ZVA=.CwBhGYQRi6fq5jOec9kzGGQ=.H4sIAAAAAAAAA42TMUhbcRDGLzEvJnlJXt4zL8ZWTWxeFQKV2k0QcZHWoRCw0LjFVTo4tODQgg5uDiLFySGDo4Ojg3Tq2MGxQ5GOHdpSRBxseud3D/OnGUJeho/vcb/c3f+4Ix4mon8WpHMAsc/jRLntLJHbhPPObKLgOkYkMV405AdIqvFXxPk+S1Q6TYC8QCKJc8lAbyFOcCtSnATptx2ispK1zVGQQ/zAkFtdMixXfO+D/IaIJHiuCzlbPxH/cikiFs+bv+5A0lkWyXx0iabUPVL3WN20OknyuuKoTN5ShWh24UZkLGwixU2TaQiS0Cas5kOi5EkOnYZNpP+Dsv2gDL820CSk3qD76YUvGSvMALJ5tQeyWmkkefNbpLz0S6S2/wOvy0aBcrxmIJ24pc9NvroSKTzD58QFcMlHgRxeNtCRzlnb9Z6+Q+OfUbjyNY/GC1Egl1/0QPYmyrkqwV4GcW9AfGRAvMjPe+PHSXSiW+iqCzsJ1IkfmSxFJkf5pSE3IPFyB8PUfbbnsTruJcTXOQTneghlXukuXWcXEtNMw21s3oweSrX1B7Ov8BOT81CrzyFnXmfrqgsWcDJS5Xov9Ak2Xx0HpM7TuwrUyVRkUqj/7w6OTpQhEgQAAA==.EweloBhBmSQNwJYAcCmAnEICME8ikKA=&bn=Deep Menace PVE vette buiild3
I like the 4A MC, they do the job nicely. I also tried two 4A LR PA plasma slug to circumvent the need for ammo replenishment, but they aren’t much use for the smaller ships which I need to massacre to get good kill rate in an attempt to get combat elite before I die of boredom (or virus), I miss them more often than not; just thought I’d better do this part of the “personal journey” !
But the thumbs are complaining!!
