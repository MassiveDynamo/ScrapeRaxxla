Founder - someone who donated an amount to the kickstarter and got access to the Founders World (SD) as a result. This is what is referred to in the system description as more secretive method, not known if there is a current backdoor to SD as the text implies, its written in current tense not past tense, but that could be an oversight. So yes, probably able to accept the mission although may be out of their league if aimed at Elite levels (think it lowers the enemy anyway even at Elite level missions, Ive had Dangerous and Deadly enemies from Elite missions)

Combat - Compromised Nav Beacons are usually 2nd best to AX scout massacres. Get a much better rate of small Dangerous and above level ships. Im useless with large ships v small ships with PA, switched to Cobra mk iii with 2 PA and different matter altogether, much easier to hit so probably some game levelling at play (convergence zone for weapons for a start, some loadouts cant converge at all let alone if the ship is a small)
