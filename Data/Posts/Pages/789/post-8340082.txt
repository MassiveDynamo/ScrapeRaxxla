I think it was EdzUp who mentioned that he played tag with criminals in a High Res and let the local security finish them off, thus saving on the wear and tear on fingers.
One fast ship with long range lasers should do the trick.

will try!
Up to 56% Dangerous. Saw a Reddit post saying highest rank rate for combat was at an Anarchy in Outbreak-fly to checkpoint & massacre all the elite local police vipers. But seems a bit non-pc to me. Might try it, after your High Res suggestion. Think you have to let police soften them up then finish them off to get the kill. Got a nicely engineered Corvette, not all that fast but very robust!
