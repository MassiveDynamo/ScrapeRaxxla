Save me some Lavian brandy! For medicinal needs!!
I’m a little asthmatic so already chesty after logburner flue leak a couple of weeks ago & now pollen season starting. I expect to be chesty until around September, if Covid doesn’t get me first. If so stand back when they light up the crematorium-my retirement plan was to self-preserve in alcohol, & I’ve been retired 3 years!

Edit: I could also rub it into my arthritic thumbs.
I’m BH deadly & elite eagles, cobras, couriers & asps in a nearby system & popping back to Jameson every so often to restock on ammo. My hands hurt, but currently up to 50% Dangerous. Only around 2400 offenders to go!
Sigh, thought I’d done all this 36 years ago!

Will save a Lavian brandy for you, CMDR. Stay safe

I think it was EdzUp who mentioned that he played tag with criminals in a High Res and let the local security finish them off, thus saving on the wear and tear on fingers.
One fast ship with long range lasers should do the trick.
