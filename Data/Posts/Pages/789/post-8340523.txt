Either all elites are founder and elite or probably an older or segregated lower value founder/elite to give easier elite level mission for founders. Notice it has only 1.3m reward. Or that is an idea at least.
Can someone who is only a FOUNDER and not ELITE check if he/she can accept the "Founder and Elite" missions, or if it is a logical AND condition?
Because that would mean that those missions are pretty elitist.

Edit:
Nevermind, it's OR. I need more coffee...
