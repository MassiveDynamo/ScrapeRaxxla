Maybe I'm not up to date, but I just found a "Founder or Elite" prequisite Mission in Jameson Memorial (SD). No special text to it from what I can tell, but is this known?

SPOILER: PICTURE

Edit: Apparently there are "Elite" type missions and "Founder and Elite" type missions. What's special about the latter? Do we know?
