I recommend using a High Capacity Corrosive Shell MC in one of the small slots. This will soften the hull and take it down faster. Also a long range laser to get their interest or just to tag them.

Yes, my two turreted class 1 burst are both LR, as is the class 3. I sometimes tag the long range targets and get them to attack me, when I welcome them with the close-in barrage.
I’ve spent the afternoon engineering two class 4 efficient overcharged beams; seems a bit slower on kill rate than the two class 4 MC with corrosive & incendiary, but only spent 15 minutes at the CNB where I’ve been hunting. While hanging out with Broo I got him to change one of the turrets to phasing since Scramble Spectrum doesn't stack. I did try an anarchy outbreak checkpoint on the way back. Hit one elite security viper & had 5 more open up on me- a bit too hot for my aged reflexes!
