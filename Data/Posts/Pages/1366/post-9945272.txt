Well the Rift was never officially linked to Raxxla or any other narrative, other than Drew’s, but that’s not to say (as according to Drew) FD didn’t appropriate it, but I find it unlikely.

It’s possible the location of the UIA do have a correlative point of origin/s; permit locked systems being a potential as these could be utilised for a Thargoids vs Guardian vs AI vs Human narrative or of the like.

But as we can’t explore these systems (yet) is there any point? And as soon as FD turn these permits on, Cmdrs will flood them in seconds, answering that question and the element of surprise being a moot point.
Pessimist ;-)

Edit: Or is it cynic? ;-)

Edit: The Rift was also mentioned in John Harper's And Here the Wheel, in passing...
