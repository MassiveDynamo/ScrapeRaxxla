So it's Friday, and I'm bored at work, and this (likely) isn't really Raxxla-related, but....

Using Canonn's nifty 3D map of the UIA positions here:

https://map.canonn.tech/route_uia.html

Is it just me or if you zoom out (waaaay out) it looks like all three might be coming from the direction of the Formidine Rift? And one of the three from the permit-locked sector(s) whose name(s) escape me waaaaay out on the other side of the Rift?

It is also interesting that when you zoom in, none of them seem to originate in any of the presumed-Thargoid home permit-locked sectors closer to the Bubble shown on the map in grey spheres (Cone Sector, etc.). This all of course assumes you can extrapolate to an origin from their current routes, which is a big assumption if they are doing weird living-in-hyperspace timey-wimey wibbly-wobbly things.

I don't think Drew is out there anymore, <sniff> (on the forums, not the Rift - well, both I guess) but he might find this amusing if correct. Bit of a backhanded tribute of sorts maybe?

Edit: Also thinking back to the Formidine Rift logs and the mysterious signals detected and noises heard, and something "immense" being out there....

Edit: Bovomit Sector was the name I could not remember. It's been a while. It is still locked also. Interestingly, it is not on the Canonn map of permit-locked regions here, I guess they are still recovering from being hexedited... https://map.canonn.tech/permit-data.html
