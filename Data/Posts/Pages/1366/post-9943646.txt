Nothing I can see here, two minor wreckages on the planet and two stellar phenomes close

Mic Turner being the user of the prototype Argents Quest that disappeared from Pleiades never to be seen again and this being close but in line from Sol to Andromeda and having his name....its all to coincidental, maybe not Raxxla but its very strange indeed, the player for this account was last online 12 days ago, cant find a CMDR by this name using Inara, iv added the player on the game though lol

This may have been a very hard name to get which leads me to believe this is either a Dev...a Backer, someone who likes the old lore before Elite: Dangerous or input manually.

Someone claimed the name on the forums back in 2009
