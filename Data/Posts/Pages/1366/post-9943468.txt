Cant remember the Megaship location or name i dug this out of screenshots I had from 2016, im currently rooting them out, im sure it was the one that travels to HIP 112970

A Hercules-class Hauler with call-sign HIP 112970 can be found for reference at the following waypoints: HIP 112970, Khun, Shona, ROSS 667, Shona, Jarildekald.
