Yes, such references are all known, but they all may well have an arbitrary reference in game such as Tannhäuser Gate, etc on their own they may well be meaningless especially if they are singular alone references, nothing more than Easter eggs.

However the Yggdrasil tree is a big series of systems, and the runes systems are in close proximity to them. They too correlate to the 2296 sphere of influence set by Tau Ceti and the pandemonium system, it’s a bit too much for another arbitrary Easter egg. Especially if you tie it to Donars Oak.

But then again I find it doubtful any Lovecraft references would be utilised, as that crosses IP.

I am doubtful, as this is projection, and to date I’ve only found 1 Lovecraft system, which might not even be relevant, as Founders could name systems too.

So I’m to begin my ramblings into the arcane…just to rule them out.
