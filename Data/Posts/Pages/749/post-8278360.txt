"Friend" was the title of my first contact person of Aegis Core. After making progress, the people and their titles changed as usual. Currently Aegis Core has mostly asassination missions for me. Sounds dubious.
Although I also noticed the "become one with us" part. But I'm already allied, so I'm not sure whether I should progress killing pirates or not.
I'd take all missions from Aegis Core and see if it leads anywhere.
