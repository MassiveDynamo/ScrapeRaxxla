If I am correct those systems have been untouched, you have to go to FSS to locate said planets to reveal them on system maps. How far out from SOL are you?


I was easily over 20k ly away in the "southern" outter arm just putzing around. But i've since brought that character back into the bubble.

it's weird though because plenty of systems out there would show all the planets in a system (even if nobody had discovered them) after a honk. but there would be no real details. You'd have to approach them to get details.

Not a concern anymore though.. I'm done with venturing out into the black for no good reason. Maybe when carriers/player bases become a thing...so i can mine pristine systems out in the black and come back home with a haul to absolutely tank the entire human economy .....or if they expand crafting, could give me a good reason as well - assuming the crafting required raw materials that i could base everything else off of.
