I was easily over 20k ly away in the "southern" outter arm just putzing around. But i've since brought that character back into the bubble.

it's weird though because plenty of systems out there would show all the planets in a system (even if nobody had discovered them) after a honk. but there would be no real details. You'd have to approach them to get details.

Not a concern anymore though.. I'm done with venturing out into the black for no good reason. Maybe when carriers/player bases become a thing...so i can mine pristine systems out in the black and come back home with a haul to absolutely tank the entire human economy .....or if they expand crafting, could give me a good reason as well - assuming the crafting required raw materials that i could base everything else off of.

I figured it shows up in bubble, especially "locked" once, when i did Earth and Vega FSS showed them fully scanned however I was 1st time there. In void it shows things if somebody else already sold that system to UC, however you will see on map "unexplored" until FSS. "Star" only means nobody sold this system to UC yet, most likely you're first visitor.
