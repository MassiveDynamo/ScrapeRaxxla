Still out in the black trying to match star patterns to Horizons start screen with the Orbis.
I have fss scanned Sifi KX-S d4-10. There is a gas giant showing in the spectrum response and 9 bodies reported but only 8 are detectable. There is a distant orbit line, but no gas giant appearing on it. I have logged to desktop and back but the planet has not appeared . Bug reported!
Sifi KX-S d4-10 not in edsm. Spinning up StarGazer to have a look.

Spent time in SOL, did not see the 'Friend' remark. Aegis Core seems to to be a dubious lot; "I think there may have been a little accident. Ahem. There's a certain satisfaction in completing work for the cooperative. Here is your opportunity to do just that". There's another version that sounds more interesting: "I think there may have been.. Work binds us, so take on any of the indicated tasks to become one with us"

Allied with all factions in SOL.
