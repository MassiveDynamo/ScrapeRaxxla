I've scanned a number of systems where the discovery scanner honks and says that x number of orbital planes have been discovered but when you goto the system map, nothing but the single star shows ...no roid belts or anything.

If only the primary star shows in the system map after you’ve honked then it’s a system that nobody else has discovered and any objects are beyond the ship scanner range (object size-dependent but around 60ls). You then have to move round the system orbits using the fss and zoom in on each signal to scan the planet/roid cluster/uss.
