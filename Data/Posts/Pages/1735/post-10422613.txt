I wanna say no belt to scan, I had that issue where the body in dss was shown by the star but when zooming in the screen sped away (from left panel body showed directly in front when I checked after) so I went to it to get it to scan. didn't see a moon and was checking map that loaded very slowly. I literally just posted this before getting out of map and having game crash on Cannon Discord.

On reboot gap still there.

Anyone in area is welcome to come see if their imagery shows something different.

trianguli sector dh-u a3-2
body 3, (gap) then
body 4,5,6 are entangled orbit with barycenter. (which I was thinking was the "blank space"
