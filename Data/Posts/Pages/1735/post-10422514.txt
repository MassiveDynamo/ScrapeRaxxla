There are a lot of Norse themed systems within the bubble. These I speculated fall upon the Axi Mundi.
today I was watching u-tube and an artist that does void art (also likes norse; image became hel in the ome I was watching btw) was talking about how he looked for images in ink blotches, instead of looking to the white space or the black space he looked at the spot in between....
So after a google search, google gave me this --

"Ginnungagap [Norse Myth.]The Great Void, the dark space between *Niflheim, the land of the dead, and Muspelheim, the region of intense heat. It had no beginning or end and no night and day."

I have found Muspelheim in game but Niflheim (as spelled) is not.
