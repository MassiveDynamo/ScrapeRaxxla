I was surprised to find there are no clear images of these things around. I had to scrape from random YT videos. @Ian Doncaster if you've still got them can you pretty please do us a quick favour

They appear to be just like the SAP-8 containers. One thing that immediately stood out to me was that they 'activate' in close proximity at about 13 metres range.
I can't recall if the other containers do this?

The name of the item has also sparked an idea - a very 'lost worlds' one...........brb

I did post pix years ago in this thread, but they may have disappeared as I cleared out some pix from my online storage. Search this thread.

@Rochester they look exactly like any other cargo container. But both TOHF and SAP-8 containers carry the same label “NEX0275401977” VESPINE TRANSPORT SYSTEMS". I think I checked normal cargo containers & they didn't have that label, but that needs checking!!! It's been a very long while and my memory is not good.

There was a report circulating that TOHF made peculiar sounds when dropped in space, however I tested that and observed nothing.
