Well, no sign of the Dark Wheel station yet with 8/26 candidate red giants checked ... but I did find an entirely unexplored system complete with ELW barely over 1000 LY from Sol while on the way to candidate 8 - and of course plenty of other uncharted or partially-charted systems at a similar distance - which is an interesting measure of the number of gaps in the collective surveys even this close and ten years in.

EDIT: and on the way to candidate 9, a couple of only-partially-surveyed systems with bodies unscanned barely over 600 LY from Sol.
