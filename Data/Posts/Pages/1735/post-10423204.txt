Now that’s interesting. So all we have is our memories, if their appearance was different, do we know this for certain?

I was hoping there was something we had all missed. I thought the original visuals might have held something linked to the logo, but by this omission. Does this only further reduce their current relevance?

Logically by having no current visual aspect we can ignore them in relation to the current codex. Logically if there were a historical link it by it’s hypothetical removal (if it ever existed) advocates that any such link was likely coincidence!?

Shame.
