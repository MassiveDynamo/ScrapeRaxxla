Remind us: what do the cargo canisters for Trinkets actually look like in game?

Pictures please if possible (top / bottom / side). As much as historical reference for this page than anything else.

Memory is clouded as have not physically been in game for some time. Currently having a lovely return holiday in Novigrad with some guy called Jaskier, can’t find my ship, instead I’ve got this daft talking horse!
I was surprised to find there are no clear images of these things around. I had to scrape from random YT videos. @Ian Doncaster if you've still got them can you pretty please do us a quick favour


They appear to be just like the SAP-8 containers. One thing that immediately stood out to me was that they 'activate' in close proximity at about 13 metres range.
I can't recall if the other containers do this?

The name of the item has also sparked an idea - a very 'lost worlds' one...........brb
