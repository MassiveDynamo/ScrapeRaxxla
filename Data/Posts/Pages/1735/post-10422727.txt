Remind us: what do the cargo canisters for Trinkets actually look like in game?

Pictures please if possible (top / bottom / side). As much as historical reference for this page than anything else.

Memory is clouded as have not physically been in game for some time. Currently having a lovely return holiday in Novigrad with some guy called Jaskier, can’t find my ship, instead I’ve got this daft talking horse!
