Well, no sign of the Dark Wheel station yet with 8/26 candidate red giants checked ... but I did find an entirely unexplored system complete with ELW barely over 1000 LY from Sol while on the way to candidate 8 - and of course plenty of other uncharted or partially-charted systems at a similar distance - which is an interesting measure of the number of gaps in the collective surveys even this close and ten years in.

Nice - ya we do tend to stick to certain paths. I imagine there are quite a few still undiscovered above and below the main routes.
Curious what your method is- im always assuming a scan wont show it so I try to find ways to identify a “dark” station by visual… which is frustrating to say the least.
