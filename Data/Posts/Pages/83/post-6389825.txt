Amazing - thank you for clearing that up.

For a second I was wondering if space legs has been delayed/removed from the plan due to the immense amount of effort it would take to design all of these various creatures!

So is the entire book retconned? i.e. Liz Ryder isn't descended from Jason/Alex Ryder?

SPOILER


The Ryder family is real. There are more of them in other official books. Liz's relation to Ben/Jason/ Alex is unknown.

The Dark Wheel book is best viewed as as a legend within the ED universe. A sort of 'Based on real characters and events' story, with lots of artistic freedom.
