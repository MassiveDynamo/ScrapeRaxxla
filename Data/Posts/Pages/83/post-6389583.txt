Howdy all - I'm currently reading The Dark Wheel, released along side the original Elite game and I am confused. There is repeated mention of other life forms i.e. Geretean Reptiles, grotesque amphibioid inhabitants of Bierle etc. So, are these sentient life? Apologies if this should be another thread, it feels related though... :S!

SPOILER

Are these beings the ones that it mentions when you scan an earth like and it says - contains primitive life etc?

Could Raxxla be an earth like/ammonia world.. with some sort of tech in orbit of it?
