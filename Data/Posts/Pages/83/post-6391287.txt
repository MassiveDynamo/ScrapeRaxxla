The Ryder family is real. There are more of them in other official books. Liz's relation to Ben/Jason/ Alex is unknown.

The Dark Wheel book is best viewed as as a legend within the ED universe. A sort of 'Based on real characters and events' story, with lots of artistic freedom.

TDW is the canon which is not canon. This is exactly how I view it; a legend based on real events in which it has become impossible to differentiate fact from fiction.
