I don't think I've specifically come across him saying anything about a book - however, he's said a lot, I'd be really interested if you can dig that one up Scytale!

Got it. OMG ...from one of my own posts ... soon my memory will challenge Jorki's ...

Seems to my teribble anglich that he refers to Legacy as being a 'spiritual successor' and the sequel to The Dark Wheel involving Raxxla the one that will be played out in the game.
If so, could we say the Raxxla of ED must be tight bound to the Raxxla of TDW ?
In other words: Q:What is Raxxla ? A: Read TDW !

You cannot find this place the Dark Wheel missions are gone form the game.

Some interesting clues in the beta may suggest they will be back soon. https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?p=6386738&viewfull=1#post6386738
