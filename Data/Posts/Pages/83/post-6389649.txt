Howdy all - I'm currently reading The Dark Wheel, released along side the original Elite game and I am confused. There is repeated mention of other life forms i.e. Geretean Reptiles, grotesque amphibioid inhabitants of Bierle etc. So, are these sentient life? Apologies if this should be another thread, it feels related though... :S!

It's important to remember that The Dark Wheel book is not in any way, shape or form considered Lore in ED. Back then Elite was more like Star Trek, with lots of aliens and humans was just one type of sentient life. That was retconned in every subsequent game to just humans, sentient machines (androids) and Thargoids (and various rumours of extinct others). and then in ED it's retconned again to just Humans and Thargoids and various rumours of extinct others.

Are these beings the ones that it mentions when you scan an earth like and it says - contains primitive life etc?

Basically, yes. There was a reference that MB made to the life-forms mentioned in Elite '84 but right now I can't find the specific quote. I think it was an interview with DJTruthsayer, or maybe one of the fiction diaries... anyway, he said that they've retconned it so that the main types of alien life from Elite '84's planets are considered to be the "dominant life on a planet" in ED - but NOT sentient. So the "grotesque amphiboids" are a non-sentient dominant life-forms found on that planet. They've tried to make sense of the crazy stuff in previous games

The only (known) sentient life in ED currently are the Thargoids and the now extinct Guardians and Acherons. There's likely to be others in the future (permit locked areas are permit locked for a reason!).

Could Raxxla be an earth like/ammonia world.. with some sort of tech in orbit of it?

Yes, that's entirely possible.
