I don't remember that specifically - I know in the fiction diaries (and maybe elsewhere) he says that the stories from the books will continue/influence the game. About 8mins into this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrv3yC3wrg8&index=4&list=PL7glm5rbPHKway8jUwKEw6MeWjC4voHD4 I don't think I've specifically come across him saying anything about a book - however, he's said a lot, I'd be really interested if you can dig that one up Scytale!

While looking for that, I found this for you MakahiGames, here's the bit where MB talks about the old alien races from Elite '84: about 9:40 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6z5OK8J5pg&list=PL7glm5rbPHKway8jUwKEw6MeWjC4voHD4
