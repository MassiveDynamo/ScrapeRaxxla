Amazing - thank you for clearing that up.

For a second I was wondering if space legs has been delayed/removed from the plan due to the immense amount of effort it would take to design all of these various creatures!

So is the entire book retconned? i.e. Liz Ryder isn't descended from Jason/Alex Ryder?
