TDW is such an influential piece that many/most Elite fiction has been influenced by it, as have several aspects of Elite Dangerous Lore - for example "Faraway" jump system mentioned in TDW have never been in any game, but they appear in the history of hyperdrive in Elite Dangerous. Also the name "Oresrians" appeared in TDW and has now made it's way into Elite lore. There's a direct link with the Ryder family in the novel And Here The Wheel (set in the 3290's), and of course the idea of Raxxla is entirely a fabrication of Holdstock (it's never been in any game, or even mentioned by name). We only know it's in Elite Dangerous because it's been confirmed by the Devs.

So while the actual book isn't Lore - it's influenced many aspects of Lore, which is why many people still consider it a good source for clues in much the same way previous games have provided insights into things like INRA and the Thargoids before they ever made an appearance in Elite Dangerous. Just, don't put any faith in the exact things it says, many people treat TDW and the previous Elite games as "Legends or stories", the kind of thing you might be told in a seedy space bar, might contain some grains or truth but not reliable enough to really do anything with.
