This game is infuriating at times. Yesterday I traveled 30 mins to the new horizons probe in Sol and was carrying an AI relic, anyway I dropped it near the probe for no other reason than "reasons" and instantly a search and rescue ship dropped in, fired a limpet out, nicked it and started to jump out. I obviously shot at it and was carrying hatch breakers so fired some out which instantly spawned a couple of system security.

I obviously lost the relic, it's such a stupid "breaking" mechanic having ships appear out of no where, 3million LS away from the star.
So the AI was saved by Search and Rescue.... like they save commanders in escape pods. Wonder if it sent a signal? Have you been mistreating your AI Relics? Forcing them mine for your fleet carrier?
