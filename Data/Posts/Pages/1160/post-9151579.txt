Honestly don’t know, not in game to test, if it’s a narrative based puzzle, we won’t find anything until FD wants us to, however if these locations are part of some larger map, and the distancing and angles of alignment are accurately equal, then they can be compared against each other.

If equal then any additional points to the map (if a map at all) can be calculated, depending upon if it’s some esoteric shape, but in theory any location can be triangulated... wishful thinking.

But if narrative driven it’s all probably popicock, because it’s all likely meaningless and whatever is at the end of it, isn’t there until FD inject it...

Which is probably why we tin foil, as the fantastical alternatives are far more alluring then such a reality.
