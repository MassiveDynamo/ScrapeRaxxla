So the AI was saved by Search and Rescue.... like they save commanders in escape pods. Wonder if it sent a signal? Have you been mistreating your AI Relics? Forcing them mine for your fleet carrier?
It wishes, it's been made to do far worse! The nights are long and lonely when all you can see is stars...

I went and got some more
