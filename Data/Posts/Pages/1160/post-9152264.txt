If you google XXL as a roman numeral it does say it indicates 30 (itâ€™s a new interpretation to me, always thought that was XXX!)

XXX would be more normal yes but in Roman Numerals its counted down in value from the left with any 'wrong' placed numerals discounted from the total like IV = 4 (-1 + 5) so technically its -20 + 50 = 30. Maybe triple XXX is something Frontier dont want in their games, even EDO is only 16+
