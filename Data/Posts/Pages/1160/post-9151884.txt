Incidentally, something from my Hesperus Adamastor comparison above triggered a thought! (Happens occasionally!)

A painting by Sir John Gilbert RA

RAXXLA
If you google XXL as a roman numeral it does say it indicates 30 (it’s a new interpretation to me, always thought that was XXX!)
RA=Royal Academy?
Painting #30 in the Royal Academy is www.royalacademy.org.uk/art-artists/work-of-art/no-30
by Sir Christopher Le Brun

Can anyone make sense out of of this?
It’s about as meaningful to me as the Raxxla logo!!!
