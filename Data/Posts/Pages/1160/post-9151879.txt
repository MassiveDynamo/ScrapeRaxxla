There is probably a little bit of Raxxla hidden somewhere in all the mythology references.

I do however think that there is a general connection between ancient history in the ED galaxy and the basic Greek creation myth.
https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/The_Creation/the_creation.html (read this if you want the rest of the post to make any sense )

I suspect that the creation myth is the story told by the exiled Guardians (those with AI implants) or just the AI, to early humans. These humans have interpreted and retold the story with their limited understanding, leaving us with the myths we have today.

I interpret the roles as follows:


- Gaia and Uranus had children: Cyclopes (Thargoids), Hecatoncheires (other Thargoids?) and Titans (Guardians). Mean Uranus had them all confined to Gaia. They could not do space travel.

- Gaia helps the Titans concur space. They defeat Uranus and som other creatures emerge (Brain trees and other vacuum creatures?).

- Titan leader Cronus (Guardian), imprisons Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires (Thargoids) in Tartarus (somewhere in space).

- Cronus and Rhea gives birth to the next generation, the gods / Olympians (AI implanted Guardians). These are eaten by Cronus. This could be a symbol of how the AI were forced to exist as implants to Guardians or locked in the monolith network or the exile of the implanted Guardians.

- Rhea manages to hide Zeus by giving Cronus the Omphalos stone(Raxxla link?), in his place.

- Zeus poisons Cronus and makes him vomit up the rest of the Olympians. This is probably the exodus of the implanted Guardian / AI hybrids.

- There is a civil war. The Titans (Guardians) are winning. Zeus goes to Tartarus (using Raxxla?) and releases the Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires (Thargoids). Zeus receives the thunder bolt(powerful weapon), Poseidon the trident(terraforming tech) and Hades the helmet of invincibility (cloaking) as thank you from the Cyclopes (goids).

- The Titans are trapped and bombed by the boulders of the hundred handed Hecatoncheires. Zeus wins and sends the Titans to Tartarus.

- Gaia is miffed and sends her las child, the Typhoon (Kalxian?) to attack him. Zeus wins and buries Typoon. Typhoon will at some point return.

FD uses the symbolism from the old myths, to give obscure hints about the past of the Galaxy. Raxxla probably is part of this, but everything isn't about Raxxla.

What an interpretation like this can give us, is a sense of geography. The Guardians are in game refered to as 'The Dead'. Their home sector(Regor) can then possibly be interpreted as Hades. Olympos should then be in the opposite direction and Tartarus should be as far below Hades as Earth is below Olympos.

I like the hypothesis of greek creation myth being based on a distortion of the Guardians/AI story. Still think Raxxla is likely to be in Sol and one of the three Guardian ark ships.

The Guardian monolith network as Tartarus?

Had to smile at “ It is unclear as to what happened to Uranus afterward; he either died, withdrew from the earth, or exiled himself to Italy” https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/The_Creation/the_creation.html
I had many business trips to Genoa!

Doesnt actually address the naming puzzle behind Adamastor & Hesperus.

Dont think Typhon could be the Klaxians since they are supposedly just another clan/species of Thargoid; more likely something even worse locked away in one of the areas out at Bovomit or towards Beagle Point. Might be worth comparing your hypothesis against the permit locked locations?
