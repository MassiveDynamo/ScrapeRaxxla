I like the hypothesis of greek creation myth being based on a distortion of the Guardians/AI story. Still think Raxxla is likely to be in Sol and one of the three Guardian ark ships.

The Guardian monolith network as Tartarus?

Had to smile at “ It is unclear as to what happened to Uranus afterward; he either died, withdrew from the earth, or exiled himself to Italy” https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/The_Creation/the_creation.html
I had many business trips to Genoa!

Doesnt actually address the naming puzzle behind Adamastor & Hesperus.

Dont think Typhon could be the Klaxians since they are supposedly just another clan/species of Thargoid; more likely something even worse locked away in one of the areas out at Bovomit or towards Beagle Point. Might be worth comparing your hypothesis against the permit locked locations?

I was definitely considering Bovomit as a possible Tartarus. There could be a few places that needs to be identified, to find the axis of the Raxxla logo. I'm not sure if that one is flat or 3D. Not sure if Sol is a the centre either.
I'll probably try to make a 3D plot and see if anything converges.

The Neptune Axis is interesting. It has a north pole of RA 19h 57m 20s DEC 42.950°. That should give a south pole of RA 7h 57m 20s DEC -42.950°. That line hits the Regor sector. It's also close to RA 20 (North).
