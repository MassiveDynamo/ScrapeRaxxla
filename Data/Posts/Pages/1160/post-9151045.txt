and say that FD scrubbed the Dark Wheel mission and Raxxla, and rewrote their narrative circa 2017 incorporating them into the wider narrative, either because they were broken, or FD noticed how much interest it stirred up

The other alternative is that they postponed it or lengthened the story because they didnt think it was good enough.

I still dont get why they withdrew the DW missions though, they didnt go anywhere and didnt need to, they just provided more tinfoil and obfuscation and how could that be 'wrong' as such?

Am I the only one that noticed the similarity, or am I seeing things that aren't there?

Its been noticed but whether its deliberate misdirection, obfuscation or a hint towards something is unknown.
