New Mattius video is a pretty solid essay summarizing almost everything we know on Raxxla and the search along with some opinions a fair few of us may share or be interested in. It might be a good addition to the first page for faster catching up?



Really the whole series is essential viewing imo but you all can decide for yourselves

Agreed, this is where my current assumptions have led me, narrative driven, not actually accessible... if correct, it’s disappointing. I would go further (as I’ve hypothesised previously) and say that FD scrubbed the Dark Wheel mission and Raxxla, and rewrote their narrative circa 2017 incorporating them into the wider narrative, either because they were broken, or FD noticed how much interest it stirred up. Again this is just reading between the lines, we have no actual solid evidence, analysis of competing hypotheses has led me to this current assumption, I hope it’s currently accessible, but it would fit with FD modus operandi to do it this way sad to say, I hope to be wrong.
