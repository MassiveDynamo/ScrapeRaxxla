After some much further checking (Take a look at "Mutabilis" by Drew Wager in Google Books), it seems that if FD is going off of the original lore, Raxxla is a Rouge Planet that travels though witch space, stopping at predetermined points along the way (one of which is Lave). The entire cycle completes every "few decades." Raxxla was the hub that kept witchspace operational (The aliens that created Raxxla also created witchspace), but using it as a transit system damaged it over time, which seems to have led to the creation of the Frame-Shift Drive.

Keep this in mind, and may you find many new discoveries on your journey to Beagle Point, CMDR.
