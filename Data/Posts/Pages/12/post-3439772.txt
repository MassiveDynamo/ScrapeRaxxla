Yay for impossible quests!

Anyway its more than likely that Frontier hasn't made it that impossible. Raxxla is only supposed to change places every few years, so it doesn't move too often. Also the whole looking for anomalies thing would make the search completely impossible unless the planet was inside inhabited space, so we can probably rule that out as well. Realistically, just looking for planets that don't orbit a host star should be sufficient to find it. Method below:

SPOILER

I'll do some searching around where Lave's moon used to be, and see if I can find anything; Will report back here.
