So. What about Elite: Dangerous?
There are two bits of information. One is public, the other I am revealing for the first time.

1. Michael Brookes said “There will be no clues.” – Inferring it does indeed exist.
2. I spoke to David Braben directly in 2014 and he confirmed to me that “It’s out there and we (FD) know where it is.” – So it does exist.
Start searching folks. Perhaps someone will be worthy of membership of the Dark Wheel after all this time. The legends are true.
