Looking for rogue planets in nebulae along the route to Beagle Point

Started the journey today towards Beagle Point with the Distant Worlds expedition. The quest is secret, and my fellow explorers does not know I'm using this journey as cover for this secret mission. Many members of covert groups are also on this trip, and it's imperative that they have no hint as to my motive for joining this expedition, as I'm sure they are using the journey for the exact same purpose. Think I'll keep a close eye on their whereabouts at all times, especially those with weapons. During the trip, I'll investigate all nebula within easy reach for signs of any rogue planets that might be Raxxla. The method for finding any rogue planet is secret, and will not even be disclosed in this journal.
