That's where I found it! Out in this mysterious HIP.

Hmmmmm.......

Check ships for additional markings. To me that number is a a hint they used wormholes.
This observation could be crucial!

In particle physics, the ADD model, also known as the model with large extra dimensions (LED), is a model framework that attempts to solve the hierarchy problem by explaining the weakness of gravity relative to the other forces. This hypothesis requires that the fields of the Standard Model be confined to a four-dimensional membrane, while gravity propagates in several additional spatial dimensions that are large compared to the Planck scale.
