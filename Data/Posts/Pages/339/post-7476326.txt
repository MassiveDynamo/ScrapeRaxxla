If peeps think XX could be 20, then why not XL = 40? I bet Raxxla is code for the first moon of the 40th planet in system 'Rax'

Flying an Eagle, I hauled 1 each of the following rare goods to The Oracle at Delphi:
- waters of shintara (shinrarta dezhra)
- lavian brandy (lave)
- hr 7221 wheat
- terra mater blood bores
- Soontill Relics (Ngurii)
- altairan skin (altair)
- crom silver fesh
- Banki Amphibious Leather (500k ls)
- jotun mookah
- Belalans Ray Leather
- rapa bao snake skins
- Ceremonial Heike Tea
- Vanayequi Ceratomorpha Fur
- hutton mug
- centauri mega gin (hutton orbital)
- vega slimweed
- Aganippe Rush
- V Herculis Body Rub (V1090 Herculis, 500k ls)
- Live Hecate Sea Worms
- Personal Gifts (Njambalba)
- Ngadandari Fire Opals (500k ls)

I also delivered 1 normal grain, wine & beer.
I collected all the rare goods with a DBX and then switched to an Eagle in a system near Delphi to fly the final leg and turn the goods in.
Nothing happened after each delivery, except that I'm now cordial with whatever faction runs the Oracle.

In the Dark Wheel story, Alex Ryder attracts the attention of the dark wheel by selling a certain kind of silk rare goods.

Additionally, I know there's been some interested in WR 104, the Spiraling stars.
I looked at the translation for "Princess Astrophil and the Spiraling Stars" in German & Spanish.

German: prinzessin astrophel und die spiralsterne
Spanish: La princesa Astrophil y las estrellas en espiral

In Spanish her name changes to 'Astrophil' with an i instead of an e.
Also, while the english 'spiraling' implies movement, the other two seem to just describe stars in a certain pattern/shape.
A native speaker of either language could clarify.
