Question: is everyone here allied with the Dark Wheel faction? Also, anyone regularly run tourist missions for them? You never know, maybe one of their VIP "tourists" will take us somewhere interesting! I might try this myself.

I was doing missions for them in LFG 926, the same faction, to get them into expansion and making them powerful with hopes that it will trigger something then I got bored.
