I was just thinking to myself and looking into the whole idea with tinfoil hat and amusing myself on with what Old Duck brought up.

What if " Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars " isn't the actual book " Astrophel and Stella ( that we know of) since it's a Male falling in love with a Female.

Since the codex insist that Astrophel is Female, they do have the resemblance of using stars. But lets look away from that book that Philip Sidney wrote and go into Elite Lore and replace the male perspective to a female perspective instead.

In essence the whole story changes but remarkably it is the female perspective that loves the stars themselves and in no use of metaphors.

Which the real title the codex is presenting us with someone with royal blood the actual title would then be called "Lady Kahina Tijani Loren (Salome) and the Spiralling Stars"
