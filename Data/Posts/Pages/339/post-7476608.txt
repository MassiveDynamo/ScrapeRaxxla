Is it at all odd that the empire was founded in 2296 following Duval and her followers move and also that the first mention of Raxxla was recorded that same year?
It's 2320 for the founding of the Empire.

Mid 2200s (century) - arrival in Achenar
2292 - colonisation of 6D (Capitol)
2320 - Founding of the Empire (conversion of Republic to Empire)

Which is actually probably more interesting date-wise!
