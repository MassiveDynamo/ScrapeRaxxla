any chance you can share the system name so others can help in looking?

It's a bit close to my own secret base, so I don't want to give it up unless it really is something. Initial surveys didn't reveal anything Raxxla or TDW related. I'll go back once I get in tight with the self-proclaimed Dark Wheel faction and give it a bit more of a detailed look. It's probably nothing...
