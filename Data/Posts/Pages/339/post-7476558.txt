Children of Raxxla is a player based squardon and FD created minor faction after them ( I'm not 100% since I never played this game since Beta or at launch) that has nothing to do with Raxxla itself. It was a group that was lead by Salome in Premonition (as well as Reclamation I think).

This mission had something to do with the travels of Salome before she died.
