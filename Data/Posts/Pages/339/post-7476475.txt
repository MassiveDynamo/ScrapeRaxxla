Question: is everyone here allied with the Dark Wheel faction? Also, anyone regularly run tourist missions for them? You never know, maybe one of their VIP "tourists" will take us somewhere interesting! I might try this myself.

I know I'm late to the party, but I still found this very exciting!

SPOILER

I couldn't accept the mission because I need more rep with the Dark Wheel, but I did bookmark the system (over 7KLY away) just in case this isn't offered to me again. Right now CMDR Jenny (who was my alt until recently) is my primary Raaxla searcher, but I may send CMDR Duck on these "excursions" way outside the Bubble while Jenny sticks to her original search area. Right now the goal is to get them both allied with the Dark Wheel, just in case this is a "key" to "unlocking" whatever awaits.

ps - if you've been to this site, please spoiler tag any details you may wish to share about it. Thanks!
