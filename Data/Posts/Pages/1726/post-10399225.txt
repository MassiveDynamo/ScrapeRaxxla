Did anyone else ever think that "Klaxian" is a vague-homophone for "Raxxlan"? To me it sounds a bit like what happens with linguistic drift and partial-mistranslations from different languages where you end up with words that sounds similar and mean the same thing, but aren't really that similar when you look closely (happens a lot in English because we've stolen borrowed so much of our culture many words from elsewhere over the centuries).

I wonder if Klaxian is just a "modern day" verbal translation of the sounds Thargoids make when talking about this ancient enemy, and in the past maybe the translation sounded more like "Raxxlan"... or someone somewhere a thousand years ago heard Klaxian and was recounting it later to someone else and said "I don't know, it sounded like Raxxlan or something..."

I do think the idea of two "god-like" alien factions/races fighting in the ancient primordial past is fitting with the themes. Ultimately either way we can be pretty sure that "Raxxla" is the product of aliens, and since we only know of two existing alien races, one of which may have two major factions or offshoots and one definitely does have at least one, then (as we've speculated before), Raxxla is either related to an entirely unknown alien race - or it's the product of one of the two known alien races (or their offshoots, etc).

I don't think Raxxla is going to be some entirely unknown thing. I think it's deeply rooted in the ancient history lore of the game, and likely somehow intersects Thargoid lore since they're so old and seem to have appendages in every pie at some stage.
