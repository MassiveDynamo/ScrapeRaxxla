Iâ€™ve long suspected likewise, that the use of specific dates identifies a specific area.

Beaumont is of interest primarily because of its omission, granted this could be due to an editorial error, but we also have a date.

Such temporal markers can define areas of influence and this might have been the authors intent. But we cannot know for certain, and potentially this is too open to projection bias.

The codex and the Brookes Tours by my interpretation do identify the Lost Realms zone which so happens to be below Achenar, the very same conceptual area described in Legacy I doubt this is a coincidence.

It warrants further investigation.
