Fellow lunatic here - I like the Odyssey slant, been looking at Dantes Inferno - there is a section about Odysseus's "Last Journey"

SPOILER: ODYSSEUS







































































His wanderlust drives him to go once more on the sea – searching past the pillars of Heracles – past the edge of the Earth in a quest to find Knowledge… the tree of Knowledge. His Goal would be Eden. In the West … as the World is East of Eden.... the Distant Mountain i think...
Wait a second - so Dante only had the Roman portrayals of Odysseus to go by, and thanks to Cicero's reimagining of the Sirens he was no longer moved by nostos, as in the Homerian original, but had very much a vagabond heart.
And some literary critics see him as an Adamic figure, led astray by his lust of knowledge to search beyond the limits set by God.

I've occasionally thought about the Divine Comedy as a possible inspiration, but never got around to investigate. At the same time, I was puzzled by the dissonance between the Dark Wheel's goals and their toast's Odyssey allusions - this explains it neatly.
