The Winking Cat thief narrative involved stolen art, and giving clues for a treasure hunt. - during the festival, the artpiece 'Penance Street' was secretly returned. - the repentence of sin, and 'street' implying a road/path to redemption.

Very much this - Penance street is a euphemism for a Pilgrimage and the painters name is Megan Madigan…. Name meaning Pearl Dog. I suspect this was pointing us to the jewel..Sirius as the first post on our Pilgrimage…. Waypoint?
