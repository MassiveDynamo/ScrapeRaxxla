IIRC Klaxians Vs Oresrians cropped up briefly in Holdstock's original novella, but was amplified in Drew Wagars two books as two warring species of Thargoid and the less warlike Oresrians were intending to use humanity as a "meat shield" against the more warlike Klaxians while they made their escape into deep space, and The Club planned to piggyback that plan to evacuate the wealthy. I thought the original, non threatening Thargoid encounters were likely to be Oresrians whereas the Klaxians erupted when the Alliance started to terra-bomb planets in the Coalsack Nebula. But this never seems to have been supported by Galnet news posts etc. Whether this idea was put on hold, is still running in the background, or was deleted entirely I think only FD could tell us, but they don't!

One thing I do suspect-when the current Thargoid War is over there'll be something worse we've been training for! I say "we" in the general term, since I'm long past any interest in that side of gameplay, after developing hand pain killing off Thargoid Scouts to get my combat Elite rank.

Edit
When the research academy finally makes some progress in decoding Thargoid communications I suspect all the flashing lights and EMP from those initial Thargoid hyperdictions will translate to "the Dolphins told us to ask for fish"!
