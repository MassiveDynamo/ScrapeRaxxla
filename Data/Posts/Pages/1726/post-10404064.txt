Ok so I looked at the stargoids and a possible relationship to what we are seeing in the bubble. The way they are setup is almost like they are arcing around something - but not quite. I suppose there would be a mathematical way to do this but I played around with triangles and trial and error. I am not at the "center" but i think it is close to the area we are looking at. I put the lines (with distances) between Arcadian and each of the Stargoid Locations. Its no where near a perfect sphere but they do seem to pointing more in this area then say Sol.
