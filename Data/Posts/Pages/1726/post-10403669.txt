I haven't looked into the system yet, but while I was grinding some engineered SCO stuff I had a look at Achenar again and something caught my eye.

If you focus your map on Achenar, then use the vertical pan to go in a straight line up, there is a system that aligns very closely to this axis called Katta which falls within Alliance region.
The Greek origins of the prefix kata- (now spelled cata- ) mean "down / downward, through, against, concerning a matter"
As a funny coincidence the word catachresis means the misuse of a word / metaphor (kata = 'down' in the sense of perversion of an idea).

If the theory that Achenar is the peak / 'above' of this 'beautiful mountain' (seat of power, home of gods?, empire = empyrean?), then from this perspective going below would mean "up" going against our standardized view of the galaxy. Not a clear theory at all, but some puzzle mysteries will utilise changing perspective to 'see' a new clue.



Love it!
