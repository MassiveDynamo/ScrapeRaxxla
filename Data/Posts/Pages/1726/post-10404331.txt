I know what everyone might think. that I'm a lunatic. But there's too much interconnectedness. Signals out of nowhere. Gravitational anomalies. People going crazy or disappearing without a trace. Plus it all too well lays down the story of the toast and the odyssey.

Fellow lunatic here - I like the Odyssey slant, been looking at Dantes Inferno - there is a section about Odysseus's "Last Journey"

SPOILER: ODYSSEUS







































































His wanderlust drives him to go once more on the sea – searching past the pillars of Heracles – past the edge of the Earth in a quest to find Knowledge… the tree of Knowledge. His Goal would be Eden. In the West … as the World is East of Eden.... the Distant Mountain i think...
