Ok so I looked at the stargoids and a possible relationship to what we are seeing in the bubble. The way they are setup is almost like they are arcing around something - but not quite. I suppose there would be a mathematical way to do this but I played around with triangles and trial and error. I am not at the "center" but i think it is close to the area we are looking at. I put the lines (with distances) between Arcadian and each of the Stargoid Locations. Its no where near a perfect sphere but they do seem to pointing more in this area then say Sol.

Great work O7

Very interesting…it’s evident from you map there is a clear symmetry.

I may look at these again, something just crossed my mind!

Evidently they are all named after storm gods, I have to wonder how does this effect they’re spacial orientation?

Likewise, apart from two titans, all the others share a name that has been used for a system! I wonder what that identifies regards spacial orientation?

In my past model, I identified it ‘might focus upon a certain location, and there ‘might’ be some significance, but I did not pursue it further… I’m going to re-map this and see if I can extrapolate anything more?
