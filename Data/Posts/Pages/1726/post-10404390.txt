There are various systems in game which in my opinion could support Dante’s work.

But in my opinion such a path presents a very an inevitable resolution, which by my understanding of the in game locations would lead towards certain obviously permit locked areas. It’s plausible, but although the two story’s are relatable and share many of the same inspirations, the ‘universes’ they were set in are very different, also if these do resolve to a known permit locked area it advertises a narrative gate.

I suspect there might be some cross over in game, as it does seem like the author has utilised various sources to build their own creation.

Contextually this is not technically accurate, from an academic nor historical perspective, but creatively I suppose anything goes, and that could be why all this falls apart, because if as I suspect, by the evidence presented, some segments of this story may have been sidelined, the ‘context’ therefore which originally underwrote it, lost. I think that’s where the codex comes in, I see it more of an index or redux.

There is so much in game which may or may not be relevant, no one knows for sure. I presume the point of Raxxla is it will make sense of this all?
