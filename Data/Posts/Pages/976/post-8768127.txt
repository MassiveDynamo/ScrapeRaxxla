I’m starting to believe it’s connected as well. The Coalsack nebula “obfuscated” the viewing of the Jewel Box to astronomers. The Jewel box was described as a casket covered in precious stones. Then we have Galnet already alluding to this with Harold Duval’s burial:

“The body of the Prince, contained within a jewelled transparent casket, was paraded through the city by a company of Imperial Guard.”

I’m going nuts now. Sorry.

You’re in the correct thread then, I’m a cashew, and a macadamia (dark chocolate coated!!)
I’m in two minds nuts
