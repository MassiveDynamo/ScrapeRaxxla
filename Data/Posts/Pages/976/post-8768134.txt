I seriously hope the mystery of Raxxla and the Dark Wheel isn't resolved because of some social media, hint drop..."looki over here, its right here'...., so unimaginative.

Likely its an all hallows eve event, I've enjoyed it, the suspense is palpable, then again, I wouldn't put it past FD to drop some major narrative hint, its what they do.

But not Raxxla FD, not Raxxla.
