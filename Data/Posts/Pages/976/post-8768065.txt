So the binary drops coming out....Coalsack....
Someone above mentioned a part of the DW riddle ....jewel that burns brightest. Coal burns and is also origin for diamonds. A double-entendre here OR maybe just in context with the coalsack description below...
Now in the Elite Wiki Coalsack starts .....The Coalsack Nebula is a dark and beautiful jewel, especially when viewed with the Milky Way as a background. It's 500 light years from Sol.
Conventional wisdom is saying that given the technology at the time, there is a max distance a ship with that vintage of FSD could travel - and IIRC, 500 LYs is pretty reasonable, if that theory has truth to it.
Not sure what 'stones' have to do with it - but this all could very well be a pointer to The Dark Wheel.
Perhaps the wiki text gives us a direction - much like we had with investigating the formidine rift mystery. Perhaps getting to the nebula, aligning with SagA and then seeing what is along that path that matches other aspects of the toast.... Might just lead to The Dark Wheel.
