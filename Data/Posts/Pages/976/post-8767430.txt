I forgot who was looking into all the Norse mythology and Yggdrasil but just came across Rakapila a few times in Galnet and Rakapila also seems to be a tree deity but in Madagascar. Not saying this means anything but I found it interesting. Rakapila also has a station with Stone in its name for anyone following the ongoing binary image thread. I checked it out, didnâ€™t see anything strange in there.
