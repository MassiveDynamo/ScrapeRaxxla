Not sure what 'stones' have to do with it - but this all could very well be a pointer to The Dark Wheel.

Not that this is the case, just food for thought, but "stones" is sometimes used as slang for jewels.

Then again, with the ease of converting binary and the simplicity of the clue, this seems way too thin and convenient.
