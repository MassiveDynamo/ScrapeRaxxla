Good thinking. I did once try to list all Elite systems that are also in ED. I didn't complete the effort, mainly because there are over 2000 to check! It's a small % though, however some are from galaxies other than galaxy 1 which is interesting.


I actually thought that all of you rifters were also CoR. However on reflexion that would be a contradictory mix of thinking out loud and total secrecy!

Great check. I checked this myself a while ago because of the "Rogue Planet" exotic star type in the player journal API. Shame they're not actually called Rogue Planets but instead brown dwarfs. Makes one wonder what systems are classed as Rogue Planets (AFAIK nobody's found one yet).

Thinking back over the thread very few Rifters were CoR, but they were always welcome.
