OK, so here is the full scoop on the possible rogue planets from the Wikipedia link posted earlier.

tl;dr
the only two that seem to be in-game from that list are WISE 0855-0714 (discussed above) and UGPS 0722-05 (which has no system info available as I have not visited it, yet.) It is possible that some of the others are on the Galmap under an abbreviated identifier format, but I tried as many as I could, and some do not even appear in Simbad as far as I can tell, although someone with more Simbad-fu than I may want to confirm those ones.

Here is the long version of my search results for anyone who might want to follow up on them:

"NOT FOUND" below means not found under any of its Simbad identifiers on the Galmap, including some speculative shorter formats I tried out based on existing survey identifiers in Galmap (i.e. SDSS J1110+0116 for SDSS J111010.01+011613.1)


OTS 44 - NOT FOUND
S ORI 52 - NOT FOUND (cannot actually find S ORI 52 in Simbad at all, only other identifier found online was S Ori J0540092-022632 which also is not in Simbad or on the Galmap. S Ori cluster does not appear to be in their database and may be being cataloged as [BZR2011] not S Ori)
Cha J110913-773444 - NOT FOUND
UGPS J072227.51-054031.2 - UGPS 0722-05 on Galmap. System information not available.
[MPK2010b] 4450 - NOT FOUND
CFBDSIR 2149-0403 - NOT FOUND (in Simbad under full designation CFBDSIR J214947.2-040308.9)
MOA-2011-BLG-262 - NOT FOUND (in Simbad as MOA 2011-BLG-262, without the first hyphen)
PSO J318.5-22 - NOT FOUND (not found in Simbad also: PSO is a survey identifier in Simbad but no database entries for it yet apparently)
2MASS J2208+2921 - NOT FOUND (not found in Simbad also, should have longer formal designation)
WISE J1741-4642 - NOT FOUND (not found in Simbad also, should have longer formal designation)
WISE 0855−0714 - on Galmap as that designation, but dwarf system with three planets (not a rogue planet)
2MASS J12074836–3900043 - NOT FOUND
SIMP J2154–1055 - NOT FOUND (not found in Simbad either, even under formal designation SIMP J21543454-1055308)
SDSS J111010.01+011613.1 - NOT FOUND
2MASS J1119–1137 - NOT FOUND (in Simbad as TWA 42)
WISEA 1147 - NOT FOUND (in Simbad as 2MASS J11472421-2040204 )

Edit: I'm off to UGPS 0722-05 to check it out.
