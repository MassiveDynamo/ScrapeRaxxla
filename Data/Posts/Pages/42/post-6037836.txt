In the line of the tiny little bit obvious, any thoughts about The Ryder Revolutionary Party in Maia ?

I believe that is named after the Ben Ryder on these forums and not the Ben Ryder from The Dark Wheel novella. If memory serves the Ben Ryder on these forums was one of the persons, along with Obsidian Ant, who helped push the agenda of colonizing a system in the Pleiades. The naming of the faction was just a nod of appreciation. Anyone out there who can verify that this is correct or contradict me if my recollection is off base?
