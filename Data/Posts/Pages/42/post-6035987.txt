WISE 0855−0714 is only about 7.3 light-years from Sol. If we figured out it's location in the night sky we could theoretically fly from Sol to WISE 0855−0714 in supercruise. It would take more than a few hours though.

It is actually WISE 0855-0714 which is in-game under that designation, I copied the wrong one into the original post. Dooh! OP now corrected.

But as mentioned it is not actually a rogue planet, but a Class Y dwarf with three planets. Starting to check Simbad for the others now.
