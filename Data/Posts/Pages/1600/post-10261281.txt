I dont have a link, but it seems like the brain tree sector have a WR star at the center. Regor, HEN 2-333 and NGC 3199 are all WR. Eta Carinae is a suspected WR in RL.

WR stars are very bright and tend to light up any dust around them. All the above are in nebulae, except for Regor.
If you are looking at wolf-rayets you are seeing where Guardians used to live but not how the system was at the time. Wolf-rayets are too hot to support life. Guardians had blood like ours. They need liquid water. The key is a peculiar stellar life-cycle unique amongst M-K stars that are 0.5 - 8 solar masses known as asymptotic giant branch stars. Wolf-Rayets are perhaps the rarest end product of this cycle (other options are white dwarfs or neutron stars). Seek life not death.
