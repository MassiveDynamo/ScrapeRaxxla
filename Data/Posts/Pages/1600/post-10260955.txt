A small addition on the Guardian map. At the beginning of star travel, the Guardians had no jet engines and used a catapult.
Did the Guardians discover Thargoid tech like Barnacles and meta alloys, etc and get the space flight advancement from them?

Is that why some of their tech is sort of compatible with Thargoid tech? (Grellics)

Perhaps that started the war with the Thargoids?

I must reread the Guardian lore....

Just a thought....
