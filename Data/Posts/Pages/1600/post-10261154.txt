I wonder if "look at nebulae" is the reason for the Brookes tour ending on PMD2009 48.

We have Artemis representing Elite: Legacy, Beta Sculptoris for the black hole, Synuefe whatshisface on Guardian space, Taygeta as one of the Thargoids' beloved Pleiades... but the Orion nebula (with the beacon that explicitly talks about Raxxla, no less!) lacked an explanation.
