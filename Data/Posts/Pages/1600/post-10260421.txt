A thought (...and not a thought out well one, but a thought!)...
If Raxxla is something to do with the Guardians (but the thought still might work if not)....
If the Dark Wheel found it....
If the toast is some sort of set of directions....
Could the toast be referring to nebulae?

SPOILER





Pretty sure Guardian bases tend to be near nebulae... Which is why I included them in the thought
"Finding new Guardian RuinsRuins have been found: In and near nebulae. Typically the areas are named for the nebula, such as the Eta Carina Guardian Bubble, Prai Hypoo Guardian Bubble etc. (This does not apply to the original Guardian Bubble â€“ which is less defined, and not associated with a nebula.)"

When in space, Nebulae would be more visible and perhaps similar to early sailors on earth using stars for navigation; but more relevant than constellations/stars for referencing directions when off the earth?

Anyone else had any thoughts on this previously or feel free to shoot it down so I can move on?

Just a thought...
