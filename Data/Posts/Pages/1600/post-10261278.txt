I dont have a link, but it seems like the brain tree sector have a WR star at the center. Regor, HEN 2-333 and NGC 3199 are all WR. Eta Carinae is a suspected WR in RL.

WR stars are very bright and tend to light up any dust around them. All the above are in nebulae, except for Regor.
I spent a few months out in Eta, its a wonderful place, visited the Guardian sites and the Alpha sites over in Hawking's.
Plan to head back after Yule, i feel there's more to that place as its in the middle of a lot of stuff.
