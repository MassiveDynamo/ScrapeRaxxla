Seem to remember when barnacles were first found that MB posted something along the lines of them preferring nebulae, but too long ago to remember specifics. You could try searching through the old Cannon threads; Han_Zen had the URLs.
Thatâ€™s true as my memory serves. I do recall Brookes stating there was a reason why they chose certain locations over others for their specific needs, at that point I presumed that obviously pointed towards nebulous areas.
