Guardians and Thargoids I believe were supposed to be proficient at bio-engineering lifeforms for specific purposes. Humans are purported to be close to Guardian level as far as biology and genetics. Why I mention this? A lot of the lifeforms we see in-game occur in noble gas atmospheres. In theory, that should render life impossible because noble gases are extremely unreactive. It may be time to start considering that a sizable portion of organisms in-game are connected to the deeper Raxxla myth.
