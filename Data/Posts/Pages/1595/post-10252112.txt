I Suppose i have to give some clarification here in order to avoid having people waste their time.
I Found the information regarding lft 509 permit being available even tho ross 54 is completely glitched at least weird. so i contacted support again. apparently the information regarding lft 509 came from some outdated source, but upon consulting with the devs it was confirmed that lft 509 permit is not available. i will leave the full answer here.


In order to ensure that we're giving you fully up-to-date information, I've gone back to our Development Team to clarify the current situation with the permits for LFT 509 and Polaris.

Now, this does match the idea of that maybe at some point these were in tha game(thus the outdated reply by support regarding their status) but for some weapon became narratively blocked by fdev. maybe the entire idea was scratched? who knows.
So we can save time by not looking to gain a permit... but can a permit requirement be bypassed.....
