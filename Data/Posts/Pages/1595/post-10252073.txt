I Suppose i have to give some clarification here in order to avoid having people waste their time.
I Found the information regarding lft 509 permit being available even tho ross 54 is completely glitched at least weird. so i contacted support again. apparently the information regarding lft 509 came from some outdated source, but upon consulting with the devs it was confirmed that lft 509 permit is not available. i will leave the full answer here.


In order to ensure that we're giving you fully up-to-date information, I've gone back to our Development Team to clarify the current situation with the permits for LFT 509 and Polaris.
They have confirmed that these permits are currently unavailable, and cannot be obtained in-game at this point in time. I do apologise for any conflicting information that you may have previously received.
This means that the wording of 'This system is locked by the Pilots' Federation, no permits are currently issued' would roughly translate to the permits being unavailable at this point in time.
Regarding the second issue that you highlighted - I have brought this to the attention of the relevant team for their review. Unfortunately I'm unable to advise as to what exactly may be occurring with the system at this point in time, but please rest assured that it has been raised and is being looked into.

Now, this does match the idea of @Rochester that maybe at some point these were in tha game(thus the outdated reply by support regarding their status) but for some weapon became narratively blocked by fdev. maybe the entire idea was scratched? who knows.
