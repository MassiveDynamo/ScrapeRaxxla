I don’t suppose it’s permit locked, if it is then it’s almost certainly narratively locked, if so there is logically no point going looking for it. Therefore if it were - like FD confirmation about permits, FD ought to have confirmed it’s inaccessible, which they have not, so logically it’s out there, just floating around in the dark.

Or it’s not.
From a pure entertainment and business perspective, wouldn't FD want to build momentum on Raxxla at various time points in game history (ie in the past ten years) if it was something they really wanted to capitalize on? And yet nothing happened.
And wouldn't Raxxla be something FD would capitalize on, if it was the greatest mystery to be solved in game? And yet, they spent real cash building completely different scenarii, instead of making the quest for Raxxla some multi-layered enigma with hard events like they did for any other narratives that happened in game. Not necessarily to reveal anything. But just so people can engage in this narrative knowing it is supported by FD as a quest, and not dead codex lore.
Not even a damn lost relay or ship or log in YEARS, that would mention that Raxxla is actually something solvable or that the Dark Wheel is active in the galaxy. Not even a Galnet news that some efforts are being conducted by (idk) some powers or research lunatics or anything.
Not a proof as something doesn't exists in game of course as it cannot be disproven by the players, but only by FD themselves.

To make a long post short: I find troubling FD apparent lack of interest or support for this quest line, if it is actually one.
