Indeed. Looks like every NPC Joe and his mom has the permit...
LOL.... And I presume that's standard functionality for permit locked systems? (both obtainable and unobtainable permits?)...

Any of them going to Ross 54? ;-)

I was wondering if the galmap shenanigans (plotting a jump or actually trying to jump to Ross 54 or LFT 509) might work if you are carrying something in your ship (SAP 8 cores, Trinkets, Tharg stuff, Guardian stuff, Grelics, etc).....

I guess scanning cargo of ships jumping there might be a bit tricky unless everyone and their mother is jumping there... ;-)
