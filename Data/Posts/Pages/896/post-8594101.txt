Can you wake scan capital ships?
It would be interesting to see where Starship One jumps to if you can retreat it.
I'm not sure there's any way of knowing if Hudson is aboard himself - the Children of Raxxla once retreated the flagship of Denton Patreus and he's still around but at least the story made it into Premonition.
