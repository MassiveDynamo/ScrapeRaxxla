Gonna try an experiment Friday Night. Hudson's Presidential vessel Starship One orbits Mars in a Capital Ship signal source. We're going to try to blow it up and see what happens. The last time Starship One blew up, it changed some history. We've given it some prods, and 2 CMDRs can't beat the zone. We expect 6 or more could probably at least retreat it if not blow it up outright. (e2a: Looks like PC and XBOX will both be represented.)

As always, questions, comments and suggestions welcome. Discord link: https://discord.gg/bbdnwdM
