I had a rental copy on the BBC and never saw Raxxla. When I got my hands on a PC copy I used XTree Pro / Gold to dig through the .exe via the hex editor, long before Frontier was a thing. While you could read all the mission text that was buried right at the back end of the file I don't recall seeing any system names.

As I understand it the systems together with the system names were procedurally generated from an 8§ bit seed. The names were constructed from a couple of 2-letter combinations. The name Raxxla was impossible to generate.

Edit: § just found this & I obviously “misremembered”!

I’m sure there was another reference to FD talking about procedural generation for Elite.
Don’t think it was this:
