Hi all,

Long time since I followed this thread (or really spent any time in the forums actually) but I think I worked it out, and I'm sure that many of the rest of you have as well but you're still speculating for the fun of it

Basically, Raxxla is equivalent to Nirvana. Some believe it is a physical place they can travel to and will forever search for it. But it's actually more metaphorical, imagine someone asks you "have you found Nirvana?" in terms of your level of happiness not in terms of the physical place. Replace "Nirvana" with "Raxxla" and when asked in the context of ED the sentence makes sense, as do all the clues we have for it.
Can I find Raxxla in the game? Yes (okay, it's not easy but I'm pretty certain that someone could find a state of absolute bliss in ED).
Is it in the Milky Way? Since ED is set in the Milky Way then one can find Raxxla in the Milky Way.
Is it a place? Yes, it's a mental and emotional place where I could be.
But it isn't a place? It's not a single physical place, one can actually find Raxxla anywhere.
A door which is also the key? Er.... okay this one's a bit trickier! I imagine that the key to finding absolute happiness is finding the correct metaphotical mental/emotional doors to open and see whether that makes us happy. I'm not entirely happy with the answer on this one.
Where is it? Wherever you find it.
Have I found it? No, but I've been closest in Alpha Centauri and Beagle Point
I've been sitting on this for a while and just found the motivation to post it, after reading all the questions about Raxxla in the AMA. So, test the theory, where does it fail?

Cheers
