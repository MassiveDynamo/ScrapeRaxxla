Also the reporter that killed herself was not the only mysterious death around this time frame. At least one, maybe more, experts on the disappearance of The Highliner Antares met unfortunate deaths after Starship One went missing just as they were going to aid in the new disappearance, unless I’m misremembering.

Cover up for the sabotage (and now a patsy found and all nicely tied up?) Strangely the guy went down for Starship One but not for any cover up did he? Maybe its supposed to be forgotten or maybe its yet to come out.

“legendary singer and songwriter”

Justified / Ancients of Mumu was a song wasnt it? EMF & Dolly Parton iirc (EMF or PMF either could fit into the game as a 'clue')

Everything is possible but it would contradict the 'that Raxxla is a definite place, and that it holds a mystical secret.' part from the codex, wouldn't it?

All the earliest sources agree, however, that Raxxla is a definite place. - or something like that isnt it?

This is where I run into problems, do I believe that as is or do I run it past logic? Logic tells me that in the history of humanity all the earliest sources agreed that sacrificing humans would please the Gods. It doesnt make it so, it just makes it another irrational widespread belief. Trust nothing and no-one, problem is you then cant trust the person who tells you that either.....

Where are all these earliest sources anyway? I might ask in the next AMA
