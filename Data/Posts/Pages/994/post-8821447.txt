I've been looking at the likes of rogue stars / planets / exoplanets on and off for a couple of months. Mostly innocuous or not in game but a couple I found interesting.

HIP 13044. Can be found and appears briefly on the galactic map before not being seen. Co-ords 7,400 -10.985, -4,340. I'd say this is similar to another group I looked at earlier that have been discussed here, and I don't see normal travel to it being an option? It is on EDSM with no body information.

HD 7199 b. A class II gas giant in the Firdaus system, named as Borealis and has a low orbit station. I had a look around but was unable to see anything unusual. Searching for HD 7199 returns Firdaus first but then HIP 41731 , HIP 41707 , HR 3353 and HD 71998. I can see why the last would be returned but inspection of the first two gives me no reason to see why they would be shown as search results (I haven't been to HR 3353 yet).
