Hi all,

Long time since I followed this thread (or really spent any time in the forums actually) but I think I worked it out, and I'm sure that many of the rest of you have as well but you're still speculating for the fun of it

Basically, Raxxla is equivalent to Nirvana. Some believe it is a physical place they can travel to and will forever search for it. But it's actually more metaphorical, imagine someone asks you "have you found Nirvana?" in terms of your level of happiness not in terms of the physical place. Replace "Nirvana" with "Raxxla" and when asked in the context of ED the sentence makes sense, as do all the clues we have for it.
I've been sitting on this for a while and just found the motivation to post it, after reading all the questions about Raxxla in the AMA. So, test the theory, where does it fail?

Cheers

Everything is possible but it would contradict the 'that Raxxla is a definite place, and that it holds a mystical secret.' part from the codex, wouldn't it?
