HD 7199 b. A class II gas giant in the Firdaus system, named as Borealis and has a low orbit station. I had a look around but was unable to see anything unusual. Searching for HD 7199 returns Firdaus first but then HIP 41731 , HIP 41707 , HR 3353 and HD 71998. I can see why the last would be returned but inspection of the first two gives me no reason to see why they would be shown as search results (I haven't been to HR 3353 yet).
"O Thou, whose memory quickens lovers' souls,
Whose fount of joy renews the lover's tongue,
Thy shadow falls across the world, and they
Bow down to it; and of the rich in beauty
Thou art the riches that make lovers mad.
Not till Thy secret beauty through the cheek
Of Laila smite does she inflame Majnún,
And not till Thou have sugar'd Shírín's lip
The hearts of those two lovers fill with blood.
For lov'd and lover are not but by Thee,
Nor beauty; mortal beauty but the veil
Thy heavenly hides behind, and from itself
Feeds, and our hearts yearn after as a bride
That glances past us veil'd—but even so
As none the beauty from the veil may know.
How long wilt Thou continue thus the world
To cozen with the phantom of a veil
From which Thou only peepest?—Time it is
To unfold Thy perfect beauty. I would be
Thy lover, and Thine only—I, mine eyes
Seal'd in the light of Thee to all but Thee,
Yea, in the revelation of Thyself
Self-lost, and conscience-quit of good and evil.
Thou movest under all the forms of truth,
Under the forms of all created things;
Look whence I will, still nothing I discern
But Thee in all the universe."
