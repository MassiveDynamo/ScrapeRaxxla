The first thing I think of with the whisperer in Witchspace are the Thargoids and their ability to navigate it with ease.
Has anybody done audio analysis of the 'whispering' sounds in witchspace?
I've always thought that this was Raxxla's own whisper. Something we could hear or see in the witchspace tunnel, if we make the exact right jump and pay attention.
The right jump would then probably be one that passes Raxxla in close proximity. In to or out of Raxxla's system, passing close to Raxxla or from / to two other systems that gives a trajectory trough Raxxla's system. The last option would work with dark systems / rogue planets, as well.
