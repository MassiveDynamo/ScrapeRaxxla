I've instructed Tyko to return from his tasking to Goliath's Rest. He has dived 12 Black Holes (not counting Sag A*) , & visited 74 systems with NS after leaving Explorer's Anchorage. If that doesn't capture TDW interest then....I'll give up Lavian brandy!
(for a day ).

The one nagging thought outstanding is that the BH at SWOALS HG-Y F11 is an obvious (from Galmap) step but at 263ly from Goliath's Rest with no NS for the return journey I was loath to try. I want to test this current hypthesis first (sell this exploration data to TDW at SD) rather than comitting suicide, which is what I think most pilots would want to do; hence it would make a very good hiding place!
Will report back after selling the data!
