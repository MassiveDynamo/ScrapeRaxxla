Justified / Ancients of Mumu was a song wasnt it? EMF & Dolly Parton iirc (EMF or PMF either could fit into the game as a 'clue')
No, I believe they are an ancient Chinese folk religion sect that somehow survived into the third millenia, like Yiguandao or something similar. When you search for 古母母 you come up with images of the
SPOILER: ETERNAL VENERABLE MOTHER
, also "Queen Mother of the West". Interesting associations with a cardinal direction, mountain as an axial pole of the world, and some astronomy.

"After the emergence of the Ancient Awakened, heaven and earth were established; after the rise of the Eternal Venerable Mother, Former Heaven was established. The Eternal Venerable Mother conceives from herself and begets yin and yang. The yin is the daughter and the yang is the son."

(edit: is there a relation to Anatolian cult of Cybele here? Can anybody study this?)
