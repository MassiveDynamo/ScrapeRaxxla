MMMMMM
just checked Starship One's route in galmap. Su is nearer to Azaleach than Furuhjlem I-645. There are other stars that could provide an almost straight line route to Azaleach from 78 Urs Maj. Something is fishy! Perhaps the XX message pointing to Furuhjlem I-645 was a red herring?? Don't think there was any wreckage hunting done there.

P.S. she would have gone past Tau Ceti to get to Furuhjlem I-645 from 78 Urs Maj!

Edit: of the listed wreckage hunt areas (see https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8818015 post) I seem to remember only finding wreckage in two of them but canâ€™t remember which. Would be interesting to see where they lie in relation to 78 Urs Maj/Su/Furuhjlem I-645 /Azaleach. I suspect the destination (Azaleach) of the diversion reported by the Feds may itself have been obfuscation.
