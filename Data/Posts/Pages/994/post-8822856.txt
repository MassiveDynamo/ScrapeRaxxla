Incidentally, why are Neutron Stars the “whisperer in Witchspace”? What is the reasoning for this interpretation? Admitedly you do see them visually during the hyperspace jump, whereas I haven’t yet seen any traces of a Black Hole. But how about White Dwarves which are also visible? Has anybody reported actually hearing any whispers from any such body? Has an FD spokesperson referred to such whisperers? (If so can I have the reference please!)

Or is this just more poetry? Yugh!
