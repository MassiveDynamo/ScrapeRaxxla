If all y'all want a real good headache time try heading over to CFBDSIR 1458+10. This is a system I came across on my hunt for rogue planets today. When you get there take note that your arrival star is different than the one you plotted your route to. Next, take a good look at your nav panel for CFBDSIR 1458+10 B and take note of how frickin' close by it is. Take a drive by while sipping on your beverage of choice. Don't worry about your frameshift drive, for it will only take seconds to supercruise there. When you have had your fill of beverage and sight-seeing, engage your FSD for no reason to the mysterious system and then watch and be amazed as the skybox plays weird tricks on you.

Is this related to Raxxla? Probably not! But why not go take a break from the hunt and see if you can find anything I couldn't over there.

There is an 8th body orbiting the unnamed "gas giant" in 10 B, so have at 'er.
