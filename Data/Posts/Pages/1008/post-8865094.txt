Besides, were there any unsolved unregistered comms beacon(s)? might be linked to RAXXLA(well, they may add more in Odyssey)
...EDIT:and found out our trustworthy Jorki has exactly this under his signature

I try to help! It’s a useful checklist if you find an LP or UCB. I don’t think any remain unsolved. Nobody has reported any new finds to me recently so I think the checklist is up to date.

There are some Tourist Beacons yet to be found! The important ones will be those relating to Elite History. See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1eu30UyjpQrWexAglwD1Ax_GaDz4d7l8KD76kSzX4DEk/htmlview#
