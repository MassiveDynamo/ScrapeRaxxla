I'm sure someone thought of this already, but what if...

Raxxla is some kind of cosmic coordinates? What does "RA" translate to in space GPS? What does "XX"? And "LA?" More like, longitude, latitude, and vertical. Not sure if that's how it works, but I presume X axis is "RA", Y axis is "XX", and Z axis is "LA".

And also, what if The REAL Dark Wheel is not a space station, but a burnt-out Generation Ship? This thing certainly has the darkness and the rotation of a Dark Wheel. No, I did NOT find their literal headquarters, just THE Generation Ship Artemis made me think...
