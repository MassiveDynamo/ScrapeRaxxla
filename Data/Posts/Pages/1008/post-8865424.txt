Except the original Start screen showed an Orbis station apparently orbiting an icy moon as seen from an srv on an adjacent moon (though the perspective was distorted). Hence Iâ€™ve often checked out twin moons, just in case. That could have been marketing, or it could have been a clue. I still have that pic available on my secondary screen to check. Wish I was good at star pattern matching!
(edit: interestingly, just started the game and that pic of the Orbis station flashed up for a fraction of a second...MMM!!)
The one with the Orbis and the SRV came with Horizons, didn't it? The original was the Coriolis with the sunrise, I think.
