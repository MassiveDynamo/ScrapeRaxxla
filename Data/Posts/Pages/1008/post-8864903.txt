The one with the hat. He recently started a new commander. Imitation as the sincerest form of flattery and all that. Or is it mockery? Never could remember that one. Updated just now but haven't got up the nerve (motivation) to start it up and hit the kill switch yet (or to reset up my joystick and throttle and keybinds, sigh.) Although the strange draw of parallax might pull me back in more than the new exploration changes (eventually, maybe). Parallax and lockdown.

Why not get yourself a new commander instead of killing off the old one? That way you can have two games underway at the same time, in 2 different areas-faster testing of hypotheses. Only cost you £20! It could be your very own Xmas present to yourself! Think of all the effort you invested into your current pilot’s development, all that engineering grind...you know it makes sense!

P.S. FD-am I still on for 50% introduction fee?
