You guys know why you havent found Raxxla at all?

It is because you guys are not searching hard enough.
I mean i have found Star Systems under 1000LY from Sol which was never mapped.

No wonder no one has found it

being near sol is so boring though. I'm not looking for raxxla but i always keep a look out. it's very unlikely it is out by bovomit but if it is i might come across it.
