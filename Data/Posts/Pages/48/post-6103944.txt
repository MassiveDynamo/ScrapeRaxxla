Guardian Ruins are still being discovered in Nebula even now (latest ones were only last week). So there's no specific reason why something else can't turn up in one, even one close to the bubble (Barnacles are still being found as close as California, Witch Head and Pleiades).

Ok. Nebulae are good places to hide anything. But not better than any other place in THIS game. That's what I tried to say. Everybody explores nebulae ! I even wouldn't try to hide myself there.
Not all what we are founding now in close nebulae are there since beta. FDevs are continually adding stuff.

What do we know about locked regions? There is no possible permit to access them. They are out "of the gameplay" until FDevs open them. So I don't think Raxxla is in one of them. What would be the point ?
System permits, on the contrary...
