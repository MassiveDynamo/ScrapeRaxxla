I've been mapping the Carina nebula and there are quite a lot of systems with secondary neutron stars (even one NS binary).
I don't know if this is specific to Carina or a general tendency with giant OAB class stars.

I've passed a handful of OABs on my jaunt along the rim of the Perseus arm ... none had a NS or WD companio.
