Ladies and Gentlemen, I have a Galmap anomaly

Could somebody please search for 'HD 93359'.
I get taken to a location in the SYNUEFE sector, but no star information shows up. I've tried various map settings, but can't find a way to make anything show up.
I'm curious as to whether it's just me.

Thanks in advance.
