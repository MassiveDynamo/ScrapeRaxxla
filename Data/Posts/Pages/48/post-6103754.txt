Well...not in this game seems to me.
There is no nebula left to explore in the entire MW.
Harsh nav conditions regions, however...

Anyway it would not be logical to refere the "outer rim" to another game than E: D
But coming from FDevs ...well...[blah]

Guardian Ruins are still being discovered in Nebula even now (latest ones were only last week). So there's no specific reason why something else can't turn up in one, even one close to the bubble (Barnacles are still being found as close as California, Witch Head and Pleiades).

"Obfuscated" could refer to a permit locked region (deliberately hiding what's there, making it harder to get to, etc.) - doubly so to a permit locked region beyond a place that (pre-FSD) would have been extremely hard to get across... Bovomit is right on the rim of the galaxy past the Rift - so if you're looking for a place "on the rim" and steeped in Rift-hunter lore that's hard to get to then that's my vote "... and they thought the Thargoids were trouble."
