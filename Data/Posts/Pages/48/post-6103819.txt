Guardian Ruins are still being discovered in Nebula even now (latest ones were only last week). So there's no specific reason why something else can't turn up in one, even one close to the bubble (Barnacles are still being found as close as California, Witch Head and Pleiades).

"Obfuscated" could refer to a permit locked region (deliberately hiding what's there, making it harder to get to, etc.) - doubly so to a permit locked region beyond a place that (pre-FSD) would have been extremely hard to get across... Bovomit is right on the rim of the galaxy past the Rift - so if you're looking for a place "on the rim" and steeped in Rift-hunter lore that's hard to get to then that's my vote "... and they thought the Thargoids were trouble."


Annnd rambling:



14,000 ly a week with a type 1. Up one arm and down another should have been pretty viable, assuming no >7ly gaps which span an entire arm.

Also 900 yrs of type 0... That's plenty of time to go a long way.

Interstellar colonisation was limited to hyperspace travel being made safe for mass amounts of people. Unmanned probes and individual pilots were going through hyperspace well before that, from it's early days. (From the lore interview DJ Truthsayer did with MB.)

Also Jason Ryder hadn't found Raxxla, he'd found evidence for its existence.

He'd come back from deep space to get a proper team together.

So whatever Jason had found was found in deep space.
