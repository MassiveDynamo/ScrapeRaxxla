Wasnt there a stage where humans thought our solar system was the galaxy! Wasnt there a stage where hyperjumpimg wasnt heared of! Wouldnt it be well hidden if it was tucked on the rim of sol ... my guess its in sol deep space sol.

Anyone tell me according to Ed lore what was first discovered system!

"Tau Ceti was the first colony established outside of Sol. Tau Ceti 2 (now called Taylor Colony) had long been determined viable for habitation with life already present (due to free oxygen detected in the atmosphere via absorption spectra) - though observation and probe data confirmed this. By 2159, the settlement was largely self-sufficient and able to elect a civilian administrator."

I've not been myself, but I read there's tourist beacons there you can visit if you'd like to get to know the history a bit more. Might be a clue or two in there for your search

The First generation ship was launched in 2097 https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/57b6f0089657ba686d4f8629 and over 70,000 were launched before the first hyperdrives in the 22nd Century - but they weren't consumer ones at that point, that didn't really happen until around 2800's.
