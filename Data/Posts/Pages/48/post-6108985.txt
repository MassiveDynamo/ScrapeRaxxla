Could somebody please search for 'HD 93359'.
I get taken to a location in the SYNUEFE sector, but no star information shows up. I've tried various map settings, but can't find a way to make anything show up.
Can confirm.
Entering gets the marker to move to that location, but you get no information, and cannot auto-plot to it. Tried flipping between Realistic and various filters, and no joy.
