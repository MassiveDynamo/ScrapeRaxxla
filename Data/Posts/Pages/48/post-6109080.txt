Ladies and Gentlemen, I have a Galmap anomaly

Could somebody please search for 'HD 93359'.
I get taken to a location in the SYNUEFE sector, but no star information shows up. I've tried various map settings, but can't find a way to make anything show up.
I'm curious as to whether it's just me.

Thanks in advance.

This has happened to me several times-three yesterday afternoon. I believe there is a bug in the galmap search function. One of my examples yesterday was a search for Lave, it took me all over the place except to Lave. Had to close galmap & reopen for it to start working properly again.
