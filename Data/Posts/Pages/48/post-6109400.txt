Nearby HIP systems:
HIP 50913
HIP 51319
HIP 53143
HIP 53340
Omega Carinae and 232 G Carinae are close too <30Ly. Closest visible system appear to be Synuefe AT-L B55-0. Selected all systems within 16.9Ly from the Nav tab and showed in GalMap. All systems visible. Looks like a bug.

The trip back to Shinrarta Dezhra was very quick due to the neutron star in Omega Carinae.
