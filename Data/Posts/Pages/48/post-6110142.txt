The trip back to Shinrarta Dezhra was very quick due to the neutron star in Omega Carinae.

I've been mapping the Carina nebula and there are quite a lot of systems with secondary neutron stars (even one NS binary).
I don't know if this is specific to Carina or a general tendency with giant OAB class stars.
