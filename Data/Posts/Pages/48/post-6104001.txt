I see a couple of options, none of them limited to nebulas:
A hidden system, only visible from the Nav tab.
An invisible body not detected by the ADS, hidden like the Voyager probes, you have to be within 1000Ls to see it.

A common Y dwarf star system nobody gives a penny for....[haha] Obfuscated in the outer rim, of course. Less than a penny !
