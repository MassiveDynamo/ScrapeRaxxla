Ok. Nebulae are good places to hide anything. But not better than any other place in THIS game. That's what I tried to say. Everybody explores nebulae ! I wouldn't try to hide myself there.
Not all what we are founding now in close nebulae are there since beta. FDevs are continually adding stuff.

What do we know about locked regions? There is no possible permit to access them. They are out "of the game playing" until FDevs open them. So I don't think Raxxla is in one of them. What would be the point ?
System permits, on the contrary...

If we're getting meta about it:
SPOILER









And if you're sticking to in-universe:

It makes sense Raxxla would be permit locked. Pilot's Federation controls the Permit Locks (they are a function of Hyperdrive nav software), and Dark Wheel are part of the PF - so if the DW are protecting Raxxla, then it follows they'd request it be locked so random explorers won't keep coming across it

That doesn't mean we can't figure out which permit lock it's likely to be under, maybe that's part of the puzzle to unlocking it. No-one knows what unlocks them yet!
