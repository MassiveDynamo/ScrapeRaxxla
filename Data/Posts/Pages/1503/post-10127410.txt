Well the dark secret of this system seems to be that it doesn't have any terrestrial planet orbiting any of its stars.
I wonder if the inaccurate descriptions were done on purpose, or if it warrants a bug ticket... Opening a ticket might be the only way to find out
For the palm trees... I always thought it was just assets to distinguish between lavish stations (like statues, fountains..) and the rest.
Speaking of which, if these assets are indeed meaningful, fountains are quite a symbol too.
I googled the exact phrasing you posted and Nuenets most certainly had terrestrial (rocky or metallic) bodies. Can you please elaborate? Also, the astronomy definition for terrestrial is different from the more common usage which means Earth-likes. Terrestrial in astronomy is much broader in its' scope.

Strictly speaking, this does technically meet the loosest interpretations for "8th moon of an unnamed gas giant". Stars are but very hot gas giants. On that particular phrase, I assume the loosest of interpretations which can include brown dwarfs, gas giants, and stars. If The Dark Wheel likes playing fast and loose with language, it would be wise not to box yourself in too much.
