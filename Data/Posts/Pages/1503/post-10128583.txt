Personally I continuously accept the reality nothing is constant in ED.

Arthur effectively confirmed this when he started, saying there was a lot of historical content he and those previously in post knew little of, indicating those threads were just left hanging / overwritten etc.

ED has been adrift somewhat without a consistent dungeon master since Brookes departure. I accept there to be a lot of archeological aspects existing in game, there is also a considerable level of errors in game as well, both in code (bugs) and star categories and positions.

Itâ€™s whether we perceive this as a failure or as a challenge, personally I feel it provides insight.
