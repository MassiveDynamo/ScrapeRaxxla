I'll take a look after Nuenets, which will take a few days at least to test the case "being ally to every faction there"
I think the deal with Nuentes is just that it's close to the founders system. Before release the idea was that the founders system shouldn't be visible in the map, until you became Elite and got an invite. It was probably going to use the same mechanic as dark systems.
The odd system description has been there since gamma release opened the full galaxy.

It's a bit like the system Quiness, with the Ammonia planet Quy. The description says that the planet has ammonia life, not the regular 'indigenous ammonia life', that is comonly used. This lead many players to believe that it was the location of a Thargoid embassy or something.
In FFE Quiness had a luxury resort on the Planet New California. This resort was used for negotiations with Thargoids. New California being gone and an ammonia world popping up instead, made players suspicious.
