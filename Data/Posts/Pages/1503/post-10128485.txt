Guys, has anyone ever sweeped an 8th moon low orbit in a scientific and documented way so we are sure it's been done and TDW station is not to be found through such method?
For clarification: Are we talking something like orbiting whilst in supercruise. That can pick up signals certainly. The problem is how close does one have to be?
