I googled the exact phrasing you posted and Nuenets most certainly had terrestrial (rocky or metallic) bodies. Can you please elaborate? Also, the astronomy definition for terrestrial is different from the more common usage which means Earth-likes. Terrestrial in astronomy is much broader in its' scope.

Strictly speaking, this does technically meet the loosest interpretations for "8th moon of an unnamed gas giant". Stars are but very hot gas giants. On that particular phrase, I assume the loosest of interpretations which can include brown dwarfs, gas giants, and stars. If The Dark Wheel likes playing fast and loose with language, it would be wise not to box yourself in too much.

I am thinking about exoplanets with planetary systems of binary stars. There are several such planets, including Kepler-16b, Kepler-34b, Kepler-35b, Kepler-47b, and TOI 1338b. For example, Kepler-47 fits the model described as "Nuenets," but I don't know how it relates to Raxxla.
