I am thinking about exoplanets with planetary systems of binary stars. There are several such planets, including Kepler-16b, Kepler-34b, Kepler-35b, Kepler-47b, and TOI 1338b. For example, Kepler-47 fits the model described as "Nuenets," but I don't know how it relates to Raxxla.
I think the concern here lies in the "dark secret". Whether that is TDW, Raxxla, or something else entirely remains to be seen. Also, I forget which of the Kepler-xxx systems is incredibly ancient. Raxxla was supposed to be very old and possibly older than the galaxy itself.
