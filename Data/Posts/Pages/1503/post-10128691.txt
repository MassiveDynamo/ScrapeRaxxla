Personally I continuously accept the reality nothing is constant in FD.

Arthur effectively confirmed this when he started, saying there was a lot of historical content he and those previously in post knew little of, indicating those threads were just left hanging / overwritten etc.

ED has been adrift somewhat without a consistent dungeon master since Brookes departure. I accept there to be a lot of archeological aspects existing in game, there is also a considerable level of errors in game as well, both in code (bugs) and star categories and positions.

It’s whether we perceive this as a failure or as a challenge, personally I feel it provides insight.

Yep! Insight into the quality control that has been exercised!
Evidence:
LTT 2771 is supposed to contain the Smuggler’s Junction pirate asteroid base from AHTW, but not an asteroid in sight in that system in-game!! Also planet 1 is Tarlak...but Tarlak is supposed to be “the garbage planet” in CD-73 253. However CD-73 253 in-game has no planet, even though its system description explicitly discusses it having the garbage planet! Was this a Friday afternoon after a pub lunch job?

I rest my case m’lud!
It’s very heavy
