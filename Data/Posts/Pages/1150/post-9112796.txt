Remember, if Raxxla has been on ED since the start, it wouldn't be a planet to land on

My only quibble here is with the quadruple Elite. CQC was not in the game at launch,

Remember the Dynasty Project Megaship was updated from an Anaconda to a Megaship when they came out...just means Raxxla might have been upgraded as well. Might even be landable now as Horizons in the base game. But not needing legs yet. Wouldnt be lying by saying there from start if it got upgraded along the way.

Elite rank I tend to agree though, if Elite rank is needed one should be enough if 'blaze your own trail' still applies and SD DW missions were one each for Trade, Explo and Combat so could do one or all depending on rank (I think anyway, you couldn't do the other ones if you didnt have Elite rank could you?)

I haven't been with you for a long time, are there any new clues besides what now need to be looked for in the asteroid belts?

Welcome back Yes we found it but lost it again, not surprising really as it turned out to be a giant set of car keys...or was that a dream I had? No nothing new just some more advanced theories / tinfoil and now the asteroids thing so we all facepalmed and thought about how many we didnt bother with and one spammer who seems to have moved to the EliteDangerous Twitter page now.
