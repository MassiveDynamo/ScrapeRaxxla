CQC was not in the game at launch
I actually didn't know that, so yeah, triple-elite at most, if not just single-elite.
I'd still aim to get triple-elite before starting to look for it, because if the system star only shows on the galaxy map if you have meet that requirement (good odds this would be the case with video game logic) there is no point on going around anywhere and trying to be clever on where it might be.
