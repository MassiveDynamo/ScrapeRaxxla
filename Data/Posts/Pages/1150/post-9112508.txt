Just throwing a little more weight on the 'Raxxla in Sol' idea.

I would like to propose Gaia as a candidate for 'mother of galaxies'.
Gaia - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org

ED seem to favour Greek in the mythology department. Gaia is the primordial personification of Earth, in Greek mythology. She is also the mother (and wife) of Uranus. Uranus is the personification of the sky. The sky is all of space. All the galaxies, stars and planets outside Earth. Gaia and Uranus are the ancestors of the titans and gods in Greek mythology. Gaia is also the mother of a lot of the strange creatures, giants and monsters. She is at the top of the family three.

Gaia in Greek is Γαία or Γαίία. Just a couple of X's short.

Gaia is believed by some sources to be the original deity behind the Oracle at Delphi:

Mother Gaia is of course also the leading faction in Sol.

If Gaia is the mother, the jewel is most likely the Moon.
The Moon is mainly personified by Selene, but is also linked to the triple goddess maiden, mother, crone system. Hecate, Demeter, Persephone, Phobe, Artemis and so on.

Not sure what this could mean. The whisper in witchspace seem to suggest hyperspace as the next step?
Perhaps we are looking for a Pole star for the Moon or and axis perpendicular to the Moons orbital plane?

Guess I'll fly to Sol again and have a look.

I like this - and if we are still going with some sort of "star lover" connection, as I think I mentioned somewhere above, most of the early astronomers (including ancient priests/priestesses and the like) were largely obsessed with the Moon and the seasonal cycles of Sun and some stars. If there is a Stella/Astrophel connection I'd be tempted to focus on one of these very early "astronomer princesses" that I collated above (there may be more) and possible Moon/Sun/other Sol connections with them.
