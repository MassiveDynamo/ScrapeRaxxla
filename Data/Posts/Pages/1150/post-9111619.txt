I didn't get those message after hesperus, any reason?
Which messages?

One is from Twitter, nobody got that in game. Some friends of the CMs probably got a heads up and maybe more info and help on Discord.

You get one more message after scanning all the logs (takes a minute or two) with a specified station to hand them in, and one after handing them in at specified station via BBS (on usual mission rewards screen).

Nobody knows yet how the next one will appear or when, but presumably when the next stage is ready or someone finds the 2 Dredgers round the Star with the asteroid field.
