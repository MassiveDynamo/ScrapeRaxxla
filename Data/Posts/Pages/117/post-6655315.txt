I can appreciate the whole "no clues" thing.
With the inconsistencies of FD, all the changes that have been made and the history of this game, I feel it would be reasonable to ask FD to make a one time statement concerning the cannon for Raxxla.
Aside from cloak and dagger comments that have been made, has FD ever been flat out asked:
Does Raxxla exist in game? Is it a reachable place? Will we know when we have found it?
Ive read all the stuff too. It sounds to me like this is all been answered, but am I just hearing what I want to hear?
