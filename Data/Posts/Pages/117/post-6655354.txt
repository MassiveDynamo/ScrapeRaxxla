I can appreciate the whole "no clues" thing.
With the inconsistencies of FD, all the changes that have been made and the history of this game, I feel it would be reasonable to ask FD to make a one time statement concerning the cannon for Raxxla.
Aside from cloak and dagger comments that have been made, has FD ever been flat out asked:
Does Raxxla exist in game? Is it a reachable place? Will we know when we have found it?
Ive read all the stuff too. It sounds to me like this is all been answered, but am I just hearing what I want to hear?

Yes. I'm on my phone so can't find it now, but both Michael Brooks and David Braben have both confirmed Raxxla is in game right now.

They haven't said its reachable, or that we'd know it when we find it, etc.

The wisest assumption you can make is that it's permit locked and unreachable, reserved for a future storyline.
