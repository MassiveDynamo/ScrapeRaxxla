I seem to remember a while ago several people were reporting new objects being reported in already scanned systems, can’t remember the cause though; might have been related to a game increment. Might be worth a search on the forum, especially in the FRift and Cannon threads.
I had a some new bodies in either Maia or Merope once (can’t quite remember which it was). I’d ADS scanned previously, but am in the habit of doing it every time I jump into a system, and on one jump got some new bodies discovered. As far as I could tell there weren’t any actual new bodies.
