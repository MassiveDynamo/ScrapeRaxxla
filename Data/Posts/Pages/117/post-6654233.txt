nope - not a troll or false lead - i remember the popup well but because i was in SC ( probably heading out to scan an ELW or something ) i didnt give it that much thought other than thinking it was odd because id already honked the system. And tbh im not sure if it was out in the rift, i just know it was somewhere around that time. Im off at the weekend so ill be looking through the logs and hopefully going back to where i got the signal - just hope ill be able to txt search either through EDDiscovery or the actual logs themselves.

Are you sure you had an Advanced Discovery Scanner and not an Intermediate? That would be one explanation for picking up another discovery in SC after the initial honk.
