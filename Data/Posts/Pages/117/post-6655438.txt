They haven't said its reachable, or that we'd know it when we find it, etc.

"... a journey that everyone has to travel for himself .." Doesn' it imply it's (was) actually reachable ? Or maybe travel for .. nothing ?

Maybe time to make a resume of what we actually know (IF nothing changed since ..)

"... a journey.." : some quest-like ? Not enough stumbling into the right system ?
"..for himself " : some kind of requisite is needed. Rank, rep, permit....
" ..R is in the game and we know where it is ." Non procedural body. Must have some name. Otherwise a known POI inside a procedural system ? Game developer or computing engineers threaders may be able to say if possible.
"... bit obvious .." TDW faction ? What else ?
" .. celestial body...The Myth .." Self explanatory.

Something else ?
