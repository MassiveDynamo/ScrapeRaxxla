I seem to remember a while ago several people were reporting new objects being reported in already scanned systems, canâ€™t remember the cause though; might have been related to a game increment. Might be worth a search on the forum, especially in the FRift and Cannon threads.

Had it happen to me a few times, sometimes out in FR, and other regions. Sometimes minutes between honk, finding initial immediate objects, and then -poof!- more found.

Not saying it is a bug, but could be a bug
