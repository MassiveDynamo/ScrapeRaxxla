Well, that was exactly my initial question. largely comented but still not answered: "... a journey that everyone has to travel for himself .." ( in the context of answering the question: " Where is R" ?) Doesn' it imply it's (was) actually reachable ?
Please, enlighten me ...

Not really. 'Travelling' doesn't imply that it's possible to get there. A 'journey' doesn't imply there's a destination to actualy reach. They're both words that basically imply that you're doing something, going somewhere (as in the actual act of movement).

Basically, that phrase is meaningless in the context it's presented in, as are most of the clues. They sound like they mean something, but they don't really from this end of the puzzle. After we know what and where Raxxla is we might well be able to look back and see what they meant, but that's not really very useful if we're alreay there.

The best interpretation I have for your favourite phrase is this (I've spoilered it because I found that to explain what I reckon properly it's turning into an essay ):

However, I think at the time MB was just being vague because he knew that in the roadmap they had the idea of doing more story-driven player-centric stuff and that Raxxla would feature somewhere there, but there's no other details yet, so hint-hint-hint is all they can do. I do find it interesting that what we're now hearing about a "personal narrative" can be made to fit quite neatly with what MB has hinted at (but that's also the point of this, since what he said can be made to fit several things in different way!)
