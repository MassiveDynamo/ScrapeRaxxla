* stopping right now searching for R*

(After all .. this personal quest-like mechanics is quite similar to what I have been doing untill now: getting triple E, getting allied with TDW, getting allied with the dozens of factions of the Elite missions, searching the 190 Ly radius around Ticushpakhi for the lost "Fifth Elite-missions Cluster"... Now just waiting for GalNet and livestreams of our "so creative" SS.... )
