Well .. as long as the "story" is told by a senior FDev ... any better fact ?

The problem is that everyone reads different things into that. I can, right now, give you several interpretations of that one little line (as can anyone here), and any could be what is "meant" by it, or all could be entirely wrong. Extend that across all the hints for Raxxla and everyone trying to interpret the hints and you've got... well, this thread actually.

Language is ambiguous. That's what makes it cool, but that's not the same as a fact.
