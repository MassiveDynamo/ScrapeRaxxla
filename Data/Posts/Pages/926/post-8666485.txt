Or looking again, the brain in the jar, the cell splitting post-it and the graph on the monitor....I am thinking human/thargoid hybrids...

Either that, or if you take the dino into the picture, one of the footfall planets is Jurassic world lol
Nah ...easier to suppose it will be "Jurassic Park" planet somewhere
They already said about 4th elite on stream. So that is visualization of that hour long talks.
I just hope they will copy creature generator like NMS has. NMS do pretty cool animals now, some NN accounts planet parameter and generates animals there. So we could get rid of limited options, like 10 brain trees now.
