Greetings fellow CMDRs , I just happened to be in that part of the neighbourhood and decided to try this out. Was testing out my newly engineered Exploraconda and two days later I find myself at Sagittarius A*. I tried lining myself up to Sol with the super massive between us and couldnt hear anything. Traveling in supercruise you can definately find a barrier that when crossed you begin to hear the whispers, I think this is the engines and space time dialation from the center. You can hear the same thing when you approach a station , but not close to this magnitude. This phenomena might be a way to detect something that doesnt show itself.

Whispers around Sagittarius A*

A little bit of an update. I may have jumped the gun. When I did this, I was just outside the exclusion zone to Sagittarius A. Like, literally. If I got close I'd have been ripped from Supercruise.

UNFORTUNATELY, after tinkering a bit with Sagittarius A, I've found its a sound that can be heard from it specifically, and doesn't actually have anything to do with Sol... Which was, and still is, disappointing... I thought I was on to something :/

I actually did record a snippet of it though, but it's through DVR do it's only 2 minutes.

Being that I only have Xbox and my Phone, I can't actually analyze the sound in any meaningful way.
