Really, REALLY strange sound in Sagittarius A.

If you place the super massive between yourself and Sol, you get this strange chittering sound mixed with what sounds like distorted jet planes landing, voices, a strange strumming, mixed with all sorts of atmospheric synthy stuff. To be honest? It creeps me out.

I'm not sure if this even relates to Raxxla, or perhaps the Landscape signal.

I'd do a recording, but I'm on Xbox, and lacking a PC, can't easily do an analysis of the sound to see if there's any images or anything.

My apologies if this had already been done.

Greetings fellow CMDRs , I just happened to be in that part of the neighbourhood and decided to try this out. Was testing out my newly engineered Exploraconda and two days later I find myself at Sagittarius A*. I tried lining myself up to Sol with the super massive between us and couldnt hear anything. Traveling in supercruise you can definately find a barrier that when crossed you begin to hear the whispers, I think this is the engines and space time dialation from the center. You can hear the same thing when you approach a station , but not close to this magnitude. This phenomena might be a way to detect something that doesnt show itself.
