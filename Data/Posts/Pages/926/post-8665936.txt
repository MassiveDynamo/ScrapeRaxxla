Sirens is an American metalcore band from Terre Haute, Indiana formed in 2011. They released their debut EP, entitled Spore, in June 2012, before releasing a remixed and remastered version of the EP via Imminence Records on November 13, 2012.

So all we need to do is find in the FSS through a BH and we are on the right track, or something?

Edit: debut EP, entitled Spore - Spore, Thargoids! It all makes sense!
