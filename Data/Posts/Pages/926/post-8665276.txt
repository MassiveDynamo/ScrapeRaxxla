A little bit of an update. I may have jumped the gun. When I did this, I was just outside the exclusion zone to Sagittarius A. Like, literally. If I got close I'd have been ripped from Supercruise.

UNFORTUNATELY, after tinkering a bit with Sagittarius A, I've found its a sound that can be heard from it specifically, and doesn't actually have anything to do with Sol... Which was, and still is, disappointing... I thought I was on to something :/

I actually did record a snippet of it though, but it's through DVR do it's only 2 minutes.

Here's the link: (gamerdvr)


Being that I only have Xbox and my Phone, I can't actually analyze the sound in any meaningful way.

I know how you feel as I'm on ps4. Imo its terribly negligent for fdev to have not given us a way to do this in game since its something that may need done like with the thargoid sensor pic
