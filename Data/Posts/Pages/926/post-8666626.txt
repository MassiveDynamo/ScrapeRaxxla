"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!"

I noticed a few people posted quite a few hundred pages back about Corona Borealis as a potential place because of the crown bit of the story, however there was no apparent link to "the mother of galaxies!" bit. The "Gemma" = "Jewel" for Alphekka/Alphecca fits, as would the brow with a crown.... The inescapable labyrinth is far too close to this mystery


SPOILER: FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THE STORY...


In terms of the constellation...
The constellation of Corona Borealis itself is small but recognizable, with only four stars brighter than magnitude 3.00. It was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century. Its brightest star is officially called Alphecca from the Arabic name for the constellation, although it is also known as Gemma, the Latin for ‘jewel’. Alpha Coronae Borealis is the brightest of the seven stars that make up Ariadne’s crown. It is an eclipsing binary star classified as an EA variable, with a period of 17.36 days. The star has an apparent magnitude that varies between 2.21 and 2.32. It is approximately 75 light years distant.


But there's still no "mother of galaxies" I hear you say, well not literally however there are quite a few galaxies in Corona Borealis...

"Abell 2065 is a highly concentrated galaxy cluster in the constellation of Corona Borealis containing over 400 member galaxies. The cluster is more than one billion light-years from Earth.On a larger scale still, Abell 2065, along with Abell 2061, Abell 2067, Abell 2079, Abell 2089, and Abell 2092, make up the Corona Borealis Supercluster."

And if not Alphecca (or Alphekka in game) for the jewel that burns on the brow, then Arcturus is quite close and really bright...



just a thought....
