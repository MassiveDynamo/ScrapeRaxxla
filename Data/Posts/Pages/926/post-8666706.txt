Gravity builds galaxies So it is the Mother. Also dynasty logs have sentence: "Gravity." Seems like "name" too.
In SG-1 it was some wording like "only 1 thing is certain - Universe is infinite" (don't recall exact). Point is ..if we're flying between stars, why should we recall ancient Earth myths ? That civilization should use some more generic knowledge, like infinite Universe.
