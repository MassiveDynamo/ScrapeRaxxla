So whats the status of the Raxxla mystery what all do we have for clues, hints, etc?
Not found.

There are clues in the codex and in the first post of this thread. There are probably many more hints in the game, but we don't know what's Raxxla and what's not.
There are endless speculations and hypothesis i this and other threads. Make your own and then disprove them. That's basically how this works.
