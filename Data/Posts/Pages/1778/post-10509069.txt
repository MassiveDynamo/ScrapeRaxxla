In the end we choose in what we believe. As for Raxxla the answers were always very cryptic, in my opinion the answers of someone who couldn't just outright say that there is no Raxxla in the game, or would otherwise ruin the whole point of spreading such rumors in the first place. But I agree with you, would make no sense for a developer to lead their community to believe in something that they never actually implemented in the game, but if you read Frontier Development's history you will find many questionable decisions.

I'm sure at the beginning they had some plans to implement this in the game eventually, such as plans to add ship interiors and other stuff they never did. And admitting it to the players would just "ruin" the whole Raxxla/TDW myth, not to mention bring forth the wrath of players such as ourselves who spent countless hours looking for something... that doesn't exist. In their view they are better off never discussing it at all, let the players think what they want and take no responsibility or commitment, which is what they have always done regarding this matter.
If you don't think Raxxla is findable then this isn't the right bit of the forum for you there's a lot of other places to discuss how Fdev didn't do stuff, and we already have Rochester here to fill that role XD
