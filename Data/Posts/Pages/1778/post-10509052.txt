Thank you for that affirmation. I agree I'd not seen anything else like it. I spent hundreds of days in pareco and only triggered the mission 3 times that I recall so it may take me a little while to trigger it again but will definitely document it this time, and try to notice the actual trigger. I'm pretty sure it started once I was allied to all the pareco factions but hostile to the one non-pareco faction.beyond that i don't know at the moment.

Sorry, when I get a moment I'll go back and find the questions. IMHO it's more about the station names matching the toast.
I reckon I'll give this a go after Cocijo pops, maybe before depending on how quickly I can build faction rep. It'll be worth checking if other players get the same results
