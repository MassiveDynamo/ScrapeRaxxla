4. Pareco station names are the answers to the six questions of the Raxxla toast - CROWN is the diadem; ASIRE (a sigh) is the whisper in witch space; James WEBB was the siren of the deeper void responsible for the foundation of NASA; the GARDEN (of eden) is the longing of our vagabond hearts (according to the song by Joni Mitchel) and so on.
6. The station ring orbits perpendicular to Polaris (Pole-star = Astrophel and the spiralling stars, seen from below) I assume Polaris is permit locked specifically to stop you easily getting the direction right.
7. The "Omphalos rift" = meaning the navel, would suggest that the access is in the centre of the ring. So I'm guessing you get to the comet and go up toward polaris; or possibly you need to go between comet 1 and comet 2, if anyone knows how to find them.

So. I became allied to all the Pareco factions, I loitered in the system, and I received an inbox "covert" mission directing me to steal data from a secure planetary base. (Blackman Silo+++ on HIP12248 5A) On successful completion of this mission, stealing the data that "we are not alone in the galaxy", I receive an on-screen message telling me that I am now considered "elite" - being a pre-requisite for joining TDW. I've done this 3 times so far. I know of no other system where a covert inbox mission gives you an on-screen message as a reward.

This is all very interesting - 4 and 6 especially, as well as just the general resemblance of the Pareco station orbits to the Raxxla picture in the Codex

Possibly this is where the Trinkets of Hidden Fortune / SAP 8 Core Containers come back in? Having unlocked something by doing the mission, you then need to be carrying those near the centre?
