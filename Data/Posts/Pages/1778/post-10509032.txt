I think what you found, if anything, was a bug. But I am very interested in seeing if you can repeat it and take a screenshot this time, the fact you've done it three times gives me hope you'll do it again and screenshot it so we can all see it. I've not heard about that text appearing before, and the phrasing of it is extremely strange. I've personally done thousands of missions all over the bubble, maybe more, as have many or most of the people on this thread- in fact Marcros started it by reporting on the missions he was doing... , so what you've reported is extraordinary.
Thank you for that affirmation. I agree I'd not seen anything else like it. I spent hundreds of days in pareco and only triggered the mission 3 times that I recall so it may take me a little while to trigger it again but will definitely document it this time, and try to notice the actual trigger. I'm pretty sure it started once I was allied to all the pareco factions but hostile to the one non-pareco faction.beyond that i don't know at the moment.

As for the rest: your entire theory revolves around Yuri Grom being present in a system with a comet.
Sorry, when I get a moment I'll go back and find the questions. IMHO it's more about the station names matching the toast.
