I totally agree. I'm 99% sure this is currently the engdame of the "Let's join the Dark wheel" portion of the game.

There's literally a lore beacon mentioning the Dark Wheel around the 8th moon of a gas giant in Shinrarta, almost like it's the placeholder for a Dark Wheel station.

I don't think it's a case of "never bothered to.." I think it's just there's nothing else to meaningfully add - what could Fdev add that would contribute to anyone's game any more than Jameson Memorial handing out DW missions and selling all the ships cheap?

If they want to expand on the Dark Wheel, the groundwork is there for the future!

From all the interviews and statements we got from FDev, it's more likely that all of this were meant as rumors, something for us players to crave for but never to be found. I don't think they expected players to actually want to find Raxxla ingame, or even join TDW. That TDW story is a nice lore for you reaching Elite rank and getting invited to Shinrartza. I just think at the very least they could have made a point of interest in Shinrartza you could find and visit with the old station, even if it was just another tourist beacon. At least we wouldn't be wasting our time looking for the 8th moon...

And now with Odyssey it would be the perfect opportunity for them to add a real station you sould dock and walk inside, and see those artifacts the Codex article talks about. Even if that was all there was for TDW and Raxxla, would be more than we got now.
