If you don't think Raxxla is findable then this isn't the right bit of the forum for you there's a lot of other places to discuss how Fdev didn't do stuff, and we already have Rochester here to fill that role XD
I've been part of this thread for several years now, did my part searching for it and now giving you my fair and honest opinion. Doesn't mean you have to agree or even like it, but might keep the expectations low to people reading this, which might not be a bad thing. I've seen people have mental breakdowns over this, just make sure you're having fun in the first place.
