It wasnt a bug, there was a powerplay scheme initiated by a group of players to move TDW faction out of Shinrarta. I think the idea was to move them into Tau Ceti or Sol etc and see if that triggered anything for Raxxla. The initiative should be searchable on the forum...

Ah. Ian's ninja'd me! It was indeed "Turning the Wheel"
That was the aftermath, TDW faction had already expanded out of Shinrartza at that point, although was only one system I think. So people tried to see if that was FDev's intention all along and tried what they could to trigger something by expanding TDW to other systems. Which we now know was all for nothing. I joined that event too, although I wasn't expecting anything to come out of it.
