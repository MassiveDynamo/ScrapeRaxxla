If it was important that TDW never expanded outside the system, then Frontier would probably have done something about it a lot sooner when the PF were expanding, rather than waiting the four years before TDW got a chance, and secondly would have fixed it when it occurred.
My point exactly. They didn't act on it because there was no point to it, since they never intended TDW to be more than it is now, a non-unique faction ingame. Hard to show you my sources for this, they are mostly from this thread and very difficult to find now, but it seemed that FDev did have some initial intentions with TDW, but if anything the fact that the faction in Shinrartza stopped giving out unique missions and eventually expanded out to other systems seemed to confirm they didn't care for it anymore.

But anything having to do with TDW and Raxxla is mostly speculation, and mostly irrelevant at this point. If there was something to be found or done with the The Dark Wheel faction in Shinrartza we would have found it by now. Any plans FDev may or may not had with it are buried by now.
