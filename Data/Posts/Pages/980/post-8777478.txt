tinfoil! Why Ch 4? they are British, we have a Channel 4 thats quite well known and CH4 News is as well. They could have gone for groovy hippy channel 27 or just a random one. Why choose one of the 5 terrestrial channels instead of just making something up so that 'any similarities between anybody or any organisation and any persons living or dead is purely coincidental'. is that not even considered anymore. Just seemed like the first thing Id have done is change the Channel to one that doesnt exist just in case, but maybe thats just me.
Very simple explanation for this one I’m afraid. Their Anchorman tribute wouldn’t work as well if they went with a different news channel to the one from Anchorman.
