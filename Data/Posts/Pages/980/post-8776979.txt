Raced superficially through this. I got: more ghost ships to be revealed over next weeks, Canonn hypothesis stated around 22 mins involves a discovery of barnacles. Comments about barnacles seems to support my initial feeling that this is leading up to Odyssey release where thargoids will be encountered on foot. Don’t think it’s in any way related to TDW or Raxxla, & don’t see any reason for FD to reveal these, but then I’m not really involved in it so could be wrong....
