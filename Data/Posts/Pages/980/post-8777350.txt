I'm not really a FPS player, too old & slow!
Did enjoy the Far Cry games, but have had version 5 for over a year & still not played it.
Perhaps I need to get my slippers on and a brandy poured...and open a good book
Wondering about going back to my CH Pro HOTAS, vice my current VKB Kosmosima; the twist grip is not helping.
