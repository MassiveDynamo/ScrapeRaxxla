Ah, I did wonder if they were including the currently known abandoned gen ships.
But I've always thought this game's story is mainly about Thargoids, & FD are clearly leading up to encounters on foot with them with Odyssey. My RSI, arthritis and old reflexes mean I may have to find something else to do after 5 years playing
In the meantime I'll still continue to quest for TDW and Raxxla, as best I can....
