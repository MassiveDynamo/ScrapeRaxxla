I’m beginning to go full blown Charlie Day tinfoil now complete with the wall of red string.

I’m grasping at straws for sure but of course my brain decided to “recognize” aka make up a pattern in some fluff Galnet articles as per usual.

Consuela Knight and Olav Redcourt articles both mention disappearances. Both stories end somewhat abruptly after the phrase Skyglow Havens on The Rhea Archipelago is mentioned. What is this place? Why did the authors mention it? Why not name the planet instead of the system in conjunction with the term archipelago.

Olav is famed for writing 14 out of 25 Corsair King books. (CK)
Consuela Knight (CK) went missing mid travel along with her crew only to be found at the Skyglow Havens in disguise then left when she was discovered. Skyglow Havens and CK.


The publisher for Corsair King, Bonespire Publishing (BSP) is also similarly abbreviated to Blackshadow Productions (BSP) another entity mentioned in the fluff article about Andromedaries.

Olav Redcourt stopped his tour suddenly from Blatrimpe to Procyon. Blatrimpe was also the location of a commodity drive for Maddox Hurd and Herculean Machines Duradrive another “fluff” article. Maddox Hurd was accused of taking money from the RED Family Cartel. Olav REDcourt. Maddox Hurd (MH). Olav’s Publicist Margaux Hist (MH). The FNS Neptune was found in Blatrimpe with seemingly no explanation. Neptune Ryder wanted to pursue Raxxla.

Yea I’ve lost it. My brain has short circuited disregard.
