Well, I'm still trying to decide where to go on my trip!
Treating the first two lines (only) of TDW toast as directions is a new (to me) idea that Cmdr IDrankWhat suggested recently; I'm ready to do another long journey, if necessary, but since TDW has been around for centuries, and their membership requirements seem (IMHO) unlikely to have changed, then any destination shouldn't be all that far away (old fsd range-limitations).

The first line could be a Carbon star (jewel that burns), and it seems common sense for it to be a significant body to form part of the TDW membership requirement (since they're a band of adventurers), but by common sense you must be able to return from the journey else it's a pretty useless membership requirement! No, the lore (!) suggests TDW don't know where Raxxla is (but that could be obfuscation), so there (currently, but I note the original existence of special Raxxla-related missions in SD, so maybe TDW have some clues....) seems to be two unrelated gameplay paths, Raxxla & TDW; in this thread we hedge our bets and attempt to get somewhere on either path.

My current ship is Deep Fernweh, one of the Rasalas fleet piloted by my young clone Tyko .
Currently sipping on a pre-dinner whisky; brandy as desert!

Sweols IL-Y e0 is the highest CN star above Sag A* so might be the target. There are NS and BH nearby, but can't see any higher up from the galactic plane which seemed at first thought to be the intent of the toast.

mmmm....Wonder if there's a carbon star nearer Sag A*....Don't think Sag A* itself fits, and I've been there, didn't see anything particularly obvious for the second line.

Of course this could be too much blue skies thinking. Sol/Earth has been suggested (Galnet) as being the jewel, so the second line could be a NS or WD quite close...LAWD 26 perhaps or Sirius??????
