Nope, Just plenty of Yorkshire tea - the best teabags
I doubt this game will follow suit to other FPS games out there though, i think it will be quite slow paced

Ah, Yorkshire tea, picked by t’hand o’ t’fair mill lasses near Ilkla Moor & trodden in t’tin baths wi’t cogs!

But, sad to say, they use plastic in their tea bags, hence I am buying no more. I now have a tea ball infuser and three packs of loose leaf teas. Protect the planet! It’s the jewel of the galaxy!
