But I've always thought this game's story is mainly about Thargoids, & FD are clearly leading up to encounters on foot with them with Odyssey. My RSI, arthritis and old reflexes mean I may have to find something else to do after 5 years playing

We are the first generation of gamers remember, as we get older the market becomes bigger and more tech may be brought out to tap into that so keep your hopes up. You did batter that Elite rank so give your hands a break rest

Edit: Im 20 years younger but we were the same first computer gamer generation just different ages in the early 80s.

Dunno how much FPS you played but some have assisted aim for Consoles due to massive disadvantage over mouse and keyboard. Some have assisted aim for all. Or join a team.
