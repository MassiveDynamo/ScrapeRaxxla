Are you all sextuple Elite?
CQC was mentioned as integral part of the lore at least since Salom√© assassination.
So, it probably counts like any other discipline for Pilot Federation ranking and thus TWD.
I mention that because most players would focus only on the three traditional disciplines of Trade/Combat/Exploration.
While it certainly was like that a long time ago, there's no reason to believe the requirements hasn't evolved to be stricter!
That said, I have zero experience in CQC myself
Im Elite V Explorer, Elite V trader and Elite II combat, i honestly think it makes no difference, my only goal was triple Elite because of rumors.
If i remember CQC was only in Premonition as a back story for one of the characters (Raan?), Elite rank, even single, is always described as a bit of a god like status.
In fact 'The old women' in her Cobra was the only one ever mentioned as being 'Elite' (as far as i remember).
Currently i have three things on the go, still looking at SOL and missing moons, still think its all linked to Black Holes and im still trying to get back out to Lyra's when i can to search for Guardian sites although the current D-2 story line has me distracted.

Other than that i have plenty of free time
