Are you all sextuple Elite?
CQC was mentioned as integral part of the lore at least since Salom√© assassination.
So, it probably counts like any other discipline for Pilot Federation ranking and thus TWD.
I mention that because most players would focus only on the three traditional disciplines of Trade/Combat/Exploration.
While it certainly was like that a long time ago, there's no reason to believe the requirements hasn't evolved to be stricter!
That said, I have zero experience in CQC myself
