Concretely, what you guys are doing in-game to find Raxxla or TDW?
Are you following any leads?
Best clue we've got for TDW station was the Brewer Corporation codex (last paragraph). That station in Tau Ceti is Ortiz Moreno City. It's an Orbis station. These are the stunning stations made largely of industrial grade plastics which are stronger than steel. You'll notice the distinct lack of FH 32 SPEC on these stations which identify steel for the hulls of ships, starships, stations, and fleet carriers.

Currently confirmed stations of this type are:

Tau Ceti | Ortiz Moreno City
Sol | Mars High
Sol | M. Gorbachev
Sol | Galileo (only confirmed Ocellus at present)
Beta Hydri | Black Mausoleum
Pi-Fang | Brooks Estate
Wyrd | Vonarburg Co-operative
Aymifa | Polya Coliseum
Aymifa | Hunziker Orbital
Aditi | PEW-1901
LHS 3006 | Leonard Nimoy Station
Alioth | Irkutsk
Gateway | Wicca Town

The above list is merely the confirmed ones and is not presently believed to be complete.

TDW may additionally be linked to the asteroid bases (A.K.A hermit stations). These likely required Dredgers to make these stations. These were likely built in the 2800s to early 3000s.

Other than this, looking into the Halsey vision as there is a notable visual effect associated with systems with blackholes that creates a "heavenly glow". Further, learning to work orbital installations towards a goal of opening galactic or Intergalactic rifts. Already have found sizable portions of the Talmor Lens. It is more learning how to operate the damn thing. This is sadly very dangerous work that involves creative circumvention.
