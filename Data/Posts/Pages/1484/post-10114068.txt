Im Elite V Explorer, Elite V trader and Elite II combat, i honestly think it makes no difference, my only goal was triple Elite because of rumors.
If i remember CQC was only in Premonition as a back story for one of the characters (Raan?), Elite rank, even single, is always described as a bit of a god like status.
In fact 'The old women' in her Cobra was the only one ever mentioned as being 'Elite' (as far as i remember).
Currently i have three things on the go, still looking at SOL and missing moons, still think its all linked to Black Holes and im still trying to get back out to Lyra's when i can to search for Guardian sites although the current D-2 story line has me distracted.

Other than that i have plenty of free time

Mmmm
“For several years, Salvation ran a private project to reverse-engineer a Guardian artefact which could store consciousness.”
Door that is also the key?
Gateway to the Guardian comms systems?
Sounds rather like the Utopian sim archive...
