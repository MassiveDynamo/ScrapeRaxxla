Concretely, what you guys are doing in-game to find Raxxla or TDW?
Are you following any leads?
I'm on my way to check a bunch of stars ("bright jewels"), and I'll conduct a search of a few system names inspired by ancient mythology. I look more specifically for a cross between a constellation (past or present, but more likely ancient), mythology (a mother of galaxies), and especially bright or hot star.
