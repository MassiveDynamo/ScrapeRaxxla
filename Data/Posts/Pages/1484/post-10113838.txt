Are you all sextuple Elite?
CQC was mentioned as integral part of the lore at least since Salom√© assassination.
So, it probably counts like any other discipline for Pilot Federation ranking and thus TWD.
I mention that because most players would focus only on the three traditional disciplines of Trade/Combat/Exploration.
While it certainly was like that a long time ago, there's no reason to believe the requirements hasn't evolved to be stricter!
That said, I have zero experience in CQC myself
Never touched CQC. I actually have a weird bit of logic to this: first Elite was combat. Pilot's Federation is founded 2805. However, we don't have anyone to our knowledge getting it before sometime in the 3100s and yet TDW exists prior (in all likelihood). Clearly, what was practiced for a long time was be so good that you fight infrequently.

Honestly, if you obey the laws the only quick way to get to Elite combat would be bounty hunting or out and out piracy. However, there is a non-trivial amount of circumstantial evidence to suggest TDW were either pirates, traders, or existed in the gray area between the two. I see this as a plot of the group that was more interested in fighting the aliens. Even living a mostly gray area between entirely legal and heavily illegal would be difficult to achieve Elite Combat or something like CQC without actively seeking to fight (especially if you were really skilled). Anyone who is highly skilled simply won't need to fight often enough to get the ranking.

I am an Elite Explorer and a large portion of the way to Elite Trader.
