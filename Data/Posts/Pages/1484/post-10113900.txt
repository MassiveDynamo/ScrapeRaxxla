I mean id love to have Elite CQC rank...but im not spending 2 hours sitting in the match making que just for it to never fill and drop, And Iv been told thers groups that come on and play at different times all of which iv joined at those times and still get maybe 1 or 2 games after leaving it to wait for a long time in the que....it needs an invite feature or bots otherwise il probably never go back
