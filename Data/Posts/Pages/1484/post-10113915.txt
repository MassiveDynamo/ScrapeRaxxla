I'm on my way to check a bunch of stars ("bright jewels"), and I'll conduct a search of a few system names inspired by ancient mythology. I look more specifically for a cross between a constellation (past or present, but more likely ancient), mythology (a mother of galaxies), and especially bright or hot star.
Other than that, I feel compelled to check every 8th moon I come across.
A bit silly maybe.
