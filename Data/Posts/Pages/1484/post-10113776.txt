Concretely, what you guys are doing in-game to find Raxxla or TDW?
Are you following any leads?
After spending a loooong time over the years investigating everything I can think of, and many things other's have thought of on these forums, and finding literally nothing at all (like everyone else here and the many thousands of people that have searched for collectively tens-of-thousands of hours), I've reached the conclusion that Raxxla is most certainly so well hidden that we won't find it without significantly more information than we currently have.

(read: Until Fdev want us to find it, which is not now.)

Until such a time, I'm just theorycrafting
