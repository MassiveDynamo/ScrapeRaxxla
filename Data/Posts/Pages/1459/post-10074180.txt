Ya i dont have data for those two.
just playing with the idea that raxxla is the origin planet for guardians so if we backtrack their spread…. I just keep reading what u wrote as “Raxxla is the guardian name for bacon” - now im hungry
I wormed the copawlot yesterday & was awaiting results. Made him sleep in the kitchen last night & got up early to take him in the garden at 06:30. Was tempted to make myself a bacon butty for breakfast, but decided to keep that treat for tomorrow’s lunch & had healthy porridge instead, with honey & blueberries
