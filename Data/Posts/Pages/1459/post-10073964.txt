Snakes on a spaceship, perhaps

Also, weren't Raxxlans supposed to have been reptilian? If so, maybe that was the snake inspiration.

Please tell me Elite Dangerous wasn't partly inspired by that nutcase David Icke and his Illuminati reptile-people. Granted, the first game manual is awfully damn fond of the term humanoid (and stranger still rarely substituted the term human).
Considering that the original game came out with the Dark Wheel Novella in 84 and Icke was doing sports news until 85 it's highly doubtful he was in any way an inspiration behind Raxxla and Raxxlans.
