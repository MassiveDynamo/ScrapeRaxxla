I liked the idea of looking at the Guardian Beacons - so I compared them with their associated structures (well at least the ones I could find)

SPOILER: BEACON FUN
Your diagram shows two beacons at top left corner with no associated structures?

Maybe they’re all Raxxla? Perhaps “Raxxla” is the Guardians’ name for a beacon, or a site?
