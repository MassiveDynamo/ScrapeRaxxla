I have an idea, though I think it's silly, but it's interesting:
You can only see RAXXLA in flight on Cobra Mk III.
Interesting idea but may need some refinement. That isn't the oldest ship by a long-shot. I believe in-service date was sometime in 3100. The following are known to be older: Viper (approx. 2762), Lakon Spaceways Transporter (Type-6 - pre-2500), Sidewinder Mk I (2982), Python (2700 - discontinued), Krait (3027), Cobra Mk I (2895), Boa (replaced Python - 3017), Lakon Spaceways Asp Mk II (2878), Lakon Spaceways Asp Mk I (unknown), Anaconda (2856), Adder (2914), and it is entirely possible that all Saud Kruger (original company history presently indeterminable) ships predate even Lakon Spaceways (specific origins unknown but linked to Sol) given the universality of Astrogator Console and the organization's ties to Augustus Brenquith.

Apparently, we should possibly be investigating why things connected the Underworld and Oceans are so damned ancient. The Cobra and especially the Cobra Mk III are known to be favored by The Dark Wheel. Perhaps there is a connection.
