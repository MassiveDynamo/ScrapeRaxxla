Your diagram shows two beacons at top left corner with no associated structures?

Maybe they’re all Raxxla? Perhaps “Raxxla” is the Guardians’ name for a beacon, or a site?
“You don’t know what it is!”

just playing with the idea that raxxla is the origin planet for guardians so if we backtrack their spread…. I just keep reading what u wrote as “Raxxla is the guardian name for bacon” - now im hungry
