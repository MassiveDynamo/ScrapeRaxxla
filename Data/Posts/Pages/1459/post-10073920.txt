In Elite 1 we played only Cobra mk3, in the novel Dark Wheel also had it. And I also heard on the forum, I don't remember exactly, but the creator of the game prefers to fly it. I don't know why.
Snakes on a spaceship, perhaps

Also, weren't Raxxlans supposed to have been reptilian? If so, maybe that was the snake inspiration.

Please tell me Elite Dangerous wasn't partly inspired by that nutcase David Icke and his Illuminati reptile-people. Granted, the first game manual is awfully damn fond of the term humanoid (and stranger still rarely substituted the term human).
