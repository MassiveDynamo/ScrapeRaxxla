I have an idea, though I think it's silly, but it's interesting:
You can only see RAXXLA in flight on Cobra Mk III.
Obviously, you need to build a Cobra MK III with exactly 7.0(00) Ly of jump range. Discard all these modern inventions, return to the origin and come back to the truth. Only then will you see the path before you.
