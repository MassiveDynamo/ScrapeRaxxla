I am thinking another pass at timelines is in order. Given recent discussion these appear to be the most likely candidate to have discovered Raxxla:

-Federation or Founder colony (early Federation discovery scenario).
-Lakon Spaceways/Galactic Navy
-Sirius Corporation (either Sol or in/near Sirius)
-Marlin Duval
-Marlinists
-Art Tornquist or family member
-Imperial Navy
-Gutamaya (dependent on founding date)
-Augustus Brenquith/Jaques (depending on timing of Battle of Hell's Gate - candidate battle is mentioned in both Federal and Imperial Navy codexes (Jaques is lying scenario).

Dredgers appear to not be an option given Scrivener University (later absorbed by Orion University) doesn't commission their dredger (J-403) until 3088. A quick review of the unofficial timeline of all games and books appears to indicate this may not be the first Dredger. However, earliest these are possibly built is still a disqualifier given the date is in the 2330s.
