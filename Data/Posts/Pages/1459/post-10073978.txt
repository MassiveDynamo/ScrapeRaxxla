Considering that the original game came out with the Dark Wheel Novella in 84 and Icke was doing sports news until 85 it's highly doubtful he was in any way an inspiration behind Raxxla and Raxxlans.
Sadly, the Reptile-people conspiracy got it's start from comics in 1929 which themselves were heavily influenced by Gnosticism and Theosophy (this plays at least some role in the myths and religious ideas in Elite Dangerous). These ideas seem especially connected with the "Revised Catholic Mission" in Aymiay. These folks apparently run Aymiay, Mars in Sol (the capital of the Federation is Olympic Village, Mars), and Beta Hydri, and thus way well feed into The Dark Wheel myth itself as they seem to connected with the palm tree stations and especially Black Mausoleum.

Relevant paragraph from Reptile-People Conspiracy Wikipedia entry:

Michael Barkun, professor of political science at Syracuse University, posits that the idea of a reptilian conspiracy originated in the fiction of Conan the Barbarian creator Robert E. Howard, in his story "The Shadow Kingdom", published in Weird Tales in August 1929.[9] This story drew on theosophical ideas of the "lost worlds" of Atlantis and Lemuria, particularly Helena Blavatsky's The Secret Doctrine written in 1888, with its reference to "'dragon-men' who once had a mighty civilization on a Lemurian continent".[10][11]

For the record: Robert Holdstock wrote some pretty wild stuff. I don't know what to feel after having had to cite cultural origins of that particular conspiracy theory. This is not something I expected to be brought into this. Oh well, the story is awesome.
