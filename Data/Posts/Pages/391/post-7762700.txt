Voyagers show up with the FSS scanner, despite them being half a million Ls out.

Look for "Ancient Probe" in the mission targets, lower frequency end scanner range.
Absolutely correct, I talked about old mechanics.
As for current version I think about two options - either Raxxla can be found with FSS under some unremarkable name (as a very distant HGE, for example) and therefore can be easily missed even in a fully explored system, or it's still hidden from scans and you must fly close enough to reveal it.
I incline to the version that Raxxla is somewhere in the Bubble or nearby, taking into account it was accessible in the early times of FSD technology.
