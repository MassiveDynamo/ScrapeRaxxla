it shouldn't be, if you look at the basic picture you natural reaction is that it is iris colour reflecting light from the candle. but it was stated in both books that Salome had deep black eyes. also the 3 points of light in the eyes are more less correct. yet that object just stands out as something, because drew even said the clue is in the picture. can't hurt to look deeper lol
