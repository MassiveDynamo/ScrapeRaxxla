well I have looked as best as I can at the image there does seem to be something green/blue reflected in the right eye, which does not follow the natural shape of the lens or iris which we all know are black. also the reflected object does not appear in the left eye just the 3 points of light are there. other than that I will go back to the amateur corner as I do not have the resources to probe further plus it could be a wild goose chase. good luck I will stay quiet now
