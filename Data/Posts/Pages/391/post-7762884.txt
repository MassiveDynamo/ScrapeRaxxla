I said the same thing but without evidence, so I got thrown in the naughty corner

We stopped using the naughty drawer, Elf n Safety objected. So nowadays we use a naughty step on the stairs

No, it doesn’t work for my grandkids either!

I don’t remember the quote, but then I tend not to watch livestreams etc. If anyone can find the source Macros will add it to the first page reference list.

P.S. DW2 was a blast, arrived at Beagle Point yesterday & also got my EDSM 500kly total travelled and 64kly from Sol badges so a good day. Just started my return journey, though Jorki will be going to Colonia leaving Tyko to progress the Quest in the bubble.
