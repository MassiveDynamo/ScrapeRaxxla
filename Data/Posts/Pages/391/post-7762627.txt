Most probably you are correct. I think it behaves like Voyagers and will reveal itself in contacts in close proximity only. In this case it can be in any system, even in the Bubble or nearby.
Voyagers show up with the FSS scanner, despite them being half a million Ls out.

Look for "Ancient Probe" in the mission targets, lower frequency end scanner range.
