Yes the binary graphical effect doesn’t seem to distort against perspective nor alignment. As a potential lens flare it ought to.

Again this could just be due to graphical application of a cut-n-paste layer, much as like any star ejection animation, which effectively is just a 2d element which rotates based on your view, even though they ought not to - being thousands of miles long…

The first time I saw that interdiction process I thought there’s a code there…
