just a thought...

"the eighth moon of an unnamed gas giant" - I've never read "unnamed" as "doesn't have a name" before.... always read it more as "secret"....

not sure it makes any difference but thought it would note it
"Unnamed" could mean it has a generic name like "285 col sector".
It just doesn't have a name.
