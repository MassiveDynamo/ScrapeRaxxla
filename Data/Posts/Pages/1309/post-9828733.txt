Wasnâ€™t there supposed to be a research lab out in Colonia studying Thargoids, their tech and developing a Universal Translator??
I don't remember. The Alliance / Turner / Argent had one, in FFE. It's quite possible that it exist in ED as well. Not as a component we can outfit though.

The Alliance may be secretly communicating with the Thargoids, right now. Thargoids could be attacking just to prepare us for the Klaxians.
