Jupp. GalCop had a list of places you were allowed to go, PF has a list of places your not allowed to go.
Ah, that’s because the PF is run by a Guardian who wants to protect humanity from: Thargoids, Rogue human AI, Rogue Guardian AI, and something else that’s alien and nasty (exactly how many sectors are locked off?) until we’re ready to face them!
Mm, might be the Pizza-eating Big Bird Monster!
Though come to think of how many Easter Eggs I didn't receive this year, it could be the Easter Bunny!
