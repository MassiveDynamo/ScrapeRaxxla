Mmm
So perhaps we have to trigger off a particular storyline that invokes TRDW and then Raxxla?
Though I suspect it would start in Shinrarta...
Well that would be applicable if there was a game mechanism to activate; but by my hypothesis it would seem it may not. If correct (and it stands to reason I maybe also equally wrong) then the DW storyline can only ever be activated by FD at a time which suits their narrative. Ergo it’s a cul-de-sac and there is no point looking for it, as it’s equally likely FD will issue some form of indication when it is available.

My only worry is this also equates to Raxxla. By DB own vernacular, something can be in the game but also not, when it’s only accessible within the galaxy map.
