Trinkets and their description always made me think of an RNG. Wouldn’t hurt to tow a few along wherever you are.

If they actually still do something, it’s likely only to be in one particular area, and given the game mechanics probably either linked to trading or piracy - eg getting someone’s attention?

Have we listened to them?
