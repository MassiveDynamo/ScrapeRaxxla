Just realized BigSix (the audit firm) may be coded language referencing Raxxla. The codex image linked to Raxxla - note the 6 dark sections. Seriously, need to figure out what the hell this thing represents. Is this Omphalos Rift? Though, in a way it looks like an Orbis. In any case, Femi Dakarai clearly found something he wasn't supposed to have found and was removed.

I've seen some patterns with the number 6, when it comes to Raxxla, the logo and the pole axis of the ecliptic (Axis mundi?).

The word:

If we assign numbers to each letter we get: 18 1 24 24 12 1.
18, 24 and 12 are all multiples of 6. The ones don't quite fit unless we use them as separators. then it becomes interesting.

18 | 24 + 24 +12 | = 18 and 60

The north pole of the ecliptic is RA 18.0.0 DEC 66°.33 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_pole

The logo: The logo is full of sixes. Six rays, six sides, six black shapes with six sides each. In the middle we have the symbol for Sol. Then there are three arcs. Possibly an orbit line for the third planet (earth).
The only thing that does not fit the six pattern are the dots in the inner hexagon. There are 33. Just what we need to get the exact declination 66°.33.

The ecliptic axis north pole is in Draco (the dragon), almost exactly at the Cat's eye nebula (for those with eyes to see). The stars will spiral around this point as the stars rotate around the pole star (currently Polaris) and the pole star rotates around the ecliptic pole. A wheel on the rim od a wheel.

The south pole of the ecliptic is in Dorado, at RA 6 DEC -66°.33. This is on the edge of the Large Magellanic cloud ( 'an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven' ). It would fit well to have the gate to Hell (and Heaven?) located at 6 -66.

Still need some distances, but I think it's fairly likely that this is the Omphalos axis.
