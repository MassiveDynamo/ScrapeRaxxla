Cabassones?
I've had no luck finding Trinkets in Hecae or Plendovii...
I forgot the system name but it was one word that ended in Jedi. It's less than 40LY from Ahti (one jump in my Courier, which can do about 36LY with all the cargo and equipment I have fitted). I found it by setting the Galmap to show only anarchies.

Today I finished visiting the belt clusters in HIP 114458 and moved on to Cibola, though in between I noticed an orbital installation called 'Hidden Universe Casting' in Idung Yin and paid it a visit. I found no tunnels there and no odd symbols on the superstructure.

Cibola has an ELW called 'Keytree', which has a moon, Quivira, which is interesting but I mapped both, also the outermost gas giant (there are only two planets in the system) and visited all four belt clusters and found nothing interesting.

As I'm not so sure about looking in an inhabited system I visited some named systems with no population, although I also mapped a couple of ELW with mythological names.
I visited Kvenland and Damara and both were empty, without even belt clusters. The ELWs I mapped were Arawn, in Annwn (another 1-planet system), Boreas in Hyperborea and Kipper's Retreat in Avalon (another Persephone station in this system, also a Coriolis called Noctilux).

I still feel like I'm looking in the wrong way - if all it took was dropping into belt clusters, it would surely have been found long ago (in theory by NPCs)? Very distant planets with moons might be a better bet, as something might only show up if a body is mapped or flown close to. It's as if I already need to know to look for it in a certain place or I have an astronomical needle in a haystack problem.
