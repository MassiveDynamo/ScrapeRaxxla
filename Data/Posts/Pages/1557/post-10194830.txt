Lets not forget Femi Dakarai
Femi was investigating Project Dynasty, in Elite Dangerous: Premonition (e.g. pages 133 and 138). Seems he had an Imperial Eagle rigged for Buckyball racing, which is what Raan Corsen used to try and deliver data MetaDrive had on it to Bill Turner rather than letting it fall into the hands of Sirius Corp.
