This afternoon I dropped in on all the belt clusters of the B Belts of the B stars in Quivira and HIP 114458. I also mapped the gas giant with rings (planet B2) in Quivira and the 8th moon (B 2 h) in HIP 114458. Nothing unusual to report.

It is very easy to burn out doing this kind of searching. I'll do the A Belt of the B star in HIP 114458 next time I log in.

A part of me feels uneasy that Raxxla might be lurking in a belt cluster, especially if the belt cluster is in an inhabited system. I can understand it not being found if it is millions of Ls into deep space but these belts are surely being mined by NPCs and right after I drop in there is usually a NPC or three following me.

I feel that I am looking in the wrong way, even if I am in the right region of space.
Asteroid belt clusters are easy to search, but the difficult thing is searching GG planetary rings. They’re huge, and if you need to drop out of SC within 50km (instancing distance for comets) to trigger the “Omphalos Rift” to download Raxxla then I can’t see we have a cat in the Underworld’s chance! So Ive given up on that possibility for the moment and am trying another hypothesis.
