Some interesting thoughts there compadre!!

Edit
Though the central dot and circle might not represent Sol...stars are dots in the night sky, and a circle surrounding a star was the centre of Hecate’s Strophalos wheel (though admittedly it was usually drawn as a six-pointed star, but maybe MB thought that would be over-egging the six theme?), so I’m not finished with Hecate yet.

@Rochester : wrt Artemis in Legacy...Wikipedia says “The Romans knew her (i.e. Hecate) by the epithet of Trivia, an epithet she shares with Diana/Artemis, each in their roles as protector of travel and of the crossroads (tri-via, "three ways"). “

Though I like Han_Zen’s 6-fold hypothesis, it seems to make a little more sense than a duplicated Y-junction for the spokes of the logo. So how is the Hecate system located wrt the “Omphalos Rift axis” that Han_Zen has mooted?
‘Three faces’, ‘six arms’ = triad goddess, Central dot = omphalos; hexagon = hexagram (six older gods)?
