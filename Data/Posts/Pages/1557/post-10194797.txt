Some interesting thoughts there compadre!!

Edit
Though the central dot and circle might not represent Sol...stars are dots in the night sky, and a circle surrounding a star was the centre of Hecate’s Strophalos wheel (though admittedly it was usually drawn as a six-pointed star, but maybe MB thought that would be over-egging the six theme?), so I’m not finished with Hecate yet.

@Rochester : wrt Artemis in Legacy...Wikipedia says “The Romans knew her (i.e. Hecate) by the epithet of Trivia, an epithet she shares with Diana/Artemis, each in their roles as protector of travel and of the crossroads (tri-via, "three ways"). “

Though I like Han_Zen’s 6-fold hypothesis, it seems to make a little more sense than a duplicated Y-junction for the spokes of the logo. So how is the Hecate system located wrt the “Omphalos Rift axis” that Han_Zen has mooted?
Just some observations on the appearance of the number 6. Sure there are more clever ways to explain the numbered letters of Raxxla. The most convincing part for me, is that it finally gives a reason for the 33 dots on the logo. It's also an Omphalos point, that would have been the same 10 or twenty thousand years ago.

As you know I don't believe that the position of any named system is relevant. The systems are named by locals, not by some omnipotent, Raxxla knowing, star chart lord. The names of the systems rather tells us which stories we might benefit from knowing.

The three way junction is in this picture as well, isn't it?
