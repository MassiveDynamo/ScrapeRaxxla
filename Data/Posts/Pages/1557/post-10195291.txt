I am sorry if this has been asked before, but I have only been following the quest for Raxxla from afar, even though it has intrigued me since I first read about it.
Has anyone checked Lagrange points relative to stations of interest? Specifically, I'm going to check Earth L3 tonight because it seems too obvious, but I imagine it could make sense for Lave station as well. It just seems like an obvious place to look for a "Dark Wheel", with the position being in the dark spot on the wheel of planetary orbits. The hexagon of the icon fits the L3, L4 and L5 positions - with non-lagrangians at the other spokes of the "wheel".
Is there any in-game indications that you reach a lagrange point? Are there groups of asteroids or something?
There are often some phenomena at some Lagrange points, mostly gaseous clouds with life forms inside but also the lightning-like "anomalies".
