According to Inara (I do miss EDDB!) he two nearest anarchies to Ahti are Cabassones at 39ly and Nidarijedi at 48ly.

Yes, I don’t believe Raxxla is hidden in an asteroid belt. A GG planetary disc I can believe cos they’re so huge and difficult to properly search (& fits in with what Will said). But the alternative might be to carry a Trinket or several and look in the correct place.
It was Nidarijedi.
I spent close to 30min at the nav beacon, scanning the hold of everything that passed through (fast scan really helps here). My hatch breaker limpet controller is a 1A, as this has only a 10sec wait to break open the cargo hatch. Some ships don't survive for long or try to run and jump, so the shorter wait for the A class module is worth the extra mass.

I'm glad I'm in my Courier now - the speed is handy for escaping scans whilst carrying illegal cargo

I agree that a planetary ring system is a good place to put something if you don't want it found. The rocks do orbit the planet, so the only fixed spots that can be reliably dropped in on are the mining hotspots. A large enough object might, like a station, be visible as a point that could be approached and dropped in on close enough to be within reasonable normal space flight range. That would require a visual survey and such a location might be missed if it was in the shadow of the planet. I wonder about a ringed moon of a gas giant might make it easier to look for something like this, as outermost moons of gas giants do sometimes have rings.
So I might be looking for ringed eighth moons... that certainly narrows it down a bit, especially if looking around the 'underworld region'.
Optimism rising again (and prepared for the corresponding disappointment but still worth checking out).
