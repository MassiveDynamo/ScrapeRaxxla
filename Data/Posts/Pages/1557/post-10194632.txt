Picking through Holdstocks Lost Realms, and I’m focusing on how certain names are grouped together.

I’m going to attempt and replicate this in game, this may add a few more ‘sectors’ eg ‘Holdstocks Eden’s’ or ‘Lands of youth’ etc.

One thing struck me on an initial search, is a few systems (I need to tally and cross check this - so totally tin-foil) have references to other myth, eg a planet named after a god, or more interestingly ‘mountains’.

@GURU-951 you touched upon a mountain theory in the past. I believe this still has some relevance, as I wonder if it’s some form of identifyer?

Brookes used the term several times in his blogs about mountains. Elite Legacy also referred to Saxon mountain men, and Lost Realms also mentioned ‘world mountains’…it’s likely just another clue towards Yggdrasil but I wonder if it’s more like an identifying signature?
I can confirm that with a DSS will find many crashed ships, along with other intriguing features like suspect system descriptions, tourist beacons, strange planet and station names, and lore locations in the search for planets named after actual mountains on Earth or unique named planets in general. To me crashed ships present is likely a sign that that system might be important to some degree, maybe as a check mark on some imaginary list. Though I think this will be rather useless, I'll share my spreadsheet here of the ones I came across many years ago, but I warn you it's rather all over the place.
