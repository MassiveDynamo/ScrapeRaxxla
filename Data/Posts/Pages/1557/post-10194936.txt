The ecliptic axis north pole is in Draco (the dragon), almost exactly at the Cat's eye nebula (for those with eyes to see). The stars will spiral around this point as the stars rotate around the pole star (currently Polaris) and the pole star rotates around the ecliptic pole. A wheel on the rim od a wheel.

The south pole of the ecliptic is in Dorado, at RA 6 DEC -66°.33. This is on the edge of the Large Magellanic cloud ( 'an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven' ). It would fit well to have the gate to Hell (and Heaven?) located at 6 -66.

Still need some distances, but I think it's fairly likely that this is the Omphalos axis
Have to admit i do like this axis if we are using Sol as a point on it. But ya - im partial to the Tarantula Nebula in the LMC as a good candidate for our southern axis point.
