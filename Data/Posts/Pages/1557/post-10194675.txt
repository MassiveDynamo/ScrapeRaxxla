Lost Realms and the Older Gods

I’ve just located a new moon goddess in game thanks to Holdstocks Lost Realms, found whilst scrutinising chapter 1 Avalon.

‘Epona’, queen of horses, Holdstock calls her a moon goddess and associates her with King Arthur.

Now Epona is in the correct ‘lost realm’s’ area in game, but just a little wide of the mark for my liking.

Not sure ultimately if this is related or not, but what’s of interest to me is that during my previous searches of this sector I actually found numerous deities which I could not align, but which were suspicious, in their proximity to this region.

Now one thing to remember, which might be relevant, in relation to Paradise Lost John Milton, actually re-used non-Christian gods eg Celt/Saxon/Asian etc, as demons, this was not intended as an insult, but these ‘older gods’ were actually represented in Paradise Lost as higher fallen archangels like Lucifer, as Milton was trying to contextualise historical religion to fit or flesh out his own fictional universe (rather clever).

One thing which just came to me, is what if these ‘older gods’ are actually relative in game but that they are used to outline this region?

*note these are singular gods not a pantheon, which I why I thought it relevant.

My initial assumption being they are actually representing Michael Brookes Older Gods!

Note this does need further confirmation, this is just one of many which need to be better mapped and correlated, and I’m taking my time scrutinising Holdstocks Lost Realms, so it’s just tin-foil.
