There are often some phenomena at some Lagrange points, mostly gaseous clouds with life forms inside but also the lightning-like "anomalies".
I would disagree with “often”. Those Non-Stellar Phenomena do occur at Lagrangian Points but are definitely not common.

@bakwards Other than the NSP mentioned above, there is no indication of arriving at an LP. Ive checked out various LP, especially in Sol. Never found anything other than NSP mentioned above (which in any case appear on the ship’s nav panel), but that’s no proof that there’s nothing there. There is an LP online tool that is useful, you need to insert the masses of the two bodies then in-game fly to the point at the correct distances from those bodies.
