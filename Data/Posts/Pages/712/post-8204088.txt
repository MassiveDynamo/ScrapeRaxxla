(Raxxla was originally found by a group of ancient Indo-Europeans, and they adopted the name into their language. Probably the Guardian Ark ship. This probably happened in the month of Thargelion, probably somewhere around Tarshish. A bit overreaching perhaps. That is why it's the another etymological origin. My yoga instructor told me this.)

Watched video 10 times and except spinning Thargoid could not find relation to Raxxla? Rakhi?
