I'm getting the impression that there are people here being intentionally misleading again or I could just be paranoid from not having enough tinfoil but I think it's the first thing I said
Idk how that would be the case. In order to mislead someone you have to know where/what youâ€™re trying to lead them away from is. Unless they know the location of Raxxla/TRDW idk how they could be misleading.
