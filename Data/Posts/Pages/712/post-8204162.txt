Does anyone if these have data besides intel for money. Maybe like a tourist beacone type data. This ship was cloaked until basically a few inches from it. And had this odd broken pod next to it. Sadly, I don't have anything to scan his cargo and stuff. I don't have a dedicated bounty ship yet.

Haven't heard of that pirate faction, but it's not in this system. And the beacons mention pirates as part of the beacon info. Might not be a coincidence.

Are we sure we don't have hidden pirate groups out in deep space like in the X series or freelancer?(Can't remember which had that.)
