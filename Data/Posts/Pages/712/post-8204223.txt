Only thing Noobilite left out is the other Pilots Federation Secrecy tourist beacon 0247 which basically describes PF as a many ways a secretive organisation which you would have to register for. The PF represents law in uncontrolled and ungoverned space.

Personally I never found anything of interest in those tourist beacons.

I was at those tourist beacons, and was snooping around the 'blue' spot on my radar on the surface when I received the Job Offer mission from an ally of TDW. Could be complete coincidence, or not...unfortunately I failed the mission. So will attempt a repeat as soon as holidays/work allows.
