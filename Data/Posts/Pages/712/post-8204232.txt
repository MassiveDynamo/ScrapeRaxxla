I just got one also and a mission beacon in the system from one of the in system things. It was officlally to help the federation though. I wonder if it's related to the things in the beceacon about PF being apolitical and TDW in essence being on a short leash. maybe we haven't triggered something yet.

If TDW is like a dark side of TPF then that would make sense, even though this isn't directly from TDW. But a fed faction in SD... So, who knows.

Although I'm notsure if the beacon in SD that is mission related is realted to the remotely given mission. (checking now)

Another interesting fact. The tourist beacons refer to PF not TPF. PF was mentioned several times in this thread as the name of the thing gained from inivislbe stats from rescue and or thargoid activity. Might not be a coincidence. Maybe we are looking for the real PF or EPF.

Mission: (it was seperate)

Interstingly related to rescue potentially. I wonder if it give the invisible PF rank credit.
