Here's an interesting beacon...

It directly says TDW is related to PF....

There is absolutely no mystery to the dark wheels location if this is accurate. Or if how I'm taking this information is accurate. Potentially game stated fact!!

BTW, the description about Fake TDW's being removed by the real DW in the Codes is the almost the exact description this gives about PF removing TDW if it gets out of line. I think PF is the real DW. I think PF is the real DW without question. This is the giveaway! Now is there a separate EPF(Elite pilots federasion) for raxxla? That might tell us where Raxxla is if it's different. I think this is the real in game clues for finding this stuff.

BTW, the line of planetary Tourist beacons takes you directly to the 8th moon of a gas giant around a star that happens to be the first base of TDW!(Puleston Arsenal) These beacons also give the history of TDW and PF and it's connections to Jameson and pilot ranking origins and pirates etc.. Giving the history of the last games connecting it to ED.
