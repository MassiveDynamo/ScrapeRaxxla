Only thing Noobilite left out is the other Pilots Federation Secrecy tourist beacon 0247 which basically describes PF as a many ways a secretive organisation which you would have to register for. The PF represents law in uncontrolled and ungoverned space.

Personally I never found anything of interest in those tourist beacons.
