The text goes into how jameson was the first to find it and how eventually he became elite to make the ranks. The descriptions on one use wording that is also how DW is described.

You have to click on the pic and it will enlarge it and make it readable.

EFP(tEFoP) is TDW. The real dark wheel.

BTW, some of the names of ships in SD are interesting. One was Bae haven or something. His name was hydra. It was a transport ship so maybe related to things.
clicking on the pic enlarged it and made it even harder to read because of how blurry it got But seeing how it's right there in shin dez. I can go read it later
