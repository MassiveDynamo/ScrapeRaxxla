Speculation:
There might be many ways to get the first real clue to Raxxla.

This could be one of them:
1. Reach Elite status
2. Find a crashed ship from a random mission during a The Dark Wheel courier mission.
3. Retrieve the first lead that might be a clue to the start of the Raxxla end game story.

I still believe that the quest for Raxxla will be a mission given at current end game status. But also ever evolving leading further, deeper and more interesting as Elite progresses and updates over the decades to come.

Permit for all the secret places in the Bubble might be a clue.
