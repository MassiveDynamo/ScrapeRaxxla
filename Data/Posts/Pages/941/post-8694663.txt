yeah usual flavour text, the inbox message will disappear on relog, implies to me its nothing more than flavour. Very interested to read Zulu actually meant something at all. Makes me think all the others do as well, have a basis in RL, and seemingly often in Shipping or British Navy.

Verified - flavour text.

I just logged in, and you're spot on Vetinari the message is gone.

A bit disappointed. It's little things like this that would add a great deal to the game if used properly and there was a way for a player to use them, even if it was to get something more from a nearby entity/base/location/crash etc.

Anyway, time to smash my Allied status with TDW and bring on the rise of Nuenets Blue Crew this weekend!
