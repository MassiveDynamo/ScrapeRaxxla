Same here. I think we suffer from ps4-ism.

I think Mick' is on XB, if not theres a namealike who has killed me in CQC more times than I care to remember. Consoles in general we do accept a lower outcome dont we, 'oh, this probably works on PC' is what i often think.

try GalMap, zoom in on Sol and look around, theres not that many Constellations actually but they should be there, sure Ive seen them on XB but havent looked recently, so an update can always change things. I thought I had to be in Sol but apparently not as long as the GalMap is zoomed in on Sol so youre looking 'out'. Ill try it next time Im on and see if I can replicate.
