I just logged in, and you're spot on Vetinari the message is gone.

A bit disappointed. It's little things like this that would add a great deal to the game if used properly and there was a way for a player to use them, even if it was to get something more from a nearby entity/base/location/crash etc.

Anyway, time to smash my Allied status with TDW and bring on the rise of Nuenets Blue Crew this weekend!

I’d like to see what happens if someone becomes an enemy of all the major powers. Seems TDW is against pretty much everyone. I don’t have the fire power to stave off the bounty hunters myself. But I may give it a go.
