I’d like to see what happens if someone becomes an enemy of all the major powers. Seems TDW is against pretty much everyone. I don’t have the fire power to stave off the bounty hunters myself. But I may give it a go.
I'm sort of heading towards that thinking, and have the fire-power to handle the intercepts.
I just paid off a 3M bounty on my Vette after my last berserk gaming session from a while back, and cashed in 30M of bounties across varied groups at the same time.

First thing will be to ally with NBC, and others directly opposed to TDW in SD. Sort of reverse Operation Less Than Three.

I'm also thinking as a personal journey to complete the Ram Tah Guardian missions, as I suspect there might be soft triggers for getting an invite to qualifying as a 'legendary explorer, adventurer etc'.
