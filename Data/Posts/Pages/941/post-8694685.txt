I'm sort of heading towards that thinking, and have the fire-power to handle the intercepts.
I just paid off a 3M bounty on my Vette after my last berserk gaming session from a while back, and cashed in 30M of bounties across varied groups at the same time.

First thing will be to ally with NBC, and others directly opposed to TDW in SD. Sort of reverse Operation Less Than Three.

I'm also thinking as a personal journey to complete the Ram Tah Guardian missions, as I suspect there might be soft triggers for getting an invite to qualifying as a 'legendary explorer, adventurer etc'.

I think the same honestly. That or become triple elite (currently double) and verify all discoveries in all sectors. I mean; if being triple elite AND having seen all there is to see (since TDW were formed by elite explorers) doesn’t get TDW’s attention I’m not sure anything will.
