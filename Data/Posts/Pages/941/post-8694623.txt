I think Mick' is on XB, if not theres a namealike who has killed me in CQC more times than I care to remember. Consoles in general we do accept a lower outcome dont we, 'oh, this probably works on PC' is what i often think.

try GalMap, zoom in on Sol and look around, theres not that many Constellations actually but they should be there, sure Ive seen them on XB but havent looked recently, so an update can always change things. I thought I had to be in Sol but apparently not as long as the GalMap is zoomed in on Sol so youre looking 'out'. Ill try it next time Im on and see if I can replicate.
No I'm on ps4, I made the mistake 20+ years ago and bought a Sega saturn instead of the first Playstation and been dedicated Sony customer ever since. There are actually a few filthymicks on ps4. I'm sad I had to put numbers in my name since I'm probably the oldest of them (guessing)
