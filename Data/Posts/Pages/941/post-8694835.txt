Got a tad of an anomaly idk if anyone has checked out before. I’m currently in GLUDGOE NC-B C27-31 and out my left window is the bubble nebula. Out my right and behind me is the heart and soul. However, ahead of the heart and soul by a bit is a string of dense luminous stars like the kind of string you see coming through certain nebula like the Orion Neb. However, search as I may there is no nebula there.

Not in-game to check, but It will likely be either NGC7822 or IC1805 (the Broken Heart nebula, though it’s in the wrong place. iRL its within the Heart neb and the light is blowing the “hole in the heart”). I searched most of the larger stars in both, they are spectacular. NGC7822 lies between the bubble and Heart & Soul, IC1805 lies not far past that. But there are plenty of star clusters in-game that will appear to be in a string (because the astronomical input data is fairly inaccurate on distance from Earth).
