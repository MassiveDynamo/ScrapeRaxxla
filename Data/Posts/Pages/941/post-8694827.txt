This is a favourite past time of mine, I'll have to upload a video of it. Skim the exclusion zone around the BH while in SC and it transforms everything around you into a swirly weird trip-fest. You can keep it going and watch things like Andromeda or other galaxies, nebula, and the galactic arm swirl around you. I believe I've tried this with Thargoid probes, links, hearts, sensors and trinkets of hidden fortune in my hold. The latter most definitely, but I have taken the other items into the black hole...I can't get passed the exclusion zone with them though and, when jettisoned, they do not go into the black hole. I want to try an Ancient Key and other Guardian items next.

A recent hypothesis of mine had me trying all the Guardian artefacts at exclusion zine & barycentre of binary BH. But good luck, you might find Raxxla!
