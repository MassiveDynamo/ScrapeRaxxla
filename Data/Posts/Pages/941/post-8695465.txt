Wasn't the lass who was kidnapped in love with someone else? Or someone else loved her, not the underworld guy? (How to be vague in Classics, Miss R was right I wasnt paying attention)

Anyway, time to smash my Allied status with TDW and bring on the rise of Nuenets Blue Crew this weekend!

What? Right now? Are you aware of the Turning The Wheel thread / forum community goal? We are trying to push DW to Sol & Lave and could do without the anti-DW effort right now if thats not too much to ask? If you havent seen it join us and try this later maybe? There are rumours that something may happen. (or at least that fdev may be aware of it, the rest is hope and the video got lost so we cant see exactly what was said - Obfuscation in the outer rim)

If not no worries, gotta blaze your own trail
