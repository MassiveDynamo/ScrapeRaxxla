That sounds like a real hobby! Something to do. Makes you think about meaning in life. I mean, I've been just drinking coffee and watching cat videos on Youtube for the past hour. Maybe some Ancient Greek poetry on Saturday.

Yes I once did it for about 30 minutes straight. I also do this to various black holes, to see what the different back drops look like. From what I've found it's best in either a Viper III or Clipper (something manueverable in supercruise), as even in my Phantom I bounce/ sling out of the skimming zone and have to double back to find the edge of the exclusion zone. But a Viper III can keep it going the entire time. It does make you dizzy and I suspect I would puke in VR lol.

There is something weird though, which makes me wonder if there's something more to this mechanic. Once you circle the exclusion zone, in supercruise, your throttle becomes touchy. So like if you exit the area and look black at the black hole you'll already be about up to 1Km from it, and where normally you could approach the black hole with you throttle just below the blue zone, at a nice controlled speed, once you've been in the vicinity of it? You can't even set throttle to one bar on your throttle gauge. One bar immediately slings you past it...and you may already be over 1K from it.
