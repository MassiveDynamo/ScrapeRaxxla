I’ve found it!! There’s a big ole string of very luminous stars like B and O class out here. One of them is 2MASS J02341820+6147375. It’s like a line that’s typically associated with a nebula but there is none here. Idk if it’s been searched before. Granted it’s on the way to the FR but one thing I’ve learned out here is the path to the FR isn’t as explored as you may think.
