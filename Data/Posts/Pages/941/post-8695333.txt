thats the one, and the sirens (which are usually bird like at this point) cried a pool of tears that formed some river or something. But in one version they live in a pool (maybe bottomless, maybe = deepest void) and cried over the edge.

Do we have any Greeks here? Do you see what your ancestors started!? I hope you're pleased with yourselves!

Ah yes, but Demeter, like Anticlea, is the mother rather than her grief or its cause. It’s either poor grammar or poetic licence. I really never did like poetry (except maybe the Ancient Mariner)!
And I’m still stuck for Lover’s Woe...
