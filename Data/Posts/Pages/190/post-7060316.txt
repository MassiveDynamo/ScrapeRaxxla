Dr Who (Jodie Whittaker) is from Huddersfield, or thereabouts.

Jodie and I (and Lena Heady - Cersei Lannister / new Sarah Connor) went to the same school - Shelley High

I don't remember Lena but we aren't that different in age so were probably there at the same time. Jodie is much younger, obviously.
