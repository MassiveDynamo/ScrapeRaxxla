"Ket" = rubbish in Yorkshire dialect. Isn't it ?

You have to be careful with things like that, though. I was born in Huddersfield and still live on the North Derbyshire / South Yorkshire border and I've never heard of some of those words. Ket is one of them.

My Granddad did used to say "I'm not capt" for "I'm not surprised". Having never seen it written, though, I always assumed it was spelled "capped".

Yorkshire is a big place, though. Honestly, I think Thargoid sonograms are easier to decode.
