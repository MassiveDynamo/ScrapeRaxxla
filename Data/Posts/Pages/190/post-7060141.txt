LOL. There's a link to a one of my previous summaries about half way down the 1st post, just before the "Tourist Spot's in Shinrarta Dezhra" title!

And yeah, it's a salt-free reason that they vanished: Bug and/or subsequently Forgotten.

doh. I was just reading the first page again last night. Think I need new spectacles, to replace the new specs I got two weeks ago. Or maybe a new brain. Actually could do with a new body too!

edit: unlikely to be a bug I think, or rather just a bug; their silence speaks volumes. I think thereâ€™s something else going on, perhaps it got mixed up with another storyline so something needs to happen with that before these missions can be reinstated? Just inference and guesswork though.
