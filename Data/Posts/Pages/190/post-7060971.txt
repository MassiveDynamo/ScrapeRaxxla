So, two DW missions are still available at SD JM, the “sensitive supply run” & assassination missions.
Has anyone completed these to see if anything further happens? Done several times to build trust with DW faction? I was offered the assassination mission in August but not really up for that.
just wondering if all the missions are actually still in-game but are now more spread out & sequenced to slow down & build the “personal journey”; that would also fit in with FD’s silence on the subject, & Adam’s view that they are still around. FD seem sometimes to confirm a bug but rarely comment on what’s in-game.

Just musing thoughts over breakfast coffee!
