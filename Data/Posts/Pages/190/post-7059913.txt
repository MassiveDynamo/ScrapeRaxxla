With the exception of Brazil, all serious coffee drinking nations are up north. Finland is no. 1, with 12 Kg a year in average consumption. Go Finland![up]

Well 12kg/year is only an approximation. In local supermarkets you do see coffee packages placed on pallets instead of shelves, so there might be some truth to it. Besides, with all these english dialects and being native to none of them, you'd have another mug just to keep up.

I don't understand why wetwork missions for the Dark Wheel were mentioned in patch notes some time back, was there anything unusual at any point? I consider old Dark Wheel missions hints and foreword for alien storyline, present elite/founder missions simply to fulfill a promise they made during kickstarter to have some special missions for founders. Maybe they originally thought qualifying players would be much smaller margin.

"It's a ghost world. A planet. A legend" Sounds awfully lot like a site for some lost civilization. Jodethum.

I like Noobilites thinking, it's probably something like that.

Those named systems in Orion region and in a cluster below the bubble, seem like leftover from different phase of game developement, I don't think there is anything hidden there, but they are strange places.

I wonder if new updates change anything related to this mission. I personally think Raxxla is a beige planet somewhere very far away, but who knows, it might be worth scanning some places carefully, like Sirius.
