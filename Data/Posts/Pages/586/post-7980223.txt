Concerning Hyperdictions: Got hyperdicted twice last night while being en route from Jameson Memorial to HR 1183. First time got me a bit scared (as usual when Goids are creepking up on you), but in the end cursing myself for being a lousy scientist. Second time I used my FSS and found that contrary to my former belief, you don't end up in empty space, but actually in System, though about 10k ls away from the nearest body. Both hyperdictions went peaceful btw. only one Goid creeping up from behind and sniffing around at my engine exhaust then disappearing. Could this be a more peaceful species?
They all seem to do that, as long as you don't have something they want on board...
