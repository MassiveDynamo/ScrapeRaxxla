Even with personal invite, all would be known in hours or days. Location would be known and commander details will be analyzed. Systematic testing and spread sheet check lists would be the result.
Unless it's an RNG based requirement, the secret will not last long.

Okay, when I get the invite I promise to not tell you what I did to get it. Then it'll stay secret for longer
