Oh, the legendary and most secretive TDW... "nothing special about it" ? Just like any other station...
A market to make commerce with..who ? SR and bring the rescued people to the "secret" station ?
But you may very well be right. FD doesn't deserve the FR Mystery, Raxxla and TDW.
Anyway I wasn't commenting about common activities in my post...

TDW station permit-locked by the PF ?? What a mess.
Nobody has a sensible idea. LOL !!
TDW are a clique of the PF. This is official, not speculation, and explains why a) they share SD and b) why they would lock TDWs system (or planet)
