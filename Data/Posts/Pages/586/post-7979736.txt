Depends on the difficulty to get that permit, then. Days instead of hours ?
Anyway... Can't be in a MMO game. Unless you get that personal invite, ofc.
Even with personal invite, all would be known in hours or days. Location would be known and commander details will be analyzed. Systematic testing and spread sheet check lists would be the result.
Unless it's an RNG based requirement, the secret will not last long.
