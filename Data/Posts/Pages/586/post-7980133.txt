Given the speed at which the community typically rushes anything new and floods it, breaks it, or both it seems reasonable to expect FDev may have decided to keep it locked away until they're ready for the salty fallout and, if it's going to live up to the hype I'm pretty sure there's more development required first.

Finding Raxxla now may be disappointing, but in another five years? Let's wait and see.
