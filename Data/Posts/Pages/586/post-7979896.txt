Okay, when I get the invite I promise to not tell you what I did to get it. Then it'll stay secret for longer

That's what I had to promise too before they told me where it was.

A nagging thought keeps at me that regardless of anything 'only a handful of each generation' gets an invite to the DW. Can it be 'open' to anyone and everyone in an MMO?
