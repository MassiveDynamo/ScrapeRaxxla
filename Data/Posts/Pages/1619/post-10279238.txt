Just thinking if they were more in one side of the bubble than any other?

There’s a lot of data there to plot by hand, didn’t want to start anything if it had been undertaken previously.

My suspicion was they were all random, but what if that randomness wasn’t intentional, if that itself was a bug, or it occurred over intentional locations, maybe they propagated in a particular ‘cloud’, or if disorganised, is there an element of order hidden within it? If so - could a base centre be identified…

If that were true, my assumption would be it might marry up with other hypotheses about various locations. Of course more likely it might not…

Not in any hurry to crunch such data…

Have a look at the Update Notes for late 2015/early 2016...I seem to remember one where the E/F mission givers had been occuring outside SD and IIRC MB himself said that had been updated to contain them within SD, which implies they were of specific interest to him. A graphical analysis of those mission locations could be suggestive, though I suspect Macros' list doesn't have enough data points for a sound statistical analysis and I never heard of anyone else keeping note of them.
