After a search on EDSM I can see a pattern:
21s systems have multiple stars
26-30s systems have a lot of stars
43s systems have a truckload of stars
Since both Maia and HR 1185 are controlled by AXI (the former even being its home system) I suspected deliberate Thargoid shenanigans, but the equally controlled Asterope at 14s soon demolished my initial hypothesis.
hmmm....

So you're saying I've discovered an accurate and reliable method for determining if the system you're already jumping into has a lot of stars in it?

I'm sure that'll be handy...
