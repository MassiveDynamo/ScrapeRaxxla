Just thinking if they were more in one side of the bubble than any other?

There’s a lot of data there to plot by hand, didn’t want to start anything if it had been undertaken previously.

My suspicion was they were all random, but what if that randomness wasn’t intentional, if that itself was a bug, or it occurred over intentional locations, maybe they propagated in a particular ‘cloud’, or if disorganised, is there an element of order hidden within it? If so - could a base centre be identified…

If that were true, my assumption would be it might marry up with other hypotheses about various locations. Of course more likely it might not…

Not in any hurry to crunch such data…
