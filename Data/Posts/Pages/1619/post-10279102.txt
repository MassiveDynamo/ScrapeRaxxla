Always wondered what the "?" was... and it would be a bit scary if it moved over the entrance and comparing to the logo

And I wonder why there are 4,5 and 6 lights....
I just had a small brain blast looking at both imgs side by side...

it almost looks very interesting ? lol

unfocuse your eyes slightly...
the spot lights, and then a dark circle with a bar thru it, and another circle offset of that...

omg it's like looking at a ringed planet with an orbiting moon, in front of a star... XD
