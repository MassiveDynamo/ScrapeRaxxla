A preliminary geospatial analysis of your systems I might draw the following assessment.

These particular systems seem to form a chevron.

They are situated right on the edge of a perimeter which I’ve already identified as the zone of Storms… this is very interesting because this zone has a great deal of significance within my current theory (to be published soon).

They are situated very close to the systems attributable to the Norse Norns… if you look through the Greek Fates close by, they align with your systems?

There are three ‘older gods’ very close to your systems, one of them is the system Tawhaki - this is very interesting because Michael Brooke’s wrote a Drabble about it!

Spacially your systems are relatively upon an alignment with a system Ive been watching called Purisaz, it is a weird mis-spelling of a Norse Rune linked to ‘Thorns’.

Purisaz is aligned with another Norse Rune system within the Lost Realms zone…

Purisaz is of interest to me because Robert Holdstock used the ‘Rune of Thorn’ to denote the location of a mystical secret in his book Ragthorn!

Technically my new theory goes towards identifying potentially locations where the Pendant world ought to hang in relation to Paradise Lost, the systems your have identified are slap-bang in one of those locations!

I will be publishing my hypothesis very soon, here is your example overlayed.
