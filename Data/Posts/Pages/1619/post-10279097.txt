uummm... I think this may have been discussed awhile ago, but if not....
does anyone else see what I see in this img of Jacques Station interior....? I've only just noticed this on a mail slot, every time I've seen previous raxxla logo discussions and stations, it was about the antenna at the back, not the doorway...
look at the "strip" lights around the mail slot first, not the spot lights....



I see a center spot for ships...
a round center circle around the ship spot...
there partial lines, part of their own circle, with 32 lines/divisions...
a glass? segmented ring, with 6 corners (spot lights)...
6 straight supports with "V" arms holding that ring...

To me, looks an awful lot like the Raxxla logo....
unfortunately I think the Raxxla logo may be literally telling us one thing and only one thing;

it's outside XD
in space... somewhere, out...... there ------

or worse yet, Raxxla is literally any Exit port for ships and MB thought it was clever;
Raxxla is where anyone can find it, more than once, but we don't what it is...
lord I hope that's not true but who knows anymore....

for me it conjures mental imgs of;
a place that isn't a place,
a door that is also the key,
a siren calling for us to go explore,
grief, woe, and yearning,

getting more abstract, the mail slot "burns" with light and sound as ships pass thru, and it could be the jewel of the human race, as without it, mass scale long distance space expansion would never have been possible...

Ok, tinfoil is cooking my brain...
someone just tell me I'm nutz lol
Click to expand...


Always wondered what the "?" was... and it would be a bit scary if it moved over the entrance and comparing to the logo

And I wonder why there are 4,5 and 6 lights....
