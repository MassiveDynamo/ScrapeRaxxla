not to throw a wrench into this discussion , but on my way out to Colonia (arrived last night), but yesterday, I had a star that took FOREVER to load in witchspace, well over 30 secs...
and when it loaded.... one star... NOTHING else... 1 signal in FSS, nothing else.....

so loading times are not about the "stuff" in the system itself.....
I assumed it was network lag yesterday, but I'm now thinking it's somthing to do with how the galaxy was "seeded" in the game.... systems that have a longer seed number, probably take longer to calculate and display, regardless of their contents....

that's my 2 cents at this time, but definitely it took well over 15/17secs, atleast 30, before I dropped into what was essentially an empty system in the gap about 1000ly from Colonia...


also, I've dropped into new systems that I get the discovery credit for, with over 40 body's, and those systems also load in normal 15sec jump times.... so yea, just saying....

also also, lol, the game doesn't download each system from fdev, it uses the seed number to build it right in your PC, no download from fdev except for market info ect...
