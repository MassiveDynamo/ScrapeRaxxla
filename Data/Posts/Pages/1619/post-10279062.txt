not to throw a wrench into this discussion , but on my way out to Colonia (arrived last night), but yesterday, I had a star that took FOREVER to load in witchspace, well over 30 secs..
I had this happen a couple years ago, on my first big exploration. I thought it was really odd and scanned the whole system, which was quite big IIRC. Couldn't see anything odd so I bookmarked it and moved on.

I really don't know why I didn't test it more on that trip out but I did go back, months later!! Normal load time, multiple attempts - so I'm guessing sometimes it is just lag.
