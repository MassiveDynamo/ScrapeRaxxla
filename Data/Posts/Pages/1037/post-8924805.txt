Pyramids at Giza according to Rob Holdstock

There's the Mars Relic too.. possibly ... maybe..

The Mars relic is the reason why I'm following the Egyptian-myth trail; if there's an alien Mars relic, then there's the possibility that ancient aliens in ED have visited Earth. Here's an interesting fact: In the ancient Egypt-times Thuban was the polar star, not Polaris; the pyramids were oriented with respect to Thuban.
The problem with this approach: That Egyptian-Alien-stuff is really crazy and I don't want my Youtube/Google-suggestions get crowded with crazy conspiracy-stuff.
