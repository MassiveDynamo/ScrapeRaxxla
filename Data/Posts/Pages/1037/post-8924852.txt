as I understand it the oisir raxxla society degraded over time and lost most of their original technology and lost sight of the original mission. seems unlikely they would have erased their own traces. all civilizations leave their mark.

hell, we have more evidence of ancient pre intelligent life on a single planet dating back more that 100 million years than we do of a so called advanced civilization that supposedly flung it's self across multiple galaxies.

it seems there is another hand in this. something or someone is removing the evidence. could this be what Thargoids are really up to

The Osir-Raxxla had sent out "generation ships", where the inhabitants were meant to live and die for literal generations until their task was complete. The task itself was to construct a machine that spanned the entire galaxy and would have allowed them to control the flow of time. Unfortunately there were some mistakes when they built the pyramids (the calibration part of the machine), where they diffused the gravity into the pyramid's base instead of focusing it at the point. This effectively ruined the whole machine. The crew of the generation ship had lost sight of their founder's reverence for details and only knew of their tasks, as that was the only information passed down. The fate of this specific generation ship is unknown.

It's been theorized that the Mars artifact was part of this machine, but it's uncertain. What we do know is that they weren't the only race to exist in the galaxy, as the place they came from was actually home to a number of races.

All of this is heresay because we don't know whether Steven Eisler's writings are even canon in the current Elite Dangerous game.
