They weren't messy monkeys like us humans, they cleaned after themselves.
And maybe the few last millions of years of their rampage, they'd manifest themselves like natural forces if they were in any way detectable to E: D -era human civilization.
as I understand it the oisir raxxla society degraded over time and lost most of their original technology and lost sight of the original mission. seems unlikely they would have erased their own traces. all civilizations leave their mark.

hell, we have more evidence of ancient pre intelligent life on a single planet dating back more that 100 million years than we do of a so called advanced civilization that supposedly flung it's self across multiple galaxies.

it seems there is another hand in this. something or someone is removing the evidence. could this be what Thargoids are really up to
