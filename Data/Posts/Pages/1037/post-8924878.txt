I don't think the players need another galaxy, so FD didn't make it. Within the Milky Way, it is difficult to find anyone, what is the point of creating a huge Andromeda (which is larger than the Milky Way)? But I like the idea that Raxxla is a gateway through which we will bring trouble upon ourselves. However, I am sure of its existence in the game, there can't be so many questions and vague answers to them to be just lies. FD is very sensitive to ED and try not to sell you something that is not in the game.

At the moment, I'm flying up to the Bovomit cluster. My journey through the Formidine Rift has been terribly boring and I'm going to be returning to the bubble soon. I don't understand why I didn't find anything, not a single sign of life. Where are the erased worlds and endless Targoid cemeteries? Probably there, in a closed cluster, still under construction...

See my thread on FD quotes: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/fdev-ed-relevant-quotes-videos.553526/#post-8671776

the quote about Thargoids, beyond the FRift,Octagonal ships blocking out the stars...
elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Project_Dynasty:
“John Harper, author of And Here The Wheel, wrote in a Kickstarter comment:

"You don't know what I've seen. I've sailed beyond the Formidine Rift, seen the fleets of Octagonal ships blocking out the stars. I've stood on lost worlds, sterilised clean by the Thargoids and erased from humanity's maps. I've seen the graves from the Thargoid wars, countless headstones stretching beyond the curvature of the horizon, little spots of reflected light dottering the abandoned continent ..."

But presumably FD didn’t implement that, and they even changed the location of the Formidine Rift, which one of the books places near the Core Worlds.
