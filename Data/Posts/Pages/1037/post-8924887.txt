the quote about Thargoids, beyond the FRift,Octagonal ships blocking out the stars...
elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Project_Dynasty:
“John Harper, author of And Here The Wheel, wrote in a Kickstarter comment:

"You don't know what I've seen. I've sailed beyond the Formidine Rift, seen the fleets of Octagonal ships blocking out the stars. I've stood on lost worlds, sterilised clean by the Thargoids and erased from humanity's maps. I've seen the graves from the Thargoid wars, countless headstones stretching beyond the curvature of the horizon, little spots of reflected light dottering the abandoned continent ..."

But presumably FD didn’t implement that, and they even changed the location of the Formidine Rift, which one of the books places near the Core Worlds.

Exactly! This is the quote I used when planning my trip. But other than the lifeless ice worlds, I found nothing. Even biological signals are very rare. I am inclined to the idea that we will someday open access to the Bovomit cluster where all those riddles and remnants of worlds will be.
