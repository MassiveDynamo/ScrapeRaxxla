Been looking around SD AB 2 F A- it's the only landable body on "the outer rim" with a suspicious orbital inclination (-86 degrees), but can't see anything much of interest (when I first went down to land I found 3 landed system security ships plus 3 more airborne but they showed no interest in me) apart from a derelict Annaconda with a hawk/Eagle symbol - hope this isn't Raxxla! (no announcement, no name visible!) - though a ship would be "a gateway to alien worlds" but this was uninspiring! https://imgur.com/yPh4FnU., https://imgur.com/KRtdZWN

Anacondas with the Faulcon DeLacy logo are quite common.

Have you tried to listen to the planet, from space?

You know, silent song of the spheres and findable before planetary landings.
