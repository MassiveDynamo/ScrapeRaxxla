Anacondas with the Faulcon DeLacy logo are quite common.

Have you tried to listen to the planet, from space?

You know, silent song of the spheres and findable before planetary landings.

Not yet, been to have a mooch around Gateway system (nothing), now back in SD having a second mooch. Besides, if it’s a silent song of the spheres then I wouldn’t be able to hear it!

Have normal USS changed? I came across a threat level 5 today, and yesterday I’m convinced I saw a threat level 6 ( talking about normal USS, not non-human SS).

Thought the annie derelict symbol looked familiar, but don’t remember seeing it on a ship side before.

Might have a mooch off the ecliptic from the barycentre (if I can figure out how to find it), but thats probably Saturday’s job, long journey tomorrow.
