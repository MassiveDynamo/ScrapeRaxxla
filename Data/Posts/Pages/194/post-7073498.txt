eddb.io is run by players. I wouldn't spend too much energy trying to figure out why eddb lists TDW's home system as "?". I've always been kind of interested to see what would happen if they were to expand from Shinrarta though ...

Shinrarta isn't their home is what I'm saying, or it would say so. It's run by software like EDDiscovery mostly, not players. Had EDD or another plug detected TDW homeworld, the information would get priority. I could still be wrong, but I'm confident that I'm not. A question remains unanswered: Are there other means to determine a home system (preferably ingame)? I'm a 2 month old player that's only been doing exploration and engineer unlocks, so I don't know about factions.
