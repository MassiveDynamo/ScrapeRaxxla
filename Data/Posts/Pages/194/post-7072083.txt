Note: Frontier could have added Raxxla AFTER everything else was decided (by Kickstarters and lore masters) in terms of names and locations. It doesn't need to fit anything, really. to paraphrase, "no clues, but we have to make it a tiny little bit obvious"

Theory:

RA -- The Ra system (go check it out in the system map)
XX -- Ra 12 and Ra 13, two named but unclassified and 'rangeless' (so XX) bodies (sub brown dwarf?), which is strange (haven't seen it yet in a named and discovered system)
LA -- lagrange point between Ra12 and Ra13

I think there may be an undiscovered body there, can anyone (edit: triple elite commander or backer) travel to Ra12 and Ra13 and then calculate and go to the lagrange between them?

Additionally, since the Oisir-Raxxla are supposed to have built the piramids, Ra would seem fitting.
