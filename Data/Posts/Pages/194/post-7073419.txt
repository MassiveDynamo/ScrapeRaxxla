There's also a system called Rattla, btw, never saw it mentioned in this thread.

another thing I just saw is that on eddb.io, The Dark Wheel's home system is "?", not ShinraDezh. Is there a way to find the home system through other means?

eddb.io is run by players. I wouldn't spend too much energy trying to figure out why eddb lists TDW's home system as "?". I've always been kind of interested to see what would happen if they were to expand from Shinrarta though ...
