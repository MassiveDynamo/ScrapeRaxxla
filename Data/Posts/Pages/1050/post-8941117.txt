I failed A level Chemistry, well I removed myself before the exam as it would just be a waste of everyone's time, loved every minute of the 2 years but Organic Chemistry, which this is, nah never even understood the basics of that.

I have two O level chemistry passes, the second from my A level exam I was so bad.
