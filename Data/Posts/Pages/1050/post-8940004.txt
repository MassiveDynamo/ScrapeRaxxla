We may have to disagree on the word 'dishonest'. They are not saying anything is real, they are telling a story and letting the audience tell their own stories. Is there actually blame if some stories dont have a good ending, if any ending at all?

Is any author dishonest by providing clues and red herrings or no clues at all? Or is it entertainment with twists and turns?

Most importantly, when is it supposed to end, how long is it supposed to go on for? Probably and hopefully decades in reality.
