Anybody know anything about chemistry?
Still musing the Raxxla logo from the Codex and a thought struck me-is it possible the hexagon represents a ring of 6 carbon atoms? If that is a valid interpretation what would the 3 arcs and the dot+circle mean? Does it clarify what the black areas and green “corridors” might be?

Grasping at straws here, but I forgot the little I knew of chemistry many years ago!!
