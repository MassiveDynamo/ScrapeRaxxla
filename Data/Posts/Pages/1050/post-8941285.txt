It's actually called kissing 8 and kissing 12. But for the sake of making things easier visually - I will refer to (66) being kissing 12 as Kissing 6. The same with kissing 8, will be referred to as kissing (44). Because this is visually how the clues look in the game.

There are also monk and didgeridoo sounds in the game around clues - that seem more Dark Wheel related, involving the Guardians as well. But I will save that for another post.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsa The Eye in this hand is symbolic and connected to Raxxla as well, primarily the symbols on the fingers, that are also in the game like the sun, eye, and Live Transfer(open ended triangle) There are many Hamsa from all over the world. I would like some help identifying more symbols from diff cultures on the fingers. You will also notice the (66) DIce pattern on the Remlok suit hand pattern.

Many of you know post about two years ago. I posted about the repeating DICE patterns. I thought it was about craps since the numbers were arranged like dice. The 4 4 over the robots eye, the 6 6 on the remlok glove. But it's not dice. The numbers are kissing numbers. And this explains the RAXXLA symbol. Video explanation:
So raxxla is a door that passes through a dimension that we cannot see. Where does it go?

More on the symbol:

The circle in the middle of the Raxxla symbol is actually a line seen in one dimension being in the center. The second dimension would be the circle in the symbol. The third dimension the three lines around the circle and the fourth dotted line would be the fourth dimension beyond that we cannot see past its invisible line

The Black parts could also be "tesseract" shapes in the 4d rotating hypercube. Why there would be six hypercubes on the outside of the gateway - I am unsure.

working theory : That Jaques is one of Guardian AI Constructs (cyborg having reached singularity).
