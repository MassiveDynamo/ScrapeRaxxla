There are so many hidden mechanics & disparate pieces of lore that not everyone knows everything.

I've seen/discovered mechanics that hide for 1-2 years before it gets outed.

And I am certain there are lore/fiction that no one looks into.

Etymologies of names are important. Art. Design. Color direction.

Why certain things are the way they are.

Why is there a universal timer?

Why do we have a godawful orange cockpit?

Why green and black for Raxxla? Bonus points if you can identify the green.

Why Nemorensis? Why Lakon? Why are the Lakon ships named the way they are.

No one asks these things because maybe its only for those with eyes to see.

Eventually, the real lesson of Raxxla is that of making a choice, breaking the loop.

You can always step away.

Maybe the maze isn't meant for you & that's OK.

I can answer one of those!
Branding! We have the godawful orange cockpit because that’s FD’s own colour, presumably chosen by Marketing, and because they liked it they insisted everybody else had to have it. And then gave us lots of orangey planet surfaces and stars so you can’t read any hud display.

I suspect the green colour of the Raxxla logo is related to the green/blue light of Guardian artefacts as I suspect Raxxla is a Guardian ship. Really raised my pulse rate when I first observed the green cockpit glows in Sol!
