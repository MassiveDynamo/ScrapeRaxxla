Which leaves me with an assumption with two possible scenarios, A. It’s a myth that they are happy to self-propagate because it keeps people interested beyond end game, OR B. It actually exists and everything relating to it is completely bug free and we either simply haven’t seen / found out enough about how to begin the “journey” and everything is working as intended because we must trust them to not let us chase ghosts.

My concern is (in the context of this being a game, I’m not really concerned) that I am having difficulty resolving B.

There are so many hidden mechanics & disparate pieces of lore that not everyone knows everything.

I've seen/discovered mechanics that hide for 1-2 years before it gets outed.

And I am certain there are lore/fiction that no one looks into.

Etymologies of names are important. Art. Design. Color direction.

Why certain things are the way they are.

Why is there a universal timer?

Why do we have a godawful orange cockpit?

Why green and black for Raxxla? Bonus points if you can identify the green.

Why Nemorensis? Why Lakon? Why are the Lakon ships named the way they are.

No one asks these things because maybe its only for those with eyes to see.

Eventually, the real lesson of Raxxla is that of making a choice, breaking the loop.

You can always step away.

Maybe the maze isn't meant for you & that's OK.
