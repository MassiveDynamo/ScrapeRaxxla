Okay, theory time.
the "Odins"-system; according to its description the Odins-system relates to Odin. There's an extra 's' at the end
the "Herme"-system; it's missing an 's' at the end, then it would be "Hermes"
According to Wikipedia: (Thoth =) Hermes = Mercury = Odin

So, you have 4 manifestations of Hermes: one in Sol, the other three outside Sol. wink*wink
