B - There will be no clues. So everything is player extrapolation. Everything, all of it. They told us how it is early on.
They said there will be no clues, I donâ€™t really them saying that everything was player extrapolation though (I might have missed it). I'm not after clues though.

But the hunt is still more fun and provides more distracting gameplay, dare i say emergent content, than any finding of it would ever do. And once the monster is dead or the riddle is solved theres nothing left to believe in any more so whats the point.?

Absolutely the hunt is more important (to me anyway) than the end result and like you say once its done its done. I'm not sure though that, that condones a degree of dishonesty in maintaining the life of the "monster" *

*IF that is what is happening
