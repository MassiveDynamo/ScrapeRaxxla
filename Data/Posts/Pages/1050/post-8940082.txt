Raxxla is the central mystery of the ED world. It is not surprising that the path to it is so complicated. It's a shame that we often confuse game errors with hints of Raxxla. But let's be honest, none of the theories put forward here on the forum have been studied to the proper extent, as it requires a huge amount of time and effort. If we go back to the idea of the Raxxla logo - map, then in fact there was not a single really long investigation. A million theories have been put forward, and surely one of them is correct, it's just lost. Instead of developing theories, the pilots focused on finding bugs in the game. It seems to me that the problem is precisely in the community, which is not able to unite efforts and structure actions. There are individual pilots and even factions working more systematically, but there are few of them. And who knows, maybe someone has already found what they were looking for and just silent? Would you tell everyone that you found Raxxla?
