Small question: Is there any star, planet, moon, starport or base named after Hermes?

The closest star name is "Herme" which has a "Herodotus Point" which would be a Greek reference. You could also joke that "Herme 5" is Hermes partially in 1337speak.

Edit:
I don't know if this is a lead/hint, look at Eqyptian Mythology on this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickster

I already mentioned that the ingame Set-system is not what I expected.
