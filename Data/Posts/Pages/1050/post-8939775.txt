B - There will be no clues. So everything is player extrapolation. Everything, all of it. They told us how it is early on.

But the hunt is still more fun and provides more distracting gameplay, dare i say emergent content, than any finding of it would ever do. And once the monster is dead or the riddle is solved theres nothing left to believe in any more so whats the point.?
