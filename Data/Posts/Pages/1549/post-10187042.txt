Yep. Iâ€™ve read more mythology in the last couple of weeks than in all my previous 70 years!

I would be very surprised if Hecate is the answer if Raxxla hasn't already been found-there must be many followers of the triple moon goddess that recognised the logo imagery.

Unless everybody else is also flummoxed by a 22 billion sq km search area!
