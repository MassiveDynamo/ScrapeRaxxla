could there be something we dont see throwing the tomie planet out of the plane?
An out of ecliptic orbit could mean a captured Rogue (not rouge, it may not be red! ) planet. Alternatively might mean interacting GG orbits in ancient times. But may be worth exploring...I mapped the planet but didn't find anything of note, but with the amount of obfuscation in this puzzle it is worth checking out. I also want to know why it was named “Tomie”, and did it happen when Arthur joined FD?

edit
the last thing was to check current view against a pic I took of Hecate 6 Belt yesterday afternoon. Difficult doing blink comparison by eye, but can't see any movement!
