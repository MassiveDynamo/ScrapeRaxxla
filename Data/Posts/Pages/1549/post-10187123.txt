The logo, three semicircular arcs around the omphalos, with six arms emanating?
You mean this. My forum logo is just a colorized variant. Those twisty sections, are notably I believe, supposed to be a serpent making up the portions along the edges - fitting I suppose given the serpent connection to the myth. I also love that the center looks Thargoid.

Unless everybody else is also flummoxed by a 22 billion sq km search area!
Suggestions:
DSS scan the rings
Navigation beacon for persistent POIs
Check any megaships in the system
Hecate may be a pointer to Terra Mater as Daunting Hammer is the Brotherhood of Terra Mater's megaship and the Hecate system is the gateway to access that permit lock. Terra Mater also has a station named Gr8Minds (Coriolis).
According to EDSM Hecate has the following with rings (been there myself so can confirm):
Hecate 4 (gas giant with ammonia-life)
Hecate 5 (ammonia world)
Hecate 6 (Icy body)
“Jewelled Rings” on Hecate 5A which says “Commander Canonn extols the amazing views within the icy rings of this moon”, however 5A hasn’t got any rings!! In fact none of Hecate’s moons have rings! Hecate 4 and 5 are visible from this TB, so it’s possible it’s talking about those. However IIRC MB put the TB into game and he was pretty precise with his phraseology. So is TB0039 just obfuscation? I’ve spent two days looking for navel (“omphalos”, which are often nowadays adorned by jewelled rings)-shaped features on 5A surface and checked out a few craters, but found nothing.

Is the tourist beacon edge-on for Hecate 5 ring system? Edge-on rings beacome practically invisible.
