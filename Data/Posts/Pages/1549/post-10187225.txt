We live in amazing times, 50 years ago when i first joined a Grove everything was passed by word of mouth, those before us never wrote things down.
It wasn't until the likes of Myers and Ellis that ancient traditions started to be put into print (with its own issues), now you can click a mouse and everything (well most ) things are laid before you.
Except of course the location of Raxxla!

This is why I was wondering about a Guardian Ancient Key the other day. Do we need to take something to the location to activate the “omphalos rift”...

Seeing the three lobes of the Strophalos and remembering FD’s fondness for timed puzzles I raced between the three mining hotspots of Hecate 5 (or was it 4?), dropping out of SC and flying through each marker, nothing. Then remembering a Stropholos was whirled around like a bullroarer so I raced around the same belt in SC. Even sat in my ship end-on above the poles and rolled that around...all to no avail!

Running out of ideas...

Oh, just remembered one more, which I’ll try out later after copawlot walk


Edit
Just find it amusing that people say the Raxxla narrative was deleted, but what are we following? It’s a narrative of a different kind! And seeing the twists and turns that he put in I’m struck by MB’s genius!

and also forgot to say that I've been doing the investigation over the last week or so in second account (Master/Elite/Elite) on Horizons Legacy as that was convenient to get an Asp Explorer for good visibility when searching the ground/belts.
Shouldnt make a difference....!!!
