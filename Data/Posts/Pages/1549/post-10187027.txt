Haha and just to chuck a spanner in the works for many pagans (myself included) there is another 'Tripple goddess' - The Morrigan, she's also in game.

‘The Morrígan is often considered a triple goddess, but this triple nature is ambiguous and inconsistent. These triple appearances are partially due to the Celtic significance of threeness. Sometimes she appears as one of three sisters, the daughters of Ernmas: Morrígan, Badb and Macha.’

Morrígan and Badb are in game but not Macha.

Location wise these are not closely associated with the Greek underworld nor any of Norse named systems whereas the Hecate triplicate is however, and that’s where our assessment is established.

Generally the Morrígan systems are not linked to the goddes Hecate, so likely not related to this wider theory linked to Yggdrasil and the Greek underworld represented in game.

*edited: I now feel these to be: Badb; Danu and Morrigan.


These triple goddess are actually relatively close to the Norse Norns and the Greek Fates… is that a coincidence or just pattern bias?
