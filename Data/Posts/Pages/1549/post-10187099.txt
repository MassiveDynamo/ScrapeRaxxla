Yep. Iâ€™ve read more mythology in the last couple of weeks than in all my previous 70 years!
We live in amazing times, 50 years ago when i first joined a Grove everything was passed by word of mouth, those before us never wrote things down.
It wasn't until the likes of Myers and Ellis that ancient traditions started to be put into print (with its own issues), now you can click a mouse and everything (well most ) things are laid before you.
Except of course the location of Raxxla!
