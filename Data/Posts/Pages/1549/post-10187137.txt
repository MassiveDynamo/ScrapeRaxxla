Witchspace entry portal when jumping? Raxxla was supposed to be something that connected galaxies (potentially). There are a number of installations with "galactic" in the name. Also, hear me out, what if you need the rare good "Galactic Travel Guide" from Bluford Orbital in LHS 3447 to activate Raxxla? In theory, the Sidewinder you start out in has the "galactic hyperdrive" pre-equiped (though obviously upgradable). This system is notable for the NPC faction "LHS 3447 Academy for Novitiate Pilots".

Good lord. I really need to prioritize getting back there.
