Hecate was the goddess of crossroads, particularly three-way Y junctions (“Trivia”).
According to Wiktionary TII means “way, road, path · trip, journey ...” in Võro (a descendant of the old Finnic/South Estonian regional language)

So Triviatii means three-way path/journey...Triviatii is 137 ly from Hecate and Triviatii B is a class T brown dwarf, so some people might call it a gas giant...it has 8 planets (“moons”?)
Spent the morning looking around the surface of the largest crater on B7, nothing to report apart from some metallic meteorites with Ruthenium.

Desperation showing, PC switched off in disgust, gonna read a book (not science fiction!!!)
