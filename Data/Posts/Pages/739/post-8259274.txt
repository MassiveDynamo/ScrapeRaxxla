I know a few of you fellow Raxxla/TDW hunters checked out the Jailhouse Rock and Blues bar in LFT 926 near the B A Belt Cluster 1 a while back, and since I was in-system decided to snoop a bit too.

Interesting to note, even though the controlling faction isn't TDW anymore that installation is still flagged as theirs, and so are the belts?

Anyway, I flew around and through the installation (inside access tunnels, and used the camera through the hackable ports - which leads to another enclosed tunnel) but couldn't see anything particularly of note. But whilst i was snooping around I saw this station / system image appear on one of the banner displays and thought it was a bit odd when compared with all the other 'advertising' materials as it had not tag lines, or company logos etc.


Strange advertising banner on Jailhouse Rock and Blues installation


It could just be old media, but I've never seen a station like this and according to the codex TDW is meant to be in a 'Dark Toroid' station. No idea what Raxxla looks like, so who knows, but has anyone else seen an odd banner like this? Just curious ...

Fly Dangerously.
