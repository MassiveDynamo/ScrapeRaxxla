I notice Hannerib has picked up on it in a different thread too but on tonights livestream Paige did mention and confirm that fossils, lots of fossils, of what hasn't been revealed by the feds, were found on Mars before they found the Martian Relic. Whether they are the same culture or period is not known or discussed.

First Id heard of it, but it is now canon if it wasn't before. Also the Tesla got nicked by space pirates

Why isn't Raxxla on Mars or is Mars by a different name, Im sure theres a reason but I cant really think of it? Certainly nothing to link to 1984, no Sol in 1984 Elite, no lore that way but could it be that simple? (hope not)
