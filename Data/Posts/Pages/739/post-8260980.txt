Caveat: Depending on who you choose to argue the phenomena with...

Apparently Sol travels through the galaxy in a spiral. There's only one reason I can think of that this might happen - a counter weight, or companion star or star system which some seem to think is Sirius. We also observe phenomena like precession, and wonder what influential body is responsible for maintaining this cycle, and why it seems comparable to the asynchronous Yugas.

SPOILER

So, why is the Satya-Yuga period so long while the Kali Yuga part of the cycle (we're apparently in now) is so short? Is it because Sol is currently at aphelion, the furthest point from Canis Major and when they swing back towards each other the perihelion or, more rounded part of the egg shaped orbital dance creates a more harmonious energetic relationship between star and nature?

Do we have any (other) bodhisattvas further along in their ~25,000 year course notes to shed light on such eternal conundrums?


Not sure how they managed it but this animation has some issues (besides scale) which they didn't appear to fix (see Part 1 in links) when trying to show our course as we bob up and down through the galactic plane. First, Jupiter orbits INSIDE Saturn, not outside and they don't both have the same orbital period, they should be in a 1:2.5 resonance (~11.9 vs 29.5 years) instead.

It's a pretty good visualisation to help one wrap their head around our stellar waltz, but who's the unseen partner in this couple?
