The tourist beacon in Tau Ceti states the 22nd century (2101 - 2200).

Hmmmm so assuming a littler earlier than 2159 (Tau Ceti Settled self sufficient by 2159)... lets say circa 2150 for the big un-manned probe bonanza. Raxxla first known to be mentioned in 2296. Thats roughly 146 years of interstellar probing. Ya i imagine those probes could get far.
