Ya I was thinking of Gaia as well for the mother... With the Jewel on the Brow (as seen from earth - dawn) being the Morning Star.... Too many references to "dawn" to count... Venus is the obvious choice for Hesperus/Phosphorus if you want to keep it in system. I was thinking Sirius but ya...
Lots of references to Venus/morning star in Astrophel and Stella also IIRC.
