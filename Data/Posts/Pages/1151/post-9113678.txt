It says unequivocally it is the 8th moon of unnamed gas giant. The Omphalos Rift probably orbits the 8th moon waiting for someone to discover it. As best I can tell no human has been there. TDW supposedly found Soontill but never found Raxxla. Ryder's sons split up over whether to go after Raxxla or Soontill first. I honestly believe Triton is locked in Sol because it is Neptune Ryder's base of operations. Oberon is probably Oberon Ryder's base. I honestly believe humanity only knows about Raxxla because of the hyperspace probes sent before the generation ships. Keep in mind those were "slow" hyperspace so it took hours to days per jump. Even then those had 1,150 years to get out well past the Bubble. Keep this in mind. We only know of this because an automated probes which are discussed at the tourist beacons in Tau Ceti. This means it is almost certainly out of the Bubble.
"It" being Raxxla or The Dark Wheel's station?
