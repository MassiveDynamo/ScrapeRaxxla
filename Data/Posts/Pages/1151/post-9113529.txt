Good point - ya they did name their first update ... Horizon..... I suppose Odyssey could cover the rest (sirens, grief, and wanderlust)... Is the toast just a reference to their planned updates and raxxla just an end game? nooooooo



To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies - DBs desire and thoughts / ideas to build the game & Stellar Forge?
To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! - The devs?
The parent's grief, the lover's woe - our friends, parents and partners who have lost us to the game?
and the yearning of our vagabond hearts - Ship interiors?
To Raxxla!

Well it fits, just need that last bit, next 2 years or so?

In lore, only the Dark Wheel has the Elite requirement. There is no mention of it, in regards to Raxxla.

Its old old lore from The Dark Wheel novella, 'you need to be elite' said to Jason by his uncle iirc. No mention of it currently so probably long gone as you say but thats where it comes from originally.
