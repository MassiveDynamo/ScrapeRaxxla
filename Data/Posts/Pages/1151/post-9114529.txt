Remember, if Raxxla has been on ED since the start, it wouldn't be a planet to land on, and surely not a gateway to another galaxy as it has been speculated so often, because why even bother from a video game development stand point with that when the current galaxy as of today is still less than half of a percentage point explored?
Any other galaxies generated by Star Forge using the same assets would look identical, same stars, same planets, same moons, I don't get why so many people seem to be hitching to "get a new galaxy" in ED when you think about it that way.
Sooo.... you are saying that if it was another galaxy, you wouldn't go there? Wouldn't be excited to see what it had to offer?
....Because if you would go, you are saying that Fdev would have a reason to create it....
