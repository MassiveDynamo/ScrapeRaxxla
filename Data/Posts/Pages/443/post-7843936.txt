I'm out in the Centauri constellation recording HDs and HIPs - only a few hundred to go - so I can't help you out with Fort Dixon.
When you hit Persephone system, could you check the local news thing to see if my Galnet submission is still visible? Iit's 2 years old now, so I doubt it'll be there.

I will gladly do that, but it might take till the weekend till I go there as my household directorate (a.k.a. wife) tends to cut gametime short during the week. If you see me writing something about Persephone (System) a little reminder would be alright...
