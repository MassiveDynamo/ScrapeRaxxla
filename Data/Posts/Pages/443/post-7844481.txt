Good work. We have several things pointing loosely to Sirius at the moment. Among them the Egyptian Isis/Osiris/Horus connection to Alien World.

If you search in this thread, you wil see a few other possible pointer.

There is an actual scientific paper from 1994, that lists stable orbits for a potential Sirius C.
I’ll pot the link, when I get of the phone.

Edit: don’t put to much into the system names. There is hardly an ancient deity without a star system in ED.

Ok well... I think I know where some of the tinfoil ideas in the codex about Raxxla are coming from....

Our story starts with an ethnography of the Dogon tribe in Africa by a fellow named Marcel Griaule. He wrote among other things a paper about Dogon and Sirius (stretch those french muscles). Which apparently caught the fancy of Robert Temple who wrote The Sirius Mystery. Temples.. 'book'? strings together alot of themes and is some first class tinfoil... Alot of which focuses on the Dogons astronomical knowledge especially about Sirius B. Im thinking TriCora needs another look..

Anyway...the story has spiraling stars

SPOILER: SPIRALING STARS

and Familiar logos

SPOILER: FAMILIAR LOGO?

not to mention world eggs and omphaloi...

Ya if this is what the dark wheel is working with ... Im a little worried
A childrens story
