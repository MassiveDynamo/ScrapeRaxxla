Did you hit Persephone (goddess of the Underworld) yet?
There's a system (contains nothing but an ELW), a station (in Avalon system) and a landable body in Sol system (which only got added to the game around v2.4). You might get some joy from the FSS and DSS.

Edit:
Also Osiris and Anubis might be worth a look-see.

Actually I am en route to Avalaon as I have been suspecting this system ever since starting to participate in this thread. Persephone in Sol is also well known to me iirc there is an installation where I had some fun and afterwards found out the nearest interstellar factor ist at Ross 154. I'll be visiting Persephone (System) after my visit to Avalon.

Now what I'd really appreciate ist if someone on PC might go and check Fort Dixon with the FSS to hear whether I was just hearing some mumbo jumbo or whether there actually is a hidden message.
