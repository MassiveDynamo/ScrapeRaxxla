Actually I am en route to Avalaon as I have been suspecting ever since starting to participate in this thread. Persephone in Sol is also well known to me iirc there is an installation where I had some fun and afterwards found out the nearest interstellar factor ist at Ross 154. I'll be visiting Persephone (System) after my visit to Avalon.

Now what I'd really appreciate ist if someone on PC might go and check Fort Dixon with the FSS to hear whether I was just hearing some mumbo jumbo or whether there actually is a hidden message.

I'm out in the Centauri constellation recording HDs and HIPs - only a few hundred to go - so I can't help you out with Fort Dixon.
When you hit Persephone system, could you check the local news thing to see if my Galnet submission is still visible? Iit's 2 years old now, so I doubt it'll be there.
