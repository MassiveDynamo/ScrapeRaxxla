Well, frak me. I did not expect this.
SPOILER: LOCATIONS: HUMAN (2)

And just for reference:
SPOILER: SD A 1
Without being there it's hard to tell exactly what's what, but everything will be accounted for normally.

Locations shows both orbital and surface locations.

Human includes:
Combat Zones
Stations
Bases
Installations
Megaships
Tourist Beacons*
Crash Sites*
Other includes:
Listening Posts
UCBs*
Engineer bases*
Some secret bases (according to some reports)
Possibly some crash sites
* is going of memory, is subject to things having changed in updates/patches and not every example necessarily being marked the same way.

RESs don't show up IIRC.

Then there's Guardian and Thargoid signals, though sometimes things are oddly allocated - almost more by 'plot / storyline' than what the actual signal source is.

Plus there's obviously a chance of bugs misallocation in signal type. For example Site 42 is human, tied with the Thargoid side of things, but shows up as GUaridan (or at least did - it might have been fixed.

From the screenshot, there's 11 notable signals - that'll be CZs, LPs, Tourist Beacons, etc.

Anyway... if you do a shot of the navpanel for the bodies in question, it should be possible to identify what all the signals correspond to.

It should be:

Founders World: (2 human)
Jameson Memorial
A tourist beacon or CZ (just guessing this one)
A1: 5(human, 1 other)
Jameson Base
Wandrei Base
Nixon Enterprise
Burke Beacon
Wolfe Reach
Pilots Federation Origin Tourist Spot 0244
I would have thought that it was Jameson Base which was the 'Other', but maybe it was changed in the last update so that Engineer bases show as Human.
