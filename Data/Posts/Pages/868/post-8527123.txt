Uninhabited...

I'm actually not completely sold on the idea that it's near the bubble either.

Im not either, never have been... and I agree most lilkely uninhabited... BUT i've been tossing around the thought that it may have a SMALL population, i.e. TDW or The Club,ect, members living on/in what ever Raxxla is?
