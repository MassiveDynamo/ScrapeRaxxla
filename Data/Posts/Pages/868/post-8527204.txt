is a Mod saying the map to LFT 509 was data-mined? LOL

I was skeptical already, but a mod physically saying that, would make me believe it more, that its not a valid map, no matter how it was supposedly obtained...
I am not saying one specific thing was. I did not read it and do not know what the issue with that particular system is.

It appears that you would have all preferred me to use different wording when asking you not to discuss it, but it is a blanket term that I personally use for information gathered in a way that should not be possible to gather it.

The only thing I will say, from my point of view, is that I think it's very likely the majority of those systems had already been explored before they were permit locked. But it's just my thought. It's the weekend, I certainly haven't spoken to anyone at Frontier

Edit after reading some more comments
If you feel I've done something wrong then feel free to contact the CM team.
