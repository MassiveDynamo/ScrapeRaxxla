The whole hidden maps in audio literally required breaking the eula by data mining game files outside of the game.

YES, I AGREE WITH YOU, that should have been a EULA violation, BUT Fdev allowed that though, and the EULA does not say you cant record your acitivies in screen recordings, and by-law, if you screen record somthing, you technically own the video file and can do what you want with it, as long as not using it for commercial purposes like dj's or an event

so at best, it was a grey Zone, and Fdev obv wanted it done, so they didnt call EULA violation
