The only thing I will say, from my point of view, is that I think it's very likely the majority of those systems had already been explored before they were permit locked. But it's just my thought. It's the weekend, I certainly haven't spoken to anyone at Frontier

to be fair, i think there could be some truth to what you say. there is a possibility that those screenshots were taken way before, as they clearly redacted the dates from their screenshots. they did provide a plausible reason for why they did so however. but i find it strange, that many other players reported the same thing, they were able to recreate the same exact process on their end, some of wich are friends i trust. but we never know these days.

It appears that you would have all preferred me to use different wording when asking you not to discuss it, but it is a blanket term that I personally use for information gathered in a way that should not be possible to gather it.

im afraid though, that you used more than just "wording" and "asking us" not to discuss it in this case. and you did it without checking what the issue was with the system in question.
