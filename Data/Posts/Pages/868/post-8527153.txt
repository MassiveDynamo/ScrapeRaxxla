I wouldn't apologise. The mod is wrong.

The buying of exploration data is no more a bug or even inside info than scan data from systems early in the game before they were permit blocked.

In the end they are worthless since you can't get the permit.

They are worthless since fdev can override the content and makeup on the systems whenever they want.

They are worthless since fdev can retcon the story (and have) whenever it suits them.

Further, I'd consider all crowd sourced databases and the reading of log files to be far more of an exploit since it very directly circumvents in game mechanics such as buying exploration and trade data. If you're going to use the exploit card, at least use it on something that actually gives you an advantage you wouldn't otherwise have.
