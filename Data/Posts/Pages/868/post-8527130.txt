my apologies if i have shared something that isn't allowed. even thought i dont agree that this comes even close to data-mining. the discovery was done completely by luck at first. a clueless player simply acted on his curiosity after discovering that he can buy the system map info on his fleet carrier, and tried doing that on what he thought were interresting systems to check out. throught the use of completely legitimate in-game means. friends of mine have confirmed that it is done in that way. if anything, this discovery can be seen as a bug report, a good service of the players discovering possible anomalies in the system. (that is if it wasn't really supposed to be found) but then again, theres also a bad side i guess. i cant see in any way how this would constitue an infringement of anything. but... regardless. my apologies again.

i did include a spoiler though.
