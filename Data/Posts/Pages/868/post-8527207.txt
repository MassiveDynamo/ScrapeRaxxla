and in other news, galnet seems to be back strong with the staggering amount of 1 articles for all of us free tinfoiled pilots to read and enjoy. i bet theres SOME link between those Nanomedicines and raxxla in there somewhere.... or is there? after all. it's not all fluff anymore.

sigh...the truth is, we've been dried out of content for so long, that we tinfoiled about pretty much everything at this point. i thought this would be some nice new and refreshing meals for us to munch on, even if it ended up being completely a hoax. imagine all the tinfoil goodies we could have extracted from that. thats a fresh new LEAD watson
SPOILER: NANOMACHINES, SON!
