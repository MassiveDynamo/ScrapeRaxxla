i know most of you are PC players, but just curious if anyone else is having sync issues with EDSM.... Im logged in thru frontier auth service and xbox login as I always do, but the dashboard keeps saying frontier auth service is unavailable... its done like 6 tries... i even logged out, closed my browser, cleared cookies and cache, and tried, still nothing

I know Frountier support has listed an Xbox issue, but thats been going on for days now and only seems to be effecting arx balance checks and the occational person being dropped from the server... nothing that should stop EDSM api from wokring....

Just wondering if its my computer/browser or if others are experiencing it too...


and back to topic... I found this link....

SPOILER: GALNEWS

and its says somthing that I was told a while ago wasnt true....

SPOILER: SPOILER

well, i was told by my friend a long time ago, that the stations dont have FSDs, just thrusters for orbit keeping ect... but this would seem to say that they do, and not only that stations have FSD drives, but that the stations do in fact move on occasion.

SPOILER: SPOILER


well... if stations can have FSD drives, it brings back the really old theory that I had a long time ago, that TDW station and possibly even Raxxla itself, depending on what it actually is, could infact be moving thru the game, from system to system... so finding it could be even harder than we thought as previously checked systems could still have the loaction if it moves into it....

I found a theory online elsewhere as well that mentions an idea that possibly Raxxla itself my be positionally locked to the Andromeda galaxay, and move as it moves, but that theory requires Raxxla to be a portal to that galaxy and the Raxxlan race of reptilians... so idk, but just worth mentioning....
