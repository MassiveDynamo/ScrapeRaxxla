Jacques station was a special station with an FSD that us players fueled to get to beagle point. However, it did not make it, and it landed in what is now known as the Colonia system.

REALLY? wow, lol cant bellieve i didnt know that..... kewl....

But does that complete negate the possibility of oother stations have FSDs? or am I just being overly liberal with the tin foil this month?
