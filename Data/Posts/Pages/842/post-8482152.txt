I had a moment ago typed out that yes there was one but it only had one player in it and I assumed they had stopped playing because they didn't have any other players. Afterwards I had went to inara to get the link to show you all and unfortunately inara says there is no such Squadron. Take that however you would like

Just a note, inara doesnt show all squardons in the game... for example mine doesnt show up....
I think you have to re-create your squadron in inara if you want it to show there...
