The 2 squadrons exists called "Dark Wheel" and "The Dark Wheel" (and not The Dark Wheel probably because the minor faction exists). "Dark Wheel" is just for fun, nothing serious with 12 members. Afaik anyone can join. "The Dark Wheel" only has 2 members though.
Interesting, yea I think it would have to be be much bigger for them to do anything about it. What I was thinking was more of a misinformation campaign which would cause confusion in the community. You could even work in some current hypothesis that people have come up with and say they’re definitely true. If fdev comes out and says it’s not then at the very least it would let us know we’re going in the wrong direction. Like I said though just a thought since it seems that this search has been going in circles for a while now
