Jacques Station is a one-off. It has an FSD and there was a community goal going back three or four years ago where the playerbase ran commodities to fuel the station for a jump to Beagle Point. It failed and then there was another CG to repair it. To my knowledge, there is no other station in game that has an FSD or can jump. Visually, the FSD is modeled on Jacques station. You can actually see the drives. Haven't see that anywhere else.

Coooool..... i didnt notice when i was there but I wasnt looking... I will on next trip...
