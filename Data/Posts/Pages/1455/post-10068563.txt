Can you solve this puzzle "Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key what am I?"

Here are a few ways to interpret the puzzle you provided:
"Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key": A keyhole is a small opening in a door that allows a key to be inserted to unlock the door. It is a place that isn't a place because it is a small hole or opening and it is also a door because it allows access to the locked space.
