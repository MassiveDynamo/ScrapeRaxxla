So the Ram Tah lore and his discoveries, yes I've read those but not in details for some time. Whilst I haven't personally ruled out that Raxxla is the construct, not knowing what it is means I haven't ruled out much

So weren't the glyphs used to identify which type of Guardian ancient artifacts you needed to complete his mission?
