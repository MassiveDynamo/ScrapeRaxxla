So after 8 years of looking, are we any closer to finding Raxxla? I'm all for the long answers, but yes or no would suffice, I get the feeling we are not, there is not enough info out there or we are missing something fundamental, either way, unless they want us to find it, I don't see how we can, 8 years is a long time looking.
