interesting theory...

"The Lord says the changing positions sometimes dictate motion, and change the meaning of the word. So does the mirroring of two symbols turned facing each other or turned opposite each other. All of these things change the meaning of the actual glyph. So this is an extremely limited written language that changes meaning every time you change the position of its characters." - did you really mean "the Lord"?? and what do you base this on and do you have some evidence to demonstrate it?

in terms of the images you mentioned can you put them on here?

"None of the markings are decorative. All of them have a purpose or an instructional reason."

Not trying to be sarcastic, but if you had read the logs you would know what phrases I’m talking about. There are phrases all throughout the Guardian logs and the hints are subtle.
I am using dictation. Every time I say the word lore Siri seems to get confused. So she substitutes Laura, Lord, and law, I try to correct it but sometimes I just can’t keep up with the . I have an entire Google photo album with certain phrases circled or underlined from the logs.
Crap. My link didn’t work. I will post it again
