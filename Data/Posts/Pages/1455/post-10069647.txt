Edit:
BUT from a gameplay, lore and common sense viewpoint I agree that (while it could be anywhere) it is highly likely to be near to the centre of the bubble, so Sol for the later game and Eranin (I think) for the beta game. But, if so then its system has almost certainly “been honked but Raxxla was not discovered” very many times! So the question is WHY are we not discovering it? Almost certainly it is not a normal astronomical body. It might be a moon (e.g. Saturn’s Atlas or Janus from my earlier reasoning) that is not normally visible & you have to exit SC with 50Km to see it (perhaps the true meaning of the invisible “comets”?), or a piece of Guardian graffiti saying “Raxxla was ‘ere”, or something 10+k ls from the ecliptic, or ...... or ...... ???

Edit2:
I’ve just been looking again at “everything we know about Raxxla, everything else is supposition”, i.e. My earlier post, to which I’ve added Drew Wagar’s reports of what DB said during the beta period at the Bafta ceremony, plus the Codex entry and Logo. I am more convinced than ever that Raxxla is (or is in) a disguised station (either Coriolis or Asteroid) in the bubble, and we may need to drop out of SC within 50Km to see it. I’m wondering again if the logo is a map telling us where to look, trying to put a new interpretation on it. Do we know what type of station Jaques originally had? I remember reading he had to upgrade it & wondering if we are actually looking for the original?

Edit3: the Wiki says he originally bought Peters Base, a Coriolis orbiting Facece. Perhaps his 40-year wanderings (does that make him the “vagabond”??) from then to his eventual misjump in his new Orbis might be a factor in finding Raxxla? But dont think they are documented.
