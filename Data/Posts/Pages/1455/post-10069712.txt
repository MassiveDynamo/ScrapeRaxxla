Details for the station in the wiki: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Jaques_Station
Yes, I had another look before my post at that wiki entry & also for stations & Coriolis. It’s that undocumented 40 year period of wandering (& is the length of that period significant?) between leaving Facece and his appearance in HIP 110620 in Feb 3301 that I find interesting. Nor are we told when he upgraded from the Coriolis to an Orbis, only that he did so. Why? And what became of the old Peters Base Coriolis??

We dont know much about the very early stations, except from the wiki I think they were similar to current Coriolis but smaller. But were they the same shape or just similar? I’m wondering if the outline of one would match the logo.
