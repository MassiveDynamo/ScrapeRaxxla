Do we know what type of station Jaques originally had? I remember reading he had to upgrade it & wondering if we are actually looking for the original?
Peter's Base was a Coriolis. If memory is serving me correctly, per "All that Glisters" he was instrumental in it's construction. It is therefore possible that Facece was originally known as Vetitice.



The Vetitice connection..



If one of the planets in Facece used to be called Vetitice, my guess is we are looking for the first Coriolis with dimensions of 1 kilometer on a side (modern Coriolis stations are 2 kilometers on a side). Shape should be isohedron and look very similar to a Guardian Orb - just obviously much larger. The one in Lave is the first full-scale version, I believe.



Modern Coriolis stations are cuboctahedrons with a 2-kilometer diameter. When it was first introduced by GalCop, the design had a much smaller diameter of 1 kilometer, but beginning in the 3200's the size was increased. By the 3300's, although new Coriolis stations continue to be built both within the Core Systems and out in the frontiers of the Colonia Region and Pleiades Nebula, maintaining them has become more costly as parts have become more difficult to procure or manufacture.[1]*

* - Per Elite Encounters RPG

In other words, are the Coriolis stations in Facece the current dimensions or not?

Approximate shape we are looking for..

Though, the major problem here is does it really match with the Raxxla Codex? No obviously but would be something concrete that would not immediately stand out unless you paid really close attention. Though, orbital installations would be really good for hiding something.
