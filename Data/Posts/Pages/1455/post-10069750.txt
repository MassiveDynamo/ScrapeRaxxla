And Iâ€™m drinking a ginger tea and pondering the hexagonal shapes of the Logo....needs a good brandy added!

A hexagon is an efficient mechanism for maximising spatial use with minimal materials, which is why bees use it for storage in honeycomb. Which brings to mind Thargoids, who are said to be an insectoidal species (though Ive not seen any evidence yet for that). Also the Guardain glyphs are based on repeated use of rotated triangles, which builds a basically hexagonal pattern - see the pic Artefacts for Decrypt the Guardian Logs mission on https://canonn.science/codex/ram-tah-decrypting-the-guardian-logs/

That same hexagonal/multiple triangle theme is also used by the Pilots Federation in the Navigation panel....
