2. Raxxla exists within a system -

However with this thinking they also said entered by a Commander not necessarily a player... A Commander this could also be left in the wind to mean a storyline character Commander such as lets say Jameson (Thargoid station from original war?),
Speaking of Thargoids ( and Raxxla ) ... Tonite i happened to stumble upon this---> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/titan-raijin-is-vulnerable.628673/page-7#post-10460173 very interesting symbol and it got me thinking:
Has anyone ever tried loading into cargo 1 of those old rare 'trinkets of hidden fortune' items while being in Thargoid system ( hyperdictions potential ) and into TITAN cloud zone + rocks zone where the big Thargoid spiral ship is? Just to see if maybe being in Thargoid proximity, particularly during 'metldown' phase , might trigger something with 'trinket' i dunno. -- i recall someone earlier speculating about possibility of Raxxla being invisible until player does something, like popping out of a hyperdiction for example.

Furthermore, has anyone ever taken the 'trinket of hidden fortune' into the GUARDIAN spire site area before? ( on ground )

Just theorizing here into the deep void of course....
