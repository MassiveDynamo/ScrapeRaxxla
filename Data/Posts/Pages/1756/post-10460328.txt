I would suggest that Raxxla may be a system or it may be a planet; we just don't know until someone finds it...if either of these then I think it is likely that it resides on FD server until a trigger is sent from the lucky player's client machine to signify " passing through the omphalos gateway" which would be in a system but is very difficult to find.

The proviso to that us that I think it is also possible that Raxxla is a huge diamond (or similarly valuable) asteroid hidden in a planetary belt around a planet somewhere.

Or it could be a Guardian ark ship hidden somewhere...

Mmm, this fence is getting very uncomfortable!!
