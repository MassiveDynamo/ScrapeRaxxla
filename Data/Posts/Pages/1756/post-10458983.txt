In the small hours lf the night a thought occurred...
IIRC either DB or MB said they were "surprised we hadn't found Raxxla by now"....
Or am I imagining that statement???
No your not, but I don’t think it was DB nor MB, I think it was a dev saying it during some stream or promotion, I do recall it, it’s a video, I can’t locate it, but it’s not in the archives and not mentioned in page one, but it certainly exists, we have reposted a link to it a few times in this thread, but… I’ve failed to track it down.
