Getting to belt cluster 3 in LAWD 27 is a bust. It's unreachable to me.

Tried different angles, different ships w/o SCO's, same result of getting caught by exclusion zone with too far to go and no hope of catching up to the belt.

It will move away from the exclusion zone if the orbit isn't perfectly spherical, so it may be reachable at another time.
