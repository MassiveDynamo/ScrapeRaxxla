Getting to belt cluster 3 in LAWD 27 is a bust. It's unreachable to me.

Tried different angles, different ships w/o SCO's, same result of getting caught by exclusion zone with too far to go and no hope of catching up to the belt.
Might be a completely stupid suggestion.... But I like stupid questions (I learnt lots with them!)... Is it possible to get in front of it at full speed and let it catch you reducing the speed differential....

And super cruise over charge would be of no help?
