In the small hours lf the night a thought occurred...
IIRC either DB or MB said they were "surprised we hadn't found Raxxla by now"....
Or am I imagining that statement???
As I recall there was a different story there, some commanders saw Raxxla and didn't realize it was her.
I mean, any of us who see Raxxla won't realize it's her either.
