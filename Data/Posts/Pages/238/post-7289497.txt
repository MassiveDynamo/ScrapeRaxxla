I think what we need here is a Google Doc or something (maybe I can get someone to update the Canonn Codex) about the most relevant information and leads we have gathered thus far. It seems new commanders want to help in the search and reading and sorting through 300+ Forum pages is becoming tedious.

A central source is always better than a fragmented one, but it's a lot of work and keeping it up-to-date can be time consuming.
