Yes, there is a Codex reference to a set of sonnets, but the name in the Codex is slightly different from the real set of sonnets. Anything beyond that is hypothetical. You are assuming the sonnets contain a set of clues and interpreting them, this does not prove they do contain clues, nor that the interpretations are correct. You may be correct, you may not. There is plenty of room in this thread for other interpretations.

Well, "Spiralling stars" in "Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" could as well be a link to WR104, which is literally known as spiralling stars (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WR_104)
Do we have that one in Elite? Google didn't return exact result, and can't look ingame right now.
As for Astrophell part, there's not only that "Astrophel and Stella" sonnet sequence, but also a poem, called Astrophel, which was written as a tribute to the name of Philip Sidney (author of Astrophel and Stella).

Not that it gets us any closer, need to read through that Astrophel thing and look for connections.

As a side note: looking through eagle nebula - those F-stars look strange, i'll try to convert them in 11 plains with stars marked, could be some kind of a pointer. Raxxla is 100% not there, as they are well scanned already, still a nice place to visit, with bio-sygnals on some planets, and crystalls in space.
