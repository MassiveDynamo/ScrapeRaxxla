Are they the ones that coerced you into signing up for DW2?


I have no such excuse; I admit it, space madness has got to me. But I’ll be alright, I have a pet Guardian to keep me company out in the cold dark black. I keep him in a cupboard in the cockpit & call him Herbert, he just looks like a well-stuffed parrot. Which reminds me, where did the ship’s cat get to? [where is it][where is it]
