Imho, first resolve the 'tiny bit obvious' part. Find TrDW 'non emissive' station. (The Codex says how to achieve it.)
Then Astrophel may help, (but only our excellent English-speaker fellow players).

I haven't really bothered with the Codex, it doesn't serve the purpose I originally thought it might, so I've not read how it says how to find the dark station - I'm away from my gaming rig for a few days, would someone mind posting the section where it does this please?

And really Scytale, if English is not your first language, then you could have fooled me, it is impeccable! Astrophel is written in 16th Century poetic style, and not an easy read. It's a bit like reading Shakespeare and needing to understand vernacular speech, the history if the times, and some myth and legend as well. Not straightforward, and a challenge for even English literature students, I would say
