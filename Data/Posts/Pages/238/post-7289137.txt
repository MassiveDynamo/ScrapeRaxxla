Just pondering on the issue surrounding the Sonnets which I haven't really given much attention until now, but what if its being read too literally?

The toast could simply point towards an area (H&S?), and yes maybe the Sonnets are a road map...

However (and stop me if this has been covered before) the names are derived from the Greek language. Is it plausible the sonnets could also reference Homers Odyssey. There are 108 sonnets.

In the Odyssey there were 108 suitors of Penelope. These suitors could be the 'spiralling stars' vying for her attention.
