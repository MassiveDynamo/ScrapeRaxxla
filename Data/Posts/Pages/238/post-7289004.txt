I’ve gone through a ton of this thread, but 300+ pages is a lot and it seems like more potential clues have been discussed in the latter pages. Is there a more recent summary or can someone who’s been following for a long time post a kind of summary of current info from this thread if they’re willing?
That'd be great. Would like to pick up and contribute, really enjoy exploring currently. But too much loose ends, completely lost where to start and what are the major findings/clues so far.
