Back playing around with Thargoids and Guardians... wondering if the barnacle seeding and meta-alloys is not just a biological imperative... Or a means to create motherships... but an ancient Task passed down from before they came to our galaxy.... an intended cog in a larger machine. How does Merope fit in?


SPOILER: THE TASK


Everything should be in Threes though...

SPOILER: PRETTY SURE IVE TRIED THIS BEFORE
