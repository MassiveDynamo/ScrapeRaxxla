Im still not getting notifications for this thread and i actually follow a good few of you. I cant seem to figure out why its like this....

@alexzk , you wouldnt be able to put the image directly to the forum could you? Imgur makes me think i need emergency laser corrective surgery

Notifications have been playing up for a while on the forums (fora?). I monitor about a dozen threads and don't always get notification of an update. Sometimes don't even get a notification that somebodyâ€™s liked one of my posts. I often sulk in a corner!
