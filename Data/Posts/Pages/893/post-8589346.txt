You need to write own tool. Or explorers forums has topic, guy there did a clone of DB and makes pictures, like visitied W-R, too hot NS etc. Ask him.
I started to do one for rings ... queries EDSM for up-to 100ly around something, then selects rings. But amount of variants is huge of what you want to query. I could make some generic, for example you do query using Lua.

Nah, my expertise with software is limited to pulling on a woolly jumper when the weather turns cold! I even failed to download the EDSM database into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.
