Iâ€™m trying to figure out how I can use EDDB/bodies, EDSM/bodies, Spansh/search etc to find a system with something and something else, but failing at the moment. Say a NS and a water giant, or a Red Dwarf and an ELW, or a Wolf Rayet and a NS.
Any ideas?
You need to write own tool. Or explorers forums has topic, guy there did a clone of DB and makes pictures, like visitied W-R, too hot NS etc. Ask him.
I started to do one for rings ... queries EDSM for up-to 100ly around something, then selects rings. But amount of variants is huge of what you want to query. I could make some generic, for example you do query using Lua.
