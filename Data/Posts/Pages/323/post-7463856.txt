We have Lagrange clouds, which could be a hint that this mechanic might work. Even though clouds would not accumulate at unstable points, as L2. A station could stay at L2 with little energy for position correction.

It works. There is a Lagrange point planet in Alpha Centauri. It's called Lagrange.
