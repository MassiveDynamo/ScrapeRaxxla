Yes. When I put Raxxla in those fan novels I was trying to figure out a way to have Raxxla be a portal and a planet (as per description in the Dark Wheel) which had somehow not been found despite decades of searching. I figured it had to be meta-physical in some manner, hence the wierdness/witchspace implementation in Mutabilis. I'd do it differently now (not that I have anything to do with Raxxla in ED I hasten to add), but that sort of slightly ethereal, magical, otherworldness struck me as quite a good way of realising Raxxla.

A way to make that idea work with the features available at game release would be: make a planet that's also a hyper wake, in that if a player targets the planet and activates their FSD to jump (not to supercruise), the ship jumps somewhere. This would also fit the whole "door that is also the key" phrase.
