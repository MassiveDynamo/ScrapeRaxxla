Oh good. Well, I was recently given 20 courier missions from the bubble to Colonia, not boom data delivery, if that's a matter. Since then, 1 week ago today, I have discovered 7 crashed ships sites (not rng wreckage) and 2 Unknown Wreckage sites. The UW sites appear to be something large like pieces of a station, however the logs appear to indicate it is a ship of sorts. 1 crash site has 4 ships and the log for that site appears to suggest non-human contact, as does one of the UW sites. 5 of the crashed ships were discovered through tip offs, all the rest were found through deciphering mythology related trackstl associated with Alexander the Greats travels.

To my great pleasure, the original missions sent me to Deriso, which means derision, or to mock. I figure at this point (hopefully) I will finally be given the evidence to put the mockery in its place.

Edit* I recently heard of cmdrs scanning logs of megaships which have been leading to tipoffs which I thought was interesting. It's not my approach, but good to see someone's getting results from investigative work.
