Not this wreckage is it? https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/264118-23810-Prototype-wrecks-WIP
We were finding strange wreckage 3 years ago. Seemed to be a mix of alien encounter and fsd sabotage/failure. Didnâ€™t lead to anything at the time, but maybe it might now.

They look very similar, though those look very much Intact and unscathed. Whereas mine have been wrecked and have had "Server Banks" which cannot be collected or scanned and Comms Beacons which can be scanned. I'll post photos when I get home. Btw, these Colonia missions were related to The Low Profile Workshop Faction
