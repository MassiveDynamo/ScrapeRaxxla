Beor returns that system because there is a planet in that system called Beorg (the Galmap search returns some planet names as well as system names and stations - searching for the system Ara was a nightmare!). It's unusual to have a named Ammonia World but the station orbiting it has a slightly different configuration of name, which makes me wonder if this was named by a backer. I don't think it's a re-named Beor.

Thanks for the clarification! I haven't been there since the restart of my account, so I couldn't look for a named planet.
