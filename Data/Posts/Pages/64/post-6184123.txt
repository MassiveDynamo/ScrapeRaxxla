It's not 8000 something ly back from the Zurara, is it? [big grin]

The Zura...what?
This storyline abomination is the filthy substitute of the original FR Mystery !
I am still convinced that the Rift has been misplaced in the range of one galactic arm, and should be in the Orio-Persean Gap (Just as the Old Lady said: ...until the end of the arm...).
There, Raxxla floating obfuscated in the outer rim (of our arm, the arm) and the " Raxxlian " capturing every ship passing by and sending them through the gateway to...wherever. They'd like it or not.
Which binds Raxxla to the origins of the Rift myth of ships disappearing, almost as much as having The Children of Raxxla messing around with the Formidine Rift storyline as the main role stars.
So...genuine.
