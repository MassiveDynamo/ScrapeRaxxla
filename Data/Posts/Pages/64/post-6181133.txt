But again, so : The mission-giver was not in Shinrarta. So if he means "outer rim" of a system he would mean of HIS system, otherwise he would have precised what system outer rim... IMHO

Right.

Honestly the biggest hurdle is the fact that these missions apparently got scrubbed. My personal belief (held without much evidence) is that the subtext of "obfuscated in the outer rim" was intended to convey a sense of being brought into initial contact with The Dark Wheel. I think later missions, once you were tuned into what was going on, would probably have read "elucidated in the inner circle". Alas, I think there was some backpedaling on Frontier's part with the realization that too many clues delivered so early in the game's history would result in us finding Raxxla to quickly and before the game engine was mature enough to make the discovery as rich as it should be.

I don't think they want us to find Raxxla. Not yet anyway.
