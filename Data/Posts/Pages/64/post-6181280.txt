Our Addams pet-penguin is unbeatable at this kind of exercises.

None of the 88 modern constellations has a name that's going to fit with those letters.
Maybe there's a system called 'Perimeter' somewhere.

Oooh! There IS the Perimeter nebula...

We've been told that nebulae are good places to hide (obfuscate) things. I might almost comsider that significant enough to follow up on.

[Edit]
Finally got in-game and no sign of the Perimeter nebula - seems it's player-named as part of the Galactic Mapping project. Back to the drawing board
