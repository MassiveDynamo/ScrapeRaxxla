I'm of the opinion that any 'clue' that pertains to Raxxla's location will be something like this: An ancient satellite signal somewhere out deep in the milky way in a particular system in one of the many underexplored regions, similar in nature to the voyager probes only a few centuries more advanced. It will lead to a planet just like so many listening post, where a ship will be found crashed a long time ago. The ship's data logs will be glitched from age and give spare and crude coordinates that when triangulated will lead, not to Raxxla, but to a distant, abandoned Dark Wheel base. The base's logs will contain dairies of one Jason Ryder, which mention a string of systems he once visited, and when each one is visited will reveal evidence to Raxxla's real existence. Hints that when accumulated reveal a trail....

It turns out Raxxla just "might" have some 'clues' to its existence afterall. https://player.twitch.tv/?volume=0.8&video=v66487974&time=1h40m30s
