The Thetis might be one worth keeping an eye on and scouring over again. Not just the system its found in, but particularly LHS 2206, the system that the mysterious "kill them all" whisper from space originated. "To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts". One might begin to think these could be referring to the gen ships?
Yeah, the Thetis story's an interesting one! I started having a re-look at the Thetis a few weeks back, but something else came up. Minor point though - LHS 2206 isn't the system that the message originated from. It's the system that has the Listening Post that leads to the Tethis. The big thing with the Thetis is trying to find the planet where the signal came from. (Unless someone's made a pretty big discovery and it's just not been widely reported?)
