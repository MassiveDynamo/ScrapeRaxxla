It makes me wonder how easily anything further afield might be missed but with all the mapping I've seen beyond the Bubble, they would have to be ~3.5+ KLY out to stand a good chance of not having been visited.

Before the more recent changes to exploration (I wasn't here for this, but from the way it sounds), it would be real possible that people have mapped systems that contain Generation Ships (some of them even now, considering you have to fly for a few thousand ls out from a random planet). Other than the few that are easy to find, we would have to find more listening posts with no clue where to look. There's a lot of people flying around that wouldn't know to report or look at a listening post if they found one, too (me, three weeks ago for example). I have to consider it possible that there's more out there (probably likely even), but if that's the case, we don't have much of a choice other than tooling around until more clues are found. I'm hoping we have enough to solve it already lol.
