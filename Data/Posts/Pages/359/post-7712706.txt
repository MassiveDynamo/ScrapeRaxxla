On a slightly different topic, the Thetis message was being touted as a possible interpretation of 'whisperer in witchspace' at some point. When I went back to look at it a few weeks back, it was similarly inspired but by 'siren song of the void' instead.

There's a definite parallel in that it's something that when heard by passing sailors would result in the death of all those on the ship. (If suitable precautions weren't taken, anyway!) It's not a perfect fit, but was enough to warrant a re-visit. Nothing exciting to report though, or would have reported it already.

Yeah I was going back and forth on that one too. The quote from the Epimetheus log having both "siren" and "the void" inside of two sentences made me give that one over. I was initially thinking it was sirens like The Odyssey as well (back to the Cassiopeia myth, Poseidon and his Nereids were involved).

"By the ninth day, the siren had stopped, but no one had come for Joe; he survived thanks to automated systems that provided him with food and water, and disposed of his waste, but could not accept that he would be trapped alone in his cell on the Epimetheus indefinitely. By the time of Joe's final log on day 1,047, he had lapsed into insanity and believed that his isolation was a deliberate test which "the void" was trying to help him solve. "

Edit: Oh man, had a funny (far-fetched) thought. The isolation was a test the void was helping him with. Isolation like Solo mode? "A journey everyone must complete on their own"? I would slap Braben's face for that lol.
