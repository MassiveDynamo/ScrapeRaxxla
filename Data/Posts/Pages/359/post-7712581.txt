The Thetis might be one worth keeping an eye on and scouring over again. Not just the system its found in, but particularly LHS 2206, the system that the mysterious "kill them all" whisper from space originated. "To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts". One might begin to think these could be referring to the gen ships?
So I actually seen you say that before, but thought you were just trolling me for April 1st. Do you have a source for this LHS 2206 claim? How are you so sure? Afaik, the logs only mention "15ly ago" on a message we could only estimate where it was when it was recorded.

I mean, it's two jumps out, I'll go have a look. Just know that if you come back with "April fools" nonsense, I will find you.
