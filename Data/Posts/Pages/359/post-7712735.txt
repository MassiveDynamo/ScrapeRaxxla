Yeah, the Thetis story's an interesting one! I started having a re-look at the Thetis a few weeks back, but something else came up. Minor point though - LHS 2206 isn't the system that the message originated from. It's the system that has the Listening Post that leads to the Tethis. The big thing with the Thetis is trying to find the planet where the signal came from. (Unless someone's made a pretty big discovery and it's just not been widely reported?)

Interesting. 70.000 deep space ships. One could stumbled on something and some kind of"order 66" was issued.
Wild stretch, but hey humanity is "ingenious" sometimes.
