The only thing we can go by is there are 70,000 Generation Ships. Some probably make it and other didn't. Wonder what are the probability of how many failed.

The first Generation Ship was launched at 2097

At some point Generation Ship's were considered obsolete so they stopped making them. Due to the development of hyperspace jumps

I'm not sure how creditable this info is on this sites from this point.
