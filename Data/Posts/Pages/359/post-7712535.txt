Curiously does Lazarus Expedition sound or fit with " Yearning of our Vagabond Hearts"?
It involves the population getting too large for their life boats, and volunteers who stay behind to drift until their death. They were wanderers in a sense, hard to say. The fact that nothing meaningful ever came of these Generation Ships makes me think we are definitely missing something with them. If it does match up at all, it would be another one like the Thetis, that would give us an area to look for something. Not a talking planet but where they started civilizations. They supposedly launched lifeboats to several inhabitable planets.
