Another thing I also like to point out that an Elite book (no longer can remember which one) mention about avoiding listening to the comms due to the some strange signal coming from it. I'm not sure if 2 and 2 can be put together or the idea came from the book itself.
Hmm, that rings a bell, but can't place it either. You sure it was an Elite book? Just wondering if it's inspired by, or a homage to, another story.

Anyway, I do hope that the Thetis was done taking into account what must have happened with the planet in question subsequently. Slightly concerned that it might just be the logs, and there's nothing more to it. (It's still pretty great though! )

On a slightly different topic, the Thetis message was being touted as a possible interpretation of 'whisperer in witchspace' at some point. When I went back to look at it a few weeks back, it was similarly inspired but by 'siren song of the void' instead.

There's a definite parallel in that it's something that when heard by passing sailors would result in the death of all those on the ship. (If suitable precautions weren't taken, anyway!) It's not a perfect fit, but was enough to warrant a re-visit. Nothing exciting to report though, or would have reported it already.
