Jorki - if picked up from Control may need delivering to HQ or Expansion or Fortifying, I think. theres a few different materials to go different places. Aisling Duval is just a major major troll, shes never happy with what you deliver, where you deliver it or even who you shot and where you hand those in. I lost 3 days working for this spoiled little brat before she even gave me 1 merit...and I thought I had understood it before starting. So good luck, you'll need it.

It came up on the IRH Discord in @Jermainwelch 's #blackflight-unstable-data-core channel and the black flight stuff caused a bit of a stir.

Black DBX are associated with a certain club, small 'c' for now. But who is/are the Lonegans? PMF or something?

And with the grammar mistakes Id say it was obviously written by someone in a 2nd language.

Their trying to take control - 'They are' becomes 'They're' not 'Their'
