Near body Alakarakmo 7 A, no apparent target... "Lonegan" is apparently a typo for "Lonnegan Brothers." There's a lively discussion going on at the discord (https://discord.gg/bfMXJr4 #blackflight-unstable...) ... we're trying to work out what route he used to attract the black flight's attention...

SPOILER: BIG IMAGE

I thought all LP had to have a target, are you sure itâ€™s not a UCB? And where is the Diamond Bear log-presumably from a crashed ship that the LP/UCB leads to?
