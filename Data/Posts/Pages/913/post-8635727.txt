Lonegan gang is one of the factions/gangs that are fighting at the unauthorized installation (orbiting the same body as the convoy beacon) in Isinor. The battle is, oddly, mostly fed ships vs imps, but i think both groups are listed as independent (cutters vs corvettes etc + other stuff.) They tend to scan for cargo, but do not appear to normally be wanted like normal pirates.
