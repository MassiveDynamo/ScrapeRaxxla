Jorki - if picked up from Control may need delivering to HQ or Expansion or Fortifying, I think. theres a few different materials to go different places. Aisling Duval is just a major major troll, shes never happy with what you deliver, where you deliver it or even who you shot and where you hand those in. I lost 3 days working for this spoiled little brat before she even gave me 1 merit...and I thought I had understood it before starting. So good luck, you'll need it.



Black DBX are associated with a certain club, small 'c' for now. But who is/are the Lonegans? PMF or something?

And with the grammar mistakes Id say it was obviously written by someone in a 2nd language.

Their trying to take control - 'They are' becomes 'They're' not 'Their'

There is a lot of spelling errors ive noticed in the codex too. They spelled 'botched' as 'bodged' in one of the sections. That's all that comes to mind atm but i bet it makes translating a nuisance
