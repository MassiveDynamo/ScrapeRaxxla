Thanks Cmdr!
However I won’t follow it up. I’m not at all into PowerPlay, the characters are two dimensional for my taste and without even Galnet posts to give them some “life” it doesn’t interest me. I think PP is an extremely poor substitute for a storyline. I’m only doing Aisling (pardon the phrasing!) to get some prismatic shields for a couple of passenger ships I’ve bought and am engineering before pursuing passenger missions and (unrelated) the rest of the system permits. Well, when I get back to that after taking the last few months off to help Han_Zen in his sysmap anomalies investigation (I suspect they’re the output from Raxxla).
