Ok, want to get some prismatic shields. Been pledged for over 4 weeks now -GIP (grandchildren-interrupted play!). Now picked up some Aisling propaganda media at an Aisling control station I was at but cant now deliver it, tried three different stations in two different systems (both fortifying for Aisling). Does it have to come from Cubeo? What can I do with the media I’ve got filling the hold? Should I deliver it to a different power’s system??

Is this a programme bug? Why is it for sale at control stations if it cant then be delivered??
