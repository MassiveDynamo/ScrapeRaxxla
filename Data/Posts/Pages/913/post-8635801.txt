This picture shows the actual in-game listening post named "Distress Call: Diamond Bear" and the text. I don't see any indication of a target in the text. The system has been searched by 3 or 4 players and nobody has noticed anything out of the ordinary.
SPOILER: BIG PICTURE

Ok, will add it to the spreadsheet asap (possibly tomorrow, if I donâ€™t melt first!)
