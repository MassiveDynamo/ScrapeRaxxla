There is a lot of spelling errors ive noticed in the codex too. They spelled 'botched' as 'bodged' in one of the sections. That's all that comes to mind atm but i bet it makes translating a nuisance

Botched & bodged are two similar UK English words, meaning (nowadays) just about the same thing. But FD do seem to have a large Dyslexia minor faction!

Edit: a bodger traditionally was an itinerant craftsman who produced chair legs etc from green wood using a polelathe. At some stage it became slang for a poor craftsman and then became confused with botcher.
