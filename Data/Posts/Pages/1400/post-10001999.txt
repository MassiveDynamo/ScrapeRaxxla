The Mimas Conspiracy, part 3.
As promised, here's all my convos with CS regarding Mimas, Saturn and it's moons. I will be posting my investigations into Saturn later on but you can see some of them are here in my email to CS. Make of this what you will Raxxla Hunters!

NOTE: I think this well is dry, I don't think bugging CS with more questions about Saturn will get anywhere. I'm certainly going to give them a rest for a while.

TLDR:
Q: Why is Mimas Missing?
A: "This particular case would be an intentional design decision"

Q: Mimas' exclusion has no deeper significance than an arbitrary design decision?
A: "I'm afraid we have no further information beyond that already provided in regards to Mimas not being included by intentional design."

Q: Points out other things that mismatch betwen IRL Saturn & moons, and in-game
A: "We cannot comment on specific design decisions for Saturn's moons any further than we already have. We appreciate your enthusiasm, but this is not something we can elaborate any further on."

Q: Why can't you comment on them?
A: "We have already told you all the information we have about Saturns moons, and there is nothing further we can elaborate on."











Again, mad respect to CS for putting up with me that long.

And I now think about the amount of time I've spent in Saturn's rings looking for the decayed Death Star Mimas that created the illusive void in Saturn's ring - thank you for your perseverance with CS.
