I've found something peculiar, a what looks like disappearing orange binary and an small orange trianary (180 degrees behind the binary) on the background of stars, along with another 5 or 6 background stars that are inline with the binary - (?bug or something by design that I've not seen elsewhere in the game) in COL 359 Sector DA-Q D5-17. Both take turns to disappear as they are approached and the centre point between the two can be reached both in supercruise and in normal space. I've reproduced the stars here in this video, one of a series of 4 videos I've produced from different perspectives:

- The tin foil started when I split the letters of RAXXLA into alternate Egyption and Greek alphabets. It's been said that there are no clues in the game, so the probability that the name RAXXLA could produce results is unlikely. However I found this system using alternate Hieroglyphics and Greek - For "RA" - Hieroglyphics R is a Vulture (Lyra), Greek A (Alpha), giving Alpha Lyrae (Vega). For "XX" - In Hieroglyphics, X is a Basket (Sagittarius in Chinese astronomy), in Greek X is Chi (Chi Sagittarii which consists of 3 stars x1, x2 and x3, all in an almost straight line cluster and just North of the 1977 discovery of the 'WOW' signal. For "LA" In Hieroglyphics, L is a Lion (Leo), Greek A (Alpha), giving Alpha Leonis (Regulus). Triangulating theses three systems, Vega, Regulus and specifically using star X2 of Chi Sagittarii (48 Chi Sagittarii in game), chosen as it was closest of the three Chi Sagittarii stars to the 1977 WoW signal discovery, I found that he centroid for those three systems is around COL 359 Sector DA-Q D5-17 - the subject of this video! Has anyone seen this happen before? The stars don't appear to correlate to any star systems on the galaxy map and are not related to the stargoids on FSS.
