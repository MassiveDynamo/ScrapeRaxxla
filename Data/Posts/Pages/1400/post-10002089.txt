Many thanks for your reply:

"Needs to be repeated by another to be verified in my opinion but off the cuff it looks more like a graphical or instance bug?"

-- Agreed - I am happy to remain in the instance and 'team' to invite someone to the exact normal space location.

"Are you in the system which this anomaly occurs or in a different system?"

-- I'm in the same system as in the video - I have been to local systems and the peculiarities do not occur there.

"If your in a different system, then you're in a different ‘instance’ so those stars ought to be presented within the flat 2D image of the galaxy, which forms around your visual background."

-- As Above

"If you’re in those system/s then they could glitch for some reason unknown? Needs replication to rule out. Report it to FD as a bug."

-- ?Bug already reported - - I expect it to expire unnoticed by FDEV

Yes, quite likely to be ignored by FD. This is why it needs to be observed by several people-I think an issue report has to be supported by at least 3 others to pass the first level of FD filtering before a dev will look at the problem. Pragmatic approach to control dev loading but IMHO pretty daft approach in a simulation of 400 billion systems.
