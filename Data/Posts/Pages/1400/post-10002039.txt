if it is not targetable, is it relevant?
a better hexagon to look for is as mentioned, finding one that is targetable and then if viewed from behind something else, appears as the dotted hexagon.
such as a black hole, or a moon
go up to every suspect body and see if it has a targetable hex on its backside
