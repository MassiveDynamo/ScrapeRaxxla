I dont engage in Bubble research stuff really but im sure you can pull the information of eddb or some other website its all in the API information, The science is easy enough to look up academic sources but again the requirements to get the Hexagon formation are very specific, if you cannot see it the chances are high its for a reason... and 'Raxxla' is not that reason.
Lol... ok, well thanks for the suggestion but it's not in the scope of my study. If you want to check out oribital stuff yourself then please do, I'll be thrilled with the help.
