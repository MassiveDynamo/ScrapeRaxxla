We're going to have to agree to disagree on this one
To be fair Alienz is at least a couple pegs higher up than religion, but yeh Sol is unimportant its just humans are OBSCESSED with the idea we are the centre of everything, Sol is unimportant and theres no natural or unnatural secret reason of grand importance for us except human ego, As gas giants go none of ours are practically special in any way, again look to the science for answers.
Turn from the darkness that is the land of the blinds "But mah Sol/But mah Sidey/But mah Mythology" piedpipers and research the science laid before you by Fdev.
