Are you in the system which this anomaly occurs or in a different system?

If your in a different system, then your in a different ‘instance’ so those stars ought to be presented within the flat 2D image of the galaxy, which forms around your visual background.

If that’s the case it’s odd if they glitch in that way because they like all the other stars in the back drop are not actually there, it’s just a graphical illusion.

If you’re in those system/s then they could glitch for some reason unknown? Needs replication to rule out. Report it to FD as a bug.

Many thanks for your reply:

"Needs to be repeated by another to be verified in my opinion but off the cuff it looks more like a graphical or instance bug?"

-- Agreed - I am happy to remain in the instance and 'team' to invite someone to the exact normal space location.

"Are you in the system which this anomaly occurs or in a different system?"

-- I'm in the same system as in the video - I have been to local systems and the peculiarities do not occur there.

"If your in a different system, then you're in a different ‘instance’ so those stars ought to be presented within the flat 2D image of the galaxy, which forms around your visual background."

-- As Above

"If you’re in those system/s then they could glitch for some reason unknown? Needs replication to rule out. Report it to FD as a bug."

-- ?Bug already reported - https://issues.frontierstore.net/issue-detail/55419 - I expect it to expire unnoticed by FDEV
