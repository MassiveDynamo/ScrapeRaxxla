Incorrect, Rossby Wave Deformations, its incredibly basic science if someones ever told you "Teh Alienz" you should block them as a idiot trying to hinder actual progress.
IRL I totally agree - but we're playing a computer game where we fly around FTL and shoot aliens I think given the context - this is a fictional computer game where an Ancient Alien Relic was found on Mars in 2280, and there's an Ancient Alien race known to have existed relatively close to human space a couple of million years ago - I don't think it's silly to bring up aliens, even a little bit

Remember - this is a computer game, not a scientific discussion about real life.

Edit: Oh yeah, lol, this thread is literally about a planet linked to an alien portal-gateway to an alternative universe too...

.. so yeah, chill
