I forget which moons are responsible for the cycle on Saturns formation of it but I can assure you it is orbital resonance cycle related and that from the last I checked the game does include the specific dataset required for ingame inclusion of the formation, and can confirm also that usage of FluidDynamics has been heavily focused on by Fdev as it was crucial to calculating nigh on all that we see and for accurately adding in and distributing the Darkmatter and Normal Matter in the galaxy as you cannot calculate it from Elemental Distribution charts alone nor does the Schwartzchild Metric deal with the distribution as it doesnt handle moving and rotating space/time vectors, thus they needed to use the Kerr Metric.
We can confirm beyond any shadow of a doubt that Fluid dynamics played this crucial role and thus is used ingame by looking at the Elemental Shell distribution waves across the galaxy, those sudden shifts to O, A and B rich areas to the sudden walls of brown dwarfs... Again I assure you if you want to no-life a month like I did during Covid lockdown and start collecting the data and running the checks you will see that Fdev's distribution is shockingly very accurate despite some obvious issues (all caused by importing from multiple papers and indexes)
I would as this requires a very specific orbital resonance conclude that either the moons are not in the same resonance anymore or, more than likely Fdev havnt included the overlay for the Hexagon as no matter how well it was blended on the edges it would be very obvious its a image layed ontop of another.
