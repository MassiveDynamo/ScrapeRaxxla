IRL I totally agree - but we're playing a computer game where we fly around FTL and shoot aliens I think given the context - this is a fictional computer game where an Ancient Alien Relic was found on Mars in 2280, and there's an Ancient Alien race known to have existed relatively close to human space a couple of million years ago - I don't think it's silly to bring up aliens, even a little bit

Remember - this is a computer game, not a scientific discussion about real life.
You do not proffer forward "Alienz" as a solution without there being actual evidence of it unless your prepared to start hosting a show on the 'history' channel and get a really bad hair do!... Stick to what Fdev gave you ingame without adding additional Koolaide to the mix.
This is a scientific discussion this is why Canonn and the others made such a mess on frankly everything... The Hexagon pattern as stated repeats over and over and over again throughout nature, in fact did you know that the Raxxla logo Hexagon even has a Audio Resonance produced in the same form as Gas giants Rossby Wave Deformations, Specifically for what a PlankScale 2D Wormhole would look like...
(Rushed example to show point...)
