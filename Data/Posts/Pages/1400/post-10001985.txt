Thinking on the Thargoid bases or map rooms, has anyone done a proper map of it’s exterior shape (granted it’s half buried). Also has any mapping been conducted of its interior layout and central chambers?

I’ve only been to one before in the past, looking for evidence towards going again and plotting their shape and dimensions, but be cool if it’s already been done.
