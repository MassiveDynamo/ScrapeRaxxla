Tried selling trinkets, sap 8, and the prohibited research stuff to The dark wheel, and a few other factions with no results. Note: have not yet tried selling a whole set ( all the items the mil couriers carry). Flew to a ton of stations, and did not see any missions related to the cargo. Bevan's Hope seemed to have a much higher spawn rate of mil couriers than altair. Next I am going to chase down a possible link to the "metadrive" mentioned in galnet a while ago. ( sirius & alioth) Perhaps the cargo is the raw materials to build something ( possibly new fsd), and only a specific faction can build it for us?

Edit:
There were a few stange npc names. One har the name of the writer of " the dark wheel" ( in altair). Probably just random chance, but still strange. The other was like 3 groups of 3 letters seperated by underscores. ( initials maybe?)
