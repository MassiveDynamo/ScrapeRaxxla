Panpiper tested the Sap 8 Cores on the Thargoid sites. He said "Testing so far has revealed nothing. Thargoids dont mind you carrying them, they scan and ignore the containers too. Thargoid structures do not accept them. Had to test all possibilities." He sent this lovely postcard as well. Thank you CMDR Panpiper!

CMDR Panpiper and CMDR Varigor managed to tank the damage and extract up to five of them this morning!! Testing is ongoing.

Very nice work, CMDRs!

Interesting that the courier had a Thargoid sensor onboard. Found a courier, it was stuffed with Point defences, could not get past them, blew it up. Ah well.
