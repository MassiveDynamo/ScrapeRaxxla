Interesting, as short time ago I posted a system first discovered by "Holdstock". Do you remember the exact name of the NPC ?
Anyway, it seems weird things are happening around these Military Couriers... If actually related to Raxxla, do FD want us to play in wings and pewpew to solve this Quest ? Would be in SS's line... The personal journey-thing would no longer be a point... Also, it seems TDW is missing the party...

Maybe one of those NPC's holds an item we don't know about yet but that would be needed to solve that riddle?
