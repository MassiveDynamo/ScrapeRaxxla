Very nice work, CMDRs!

Interesting that the courier had a Thargoid sensor onboard. Found a courier, it was stuffed with Point defences, could not get past them, blew it up. Ah well.

Same goes to you, sorry you blew up but at least you tried. We were 3 ships, one of them not shooting at all and just scooping cargo (to avoid too much attraction). The first time looked quite easy, but I think the second was a bit of a rush moment, too much fire, too much chaos, too many police ships and too few thrusters!

Good thing we secured enough containers for some testing. I'm happy to wing up again to get a few more.

Varigor and panpiper are great wing mates, it was really fun, friendly environment and I learned a lot from them today. 10/10 I'll repeat again!
