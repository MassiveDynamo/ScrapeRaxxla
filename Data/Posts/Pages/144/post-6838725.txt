There were a few stange npc names. One har the name of the writer of " the dark wheel" ( in altair). Probably just random chance, but still strange. The other was like 3 groups of 3 letters seperated by underscores. ( initials maybe?)

Interesting, as short time ago I posted a system first discovered by "Holdstock". Do you remember the exact name of the NPC ?
Anyway, it seems weird things are happening around these Military Couriers... If actually related to Raxxla, do FD want us to play in wings and pewpew to solve this Quest ? Would be in SS's line... The personal journey-thing would no longer be a point... Also, it seems TDW is missing the party...

For preventing Cosmic Gonorrhea ?
