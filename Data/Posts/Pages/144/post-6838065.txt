The Point Defense can be beat with 3 missile racks (preferably engineered for high capacity). Attacking the PD from the broad side seems to work best as it mostly avoids the missiles hitting any other part of the ship. The first PD take a lot of missiles to destroy, but the last few usually go do in a single volley. The Conda build I have been using to pick them clean is: 3 missile racks (2x small, 1x med), Rail Gun (feedback cascade, medium), and assorted pulse lasers on the remaining hardpoints. A fighter bay is useful to keep the ship from interrupting the main ship's scooping. 2x 5A Cargo Collectors and 1x 5A Hatch Breaker.

That being said, combat is not even required. The group(s) behind the courier apparently have yet to unlock Prof Palin, or the Tech Broker CRCR so if you are patient the thargoid items will eat the cargo hatch for you. (Only negatives are that it takes much longer, and you need to be able to reliably follow their wakes) The npc does not appear to drop cargo in supercruise, and only appears to do so after dropping out.

I have Pack-Hound missiles, I'll give those a try.

Same goes to you, sorry you blew up but at least you tried. We were 3 ships, one of them not shooting at all and just scooping cargo (to avoid too much attraction). The first time looked quite easy, but I think the second was a bit of a rush moment, too much fire, too much chaos, too many police ships and too few thrusters!

Good thing we secured enough containers for some testing. I'm happy to wing up again to get a few more.

Varigor and panpiper are great wing mates, it was really fun, friendly environment and I learned a lot from them today. 10/10 I'll repeat again!

Fortunately it was the Imperial Courier Vessel, the Imperial Cutter that blew up and not me

I was lucky that the Imperial Cutter high waked to an Anarchy system, so I had plenty of time to work it.
