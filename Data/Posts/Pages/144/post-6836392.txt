Panpiper tested the Sap 8 Cores on the Thargoid sites. He said "Testing so far has revealed nothing. Thargoids dont mind you carrying them, they scan and ignore the containers too. Thargoid structures do not accept them. Had to test all possibilities." He sent this lovely postcard as well. Thank you CMDR Panpiper!

That is a flying scavenger hahaha
