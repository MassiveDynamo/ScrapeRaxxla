Maybe one of those NPC's holds an item we don't know about yet but that would be needed to solve that riddle?

Maybe. But for now, the SAP 8 Core conts and the data they hold are the only thing that survived from the past E/F missions (and the Trinkets ?). And there must be a reason to it.
Could be interesting to shadow these Couriers to know what factions/powers are playing... Any pattern in the deliveries ?
