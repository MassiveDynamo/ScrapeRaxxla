There isn’t anything unique (e.g. nebulae, O types) in the two start menu screenshots, otherwise I would have found them by now. The only way to triangulate these few stars would be to code something like http://ancs.eng.buffalo.edu/pdf/ancs_papers/2006/star_id06.pdf and run it against all the known star positions (available from eddb.io).

It would likely not be definitive with so few stars in the images, but would give you some search areas. I’m no coder so if anyone would like to have a go then please let me know!

I’ve been out in the black searching star patterns for around two months now, seen some nice sights & found a few biologicals & geological signatures since the fss appeared in my Asp, but haven’t got time to explore those. What I really need is a cockpit hud overlay to get the angular distances between stars & a means to transfer those into galmap. There have been so many times that I can see things from the cockpit but I can’t identify them in the galmap.....it’s extremely frustrating!!!!! :O:O
