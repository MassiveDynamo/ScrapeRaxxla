Codex, TDW: "... only when a suitable test of courage and skill has been discreetly administred and passed."
An entire paragraph telling how TRDW is supposed to recruit. Sort of personal journey.
Might not be written for nothing.
Makes me think of some kind of reputation related thing. Tip off, chained missions...
But not only wit the Shinrarta TDW.

Maybe nothing less than triple elite to start with?
