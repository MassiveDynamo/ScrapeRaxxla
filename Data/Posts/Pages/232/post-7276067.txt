Mmmmh... 4E ?
I am not coming back to ED for such a burden...
Might aswell require all the Guardian blueprints and patterns, all the different Tharg stuff and mats onboard and all the EDSM badges, all the PP weapons and... a night passed with the Princess.. [haha] (For the 5E. I bet she is a TDW brass !)
Btw, afaik we never commented if the PP pledges could have something to do ?

And yes, as I stated many times about the disappearance of the E/F missions: it's Macros fault !

Oh I concur. I would much rather it be the correct; triple Elite.

But I wouldn't put it past them to force that on us, they still insist on showing that fourth carbuncle on our heads-up. Seriously if I could I'd jam a spoon down the flight decks holo emitter and scratch out that fourth icon. No way I'm wasting my time on that without solid proof first.

Think its solid to state that triple Elite is elite.
