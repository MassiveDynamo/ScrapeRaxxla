Mmmmh... 4E ?
I am not coming back to ED for such a burden...
Might aswell require all the Guardian blueprints and patterns, all the different Tharg stuff and mats onboard and all the EDSM badges, all the PP weapons and... a night passed with the Princess.. [haha] (For the 5E. I bet she is a TDW brass !)
Btw, afaik we never commented if the PP pledges could have something to do ?

And yes, as I stated many times about the disappearance of the E/F missions: it's Macros fault !
