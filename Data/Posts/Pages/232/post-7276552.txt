Stand corrected - apologies for post, twas combination of a winter cold and half an hour waiting for patch to load.

Agreed about the loading screen, was out there some time ago searching for very faint dark regions (there's a few). The loop is our strongest contender.

Toast/poem I still think don't direct to a point in space (Rift) but draws the attention to an area, around Orion and the loop?

Hard to focus with so many competing theories I'm used to analysis of patterns from evidence not compiling evidence.

On route back to loop after ruling out Dumbbell nebula. Going to continue searching the loop.

Constancy ladies and gents. I'm too prone to tin-foilery.
