Ironically thinking along those same lines...

Its extremely likely the older DW missions were just this, those got dropped for an undisclosed reason / possible bugged following an update. FD never confirmed directly what happened only something was in game...

I feel people were getting too close; FD underestimated peoples skill levels and they moved the goal posts.

The codex entry is for me confirmation those missions are back in the game. Where/when/how is the big question.

Maybe you need to be quadruple Elite and allied with certain factions and wait for tip-off missions....

Find the DW station and obtain some interesting new info....possibly around Raxxla?

Who knows...except finally it now gives me the objective for attainment of Elite rank. I've held off grinding this since day one...tacking my time.

Now there IS a reason to obtain this moniker.

Good show FD.
