Codex, TDW: "... only when a suitable test of courage and skill has been discreetly administred and passed."
An entire paragraph telling how TRDW is supposed to recruit. Sort of personal journey.
Might not be written for nothing.
Makes me think of some kind of reputation related thing. Tip off, chained missions...
But not only wit the Shinrarta TDW.

I have two current tip off missions. Both systems are on the very fringes of the human bubble. I have images from the first site. It was not a crashed ship, but a planetary base those you have to scan for some wetwork/assisination missions etc.

Strangely one of the missions was from before 3.3 and pointed at a location in the Pleiades, but now the text has changed and it points elsewhere.
