Alrighty just logging in after patch. Are we seriously saying no one has tried triangulating those stars seen in the Start menu screen (with the rotating station).

Didn't some Cmdr uncover the Guardians doing just that from a trailer...

Really Horizons there's a 'darkened station' (Dark Wheel). Within non Horizons its a different system and a close proximity station (Raxxla gateway).

Trigonometry is not my strong point.
The Guardians trailer had identifiable galactic objects in the trailer images (The Pleiades Nebula and Andromeda, IIRC). That’s what allowed the triangulation. There’s nothing like that in the Start screens. Without something distinct to triangulate from it’s down to skybox matching. I’m not an expert at skybox matching, but there doesn’t seem to be enough to go off to do that either.
