Bravo - I have always wondered about those images. Have you the link to source, be interesting reading.

Ah sorry, misread your post. It's actually the view from the start video that we've been looking for. In that, we know for certain where Barnard's Loop and Witchhead are, but trying to find where the other stars in the view are. Jorki is convinced that the image is a view from the correct system, or that the bright yellow star between the horns is the right system.

As for the menu view, that's been bright up several times as well. I don't know if anyone got anywhere, but there isn't much to go on. Personally, I think that one is actually just a composite showing assets that were added in horizons.
