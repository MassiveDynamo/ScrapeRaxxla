Alrighty just logging in after patch. Are we seriously saying no one has tried triangulating those stars seem in the Start menu screen (with the rotating station).

Didn't some Cmdr uncover the Guardians doing just that from a trailer...

Really Horizons there's a 'darkened station' (Dark Wheel). Within non Horizons its a different system and a close proximity station (Raxxla gateway).

Trigonometry is not my strong point.

That's exactly what Jorki has been trying to do for some time. I've put some time into it myself, but gotten distracted with something else. There are plenty of Jorki's posts about this, but there have been several pages of stuff since the more important ones.
