I've devised and completed an extensive theorized set of checkpoints/tests based on my interpretation of the riddle and its clues. I'm back in the bubble after completing them all and handing in my data and am going to see if it's worked to make any sort of contact with DW or its mysterious contacts. I'll be keeping an eye out for "golden opportunities", odd jobs and clues to potentially connected scenarios to see if it has actually worked. If it did than I will make the list public shortly after. If it doesn't work than I am utterly lost for the time being and I will also make it public. o7
