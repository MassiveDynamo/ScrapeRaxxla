Alrighty just logging in after patch. Are we seriously saying no one has tried triangulating those stars seen in the Start menu screen (with the rotating station).

Didn't some Cmdr uncover the Guardians doing just that from a trailer...

Really Horizons there's a 'darkened station' (Dark Wheel). Within non Horizons its a different system and a close proximity station (Raxxla gateway).

Trigonometry is not my strong point.
