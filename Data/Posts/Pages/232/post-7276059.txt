Surely it wouldn't require 4x Elite. That would lock off a significant portion of the playerbase

I'm banking on Raxxla being in Polaris, or at least the actual way to reach it starting there, and it's staying locked up tight until FDev decides to open it. I'm also guessing there will be a few events in the coming months that lead to the unveiling of a new expansion pack whose content is accessed through the Raxxla gate, and once it releases, The way to earn the permit will be added and Polaris will be open for business
