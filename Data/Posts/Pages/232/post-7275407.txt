Codex, TDW: "... only when a suitable test of courage and skill has been discreetly administred and passed."
An entire paragraph telling how TRDW is supposed to recruit. Sort of personal journey.
Might not be written for nothing.
Makes me think of some kind of reputation related thing. Tip off, chained missions...
But not only wit the Shinrarta TDW.

I was thinking the same. It also says something about that TDW gives tasks to exceptional pilots without revealing themself. Maybe the Raxxla missions are still in game, they are now just hidden as a chain of tip-off missions.
