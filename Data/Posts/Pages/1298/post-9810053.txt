If the statement is true and accurate, it tells us a few things.

1. Raxxla is in a dull system that normally wouldn't be worth scanning.
2. Regular scanning will not reveal Raxxla. If the System was visited that many years ago it has been scanned a hundred times, by ow.
3. Raxxla is probably close to or inn the bubble. Even though many far systems had been visited at the time, the percentage chance of hitting a specific random, far out system was very low.

Ive asked Ascorbius for clarification. He responded that
“
It was during a closed Q&A session - I'm trying to recall whether it was Lavecon or the later ECM in Reading. It was the last Q&A Michael Brookes was at.

I'm pretty sure it was Lavecon 2017 in the Q&A. There were a load of things announced there, Crime and Punishment and the early views of AX weapons as well as Search and Rescue.
I've also just checked Michael Brookes announced he was stepping away from Elite at Lavecon 2017 so it's pretty unlikely to be the ECM Reading.

The memory is hazy given that I've been to a few Lavecons and ECMs and recollections after the fact are unreliable but I'm pretty sure it was Lavecon 2017.

But I absolutely was there when he said it, it's sad there's no footage with it being a closed Q&A, but there were a lot of people in the room.

BUT as Ive just explained, it is to pursue this alleged rumour as it is

Jorki what was the question you asked him? I watched the video to refresh my memory and the only claim he actually mentions is the system has been visited... The honking and going or even scooping and leaving were suggestions...
