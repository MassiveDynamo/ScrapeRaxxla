The first rumour date is just before Achenar, 139 ly from Sol, was colonised. Why would FD give us that piece of information? It might be meaningless window dressing (we’ve had a lot of that from FD in the past), it might be obfuscation (Raxxla might be in deep space with the system visited by an early explorer, though I think less likely if he was honk & scooting since this implies he was on his way somewhere), or it might be a genuine clue that Raxxla is within the bubble. We have no evidence to support any of these so probability is about 30% for each. But I think about DB chortling “but you don’t know what it is” and the fact that MB has (likely) given out that (alleged) statement in a closed Q&A session, which raises the community interest level...it suggests to me (since my teens I’ve been an avid reader, mainly of detective mysteries and scifi, I can often guess whodoneit before the reveal even if I’ve missed clues just by the way the plot is constructed) and I just lean towards it being in the bubble; and possibly even within a highly popular system such as Sol. I can imagine DB’s grin when it’s found and him saying “it’s been there all this time”.
Just going to point out that the date is from the Codex, and what the Codex does is also compare Raxxla to El Dorado, Atlantis, and the Kingdom of Prester John. All of those are places where the legends weren’t based on the places being found. I don’t think we can just discard that hint while treating other Codex things as clues.
