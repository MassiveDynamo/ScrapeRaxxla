Raxxla was here before thargoids and guardians and for that reason it can't be found by looking at thargoid or guardian stuff.
Raxxla is DB creation and for that reason there is no way someone besides him could just change it. MB helped DB coded and hide it. I think only those 2 knows where it is, if any of Fdev would have known raxxla location they would have already leaked it or sold that information to someone like they leak so many informations to certain group.

p.s. when one of Fdevs says they know where it is, they mean "we know it is somewhere inside milky way" lol
We actually do not know if it is older than the Guardians or Thargoids. Raxxla is actually Robert Holdstock's creation that predates any Elite game. That being said it's implementation into the game was done by MB as you suggested. If I remember correctly he was going to write it as a book, but figured it would be better in the game.
