No, I think Iâ€™m right about the evidential assessment. Ascorbius says he heard MB say this statement. I think that is hearsay. We cannot cross examine MB, the (alleged) source of the statement to determine if that statement is true. The question is not whether or not Ascorbius heard the statement; the question is whether a pilot had visited the system and honked but did not (for whatever reason) notice the presence of something we know as Raxxla.

But as I reiterate, the statement tells us nothing useful!!
I agree the statement is almost entirely useless, but I know enough people, from different groups who were in that room and quoted it verbatim, MB said it. All it tells us is that we can enter the system it is in, but we don't know if we can see it or identify it in any useful way. The mechanics (or non-mechanics) behind it are unknown.
