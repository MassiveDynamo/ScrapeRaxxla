The argument against ascorbius is just whether or not he is lieing.
No, the argument is that it is an unsubstantiated report about what happened.
I actually believe it is likely to have been said, on the basis that it tells us absolutely no useful information, which was the norm for MB’s clues, and I have no reason to disbelieve Ascorbius’ report. But because it is unsubstantiated the confidence is low.
