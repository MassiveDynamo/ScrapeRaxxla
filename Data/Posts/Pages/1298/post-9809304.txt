No, the argument is that it is an unsubstantiated report about what happened.
I actually believe it is likely to have been said, on the basis that it tells us absolutely no useful information, which was the norm for MB’s clues, and I have no reason to disbelieve Ascorbius’ report. But because it is unsubstantiated the confidence is low.
No, the video link has him directly saying that he saw it. That means he's either lieing or isn't lieing. You are missing something in this conversation. And what the definition of the words you are using are. Yes, it is unsubstantiated wether or not he is telling the truth. But it's a first person testimony that he saw it. Unless you assume there are other such statements and someone said it about a person they know that also heard it at which point that is, "hearsay". Hearsay is saying another person saw something. It's a third person argument. This is a first person statement. The definition of hearsay cannot be from the first person. That is not what the word means.

We're just stating what the words mean.
