Yeah. Ring objects i general are interesting. Stellar and planetary rings are probably basically the same object, in the code. If FD can manipulate the density of rocks in a ring, they could have very few or even a singular rock orbiting whatever they want. Planetary rings aren't scannable without probes and they require visual contact.

We know from Sol that ring can be 'empty'. There could be similar setups in other systems.
