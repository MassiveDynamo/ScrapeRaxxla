Well I ran into something interesting while listening to some tv series that talked about a conquistador Francisco Vazquez de Coronado. At first I thought they were going to say El Dorado or use that nope they use a whole new name I never heard of. Cibola also known as Seven Cities of Cibola. I check for EDSM Chibola and there is only 1 system by that name not sure if unfortunate that is a populated System of 760 thousand. I'll have check it when I can and see what that system has. It also names associated to Lost Cities.

I haven't played much ED, but I still take time to look into other stuff for Raxxla that's the only thing that hasn't stopped. Usually I keep an ear/eye to things that are interesting and might fit Raxxla codex.
