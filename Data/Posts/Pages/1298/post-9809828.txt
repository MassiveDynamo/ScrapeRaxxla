And AFAIK some CG search goal was hidden in one (belt cluster), not visible by scanning the cluster(s), you had to enter the cluster to find it.
Yes, hidden in an asteroid cluster or planetary ring would be a good way to obfuscate Raxxla, and it fits the logo where the three arcs could indicate an asteroid base. It is for this reason that I now search a system by visiting every body including all the asteroid clusters. Planetary ring would be best, because unless you drop in within a short detection range it might not show. So I’ve been steaming around (mixed metaphor?) above rings trying to visually see a bright spot of light worth dropping in on. If there’s no visual difference between it and ring surroundings it would indeed “be very hard to find” !!!

After searching Doris (gaelic for door) I’m currently in Lillith- first wife of Adam, got uppity & thrown out of Garden of Eden so Father’s grief & Lover’s Woe. Not found anything so far!

Mmm, reconsidering the previous couple of posts....and the Mars Relic...after Lilith I might have to go back to Sol and go ring dipping around Jupiter, again!!
