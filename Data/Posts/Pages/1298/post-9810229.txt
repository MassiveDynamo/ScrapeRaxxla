I’m quite curious looking at all them PSR Neutron stars. I find it strange that I can’t find PSR J1921+2153. The first ever Pulsar discovered by our very own Cambridge Dane… Joyce Bell Burnell. I Guess you could call her a space witch and a whisperer reading her bio. I’m heading to the Vulpecula dark region to have a look around, as that’s where the Pulsar is meant to be. Maybe tucked away in another whisperer at the low end of the spectrum.
