It was on the cartography cash in screen saying congratulations, might have been first footfall?
Ah. That's an old bug, and has tripped up a few people over the years in this thread and elsewhere.

If you fully map a system - which with a 3-star 1-planet system is pretty easy, of course - you'll get a "first to fully map" bonus award screen when you hand in the data.
You get this whether or not you're actually the first. Various people have reported getting it for Lave over the years, long after it was implausible that no-one else had thought of mapping both the planets.

Whether the bug is "you should only get it if you're actually the first" or "it should just say 'full mapping bonus' without implying 'first'" I don't know.
