The "whisper in witchspace" looked a bit like a pyramid with an eye at one point; the typical freemason thingie.

In any case, finding an unmapped planet in the bubble at this point shows how little is explored.
I've been trying to get more info on the whisper. Is this the one where it's spectrograph analysed?

I was surprised when the cartography contact gave me the First mapped tag, could be a glitch I suppose.
