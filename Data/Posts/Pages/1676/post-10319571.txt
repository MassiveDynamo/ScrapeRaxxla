The only planet I found something on was in Segin. It had an unmapped planet, the only unmapped planet
That feels like it has to be a display bug, given that it's a real-life system relatively close to the bubble.

EDSM's records for Segin have Segin ABC1 being first mapped by Jackie Silver - https://www.edsm.net/en/system/bodies/id/157535/name/Segin/details/idB/8240684/nameB/Segin+ABC+1 - so that must have been a while ago, and they might not have been the first person in-game to map it either.

Do you now show up as the first person to map the planet?
