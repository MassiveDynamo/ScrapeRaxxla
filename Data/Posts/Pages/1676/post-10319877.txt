Could it a representation of the symbol Sa," also known as the "Ankh," The Ankh has sometimes been interpreted as a symbol of a doorway or portal between the realms of the living and the dead.
Edit: I had a look through many rune and symbolic languages and found nothing else that could suggest a link to the symbol. The symbol in the spectrograph could just be static?
