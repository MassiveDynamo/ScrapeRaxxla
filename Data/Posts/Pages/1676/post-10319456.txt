The "whisper in witchspace" looked a bit like a pyramid with an eye at one point; the typical freemason thingie.
I had a look in the free mason symbol, and believe it's also called 'The eye of providence'. The building in Segin looks like the Pyramid, minus the top half! I never got back there as I was having fun dodging pirates at the CG.
