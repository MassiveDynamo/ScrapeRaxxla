Here is the path I drug all those items through.

Here are 3 screen shots of the items I used
In the path picture, the highlighted system is closest to what I found to be the L. Signal. The other bookmarked systems criss crossed a few times through where I think it is. In the end, nothing happened. Please note that this location is near the center of the grid location. Next are the places described in CMDR PublicStaticVoid's report.
Edit - CMDR PublicStaticVoid's report found 5 systems that surround an area close to where I was. I believe my hypothesis of triggering an event will not happen, at least not with the items I've brought. All Items are for sale on the Prince Hector with the exception of the Sap 8, Hafnium and Trinkets (No blackmarket) should someone wish to try any other ideas. Prices are set at Galactic Standard at a GREAT loss for me. At this point, I've transcended above the need for credits. I'll leave the Prince in orbit around Stuemeae GG-Y C6380 for a while.
