That feels like it has to be a display bug, given that it's a real-life system relatively close to the bubble.

EDSM's records for Segin have Segin ABC1 being first mapped by Jackie Silver - https://www.edsm.net/en/system/bodies/id/157535/name/Segin/details/idB/8240684/nameB/Segin+ABC+1 - so that must have been a while ago, and they might not have been the first person in-game to map it either.

Do you now show up as the first person to map the planet?
It was on the cartography cash in screen saying congratulations, might have been first footfall?
