How many kinds of different Guardian sites are there ?
Three types of ruins, at least three types of the bases with the device and the beacons in space. There are also variation within a single type. none of the look exactly the same, I think.

All of these sites are still functioning 1-2 million years after the Guardian wipe. I don't know if that means they were very well built of if the network has been maintained by the AI Constructs. The codex hints that the AI planed to survive the the wipe 'giving their own burgeoning society the best possible chance of survival'.
