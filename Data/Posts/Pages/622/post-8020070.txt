Three types of ruins...
Mmmmh.. Three types with device and beacon in space...
The Icon might match a Guardian ruin of these. Central point being the device and curved lines the beacons or the emissions of the network... Circle being the force field dome.
Also the dashed lines, in both the Icon and the sites, and the general shape of the ruins of "beta-type "seem to match. Imho.
I assume you Canonn biscuit eaters investigated this option, yes ?
