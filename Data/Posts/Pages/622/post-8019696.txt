P.s. what was the reference for your six bridges theory? I’m suffering hypothesis overload. Still stuck trying to decipher MB’s tattoo features! (Though I think it’s unrelated to Raxxla).
Just a way to look at the Icon. Six green bridges/paths/ways to reach Raxxla. N,W,S,E, up and down,maybe. Depends on how you figure it out in 3D.
Did someone plot these six locked systems and look for the "center" of the figure they draw ?
