The E/F missions were cut when they no longer had a function in the narrative.
A journey can be anything. We always have to do them our self(unless mulicrew works).
So, the E/F missions would have been replaced by the Guardians narrative, which, since that, is what should lead us to Raxxla ? Interesting theory, mein Herr.
A pity that the Guardians plot seems to be on stanby too...Or am I missing something new ?

Ofc a journey can be anything. I assume we threaders of The Boss' forum are mostly interested in the Raxxla related one. The one that MB was talking about.

I suspect it is in a permit locked system, one of the six in the bubble. And I think TDW grant the permit once their test has been successfully completed.
Six ? Interesting. It matches with my "Six Bridges" Icon theory !
I would be surprised (or not) by the huge inconsistency if it turns out that TDW has access to Raxxla.
