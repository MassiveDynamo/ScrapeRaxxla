My granddaughter asked me yesterday what my car is called; I had to say it has no name.
I’ve been thinking about this and have decided to name it Raxxla, so from henceforth I’ll always know where Raxxla is.....
unless I park in a multistorey.
You need one of those fancy car horns... Then you can say... Ahh the siren call of raxxla...
