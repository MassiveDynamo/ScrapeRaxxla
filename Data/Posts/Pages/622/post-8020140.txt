I suspect the SAP8 containers provide crystal maps (Guardian tech?), possibly to Soontill which may or may not be a Guardian homeworld or Arkship destination.

Interesting, I hadn't heard this view on it before, I wasn't around but do wonder about Soontil involvement..as well as 'The' Moon, Diso 1 (iirc) and Lave 2...not a clue on whether Guardian, Raxxlian or Futurestorylineian. Soontil hints at Thargoid but never actually says one or another to my knowledge.

Yeh, so about 7 NS jumps gives 14-20 arx (I do stop to repair at 93% engine and relog to check arx).

Theres a highly cynical part of me that keeps saying you're getting rewarded for using materials which you have to 'grind' if you don't enjoy the game.

The 'grind' by the way is how many times I have to click to transfer an item from storage to my ship vs just swopping them around within ship.

Guardian Ruins as well don't forget, I only visited one once and that was at oops-boost high speed so I didnt really get to see much before I woke up LY away and it was all a dream, are there more than 1 variation of ruin, are there 3 as well to go with the 3 ?
