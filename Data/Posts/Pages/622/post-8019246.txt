So, the E/F missions would have been replaced by the Guardians narrative, which, since that, is what should lead us to Raxxla ? Interesting theory, mein Herr.
A pity that the Guardians plot seems to be on stanby too...Or am I missing something new ?

There are at least a lot of parallels. Guardian places checks most, if not all the Raxxla boxes.

Ghost world, check
Alien construct, Yes and yes
Gateway to other Universes, if we count the Monolith network as another universe.
People on Raxxla already, check. The Club knew.
Realm of the Dead / underworld stuff, Check.
Crystalline tech and containment fields check.

The real Raxxla is probably not the standard stuff we have found to date, but I doubt it's totally unrelated.
