Also ever wonder if this "Witchspace" that we travel through is Raxxla, its just one place we travel through that brings us from system to system considering it is the same every single jump, same colours, clouds, distancing (minus the server lag) and lights just varied in where/when they appear depending on the angle of your ship compared to it in the galaxy? Other than those angles and changes it is pretty much the exact same instance each jump and could be a lets say "single wormhole/space" we jump through to get from A to B that our mysterious masterminds have taken a part of (the other part of which is used by the Thargoids however they are intwined)

Where in the galaxy it is being manipulated from However is the key, and we are the real bad guys that want to kill off the Thargoids to take full control (since they only attack when we encourage it but the higher ups paint a different picture for reasons unknown)
I'm trying to find out since day one what the pattern during a jump is. The only reliable pattern I found:

white "comets" are never close to the target star at the end of a jump
yellow "comets" are often close to the target star, very seldom there is no yellow comet close to the target star
I assume that the stars around the tunnel are indeed stars. It seems that there is a pattern when they start spinning/spiraling; mostly when the jump is at the end.
I'm not 100% sure, but I believe I had the stars spinning/spiraling violently way before I found the "veil north"; it could have been after my "HIP 49285"-visit.

I tend to think that there is no pattern in the jump-animation, with the possible exception of one-off events.
