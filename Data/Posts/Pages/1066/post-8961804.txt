Sifi KO-G b24-5 looks hand tuned to me. Here are a few notable things:

the star is 256 M years old; 256 always screams at a programmer, also 256 is a square number (16*16)
there are 49 bodies, which is another square number (7*7)
there are 7 landable small high metal content worlds in sequence
then there are 9 planets with an atmosphere; again 9 a square number (3*3)
the 7 high metals and the 9 with atmosphere together are 16; again a square number (4*4). The only problem I have is the moon around the water world which would break my crazy numerology scheme
4 gas giants; square number (2*2)
gas giants moons:
1st gas giant has 5 moons
2nd gas giant has 6 moons
3rd gas giant has "7" moons (well, the 6th moon has its own moon, I'm grasping at straws here)
4th gas giant has 8 moons
the 8th moon of the 4th gas giant has a ring, like a big f*** you
the pattern breaks occur on the number 7:
the water world is the 7th in the sequence of atmospheric planets
the "7th moon" of the 3rd has giant is actually a moon of the 6th moon

So, does anyone else think this system is hand tuned?
