I hope its not a useless easteregg like in some other games. I mean think about it: The greatest mystery of all gaming history, you find it, and its nothing but just a bobblehead you can put in to your cockpit... oh god no. I cant handle that. It has to be something significant.

That's why you'll never find raxxla. Nothing fdev comes up with is going to fulfill the expectation they've created around it. It's a no-win situation for them and the players if it's ever found.
