Welcome to Sifi KO-G b24-5 commander o7

I'm already in the bubble because of Cg. But i will be coming back
o7

I plan to stay in Sifi KO-G b24-5 until Thursday. I will not leave the system; I'll just scan everything, I'll visit all geo signals, I'll try out a few coordinates (79째 41째 and other combinations like -79째 41째 a.s.o.).

This means, I'll log out on Wednesday in "Sifi KO-G b24-5" evening and I will log in on Thursday after server maintenance. Let's see what happens.
