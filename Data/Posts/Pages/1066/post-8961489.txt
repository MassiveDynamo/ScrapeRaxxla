Also ever wonder if this "Witchspace" that we travel through is Raxxla, its just one place we travel through that brings us from system to system considering it is the same every single jump, same colours, clouds, distancing (minus the server lag) and lights just varied in where/when they appear depending on the angle of your ship compared to it in the galaxy? Other than those angles and changes it is pretty much the exact same instance each jump and could be a lets say "single wormhole/space" we jump through to get from A to B that our mysterious masterminds have taken a part of (the other part of which is used by the Thargoids however they are intwined)

Where in the galaxy it is being manipulated from However is the key, and we are the real bad guys that want to kill off the Thargoids to take full control (since they only attack when we encourage it but the higher ups paint a different picture for reasons unknown)
