O7 cmdrs. I have read this forum as far as possible and I will express my thoughts, after which you can throw stones at me.
1. Raxxla is a planet and Raxxla is the way of the pilot, unique to each. In the book The Dark Wheel, Rafe is talking straight - - - If you are there, if you have become an elite, you will never be about RAxxla. And you'll never know exactly what your father was looking for.' Obviously, the first condition is to be an Elite, but it is not known whether it is a triple Elite or a quadruple Elite. Yes, in the book it was theElite combateer, but the game world has changed since then....

2. Toast the Dark wheel. "...witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!... " In the audiologs of the abbadoned Alpha settlement in the Formidine Rift, there are also references to the siren song, when moving in hyperspace, which was maddening. I assume that the transition to Raxla occurs during a jump through hyperspace, if the pilot meets certain conditions.

3. Also assume that Raxxla is under the protection of an Elite rank NPC

What else do we know about Raxxla?

I hope the online translator translated my message correctly
