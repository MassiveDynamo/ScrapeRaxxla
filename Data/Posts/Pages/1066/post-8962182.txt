DOnt get mad on me but you dont have to write your every action here. There are new players who are interested in raxxla, and they are trying to read this thousand pages of tinfoil madness and theories, and you are not helping them. I suggest you to join a discord channel like independent raxxla hunters, Canonn or a group like that.
Sorry, not used to forums
