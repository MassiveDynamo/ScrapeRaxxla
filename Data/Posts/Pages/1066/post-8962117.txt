Sifi KO-G b24-5 looks hand tuned to me. Here are a few notable things:

the star is 256 M years old; 256 always screams at a programmer, also 256 is a square number (16*16)
there are 49 bodies, which is another square number (7*7)
there are 7 landable small high metal content worlds in sequence
then there are 9 planets with an atmosphere; again 9 a square number (3*3)
the 7 high metals and the 9 with atmosphere together are 16; again a square number (4*4). The only problem I have is the moon around the water world which would break my crazy numerology scheme

So, does anyone else think this system is hand tuned?
