I plan to stay in Sifi KO-G b24-5 until Thursday. I will not leave the system; I'll just scan everything, I'll visit all geo signals, I'll try out a few coordinates (79째 41째 and other combinations like -79째 41째 a.s.o.).

This means, I'll log out on Wednesday evening and I will log in on Thursday after server maintenance. Let's see what happens.
I will be coming in an hour and a half
