Has it been suggested that the dark wheel faction is really known under an other name? Since its seems not likely that they would say "We are the dark wheel. We know everything" If thats would be true empire and federation would both be invading this faction to get their secrets.

its an idea for sure, but where do you start? I do rank up with as many random factions as possible, usually coz I have explo data to sell so its quite easy, and theres an underlying theory that the DW will get in touch when Im allied with 10,000 factions or something.

I did find a Light Wheel faction once, only got half ranked and forgot where they were, typical. Found em much later and turned out to be a player named faction.

Its possible the DW 'retreated' or 'escaped' to Shin Des and were 'protected' here or could defend it and they were left alone as not being able to cause much trouble. Turning The Wheel is a project for many reasons but one by-product may be an answer to this theory.
