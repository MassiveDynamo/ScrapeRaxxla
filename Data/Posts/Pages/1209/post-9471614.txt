They’re from 3.0 when the new type of Guardian sites were put into the game (along with the Decrypting The Guardian Logs mission, and the change to the obelisk displays to show the item combos needed for the obelisk in question rather than the previous fluctuating patterns).

On a completely different note, happy birthday for the other week! Hope you celebrated in style, and you’ve recovered from all the Lavian brandy!
Thank you mate!
Yes, I had a nice day and celebrated appropriately (actually it’s my plan for immortality - preservation in alcohol! if it doesn’t work the family can stand me in the garden and have a giant Roman Candle at my wake! )

Unfortunately the brandy has worn off, and after a game session last Sunday (it was raining, so couldn't cut the lawn as planned) I now have my RSI back. Both thumbs are extremely painful and getting pins & needles in my right hand. So my gameplay is on hold and getting to full Admiral will have to be delayed (it was much easier to get to King with the Empire, wonder if there is a reason the last Fed promotion seems more difficult).

And is there anything worth watching on TV as a substitute?
No!
