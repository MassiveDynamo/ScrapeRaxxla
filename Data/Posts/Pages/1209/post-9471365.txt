I think the second line is preparation for future Thargoid gameplay!
Unless it’s relevant to some obelisks at Guardian sites yet to be found? Not heard of them appearing on any obelisks found to date.
With the Hesperus storyline suggesting that the ancient relic towers were actually air defence weapons, and the descriptions for all those ancient items suggesting more functionality exists, then there may be some interesting things still to discover.
They’re from 3.0 when the new type of Guardian sites were put into the game (along with the Decrypting The Guardian Logs mission, and the change to the obelisk displays to show the item combos needed for the obelisk in question rather than the previous fluctuating patterns).

On a completely different note, happy birthday for the other week! Hope you celebrated in style, and you’ve recovered from all the Lavian brandy!
