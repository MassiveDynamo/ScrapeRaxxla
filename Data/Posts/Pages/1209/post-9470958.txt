I think the second line is preparation for future Thargoid gameplay!
Unless itâ€™s relevant to some obelisks at Guardian sites yet to be found? Not heard of them appearing on any obelisks found to date.
With the Hesperus storyline suggesting that the ancient relic towers were actually air defence weapons, and the descriptions for all those ancient items suggesting more functionality exists, then there may be some interesting things still to discover.
There are 2 parts of Ram Tah, first is Guardians and second is Thargoids
