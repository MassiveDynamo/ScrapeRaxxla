It's weird, when I did the Ram missions, you had to collect 101 pieces of Guardian history and get 200 million for it. I don't remember it being about the Targoids.
There’s two different Ram Tah missions.

The first is ‘Decoding the Ancient Ruins’. That has 101 logs and is done at the Ancient Ruins.

The second is ‘Decrypting the Guardian Logs’. That has 30 logs IIRC and is done at the Guardian Structures.

The first involves just Guardian Artefacts.

The second involves both Guardian Artefacts and Thargoid objects/materials.

The image is just a key to the symbols on the obelisks that was produced by members of the community once what they were had been figured out shortly after 3.0 was released.
