The use of the term ‘rift’ has always caused me some interest, in respect of being able to identify what or where Raxxla might be - within game, especially when interpreting it in relation to the use the word Omphalos.

Initially within Greek mythology the Oracle of Delphi, said to be to home / resting place of the Omphalos; sat directly over a supposed rift or fissure.

Archaeological excavations of the Delphi complex has identified that area is situated directly over a geological fissure, and a river complex runs through the area, supporting in part this theory.

In game, we can suppose that early statements off Braben and Brookes established that the game ought to be based upon real-world science (!) except for faster than light travel, which is just in their words made up hand-wavy sci-fi to enable the game to work.

So in theory, how could a natural fissure work in game?

One possible hypothesis:

I’m seeing a lot of references to zones and areas separated by water, thunder, mountains and the underworld, especially in relation to the concept of travelling to the ‘Otherworld’.

There are certain references in game to Holdstock (Lost realms) and Gilgamesh which revolve around travelling through mountains to get to this ‘Otherworld’!

Could the Omphalos Rift relate to these spacial zones and an intersection identifying a passage to the Otherworld!
