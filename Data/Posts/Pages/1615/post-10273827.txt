Been thinking on the comments about the Raxxla codex being the only evidence in game...

Then using argument modelling to start to try and map out what might be leads/not leads....

anyway here's my starter for 10.... loads missing, but thought it might be useful and if you can knock down some of the thoughts or add to them let me know...

https://www.mindmup.com/ - if you want to use something to mindmap stuff.... first time I've used it and seems cool....

Green is putting a position forward/red is an objection/negative thought...

Mind mapping is definitely a smart way to help find idea relationships and paths of enquiry.
Perfect example, your map exposed one question I hadn't given much time to - what would the "Rift" actually mean? or more importantly what other meanings of Rift haven't been considered? The codex could be deliberately leading the reader off track by inferring it is a type of wormhole in space or gateway construct.

Could it be a geological rift? A place that is divided? Something that is breached? Something that is burst open? Something wrenched open / split with force / cleaved?
