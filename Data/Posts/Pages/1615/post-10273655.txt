Also, I still have a theory that Raxxla actually moves. I've had people jump down my throat previously for even suggesting that, saying it wasn't possible, but now, after the Thargoid mothership things moved thru the galaxy, I'm even more convinced that Raxxla is on some predetermined "path" or "circuit" between set stars, only being at each star for a limited duration of specific time before moving to the next star, likely always at a far far distance from any objects in those systems so as not to disturb orbits (or its the size of the thargoid motherships or smaller and just doesn't effects orbits as it passes), and that to be able to find it, and be a repeatable process, requires finding and understanding that path, or simply stumbling upon it (which would be unlikely, assuming Raxxla won't show up on FSS/system map as Raxxla (FSS wasn't in-game at launch anyways))...
I also think if Raxxla is Guardian in nature, that this would be one of the ways they would choose to hide it, so that even if stumbled upon once by someone (an enemy), it would not be there when/if they returned....
but again, just a theory and no good idea of where to even start...

It's a good a theory as any other until it's found as we don't know what it is! ;-)

13:45, does Raxxla exist? There’s an interesting one. What a silly question, of course....You don’t know what it is though!

I think you could interpret the following two statements as suggesting it's moving....
"Anyone can FIND IT MORE THAN ONCE" - If it's a stationary object why would you need to find it each time?
"It's NOT A RANDOM THING." - With reference to not having to find it by chance... so there may be a method to find it more than once...


And it might be because Raxxla is orbiting a comet like this station..

Which MB confirms might be the case here (for the station orbiting the comet... not Raxxla!)
What is this??
Do you see something strange in this screenshot? :rolleyes: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=572128347

And as for Raxxla being Guardian in nature, perhaps only one of the Guardian sites is "Active" in someway at anyone time and that is Raxxla? (After all as we've been told....we don't know what it is!)
