Mind mapping is definitely a smart way to help find idea relationships and paths of enquiry.
Perfect example, your map exposed one question I hadn't given much time to - what would the "Rift" actually mean? or more importantly what other meanings of Rift haven't been considered? The codex could be deliberately leading the reader off track by inferring it is a type of wormhole in space or gateway construct.

Could it be a geological rift? A place that is divided? Something that is breached? Something that is burst open? Something wrenched open / split with force / cleaved?
Mind mapping is a useful tool for exposing for criticism your logic in interpreting relationships, but is only as good as the input information.

I've pondered "Rift" in the past. Rift could mean a hole in spacetime, i.e. a gateway (would also fit "door that is also the key") and science postulates this might be caused by a rotating Black Hole. It could also mean a dark nebula, i.e. one that is dust that is not emitting light so appears to be a hole in the galactic background. There is one interesting one, the Great Rift, but IMHO it is too far from Sol to fit the first rumour date, and is pretty big so no use in localising Raxxla:
Great Rift (astronomy) - Wikipedia
en.m.wikipedia.org

However a grapefruit-sized black hole might form a rift, and be extremely difficult to detect. I saw mention of the possibility of one being in the outskirts of Sol, IIRC it was a possible solution for a rumoured 10th planet, though FD have decided to put Persephone there.
