Been thinking on the comments about the Raxxla codex being the only evidence in game...

Then using argument modelling to start to try and map out what might be leads/not leads....

anyway here's my starter for 10.... loads missing, but thought it might be useful and if you can knock down some of the thoughts or add to them let me know...

https://www.mindmup.com/ - if you want to use something to mindmap stuff.... first time I've used it and seems cool....

Green is putting a position forward/red is an objection/negative thought...
