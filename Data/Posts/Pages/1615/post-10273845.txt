Been thinking on the comments about the Raxxla codex being the only evidence in game...

Then using argument modelling to start to try and map out what might be leads/not leads....

anyway here's my starter for 10.... loads missing, but thought it might be useful and if you can knock down some of the thoughts or add to them let me know...

I don’t believe one can simply interpret the Codex, without first having the eyes to see….namely, understanding the original context…I suspect the author has utilised a number of abstract allegories.

I agree this concept of mapping can assist with interpretation as an application of critical analysis which is very helpful to stress test our understanding and identify unknowns.
