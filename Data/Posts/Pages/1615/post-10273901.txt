Now there's a Raxxla question I have a faint hope that could get an actual answer:

"Allegedly someone has been on the same system as Raxxla at least once; however, is it still there?"
Which brings the question did they not notice it as they were literally buckyballing or was it something that showed up on the scanner as a normal object?
For example a space station, our missing Dark Wheel?
