There are two points on this where we got further answers from Drew Wagar:

4.27 - Raxxla was explicitly off-limits to the book authors (and The Club is a DW creation)
5.2 - Michael Brookes was responsible for every single handcrafted system in the game
Interesting.... I don't think I knew MB did all the hand crafted systems (forget so much about this game!)

So I wonder if there's away to work out which ones are MB systems....
