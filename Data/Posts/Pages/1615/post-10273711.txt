Absolutely the problem with the English language, it's open to lots of interpretations... but MB made two comments in a short period of time... and the other one was about anyone finding it more than once... which can be read that it's not always there, so perhaps it does move, or it's cloaked/hidden, or some other reason why he used the word "find" rather than something like "return to it more than once" which would imply a static position? - which might also be a bit of strange comment if it was always there..... e.g. lets flip it and use Earth as an example.... "Earth is always there and you can find it more than once" sounds a bit strange as you know where it is and don't need to find it again? and "Earth is always there and you can return to it more than once" sound better to me but still a bit strange/over stated? .... "Earth is always there" would seem sensible and suffice?

And perhaps if it was always there it wouldn't be "hard to find" in the first place? ;-)

Just a thought...

Aye the 'find it' bit does seem to point towards finding it once but it may not be in the same place next time, hence find it again.
