I like the thoughts around requiring =>Dangerous for Combat, which if the case excludes me (currently) from obtaining any JO.

The only challenge I see with your theory, is that the game has a 'Solo' mode which doesn't require you to interact with other players. So by isolating it to hunting other CMDRs to rank up with PF, FDEV would have to have consciously made an exclusion of finding TDW / RAXXLA (potentially) to only 'Open'.

Thoughts?

True but this isn’t the only way to get PF rep, I just imagine it’s the most efficient way since CMDR’s generally carry higher bounties than Thargoids do or the payment amount you get for search and rescue, iirc rank up in this manner is usually tied to how many Credits you’ve earned in a role. So you could still get there in solo, it’d just take a super long time comparatively. Higher risk higher reward etc. and the PF was formed as a pirate hunting organization so it would make sense that they would award that in greater amounts.
