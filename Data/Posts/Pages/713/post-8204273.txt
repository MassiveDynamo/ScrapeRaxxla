Now that is interesting! Your first mission is from the same faction 'Future of Arro Naga' which I believe Filthymick420 received too whilst in-system? Are you guys allied with 'Future of Arro Naga' by any chance?

I also checked my OLT3 spreadsheet and 'Fong Wang Regulatory State' is not an ally of TDW, but 'Future of Arro Naga' appears to be from the mission data I've been collating.
