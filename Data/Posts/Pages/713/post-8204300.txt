I think I was lacking any faction rank with them. It was base levels. I've since added some donations to them though, but I'm pretty sure after the fact.

I'm currently friendly with them, and they are in outbreak. Edit: I could be wrong. Maybe I got rank with them before. I'm not sure.

Also, is it normal to not have a power contact in jameson memorial?
