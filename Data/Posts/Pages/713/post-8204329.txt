I like the thoughts around requiring =>Dangerous for Combat, which if the case excludes me (currently) from obtaining any JO.

The only challenge I see with your theory, is that the game has a 'Solo' mode which doesn't require you to interact with other players. So by isolating it to hunting other CMDRs to rank up with PF, FDEV would have to have consciously made an exclusion of finding TDW / RAXXLA (potentially) to only 'Open'.

Thoughts?

Pretty much this FD not the type to try to exclude solo players from content there would be a huge uproar if any of the solo players couldn't access Raxxla and TDW station among other things.
