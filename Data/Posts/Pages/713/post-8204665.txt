There are a few more. Interestingly some are planetary, meaning they were moved or added during the beyond update. And like in my last post they have ships near them on the surface. Might just be random content, but they seem to be pirates like in one of the beacons. Might be relevant on some level. Even if it's just flavor about game mechanics.

Anyone seen or heard of Eithure family?

Rammed it to blow it up and it dropped cargo but it won't let me select or see the cargo in my ship. Did they change the game to now allow this?!

Itâ€™s a crashed spy satellite, so no they only have a recoverable intel package. They usually have a landed system authority ship nearby, if it was a pirate faction ship then I guess you were in an anarchy system.
