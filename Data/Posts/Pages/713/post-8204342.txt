True but this isn’t the only way to get PF rep, I just imagine it’s the most efficient way since CMDR’s generally carry higher bounties than Thargoids do or the payment amount you get for search and rescue, iirc rank up in this manner is usually tied to how many Credits you’ve earned in a role. So you could still get there in solo, it’d just take a super long time comparatively. Higher risk higher reward etc. and the PF was formed as a pirate hunting organization so it would make sense that they would award that in greater amounts.

Nice.

I haven't investigated the options either way to clarify 'how' to rank up in PF levels, so if it's possible in either game mode then it's certainly a possibility. Hell, anything is a possibility at the moment as there are so many active theories going on!

I guess 'It's a journey every player will have to take'. ;-)
