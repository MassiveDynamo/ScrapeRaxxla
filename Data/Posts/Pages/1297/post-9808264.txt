I still presume ‘tiny bit obvious’ relates historically to the older (now removed) Dark Wheel missions, which although never naming Raxxla, did heavily allude towards it, ergo a little bit obvious.

I also presume that ‘eyes to see’ is a reference to John Milton who was blind when he wrote (with assistance) Paradise Lost - one of MB favourite stories, and which heavily references the ‘music of the spheres’.

Eyes to see could also relate to Odin, who ripped out his own eye to seek / see knowledge. Odin is also referred to as a vagabond, as well as Thors Oak.

Also there is a strong relationship between John Milton, Philip and Mary Sidney on various levels.

Now of course there is also the H. P. Lovecraft references. I’m no HPL fan, but according to @Allen Stroud MB was…

What it all means we’re still trying to figure out, of course I could be wrong and it’s something else entirely… we keep searching.
