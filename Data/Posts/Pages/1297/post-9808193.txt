I did check Bethlehem Star.
Egyptian hieroglyphs = Ra means Sun-Star, xx???, La is pahlin (love, lover) = star lover.
Astrophel and the spiralling stars = Astro means Star, phel again lover, love) = star lover (spiralling stars = galaxy or maybe Circinus )
star lover(s) in galaxy for eyes to see.
star lover(s) came out to be a Bethlehem Star (yes, Star 3 kings followed). Astronomers never figured that out what star could that be, some say it was Jupiter and Saturn conjunction but some believe it was a supernova explosion that was witnessed by chines astronomers in around 100ad and that is thought to be RCW 86.
RCW 86 is known as Circinus constellation and was mapped by Chandra x-ray observatory.

p.s.Circinatus is from circinus, a pair of compasses, hence means rounded like a circle
