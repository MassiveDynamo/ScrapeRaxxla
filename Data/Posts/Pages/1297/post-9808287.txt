I still presume ‘tiny bit obvious’ relates historical to the older (now removed) Dark Wheel missions, which although never named Raxxla they did heavily allude towards it, ergo a little bit obvious.

I also presume that ‘eyes to see’ is a reference to John Milton who was blind when he wrote (with assistance) Paradise Lost - one of MB favourite stories, and which heavily references the ‘music of the spheres’.

What it all means we’re still trying to figure out, of course I could be wrong and it’s something else entirely… we keep searching.
I think “presuming” anything with MB “clues” is dangerous. He has a sense of humour, clearly likes to misdirect, and wasnt intending to give anything away of any value.

“Tiny bit obvious” could mean obvious, i.e. right under our noses (e.g. Sol), or it could be tiny, as in it’s a SmallObject such as a comet, which strangely are not visually implemented in-game (though FD have the technology to do so) and the Pareco system seems to be intentionally designed to draw our attention to Pareco Comet 1 around which 6 research stations orbit. This makes me wonder if Pareco Comet 1 might be Raxxla and we have to be in exactly the right spot to honk and detect it (N.B. Pareco is also one of the system names that are anagrams of “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars”!). I suspect Raxxla has a detection timeout and it might need several commanders all honking within the 16 seconds scanner recharge period for Raxxla to unveil.

“Eyes to see” could indeed refer to Milton, as he was one of MB’s favourite authors, but it could also refer to the alleged book title, and probbaly a whole load of other interpretations too. My advice is not to get hypothesis-locked by assuming specific interpretation of MB’s phrasing. I think he was very adept at selecting words that were ambiguous & told us very little.
