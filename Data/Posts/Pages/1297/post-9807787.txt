Disagreed (partially). Ascorbius is a good fella, and I'm more than happy to believe him that something was said. It's the exact wording that's the issue. I've seen more than enough misreporting of things where there's an actual video and everyone can see exactly what was said. Given that, I'd never take someone's version of what was said as being verbatim. Especially not with something said by Michael Brookes, who's prone to being a bit mischievous and cryptic.
Ascorbius is the only one who confirmed it on video, countless other commanders have also confirmed that Michael Brookes said this exact thing to a room full of people. At some point you really shouldn't throw that out.

Michael Brookes wasn't cryptic, he said someone was in the system, honked and left. I get that some conflated thiw rumor with the Formadine rift clue from Drew saying you can get there in a stock cobra, but Michael Brooks has been rather candid, if not selective in his wording about Raxxla.
