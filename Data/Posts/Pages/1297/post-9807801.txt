As soon as Arf started his role as CM, he was asked about Raxxla and he replied something in the lines of "it would deserve to be actually something special there?" implying that Frontier changed how/where/what was Raxxla to some bigger "lightshow".

So, my 2cents is that Raxxla was changed, evolved and built upon due to massive interest from the player base. Then we have now locked sectors... entire galactical regions segregated... which I think Frontier will unlock and allow us to actually find it as the game's ultimate treasure hunt community event.
