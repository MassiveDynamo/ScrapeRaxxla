I still presume ‘tiny bit obvious’ relates historical to the older (now removed) Dark Wheel missions, which although never named Raxxla they did heavily allude towards it, ergo a little bit obvious.

I also presume that ‘eyes to see’ is a reference to John Milton who was blind when he wrote (with assistance) Paradise Lost - one of MB favourite stories, and which heavily references the ‘music of the spheres’.

What it all means we’re still trying to figure out, of course I could be wrong and it’s something else entirely… we keep searching.
Paradise Lost, I read somewhere that Adam and Eve are named as star lovers when I was researching Bethlehem Star.
