As soon as Arf started his role as CM, he was asked about Raxxla and he replied something in the lines of "it would deserve to be actually something special there?" implying that Frontier changed how/where/what was Raxxla to some bigger "lightshow".

So, my 2cents is that Raxxla was changed, evolved and built upon due to massive interest from the player base. Then we have now locked sectors... entire galactical regions segregated... which I think Frontier will unlock and allow us to actually find it as the game's ultimate treasure hunt community event.
Raxxla was here before thargoids and guardians and for that reason it can't be found by looking at thargoid or guardian stuff.
Raxxla is DB creation and for that reason there is no way someone besides him could just change it. MB helped DB coded and hide it. I think only those 2 knows where it is, if any of Fdev would have known raxxla location they would have already leaked it or sold that information to someone like they leak so many informations to certain group.

p.s. when one of Fdevs says they know where it is, they mean "we know it is somewhere inside milky way" lol
