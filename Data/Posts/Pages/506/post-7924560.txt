A while ago I tried finding PSR J2222-0137. The main star is a pulsar, but the second star is a faint white dwarf with a temperature of only 3000 K. Apparently at this stage it is just compressing carbon, forming a planet size diamond. I thought it would be a good candidate for the "Jewel that burns in the brow of the mother of Galaxies," but I can't find it anywhere. There's no other designation for the system, and I tried searching the area where it should be. Has anybody else tried to find it?

If you look at the Simbad entry, you will see that there is no distance figure. ED includes all stars in the star catalogues, but only those with distance estimates - so your pulsar won't be in game..
