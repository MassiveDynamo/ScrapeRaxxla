Deserves a bug report. Continuing the search brings you to:

HD 133704, HIP 73849, HIP 73928, HIP 73974, 5 Trianguli, HIP 73765, HIP 73793, HIP 73874, HIP 73906, HD 133729, HIP 74053, HD 133738
HD 13374, HD 133740, HIP 73877, HIP 73912, HIP 73957, HIP 73987, HD 133755, HIP 10108, HIP 73474, stopped searching here.

Strangely enough, I've visited none of these systems.

Edit: One idea is to look in the nav-panel for a system listed there, but not visible in the Galmap (the one you mention)
Click to expand...

the ghost system for 1337 is somewhere between the left and right point... added video of search and bug here(if it is a bug) : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19U2JsxlOiq0XFqySHi73gqSIMxekZ4ye?usp=sharing
