I have reached V1357 Cygni, the location of Cygni X-1 (the secondary in the system is the black hole with that designation). There is one planet, a lava world, which I mapped. The FSS does not show anything else in the system and I flew close to the planet and black hole and nothing unusual was apparent and nothing showed up within 1000 ls of either in the nav panel. I dropped out at the black hole and hit the body exclusion zone at 67.6 km and could not get any closer. I jumped from this proximity to another system and nothing unexpected happened (very minor module damage from heat).

I still think Han Zen's idea that the Dark Wheel toast and the Astrophel clues are giving directional markers that cross over is the best idea around right now, so if there are any other places worth a look nearby let me know, else I'll put this ship into storage at Colonia (I have a DBX with slightly longer range back in the Bubble so this way I will have long range ships in both regions).
I you intend on heading back, I would recommend checking out the Cygnus X Complex: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X_(star_complex)

It should fit well with Gan Romero's comment about 'an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven’.
