the ghost system for 1337 is somewhere between the left and right point... added video of search and bug here(if it is a bug) : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19U2JsxlOiq0XFqySHi73gqSIMxekZ4ye?usp=sharing

It's a bug*

Search for HD 119834, otherwise known as M Centauri (not to be confused with m Centauri, HD 116243) and you'll see the same behavior - you get taken to an empty patch of space with no star.

* Of course, it could be a clue** Someone needs to cycle through ALL of the HD stars and identify those that show as blanks, then plot them on the GalMap to see if they form a giant arrow.

** It's a bug

Edit:
Actually, now I think about it, it should be a spiral, not an arrow
