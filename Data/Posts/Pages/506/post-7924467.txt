Going to throw in my 2 cents and break down how I interpret this thing...

“To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts."

The universe itself is the mother of galaxies. Jewel on the brow makes me think of a crown. I think the whisperer and siren refer to the same thing, and I think that thing is a sentient entity. The parents grief, lovers woe, both refer to losing someone you will never get back. Maybe an event horizon? Vagabond means wandering, without home.. perhaps they yearn to find a home?

The most interesting thing is the first half of this, as it describes a location. Crown has a couple interesting definitions beyond something you wear. Obviously it means the top/peak of something. However it also means:

the part of a plant just above and below the ground from which the roots and shoots branch out.
the upper branching or spreading part of a tree or other plant.

a paper size, now standardized at 384 × 504 mm.
a book size, now standardized at 186 × 123 mm.
noun: crown octavo; plural noun: crown octavos
a book size, now standardized at 246 × 189 mm.
noun: crown quarto; plural noun: crown quartos

The paper sizes immediately look like coordinates. The tree stuff can be interpreted in a few ways. I don’t have time to get as in-depth as I’d like, sorry for the messy and over simplified post but I hope it stirs some ideas in someone.
