Well, thanks. There may have been a possibility I could someday resume a normal life, not hiding in a closet under a blanket, all tin-foiled up. desperately pouring through web pages, PDFs and paperback books, the history channel, Douglass Adams' personal diary, Greek mythology, Norse mythology, Indian mythology, 14th century English poetry, 12 century druidic verses, the Bible, a picture of L Ron Hubbard, ancient Sumerian cuneiforme tablets and a blood pact with Kthulu, with a hotas on my lap and a vr strapped to my face.

But seeing as you've put it all together for me in a neat little archive, it would almost be a shame not to.
