Mutabilis

Eight channels containing the witchspace energy.
There are eight chart.
A point from which all the galactic witchspace wormholes are sustained.
Raxxla is the mechanism that keeps them open, generates them in the first place.
Raxxla isn't a portal, or time machine by design but an alien construction that underpins the very fabric of witchspace.
Linked to space and time.
Witchspace itself is a manufactured construct.
Raxxla is a hub, a centre point for those wormholes.
Every time you take a witchspace jump, you're passing through Raxxla.
