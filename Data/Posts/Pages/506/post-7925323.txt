After all this time since TDW toast was released... Still somebody who thinks that every single sentence of it DOES NOT directly relate to Raxxla ?
Raxxla is the jewel and the siren and the parent's grief and the lover's woe and the yearning... Just think to how Romero's (if Raxxla related) wife and parents must feel...
Imho.

My favorite interpretation of The Myth:. Oolite's Raxxla. Every single jump through witch space is a gift that Raxxla grants us.
But very very unlikely, imho. Note, I'd love to be proven wrong.
