apparently not now showing any population
That’s the one. (And the same post that I went via to get to Jmanis original post too )

Anyway... yeah it’s definitely not showing any population now, I’ve already checked in-game. I suspect that FD have made some changes to stop mystery things being found via the galmap in that way. It scuppered what they’d got planned for finding Jacques, and there was that system someone had spotted near BL that got asked about on a livestream with Dav a while back. - you know, the one where Dav said that there were some outposts of humanity that hadn’t been discovered yet!
