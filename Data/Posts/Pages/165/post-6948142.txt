There’s screenshot from galmap floating around somewhere that shows the population. Will link it if I can find it.

Edit - managed to find it really quickly! It’s Jmanis handiwork, so a reputable source!

Only thing is it might be from a Beta. All the other locations made it into the full game though so it’s very possible this one did too.
