Nice! I'm a little confused by the whole Gnosis jump into the permit locked sector however. They'll be jumping to a single star system within the permit locked region, right? Unless the permit locks are lifted for the sector how will it be possible to jump to other nearby star systems? Will the voyagers be limited to exploring just the one single star system within the region?

No, Gnosis will jump to a single system in Cone Sector, a region of (apparently) several hundred unlocked systems that are surrounded by permit locks to a depth which prevents anything else jumping in. Some of those unlocked systems will be tagged from the days prior to the permit locks application. Don’t think there’ll be anything to find there, but FD might use the event to trigger something new in the Thargoid storyline since the indications are those permit locked areas are their territory.

Was thinking of going along myself, but I still have to do shakedown trips in my KraitX vs PythonX to decide which one I’ll take on DW2; hitching a ride would obviate the point. From the thread looks like some psycopath gankers pirates are already aboard so be prepared.
