There’s screenshot from galmap floating around somewhere that shows the population. Will link it if I can find it.

Edit - managed to find it really quickly! It’s Jmanis handiwork, so a reputable source!

Only thing is it might be from a Beta. All the other locations made it into the full game though so it’s very possible this one did too.

Nice! I'm a little confused by the whole Gnosis jump into the permit locked sector however. They'll be jumping to a single star system within the permit locked region, right? Unless the permit locks are lifted for the sector how will it be possible to jump to other nearby star systems? Will the voyagers be limited to exploring just the one single star system within the region?
