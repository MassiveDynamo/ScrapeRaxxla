So the Canonn guys from Varati (iconic system of the disappeared E/F missions) are aware (I wish I knew how...) of existing unlocked systems surrounded by entire locked regions. They seem to be very well informed. At least much better than we average players.

To be fair, I kbow of them, as well, and I'm not Cannon. It's simply the fact that prior to the permit locks, early exploration CMDR's made their way out there. Honestly, it's part of what cooled me off to whole Gnosis idea anyhow. It won't really be virgin ground, just sort of.
