So the Canonn guys from Varati (iconic system of the disappeared E/F missions) are aware (I wish I knew how...) of existing unlocked systems surrounded by entire locked regions. They seem to be very well informed. At least much better than we average players.

I merely reported a post from Delmonte’s Gnosis-trip thread. I imagine someone had a good rummage in galmap! And I think the original discoverers checked on galmap to see if they still had the tag. There is nothing magical or underhand in Canonn’s operation, just a collection of cooperative intelligent players, much like the Raxxla hunters but with more evidence to test......

I’m a very disconnected member of Canonn nowadays, haven’t really been involved since they moved from Teamspeak to Discord; whatever happened to Cmdrs Lord Zoltan & SpocksOddSocks? I fondly remember the days of testing Unknown Artefacts and trying to decipher whale noise and embedded imagery.
But I still promote application of the Scientific Method!
