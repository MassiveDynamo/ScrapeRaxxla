What Jorki said. But that shouldn't stop you from trying

Think you'll need a 120Ly Anaconda and NS' to enter and depart.

I don’t think there’s a NS in range to provide entry, And I don’t think there’s any NS in that region to provide a return journey, at least as a primary star that would show on galmap.

i tried to get into that region about a year ago (treated myself to an AnnieX when I got to exploration elite) but couldn’t get past the permit locks.
