So the Canonn guys from Varati (iconic system of the disappeared E/F missions) are aware (I wish I knew how...) of existing unlocked systems surrounded by entire locked regions. They seem to be very well informed. At least much better than we average players.

Canonn is good at crowd sourcing. That's the way to know stuff in ED. People spend hours searchmpleing the Galmap. When someone finds something, the Canonn does not forget.

Jmains is a good example of a non Canonn player, that has provided lots of info to the community(cracking the Morse code in the UA, for example). He always reports to the Canonn.

The only other group that works as systematically, is the Children of Raxxla. They never disclose what they have until a discovery is mad though.
