According to FDev someone has already found Raxxla, but they just honked the system and flew on...
So, you know what this means... In order to find it all we need to do is revisit every system that's ever been honked but not explored and go over every single planet and map it :O

THough this may just be a ruse by FDev to give us enough pointless grind to last 2 years for the next major update.

Until someone can provide a reputable source for Frontier having stated that Raxxla has been found and honked then it remains an urban legend. So far no one has located a source that isn't third hand at best.
