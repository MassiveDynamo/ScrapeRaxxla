I’d say 99% it’s Elyssia. Drew hinted very heavily at the time. ‘Those who know the old lore will know who she is’ or something similar to that IIRC.

Also Drew confirmed Elyssia was nearly 200 when she died, and her life had been radically extended by cybernetics and genetics. See:

Edit - updated link to the correct post

A perusal of the original novella, The Dark Wheel, should answer this question for you.

Cheers,
