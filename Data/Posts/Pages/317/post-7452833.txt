In the books, Dark Wheel was observing and approaching pilots with extraordinary skills. Elite status was NOT primary requirement.

From a lore perspective they can of course choose who they want to contact. In the game, it's difficult to measure extraordinary skill. Either way, it has to be a concrete measurable gate.

Unless it's triggered manually by the devs, that is.

I still don't think Raxxla is gated, unless it's in Shinrarta Dezhra.
