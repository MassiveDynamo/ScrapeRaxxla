Upgraded my Conda again and got her up to 60ly and decided to go check out NGC 7822. I had been out that way once before with the intention of going to the rift, but in my 30ly ASP it wasnt happening. Turned back after like 7k light years.

While perusing the systems in 7822 I began to research the nebula. I found an interesting chain of information that is highly relevant to a lot of things and thought I would share.

To begin with NGC 7822 begins nearly on the border of the "Elysian Shores" sector. The Elysian Shores in greek mythology is related to the underworld and hence, persephone, hecate, etc...

From a more scientific perspective, NGC 7822 is part of the Cepheus constellation, named after a Greek figure who was married to none other than Cassopeia. Through this research I found a lead on a star that happens to be in the formadine rift. This "lead" is weak, but it is directly related to all this information as well as the Dark Wheel Toast. Perhaps this information has been shared in the thread already, Im not sure due to the massive size of the thread, but I thought some people might be interested in these connections.
