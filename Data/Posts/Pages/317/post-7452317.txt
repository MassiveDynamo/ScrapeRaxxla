Yesterday on the livestream Of Obsidian Ant was said by DJ Truthsayer that you needto be tripple elite to find Raxxla, how can we find out this is true,
because if it is not then allot of us are lead on a long journey to become triple elite

That has been a long-standing theory proposed by DJTruthsayer. There's not hard evidence either way that you need to be Triple Elite. It certainly isn't a crazy theory as far as theories go. It certainly can't hurt.
