When it comes to game mechanics there is no reasonable way to hide a planet, based on rank.

A triple Elite requirement to get in contact with the inner circles of the Dark Wheel, seem fully reasonable though. If it is practically impossible to find Raxxla without hints or tools from TDW, it may be sort of a requirement?

It is possible to hide a planet behind a permit lock however. We already have an example of one system where Elite rank is required for access: Shinrarta Dhezra. It is quite possible that there is some other permit lock requirement out there that also hinges on the requirement of Triple Elite. This is all conjecture of course. Until someone actually discovers Raxxla we just won't know what, if any, requirements are required.
