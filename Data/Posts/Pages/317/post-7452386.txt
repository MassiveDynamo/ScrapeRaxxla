That has been a long-standing theory proposed by DJTruthsayer. There's not hard evidence either way that you need to be Triple Elite. It certainly isn't a crazy theory as far as theories go. It certainly can't hurt.

When it comes to game mechanics there is no reasonable way to hide a planet, based on rank.

A triple Elite requirement to get in contact with the inner circles of the Dark Wheel, seem fully reasonable though. If it is practically impossible to find Raxxla without hints or tools from TDW, it may be sort of a requirement?
