A triple Elite requirement to get in contact with the inner circles of the Dark Wheel, seem fully reasonable though. If it is practically impossible to find Raxxla without hints or tools from TDW, it may be sort of a requirement?

In the books, Dark Wheel was observing and approaching pilots with extraordinary skills. Elite status was NOT primary requirement.
