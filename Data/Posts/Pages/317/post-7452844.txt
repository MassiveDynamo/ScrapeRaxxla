That has been a long-standing theory proposed by DJTruthsayer. There's not hard evidence either way that you need to be Triple Elite. It certainly isn't a crazy theory as far as theories go. It certainly can't hurt.

Its not a crazy theory but it has to be also said that no one who is triple elite is any further to finding it to those that aren't.
