Just curious here, the cogs are turning in my head, when Jason Ryder was killed, and he shoved his son into the escape pod, is there any mention of what system they were in at the time?

Or what station his son ended up at? since we know the escape pod system delivers, or is supposed to deliver, the pod to the closest station, correct?

Just thinking we might be able to infer a general direction from where these events occured.
The attack occurred in the Leesti system but Alex Ryder wakes up in a Moray hospital ship, not a space station.
