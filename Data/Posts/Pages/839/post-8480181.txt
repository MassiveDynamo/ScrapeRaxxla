I've had this rattling around my head for weeks, months now. I guess I finally feel like I need to say it. The alleged Dark Wheel toast? I think it's meaningless as far as in game clues. I know this won't be popular, but I really think we are wasting our collective time, however interesting all the mythology surrounding it may be. Here's why. For starters, the Dark Wheel is also searching for Raxxla. They also do not know where it is. So how could there be clues to its location in a toast given by an organization that doesn't know its location? Also, if indeed there are clues to be found in the toast, that feels a little meta-gamey to me...using NPC text to speak to players? The game has never done that before, so why now? And lastly, weren't we told "no clues?" I don't know...to the guys carrying on the research and who are commited to the cause, by all means carry on. I've just gotten so stuck in the "it's in a permit locked system" rut, I can't get out. Even the Potato Hunt thing I've been (poorly) contributing to, seems a fool's errand.
