I've had this rattling around my head for weeks, months now. I guess I finally feel like I need to say it. The alleged Dark Wheel toast? I think it's meaningless as far as in game clues. I know this won't be popular, but I really think we are wasting our collective time, however interesting all the mythology surrounding it may be. Here's why. For starters, the Dark Wheel is also searching for Raxxla. They also do not know where it is. So how could there be clues to its location in a toast given by an organization that doesn't know its location? Also, if indeed there are clues to be found in the toast, that feels a little meta-gamey to me...using NPC text to speak to players? The game has never done that before, so why now? And lastly, weren't we told "no clues?" I don't know...to the guys carrying on the research and who are commited to the cause, by all means carry on. I've just gotten so stuck in the "it's in a permit locked system" rut, I can't get out. Even the Potato Hunt thing I've been (poorly) contributing to, seems a fool's errand.
I totally accept you may well be right. It might not be a clue...hell....raxxla might not even be discoverable, but.....
Apart from either:
A) Abandoning the search or
B) Trying to write force 400 billion systems and almost countless bodies
The "clues" (yes I know there will be no clues) are all we have to go on...plus...its fun - and that's the ultimate objective right?
I really hope the Codex does have "clues", either in the DW toast or in the Raxxla codex entry (or both). If they were ever proved to be pure "fluff" then this would be far far worse than the Gan Romero debacle and probably a game ender for me, personally. Gan Romero (plus realising I was playing too much) lead to me taking a 6 month break
