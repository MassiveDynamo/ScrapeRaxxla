Mmm. Just wanted to do a keyword search through the old Galnet articles, but cant get either Heinrichâ€™s archive (http://ed.frank-heinrich.net/index.php?title=Galnet_Collection_News_Articles) or the french searchable galnet site (https://news.galnet.fr/enclave-established-in-witch-head-nebula/) to actually do a sensible search and return the article containg the keyword. This used to work! Am I being obtuse?
