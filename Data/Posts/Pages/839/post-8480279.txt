As I suggested yesterday the toast more likely to lead to/represent their dark station.

MB said there would be no clues several years ago; since then I think we've had several clues, including the Codex itself. This is why I want to search the Galnet News archive! Weeding out false leads & incorrect hypotheses is a lengthy process however!

What you are suffering from is Questors' Quadrantanopsia, a rare brain conditon brought about by searching for something but you don't know what it is and you don't know where it may be.

Symptoms may include visions, fatigue, ennui, despondency and an addiction to tonic water. The cure is to:
Begin loop
add some gin to the tonic water
add a slice of lemon
add a single ice cube
drink beverage until glass is empty
If seeing spiralling stars you may exit, if so desired
Repeat
congratulations you have found nirvana, or Raxxla
