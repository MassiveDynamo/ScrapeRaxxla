I put it down to too much lavian brandy...
I am currently experimenting on myself to see what amount imbibed causes one to see Raxxla. I have seen a few stars, but nothing significant to report as yet!

Few more shots and you might even see spiraling stars.

Mm, I start to spiral before hitting the floor & seeing stars, there is a temporal discontinuiy!
It's one step past the temporal discontinuity. You are almost there! Just a little more Lavian Brandy and you'll experience Raxxla. ... Raxxla is old Lavian slag that means to thow-up. The Dark Wheel were and are a secret society of drunken partiers. The toast is a drunken rambling made at one of their parties. ... To Raxxla... {barf}
