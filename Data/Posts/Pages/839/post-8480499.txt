I’m 99% sure that The Dark Wheel has not found Raxxla. First of all we have been told that they haven’t found it and second, I think FD want a player to be the first to get there.
TDW may still have a clue about the approximate region or direction. According to the myth, Jason Ryder knew how to get there. He may have said something or even come up with the toast, before he was killed.

One thing to remember is that TDW is not an earth based organisation. If the toast really contains clues, they may not reference the earth sky. It could be the TDW station system or Lave, but most likely it would be Shinrarta Dezhra. That would provide an Elite rank gate, without extra development.

Just curious here, the cogs are turning in my head, when Jason Ryder was killed, and he shoved his son into the escape pod, is there any mention of what system they were in at the time?

Or what station his son ended up at? since we know the escape pod system delivers, or is supposed to deliver, the pod to the closest station, correct?

Just thinking we might be able to infer a general direction from where these events occured.
