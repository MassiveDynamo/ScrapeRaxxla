There are 15 beacons that may be in the 'Elite History' group that are unaccounted for. See:

Tourist Beacons
docs.google.com

They are labelled as such because they are sandwiched in between other history TBs but that doesn't guarantee that they are. Also no surety that those numbers are in game, so tread carefully as ever before making conclusions.

PS - not my work..
