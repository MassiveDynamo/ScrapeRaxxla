Well we’ve known of Oresrians and Klaxians since the original novella in 1984, & this was reinforced for ED by at least two more “official” books (Premonition and OOTD).

No, there would definitely seem to be Tourist Beacons yet to be discovered, assuming they are consectively numbered, from the gaps in the table https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1eu30UyjpQrWexAglwD1Ax_GaDz4d7l8KD76kSzX4DEk/htmlview#.
Although a lot of the gaps are user-submitted beacons there are several (e.g. 637, 650-663 ) that are Elite History beacons by FD that are not yet known.

Mmmm, ninjad!
