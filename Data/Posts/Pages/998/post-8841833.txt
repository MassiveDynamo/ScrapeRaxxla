To be sure of that we’d have to know where it is, and we don’t.
Moreover we don’t know what it is, or even how we’ll recognise it if we do find it, so we could have already found it and not know!
Since the name sounds alien (IMHO) it is likely to be of Guardian or Thargoid origin. It should be a significant thing, so I’m still of a mind that it’s a Guardian Ark ship (Ram Tah’s decoded messages) or Thargoid planet-sized ship (did that come from a tourist beacon or is it now non-canon lore?). We need to think like an alien- we think we know the location of their homeworlds (in Col70 & Regor sectors) and although we cant get there because of permit locks, but from those homeworlds where (& why) would they send such large ships?

We know aliens had visited Sol because of the Mars Artefact. I’m still suspicious of Triton & Luna!

Afterthought: Post 20, 003 and the thread’s still operational! Although we’re so in the dark in this Quest perhaps it’s been closed and we don’t know it yet?

if we take into account the holdstock report, the thargoids were divided into two factions, remember what they were called.
the truth is little sense from this, all exactly this information will not give us anything, we in fact do not know where to start.

though my theory with Coriolis takes on a reinforced concrete foundation.

can anyone tell us we have not opened all the tourist lighthouses with lore?
