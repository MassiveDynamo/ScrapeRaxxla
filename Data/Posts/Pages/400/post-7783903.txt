on the hypothesis that it may be very obvious, and the RAX_XLA letters spell out (R=18, A=1, X=24, L=12) system coordinates, I've just jumped from Core Sys Sector ON-T b3-7 (18, 1, 24) to LHS 2429 (24, 12, 1)
conclusion: nothing to report!

likewise LHS 2661 (19, 48, 13)

likewise Alrai Sector JB-X b1-5 (19, 12, 48) - just in case they swapped Y&Z coordinates!
