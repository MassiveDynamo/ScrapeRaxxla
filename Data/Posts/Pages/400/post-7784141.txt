It would be epic if the final thing to unlock whatever it is was to gently whisper “raxxla” into your mic.

If you're looking at Raxxla being IN witch space, then you'll have to research all the actions that we can take while in witch space, for starters. Maybe it's not the actual whispering of it, maybe it's the "push to talk" key.
