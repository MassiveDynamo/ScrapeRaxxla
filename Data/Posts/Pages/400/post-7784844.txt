Someone wanted a list of all procedural possibilities or Ra XX la. From the one wiki at least.

Oolite planet list - Elite Wiki
wiki.alioth.net

RAXXLA:

"ABOUSEITILETSTONLONUTHNOAL" (used by the planet description string)



























and " ' 'LEXEGEZACEBISOUSESARMAINDIREA'ERATENBERALAVETIEDORQUANTEISRION" (Planets and systems)





























































Click to expand...

Note: RA and LA are only in the system+planet lexecongen. There is no RA or LA in the planet string which is the first set of names. So, I'm assuming the first list is mute.
