For those who follow the mythology, Oomphalos stone etc, Delphi was discussed andeveryone seemed to jump on a base in the Pleiades. Has anyone checked out Delphi Control Chapter by Pluto in Sol? (don't understand the new symbols yet, but think this is an installation rather than a tourist beacon). In Sol now, can look if requested.

Have some Delphia cake, while you search.
