For those who follow the mythology, Oomphalos stone etc, Delphi was discussed andeveryone seemed to jump on a base in the Pleiades. Has anyone checked out Delphi Control Chapter by Pluto in Sol? (don't understand the new symbols yet, but think this is an installation rather than a tourist beacon). In Sol now, can look if requested.

edit: it's a Mother Gaia Security Installation
edit2: there's a crashed Anaconda on Charon with some cargo units + two shipping containers (couldn't land Tyko's Krait to check it out-landscape too rough) with a landed pirate FGS nearby.

I was in Sol when the codex was first released, so I went straight to the installation and got the normal mini-game where they are attacked by priates etc. Nothing extrordinary, but your mileage may differ..
