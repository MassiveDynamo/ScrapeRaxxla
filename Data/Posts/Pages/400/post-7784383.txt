I was in Sol when the codex was first released, so I went straight to the installation and got the normal mini-game where they are attacked by priates etc. Nothing extrordinary, but your mileage may differ..

I scanned the first data terminal (or whatever it was called) & received a message calling for help under attack by hostile forces. Didn’t look Raxxla-related so set off on Tyko’s trip to Heart Neb to get the mileage (lightyearage?) for Palin, and try to push him up to Elite Explorer, currently at 18% Pioneer.
