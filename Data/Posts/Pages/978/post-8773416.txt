I can see the Winking Cat stuff tying into the current story, but not to the dark wheel or Raxxla. Most of the characters we know of in the dark wheel that could have pulled this off are all dead except possibly one or two (Alessia Verdi or a Ryder).

The Winking Cat heists likely required:
1) Beyond state of the art tech capability
2) Interest in AI dev or control of AI (knows about past 'secret' ai experiments or guardians etc)
3) Sympathy towards the alliance and an need to atone for past actions
4) Some understanding/appreciation of "ancient" art
5) A willingness to work outside the lines
6) Ability to locate 'lost works". (connections to black markets etc)

From this it seems likely that the heists were the result of a state, inra or club backed group. Arissa to my mind is the most likely candidate to be backing the heists. She has the tech. She is aware of the threat of AI as Emperor. She may regret the actions of inra in killing mic turner (which basically no one is supposed to know about in detail except federal and imperical leadership.). She decorates her living spaces with ancient paintings etc per Premonition. She was willing to use unofficial back channels in Premonition, and Salome had a tendency to spark rebellious streaks in people she meets. Having the entire imperial intel apparatus to call upon would make finding/tracking hidden things much easier.

As far as engineers go Jameson(automated systems expert, high level Pilots federation resources), Nemo (Hacking), Tani (mysterious imperial backer, possibly Arissa?,gang ties,power systems) or the Dweller (underground) seem the most likely options, but most any of them (or a sub set) could probably done it given the right motivation. The general connection between engineers and the club muddies this a bit.
