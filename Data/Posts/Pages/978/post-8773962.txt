Was the Adamastor, already in game prior to this Halloween event? Is anything which follows already in game?

No, it was in that mysterious sub-light space between systems that Cmdrs can not get to. Nor were any of the new Coalsack additions, they grew overnight and other stuff was revealed after a huge sandstorm uncovered all the wreckage at the same time.

but DB has said 'What a silly question, of course its in the game'.....but people still take their own POV, it either is or it isnt, its accessible v behind permit, its accessible v its not 'unlocked' yet.
