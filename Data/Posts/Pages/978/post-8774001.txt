Yes my point entirely, I would not put it past DB and MB to hide Raxxla behind some drip fed narrative.

Its in game but we haven't turned it on yet....

As confirmed above these Halloween elements were not available to us prior to that date.

The creator of the Adamastor first appears in The Lusiads, written by Luís Vaz de Camões in 1572, although there is no direct connection to John Milton, this work has some historical comparisons to Paradise Lost but nothing concrete.

Its easy to see how MBs could have utilised it within his source material yet, discounting the occurrence of recent events, could we have discovered the Adamastor using its appearance in his tattoo?

In the Lusiads, its described as appearing with a dark cloud, and a mouth as dark as coal....

On this alone would our scavenging of the Coal Sac brought us to anything prior to 2020, I doubt it.

My point is, if something or other occurs over the next narrative that matches the next element of the tattoo then its 'probable' this wider narrative was written by MBs, as to if it contains or leads us to Raxxla is still up for discussion, but its interesting none the less.
