No, it was in that mysterious sub-light space between systems that Cmdrs can not get to. Nor were any of the new Coalsack additions, they grew overnight and other stuff was revealed after a huge sandstorm uncovered all the wreckage at the same time.

but DB has said 'What a silly question, of course its in the game'.....but people still take their own POV, it either is or it isnt, its accessible v behind permit, its accessible v its not 'unlocked' yet.

Or, more likely (to my mind), it’s been in-game and accessible from the outset but it’s so mind bogglingly obvious that nobody has checked it out (like the single in-game BH that contains an fsd jump trigger) or else it’s a Guardian/Thargoid/ human (gen) ship that might be off the ecliptic somewhere, 80,000ls out...
