So unless MB/FD suddenly seem to be improbably mixing up their lore (not an entirely impossible scenario ) I’m still sticking with Triton. I suspect the Adamastor gen ship is the start of a trail, but nothing to do with TDW/Raxxla; I note the hint at smuggling and unauthorised colonisation. More likely this is scenario building leading to the major invasion of thargoids that we’ve been threatened with for the last five years; makes sense since pic of thargoids on the ground was leaked a while ago and I expect this is going to be a significant part of Odyssey release gameplay...
Unless it’s just a Halloween-related Easter egg
A bit of both maybe, but also a whole load of something else. Not sure how close you've been following it, but the events discovered date to 3111. o7
