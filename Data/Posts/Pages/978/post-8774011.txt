A bit of both maybe, but also a whole load of something else. Not sure how close you've been following it, but the events discovered date to 3111. o7

Iâ€™ve not been following it at all, stuck searching tediously for jumponium in Shinrarta prior to an extended trip out to Sweols...So are we expecting a reveal on 31 October? (I assume you meant 3110 as there are only 30 days in November ).
