"Where" Raxxla "Was"?

About 2:15. Past tense? A clue or filler, was Raxxla an event, is this poor delivery or a deliberate hint, e.g. Winking Cat deals with incidents occurring at different times, artwork from different time periods? Who knows.... smells fishy.

The Winking Cat always perplexed me, probably because it referenced 2 real life paintings by Picasso and Rembrant.

That threw me because Picasso loved Rembrant and replicated many of Rembrants works. The 2 circles is throught to be a reference to Giotto and his perfect 'O' amongst others.

Likewise Picasso had a favorite assignment for young artists to have them try and draw a perfect circle....

By drawing a perfect circle, Picasso aligns himself with Giotto as well as Rembrant as an artist who replies to his critics not with words but simply with a pure line.

What has this this to do with the other 'fictional' artists that The Winking Cat steals? My only hypothesis was that the artwork was irrelevant, the Galnet articles either 'fluff' or red herrings, that something else was being referenced, locations and times?
