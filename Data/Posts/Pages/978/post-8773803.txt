Excellent work Cmdr, well spotted, I feel this is the beginning of the journey mapped out on the skin of Brooks.

I would not be surprised if the journey is purely 'creative' and is a narrative we must follow.

Back in the Truthsayer interview MBs stated he had nothing to comment 'at that time'; and his continued reluctance to publish, in his own account, his best work to date, and then go commission a book cover and then a back tattoo, only raises my suspicions that MBs has already written Raxxla as the goal of his narrative which will be played out, over time in game.

Much like the megaship Adamastor, I am becoming doubtful that its 'currently' discoverable, yes, that its in game, but only within the context that its yet to be 'actioned'.

We will know for certain if this is the case if following FD next big narrative content drop, part of that correlates with Brooks tattoo, then Raxxla may be at the end of this narrative.

We as questers may hold more cards than others, to make a few narrative jumps, but so far if the Adamastor is the starting point whatever comes next may not actually be discoverable until FD place it in game.

Was the Adamastor, already in game prior to this Halloween event? Is anything which follows already in game?

It would make sense for FD to utilise this method of drip feeding narrative, as its what they do.
