Well I’ve gone mad previously trying to decipher the Winking Cat Story line in the past so I don’t feel as though I’m unbiased enough for it now But I’ll just put out a few of the things mentioned within it to possibly generate thoughts.

I’m going off memory because my usual searchable Galnet Archive is down unfortunately.

First theft: A work of art that watches the viewer and adapts itself to fit the viewer.

2nd: Lal Candromir New Dawn statues stolen from Eotienses.

3rd: Giant holosculpture above Olympus on New Years Eve. (I may be remembering out of order, sorry) The sculpture was supposed to be the federation logo. Do we know what that logo is supposed to represent? I tried looking but came up short.

4th: Rembrandt‘s two circles, Guernica by Picasso, Terra Absentia Zoe Okeke from Mars. Terra Absentia might be intended to mean “missing land“ or Land in absence.

5th: Returned a painting to Alioth named Penance Street.

Now in the 4th theft they specified the centuries these works of art were created as 17th, 20th, and 23rd. Could these centuries be applied in any meaningful way to narrow down a location? Or are they indicating something else.

I’ll have to check what you mentionEd Rochester. Sometimes hints to scents like ammonia for example could indicate a relationship to Thargoids.

There’s got to be a reason why they keep bringing up Winking Cat although that storyline ceased so long ago at least in my mind. I remember the devs of Sea of Thieves would leave little objects in their streams to hint at stuff. I think FDEV having the Winking Cat magazine may be a similar approach.
