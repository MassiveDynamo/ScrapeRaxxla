Indeed; the original game was split into paged ‘galaxies’ to fit in available storage (the first machine I built back in ‘75 had a whole 4k of ram!).Jumping with the galactic hyperdrive just paged in a load of new stars. In E,D we call them sectors and they’re much larger than the original game’s ‘galaxies’.

If you read Imprint, it's explained that the Galaxies are just Galcop jump networks.

Only pilots of Elite rank is allowed to apply for full jump priveleges and leave the network. This is probably one of the reasos it was important for Jason Ryder to reach Elite rank.
