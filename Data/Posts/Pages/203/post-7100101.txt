Did anyone else notice the part from Elite: The Dark Wheel when Rafe says "He came back from Deep Space to get a proper team together . . . " when talking about Jason Ryder. This means that the evidence for Raxxla was out in the black. I'm not saying that Raxxla is out there. I'm saying that evidence to for it's existence is out there.

Great Hunt BTW even if other people claim Raxxla to not be in elite yet but I still find the hunt to be exhilarating, even if its all for naught!
