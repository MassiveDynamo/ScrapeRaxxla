Already done thousands of missions of all kinds for TDW and their allies since I started playing. Never saw (almost) any kind of consequences..

What level of influence did you get up to at SD?

Another possibility could be that to get the offer of a permit for Raxxla you might need to get allied with several related factions- hence the comment that TDW is not just a single faction..just trying to think along FD metagaming lines.
