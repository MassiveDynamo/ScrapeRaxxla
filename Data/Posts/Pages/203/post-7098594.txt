I think a lot of you have become far too obsessed with this new "Raxxla Icon" revealed in last week's live stream. Over-analyzing it in search of some hidden meaning, incorporating it in your avatars, etc, etc, etc. It's probably just a placeholder graphic with no intrinsic meaning. Certainly not something to invest time speculating about.

...incidentally the number of dashes that form the body of the hexagon structure form two separate triangles; the sides numbering five dashes being one triangle and the second one being the three sides marked with six dashes. You can fold these two objects into separate three-sided pyramids which, if inverted, could form a part of the Talmor Lens.

I agree that it's a bit early to go all inn on the Raxxla icon.

Personally I'm more pleased to see the TDW logo. Hopefully it will stop speculations on the player made version.
