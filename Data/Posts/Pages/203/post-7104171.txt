My understanding is that Quirium Drives were capable of intergalactic travel. While modern FSDs are as fast as the old Quirium Drives, they don't have even a fraction of the range. Yet another concern with trying to find Raxxla; while it was first discovered in the early days of exploration, that doesn't really narrow it down beyond FDev's "it's in the Milky Way" comment.
