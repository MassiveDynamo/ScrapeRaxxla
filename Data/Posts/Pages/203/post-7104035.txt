Did anyone else notice the part from Elite: The Dark Wheel when Rafe says "He came back from Deep Space to get a proper team together . . . " when talking about Jason Ryder. This means that the evidence for Raxxla was out in the black. I'm not saying that Raxxla is out there. I'm saying that evidence to for it's existence is out there.
Yep. Worth bearing bearing in mind though that TDW is myth and legend, not canon, and also that itâ€™s set more than 200 years ago compared to the current game year. Whatever evidence Jason found would probably have been taken care of a long time ago.
