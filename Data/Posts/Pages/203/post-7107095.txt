My understanding is that Quirium Drives were capable of intergalactic travel. While modern FSDs are as fast as the old Quirium Drives, they don't have even a fraction of the range. Yet another concern with trying to find Raxxla; while it was first discovered in the early days of exploration, that doesn't really narrow it down beyond FDev's "it's in the Milky Way" comment.

Quirium drives were what were in use in the original Elite - max jump range for a non-hacked/engineered Cobra was 7ly.

Galactic hyperdrives were different to standard hyperdrives - they were one-use items. Also it's in doubt whether they were actually intergalactic jumps.
