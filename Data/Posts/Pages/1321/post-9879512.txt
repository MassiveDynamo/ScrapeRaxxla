Your phrasing is confusing me a little (disturbed sleep last night due to cat crying to go out & play with the Dawn Chorus at 04:20 & dog having a fit at 05:30). We know what the Codex is, but how valid is it? Seems to be full of rumour and speculation. We don’t know what Raxxla is, apart from it’s a topic reported within the Codex.

But we do know a little more about Raxxla, beyond the Codex article, from Michael Brookes:
“It’s in the Milky Way”
“But some of it is a tiny little bit obvious”
“It’s something in the game world (not text) but very hard to find”
“It’s not a random thing”
“Anyone can find it, and more than once”

And David Brabens response to the livestream question “does Raxxla exist?”
“ What a silly question...... of course....You don’t know what it is though!”

To me that “a tiny little bit obvious” tautology is very striking. MB is an author and both skilled and careful with his phrasing. So it has always seemed to me to be a clue. What is both tiny and a little bit obvious in ED?
A singularity? a small Black Hole perhaps? There have been speculations one could exist in our solar system and be the 10th planet/cause of Oort Belt disturbances etc. It would have a small detection range (edit: and be about the size of a grapefruit https://www.sciencefocus.com/space/primordial-black-holes/). Or it could be a comet which are in-game but not visually implemented, but they do have a small (20km?) instancing range....anything else?

We also know IIRC from Allen Stroud that it is a topic within the Alien lore book that we have no insight into. Not sure if/how that helps, but it led me to speculate it’s one of the Guardian ark ships that Ram Tah’s decodes mentioned.Though I suspect MB wouldn’t have then called it “tiny”.

Edit: a comet has data type “SmallBody” , which is close to “tiny”!
