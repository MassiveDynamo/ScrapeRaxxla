Well, still considering the toast. Hypothesising that it is a directional clue and Jewel is Sol (Galnet article) or LAWD 26 (WR star!!) and WHisperer is Sirius, Siren is Lucifer...
journeyed within Sol towards Sirius 2,000,000ls and vice versa...
journeyed within LAWD 26 towards Sirius 2,000,000ls & vice versa...
nothing to report!
