The problem with the Codex is that we don’t know what it is

Is it just lore, is it information, or is it pictorial, via optic allusion or verbal emblems?

If it’s lore, it simply is FD tidying up loose threads, but its inclusion identifies it as information by its existence, so it merits investigation.

If it’s a collation of information, it ought to be identifiable through analysis, sadly none have born fruit, so far, except possibly the Tau Ceti temporal concept.

If it is pictorial then it’s fitting with FD historical modus operandi of utilising wordplay. If true the Codex may also contain a cypher or literary reference, except we have no basis nor axis to work from.

For instance the inclusion of a drunk ‘Core’ in the Codex could be interpreted (as by example there are multiple) as ‘Kore’ / ‘Persephone’ as pirates were also involved in that tale… https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-9706079

There also is the strong possibility it contains counter intelligence, misdirection or red-herrings, which given the audiences collective abilities would be applicable.

I suspect it’s a combination of all. However we can not assume FD are utilising standard references, and said references may be interpreted differently based upon where you reside, or abilities, or biases, which introduces a high level of doubt in FD reliability as a source.

The application of such logic would therefore possibly suggest the information is either erroneous or incredibly obvious?

I’m somewhat wavering towards it being absurdly obvious.
