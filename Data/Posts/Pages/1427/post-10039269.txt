The problem here is Frontier did not. The Codex is actually got my back that everything is canon. This is the in-game description of Lavian Brandy:

A highly valued liquor from the old world of Lave. Using ancient breeds of grains grown in its tropical climate under a permit from the government, the distillate is kept in old Earth oak barrels and held in an orbital maturing facility for decades to achieve maximum richness.

This rare good is legal in all systems except for Prison Colony systems and Federal and Alliance Theocracy systems.

Cheers!
