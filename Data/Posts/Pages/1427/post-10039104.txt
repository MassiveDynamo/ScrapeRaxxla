You've finally entered your Turnip phase XD

How much would your theory change if Sirius was the axis?

I've been doing a lot of work on trying to reconstruct the narrative 'backstory' using the bits we know, and Sirius is - as we all know - a stupendously large player in galactic history.
The theory works by knowing the axis, then the boundary of the ‘crystalline sphere’ (our universe by Miltons abstract concept); Pandemonium is the Celestial South Pole. Which sits outside this sphere below ‘Chaos’. It’s effectively 2 spheres one within the other.

If you know the diameter of the Crystalline Sphere then you know its radius. Pandemonium ought to be at least 1 radius away from the outer rim of the sphere; the gate of heaven ought to be x3 this distance from Pandemonium. *edit this is now known to be incorrect, this distance should be attributed from the centre eg Sol.

At present we don’t know where this Crystalline Sphere extends, I’m presuming it’s Achenar via the attribution of 2296 as a clue to a sphere of influence.

But Pandemonium is closer than Achenar which technically places it inside the sphere.

Technically it’s irrelevant as if FD were to utilise this theory then technically you don’t need to know where this hypothetical boundary is; all one needs do actually is follow the celestial pole upwards… that if it’s on the pole, it might not be…

Milton’s text is vague it that relationship, it’s very abstract, and some place these points of interest ’just off’ the pole so it could be anywhere really!

And of course this theory falls down fast as it’s 100% reliant on Milton, it’s highly likely if true it’s more likely to be an archeological artefact, of either a half completed concept, or nerfed narrative… or only partially reliant on Milton… the rest could be Lovecraft etc it’s only part of the puzzle; so all in all very likely just Space-Madness!

*bell rings

It might be a location at an equal distance between Pandemonium and Sol; mathematically that ought to be the boundary of the Crystalline sphere!

A midpoint is the exact center point between two defined points. To find this center point, midpoint formula is applied. In 3-dimensional space, the midpoint between an example (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z1) is (x1+x2 )/2,(y1+y2 )/2,(z1+z2 )/2

Resolving to = 17.078125, -57.015625, 22.984375

Extrapolating that you get: -17.078125 / 57.015625 / -22.984375 = LHS 2522…as Heaven’s gate!

Obviously utter nonsense, I prefer the Turnip idea…
