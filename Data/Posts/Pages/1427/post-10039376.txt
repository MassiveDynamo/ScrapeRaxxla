I agree. This is why I chose to not treat the old statements / novels as 'facts' anymore, I rather have it in the back of my mind as background knowledge.
I think I also agree with some of you who says the Codex is the only true source we have today, so I'll be avoiding the other sources.

Not saying other folks are wrong, that would be a bad idea (tm). We need the alternate paths, because we have now idea still after 7-8 years.
We (individually) just have to chose what sources & theories use to create the path we take to find Raxxla.
