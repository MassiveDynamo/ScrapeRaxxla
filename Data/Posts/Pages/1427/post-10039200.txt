But rather to brute force whit all known Systems, brute force whit only the ones from this tread may make it doable in the lifetime of our universe
Brute force doesn't necessarily mean to attack the problem by using 7 nested loops.
A slightly faster algorithm for the problem "find 7 systems that form a 3D-cross" may look like this:
1) Iterate i1 over all known systems in region of interest
2) Iterate i2 over all known systems in region of interest, where i2 > i1 (to test each pair only once)
3) Calc the point "goal" in the middle between systems[i1] and systems[i2].
Iterate i3 over all systems that could be close.
Use grid or octree to limit the search for systems in the vicinity of point "goal".
If any systems are within distance tolerance of goal, remember each triple formed by systems[i1], systems[i2] and 1 system more-or-less in the middle between the two.
4) After you have collected all such triples, you search all triples for sets of 3 triples that share the same system in the middle.
5) For each result, you check if the 3 triples form a cross (meaning angles of 90 degrees +/- tolerance).
