The Venusian logs specifically say this:


The Venusian didn't have Supercruise, the ships attacking it did. Some Gen ships do know about "outside society" and choose not to get involved. The Golconda and dredgers taught us that. There's no reason at all that the Venusian wasn't fully aware of "the outside world" and all the advancements in drive technology.

Supercruise is a function of FSD, and we know that FSD became publicly available around 3290. Galnet source. As far as I'm aware Supercruise and FSD are synonymous and therefore the Venusian logs must date from post 3290. Problem solved.

I'm not saying there hasn't been a mass conspiracy (we know there has been one), but I'm not sure this is a smoking gun for another one

I never said Venusian had supercruise. I actually had highlighted there is a journal from First Encounters implicating the oldest of the INRAs, Imperial Navy Research Arm. Now are Bubble ships Imperial-speak for generation ships? Or did this happen right at the end of generation ship era. Casimir drives are linked to Bubble ships. Regardless, it seems the that Feds and Imperials were working together to destroy colony ships. The speed matching part of the journal is what makes me think this is supercruise.
