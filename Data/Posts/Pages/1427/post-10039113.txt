We really, really need to know when supercruise came about and if it was connected with one of the various INRAs. Venusian generation ship seems to indicate a much earlier origin of this technology.

The Venusian logs specifically say this:
Two small ships of unknown designation were briefly caught on sensors until they initiated supercruise and disappeared.

The Venusian didn't have Supercruise, the ships attacking it did. Some Gen ships do know about "outside society" and choose not to get involved. The Golconda and dredgers taught us that. There's no reason at all that the Venusian wasn't fully aware of "the outside world" and all the advancements in drive technology.

Supercruise is a function of FSD, and we know that FSD became publicly available around 3290. Galnet source. As far as I'm aware Supercruise and FSD are synonymous and therefore the Venusian logs must date from post 3290. Problem solved.

I'm not saying there hasn't been a mass conspiracy (we know there has been at least one), but I'm not sure this is a smoking gun for another one
