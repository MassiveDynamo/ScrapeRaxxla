A cunning plan

Following on from the John Milton Conundrum; if we extrapolate along a trajectory starting from Pandemonium via Sol; but apply the John Milton equation of x 3; we identify Akras.

This is based upon the assumption where Milton identifies in Paradise Lost, the distance from Hells gate to the gate of Heaven as being 3 times the radius (or mini diameters) of the celestial sphere.

If we accept Pandemonium as the Celestial South Pole, and Sol as the axis, if this calculation is correct, based upon the distance from Sol to Pandemonium, this ought to place the Celestial North Pole at: -68.3125 / 228.0625 / -91.9375 = .

Äkräs (also Ägröi, Egres) is a Finnish god of fertility and the , the protector of beans, peas, cabbage!

Based upon its absurd naming it’s highly unlikely that Akras is the intended Celestial North Pole. This draws attention to the assumption that Sol, is not the true Axis or that the distance attributed is incorrect.

It may also be, that FD are not aware of this John Milton calculation or it has been misinterpreted by this Cmdr.

The prevalence of the Yggdrasil system and Norse runes systems does open this up to a much wider context. On its own they hold little relevance other than assisting to denote the diameter of the Milton mobile, therefore it either identifies there is no Celestial North Pole, or that a Yggdrasil system is being utilised as the primary axis, or Raxxla is shaped like a turnip.

You've finally entered your Turnip phase XD

How much would your theory change if Sirius was the axis?

I've been doing a lot of work on trying to reconstruct the narrative 'backstory' using the bits we know, and Sirius is - as we all know - a stupendously large player in galactic history.
