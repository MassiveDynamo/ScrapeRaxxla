Relax, it's only the Terry Pratchett approach to problem solving:
"Sometimes it's better to light a flamethrower than curse the darkness."

I have already proven it was one continuous Universe. Earth is in the lore of every single game at minimum. Even the Codex states Lakon Spaceways is from Sol originally. The modern version of the oldest ship is the Type-6 Transporter (originally known just as Transporter in the first game). Even Lavian Brandy is made in Oak barrels from Earth per in-game description. The naming scheme is really a trivial difference and I have found pretty much all the major lore systems in Elite Dangerous. It is fair game for explaining away quirks in the lore as far as I can tell. By the way, the Earth being present in all games is an absolute requirement for Holdstock version of Raxxla to be real. We're pretty much down to locating where that take leads us. Soontill being a cover story is the other requirement.
