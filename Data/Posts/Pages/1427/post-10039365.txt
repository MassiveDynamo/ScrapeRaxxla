‘Some will know from our timeline that many thousands of ‘generation ships’ left the safety of Earth beginning in beginning in the 24th century onwards’

‘In those days when faster-than-light communication didn’t exist, many of these potential settlers faced terrible risks alone, travelling thousands of light years into the black’….

‘The plight of The Missing is just one of the things that will become more prominent over the coming year and the Commanders of the Pilots Federation will be pivotal in solving these mysteries. You can expect more news on this soon’…

I wonder how much of this got exaggerated or misquoted over time, how much was retconned, I remember when this was posted, the indication at the end felt like ‘more was to come’ but it didn’t, at least not to my perception, leading to Braben’s leak about ‘number stations’… like many other elements in game, I feel it’s partly inconsistent, partly half written and likely other elements were later cobbled together by other writers when certain employees left ED?
