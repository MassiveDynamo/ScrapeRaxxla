I think it's possibly this that I was thinking of, so definitely inconsistent with current in-game lore.

I think I might also have got this merged with that pist by Sapyx that we can't find sources for:

Generation Ships: All you need to know
I posted some musings on Generation Ships in a thread in the main forum, and popular demand (well, OK, it was DNA-Decay, but I'm sure he's quite popular in some parts) requested I post the information in the Lore subforum, so it didn't get lost. Rather than simply duplicate it, I'll reformat it...

I currently suspect that most of this information was from the Drew Wagar site, which I'm sure he stated was meant to be canon based on his dealings woth fdev at the time, but has since been deleted (I'm guessing due to retcons).

The fact that there definitely seem to have been retcons during the span of the game, it gets very frustrating. I'm starting to suspect Frontier are trying to make it seem as if The Club have hexediting us all. I really need thicker tinfoil! (I'm sure the Christmas livestream suggested we might need it for some reason, but that might only have been for the Turkey.)

I find it curious that some CMDRs love to toss around "retconn" when even Allen Stroud says he hates the term.
