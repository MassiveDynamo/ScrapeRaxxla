This is the Tao Ceti Probe, is this what you looking for?
I know about that. Found a reference to supercruise on the Venusian's logs (someone had brought up generation ships as possible clues) and now trying to somehow date those events to see it fits the INRA reverse engineering story or means we've had supercruise for a really long time.
