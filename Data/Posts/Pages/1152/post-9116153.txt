I remember some discussion about DB’s “numbered systems”, that this was clarified by MB as “number stations” and these are the LP/UCB, and that FSP is an ID code (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/stations-labelled-with-fsp.140306/post-2149575) generated from the co-ordinates/name of the star system because feds are impersonal and like numbers...

However did anyone actually made a list/database of all the Fed Space Port (FSP) numbers with name and location?

Edit: Ah, good old Yelboc started one! https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/analyse-fsp-starport-numbers.478369/
@yelboc But don’t know how up to date it is?
