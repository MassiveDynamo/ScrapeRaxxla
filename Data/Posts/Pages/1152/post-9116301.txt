I waffle back and forth on whether I think the Martian Artefact was the source of information on Raxxla or maybe the probes, or something else.

1st scenario - we find the Martian Artifact and then translate it - getting some possible location information and the name Raxxla. Maybe then send some probes out to it.

2nd scenario - We find Raxxla first through probe ships and find some inscription there that leads back to Mars and the finding of the Martian Artifact.

3rd scenario - Finding an object the size of a childs hand on a planet, or finding a mysterious Raxxla in the depths of space.... is very much a needle in a ridiculously large haystack (as we all know). Maybe there was something on earth that lead to the finding of things on Mars and the knowledge of Raxxla? And was kept secret ?
