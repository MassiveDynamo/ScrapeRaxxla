I thereforce have strong reason to believe the discovery of Raxxla and/or Soontill happened between 2280 (or slightly before - Mars Artifact) - 2735 (a period of 455 years).

This is the point I was making when you first said this. I have reason to believe it was discovered before 2296 as that is the first mention of Raxxla in Arts journal - unless it was a psychic prediction

Per the tourist beacon in Lave the first RECORDED interaction between humans and thargoids happened in 2849

And per GaNet 8th Apr 3307 it was in 3111 so Im waiting to see which one gets retconned

The Adamastor vanished in 3111 after an incident that may have involved the first historical encounter with the Thargoids

P.S. The Penguin is back!
