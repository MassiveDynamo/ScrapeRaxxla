4. Stamped on the bottom in a strange pictorial language were the words 'Made in Raxxla'

Which reminds me, a friend of a friend was using their phone SatNav the other day and when looking at the route found Raxxla. Its apparently a Buddhist retreat in Canada, he hasn't reported back since afaik
Just a heads up, CMDR Bluecrash from the IRH Discord found what looks like a Caesar cipher decoder on a building or a megaship. It lacked the full complete parts but looks like a decoder. I am trying to see if he can get me it and we decode it. There is one other thing, I stumbled across and mentioned on the Canonn and IRH Discords, there is book by Plutarch that Braben or some of the programmers seems to have read that seems to hint there are multiple paths to the solution and discusses a way that humans saw the stars and planets. But there are enough odd coincidences that it has me intrigued. It along with the in-game timelines is why I am growing increasingly suspicious of Delphi system as the omphalos (center) when it may have been Sol as the reference that is required to find Raxxla. I'd honestly suggest we all read it because like I said it seems to explain how the puzzles are built especially TDW and Raxxla itself. Still reading but nonetheless interesting.


UPDATE: This proved to be an unrelated image (not from the game) and has been shelved until such time better evidence can be presented.
