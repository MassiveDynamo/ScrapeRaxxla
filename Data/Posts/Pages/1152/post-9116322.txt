I waffle back and forth on whether I think the Martian Artefact was the source of information on Raxxla or maybe the probes, or something else.

1st scenario - we find the Martian Artifact and then translate it - getting some possible location information and the name Raxxla. Maybe then send some probes out to it.

2nd scenario - We find Raxxla first through probe ships and find some inscription there that leads back to Mars and the finding of the Martian Artifact.

3rd scenario - Finding an object the size of a childs hand on a planet, or finding a mysterious Raxxla in the depths of space.... is very much a needle in a ridiculously large haystack (as we all know). Maybe there was something on earth that lead to the finding of things on Mars and the knowledge of Raxxla? And was kept secret ?

Honestly, I think there is probably a military or research planetary/moon base that has info on what they found (especially those with the + symbols included in the name). Someone knows what the artifact was. As of now some of these have special data beacons you can scan for personnel and other details (not universal). But, honestly, might be more fun once Odyssey comes out have having to sneak in and hack the data panels in the buildings. Just watch out some of those places have redundant security systems.
