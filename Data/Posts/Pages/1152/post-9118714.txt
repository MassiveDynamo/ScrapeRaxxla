and yet no one asked the question how access to raxxla is related to the rank of elite?
She was discovered long before the introduction of the ranks, if I'm not mistaken.
Pilot's Federation founding was 2805. This was 70 years after the Birthright Wars (2621 - 2735).

The assassination of Dr. Joreb Innitu (a Thargoid researcher) happened in 3251 in Beta Hydri. I thereforce have strong reason to believe the discovery of Raxxla and/or Soontill happened between 2280 (or slightly before - Mars Artifact) - 2735 (a period of 455 years). The assasination looks to have been politically motivated (to stop the spread of info about the Thargoids). Keep in mind, the first large scale return wasn't until 18 JUL 3305 - https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/18-JUL-3305 ). Per the tourist beacon in Lave the first RECORDED interaction between humans and thargoids happened in 2849. Given the key phrasing about RECORDED that means the government of Sol likely discovered something about the Thargoids between 2280 (or before) - 2621. The earliest dates this likely would have occurred (due to hyperspace probes launched mid to late 22nd century - 2101-2200 - see Tau Ceti tourist beacon) would likely have been somewhere between 2250 - 2620.
