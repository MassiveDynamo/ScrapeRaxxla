while I was not here, I did not sit around. I researched I checked. I am still trying to investigate using in-game information only. But there is a question, does anyone remember when we found out about the toast, just maybe we blindly got to the solution and so that we would not solve it fd introduced a toast so that we would go on the wrong path?

I can also give you an idea, but what if you need to search for toast using the zero point base of the dark wheel (509)?


If anyone is interested in my investigation in general terms:
Using information only from the game, the first thing was decided to start the search with tau ceti, where the first mention is the starting point (by the way, it can be a pearl in the crown of the mother of galaxies, because the first colony). He found nothing interesting except Van Maanen's Star. getting access there came to a dead end ... Maybe someone has any ideas?
The second phase of the investigation is the old worlds. There was the first contact with the Thargoids, I wonder what they forgot there in such proximity to the sol
