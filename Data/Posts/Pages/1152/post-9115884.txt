The Codex says Lyta Crane is unequivocally ambiguous, she may even be an outright obfuscator
While I will give you that much my take is at best it is close but not perfectly accurate which means the following:

-Gas giants could mean techically mean anything from your standard fair gas giant to sub-stellar objects (brown dwarfs) that will never be able to fuse Hydrogen to Helium.

-8 moons means any configuration not just the H one -- if moonlets count towards the total of 8 you could have some F and G moons that are fair game.

-IF it has been there since the beginning, it doesn't have to be landable to be fair game. The Omphalos Rift likely orbits the moon and you have to get close enough to detect it. I sincerely doubt a system scan will reveal it or even a FSS. This is going to be something where you have to be ACTIVELY looking for it.

-I would argue between TDW codex, Raxxla codex, and reports on Thargoids the odds are good for a wormhole. Also, there is the fact there was an assassination over this knowledge at Beta Hydri in 3251 (see text from the tourist beacon below). Omphalos Rift has often been called a "place that is not a place, a door that is the key". This phrasing is important as it is taken directly from liminal myths and and liminal beings (or threshold entities). This mean it connects at least two places simultaneously.

Text from the tourist beacon in Beta Hydri:
In 3251, the publication of "The Thargoids: Truth and Fiction" by Dr Joreb Innitu of the Alien Studies Department of the Ghandi Institute based on Wicca's World (Alioth) inflamed tension between the Alliance and other political powers. He was ambushed and assassinated whilst leaving the Beta Hydri system after a scientific conference.

My take on this event is this is a case of either the Federation or the Dark Wheel silencing this knowledge before it became part of the public consciousness. Remember, the Ryder sons split from TDW over prioritization of Soontill or Raxxla but supposedly only ever found Soontill. Soontill was loaded with Thargoid goodies. This says to me someone already knew there were connections back to the Thargoids. So this means Raxxla or Soontill was discovered that year or a few years prior (the Mars Artifact isn't until 2280). So let's just say Raxxla was discovered 2250 by the hyperspace probes (remember these were launched in the mid or late 2100s) and Soontill maybe a decade prior. This means we have 500 - 1000 years of slow hyperspace travels (hours to days per jump) before it is uncovered. It also provides a motive for assassination. You don't kill a researcher unless you are really terrified of this knowledge becoming public and causing a panic. I can assure you that is why in 2280 when the Mars Artifact was uncovered it promptly locked in a vault and made utterly top secret.
