I think normally it would look silly. But if you are spawning a single unique handcrafted object based on rank or a permit, and only making it visible (or accessible) to people with those prerequisites (or perhaps to those in the same wing or instance with someone with those prerequisites), for something like Raxxla it makes perfect sense. There are certainly ways they could do it without "breaking" multiplayer. YMMV.

Edit: Doesn't everyone play solo mode anyways?
You need a how and why explanation. For a TDW Station, the why is given. They don’t like non Elites. How is a bit more tricky.

For Raxxla the why is unclear. Alien consructs don’t care about rank and wicked Elites would not welcome anyone.

I thin the rank lock is put on TDW. Raxxla does not need it. It’s hidden well enough for anyone to bump into it, by accident.
