You need a how and why explanation. For a TDW Station, the why is given. They don’t like non Elites. How is a bit more tricky.

For Raxxla the why is unclear. Alien consructs don’t care about rank and wicked Elites would not welcome anyone.

I thin the rank lock is put on TDW. Raxxla does not need it. It’s hidden well enough for anyone to bump into it, by accident.
I'm not saying it has to be a rank lock. I'm saying it could be a secret permit, with multiple prerequisites (the various stages of the mystery that need to be solved) before the "permit" reveals the location. Or a similar mechanism.
