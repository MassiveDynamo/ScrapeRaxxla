4. Stamped on the bottom in a strange pictorial language were the words 'Made in Raxxla'

Which reminds me, a friend of a friend was using their phone SatNav the other day and when looking at the route found Raxxla. Its apparently a Buddhist retreat in Canada, he hasn't reported back since afaik
Ommmmmmmmmm,...
