It's nice to see the familiar faces around here

Former UA Bearer here, ready to activate once 1.4 hits.

I faintly remember reading that the black boxes have the same audio and it translates to "this is a black box, please return to the nearest station" or something similar. Here is hoping I'm wrong.

The writings on the side could be interesting. If any. Writings on SAP8s and various other items/rares seem to be a dead end as most of them match, even the serial numbers. Only difference is that some are missing.(Did NOT decode the barcode though, but I suspect it's the same)
