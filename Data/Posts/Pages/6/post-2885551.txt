Thanks. I do know it moves, that's why it caught my attention. I'm not fully aware of the lore behind it though, and I will explore it a bit. I never thought it might actually be looking for something.

If it is, I will try to follow that lead (also a hunch...). The lore I can study from hotels, and if the lore gives some hint on my "hunch", then I'll need the game, which is hard to get into lately due to work.

In any case, I like these kind of mysteries and I need a new goal in the game, so I hope you don't mind that I tag along for the search.

That the actual presence of Raxxla has been confirmed by DB is a great incentive. I'm one of those that was very involved on the search for the Formidine Rift, just to find out that it isn't there, but it was a great search nonetheless.
