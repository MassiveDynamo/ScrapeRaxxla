As for missions in isolated systems: I have just finished a tour of the Sirius corp "footholds". Apart from the last 2 that are close to each other, all of the others had only charity and raxxla missions. So I conclude that these are the only mission types present in any system that does not have a close neighbour (15 ly)

The isolated systems I've found and run missions in, seems to confirm this pattern. Not sure why "The Silent Song Of The Spheres" mission requires another system though.
