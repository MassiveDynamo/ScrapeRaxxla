If you are looking for piles of Elite Missions, try the Canonn's proposed home system of Varati. I took 4 Obfuscating missions in 1 hit yesterday, all to another station in the same system. There are always many Sap 8 missions available to those with the rank.
The system is also the closest to Polaris.

Hi Dommaarraa, Varati is indeed special with regards to the Elite missions, there's a lot of special types of the missions; the "Obfuscated In..." missions all goes to Forsskal Hub, so this outpost is special somehow. There's no "Sealing The Deal" or "The Silent Song Of The Spheres" missions, which is a bit strange, I can understand the absence of the "Sealing The Deal" missions as there's no nearby populated systems for the Dark Wheel to join forces with, but I'm a bit surprised about the absence of the "The Silent Song Of The Spheres" missions.

The actinic light of the Varati main star is very pleasing to my eyes, so I might stay a while in Varati.

I'll go hunt for systems similar to Varati to see if the pattern repeats itself.
