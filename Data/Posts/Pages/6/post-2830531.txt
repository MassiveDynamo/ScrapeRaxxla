Voices In The Black Box Missions

Apparently the Black Box'es have been seeded from the factory with identical voice soundtracks?, just recorded a black box from Synuefe VQ-B B46-1 and the voices definitely sounds like this previous recording. So I really hope that other Cmdr's recordings contains other voice tracks...
