Hello Commanders, I'm sharing this with you in the case you missed it: http://www.drewwagar.com/progress-report/raxxla-the-definitive-guide/

From the wording chosen by Drew I'd bet that he doesn't know the location, only DB.

Then I have an idea, if you remove all filters from the map, you can see some "bright spots": maybe one of those "bright spots" include a very special system?
On the other hand, it could be in a zone with a very difficult access, such as out of the plane of the galaxy, with sparse systems. Which one would be the most probable choice by FD, knowing that "there will be no clues"?

Thanks for the link, very interesting!

I actually think that there has to be hints, nobody found them yet, or we did and didn't realize. Probably the elite missions are the biggest hint, but they are unavailable to me yet. By the way, which are the target system for these missions? Do they follow a pattern, or point in a specific direction?

Removing the filters is an idea, but there are still tons o special systems seen with your method. We need an approximate direction.

The planet is supposed to be rogue (am I right?). If so, there is no known way to find or jump into a rogue planet. There is a way though on how it could have been implemented, and you can look into the ancient probe in Sol as an example. FD could have placed the planet in a normal system, but very far away, without orbit, and maybe only detectable by looking at a specific direction. A rogue planet would also be without a sun (or too far away), and thus ice type and landable in horizons! Again just a hunch...
