Yes, although I guess it doesn't hurt to try again

Edit: Raxxla not found in search in 1.3 or 1.4, Jaques station still at Gliese 1269 in both.

Hi. Interesting search. Not Elite yet and sadly barely any time available for helping, but would love to participate.

One question though. What does Jaques Station have to do with Raxxla, that you are monitoring it's position?
