Wow! A search of this thread and it appears I'll be the first to raise this here. I can't believe that's right.

Anyway....

I know I'm far from the first here to look at the current game manual pdf, I see others have mentioned the pilot's licence and similar. Surprisingly, it seems none have mentioned the watermark images on the pdf pages.

To me it looks like the background images on the pdf pages are an external projection of a cobra III, a cobra III's landing gear, an exploded diagram of engine componentry, the depiction of a terrestrial building entryway and on the cover an additional overlay of the external projection of a sidewinder.

Given it's context the depiction of a building (door included) strikes me as particularly odd. I'm left wondering if the arrangement of circles shaded to varying degrees, and/or circled reversed numbers across the bottom of the page (7, 1, 11, 18, 10), are of any significance.

(For that matter the pattern of circles on the cover could easily be viewed as an orrery.)

In case you can't find it on your launcher....

There is more, go to the end page and zoom, all around the page there is more information, speculative the 229 (2296?) then check the dats of the Cobra MKII in old Lore particular of missing prototypes in the same region as our first Raxxla date

Fitzroy Smith sounds like a very fitting Dark Wheel member and is mentioned along side this with owning a station with a location not realy advertised though he gives invitations
