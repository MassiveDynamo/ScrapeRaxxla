Do y'all remember the part about Halsey and Romero's vision specifically this:


“Our analysts have recovered a few fragments of these recordings, which appear to have been part of a dream journal. In them, Romero makes repeated mention of seeing ‘an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven,’ and being called by ‘voices that didn’t come from anything with a body’.”

“Medical experts have proposed that Romero’s recordings, along with his recent distracted behaviour, may be symptoms of an undiagnosed dissociative disorder. If true, Romero was likely acting upon dream delusions when he stole the ship. At present, our investigation has not yielded anything more substantial

I think I know where this is -- outside the Bubble but still closer than Coalsack. Interestingly from multiiple GalMap filters there is a glow and it doesn't happen with other systems (especially the same primary star class). Views used: star class (distant), star class (close), security, civilization, and realistic.

NOTE: VR screenshots are quirky. I could see everything but screenshot captures only part of the view. In each, you can notice a faint glow even from distance. You may need to view these in browser as previews may be harder to see details.

More will be posted when I get out there. I am making a few quick pit stops at Far God sites along the way in case those logs end up being useful.
