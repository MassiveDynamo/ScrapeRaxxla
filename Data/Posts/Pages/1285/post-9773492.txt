Well...seem like thargoids are going to attack bubble and will most likely take most of it. Because of that there is a content of Srius being injected in to Old Worlds systems. I think Old Worlds systems are going to be only part of bubble controlled by humans. Sirius being injected in to Old Worlds systems creates a big problem because someone who created that content didnt know that Old Worlds where created because of colonist being forced out of central colonies by Sirius and because of that Sirius is a enemy to Old Worlds.
Unfortunately since most old lore is redacted and they may have known however this may no longer be written in lore, However on that if it is still lore things change, times change and so do alliances, Sure I wont mention names however a few recent conflicting countries in the last 20 or so years in real life where once allies who are now enemy's and vice versa, things change I just hope if this is the case its done properly
