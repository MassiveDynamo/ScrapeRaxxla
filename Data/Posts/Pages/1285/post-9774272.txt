Question for consideration relating to how early ships travelled circa 2296?

Maybe one for @Allen Stroud

Up to that point we have a number of settled systems; namely Sol; Tau Ceti; Delta Pavonis; Altair; Beta Hydri; Eotienses and Achenar.

In regards to Achenar it is said the discovery was via ‘unexplored’ space.

Q: How did early ships traverse between these points?

Did they take arbitrary routes (as we might) utilising unexplored systems as waypoints and therefore expanding the sphere of influence to encapsulate all systems within this bubble, eg from Sol (the centre) out as far as Achenar?

Or did they adhere to routine routes, within direct line of sight of these systems. If so there is no sphere of influence, but a web of routes with a limited area of influence.

I don’t believe there has ever been confirmation as to the actual drive limit of early ships.

If that limit can be officially confirmed, we can draw lines between these locations with an economical sphere around them creating a web of interest.
