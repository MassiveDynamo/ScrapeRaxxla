It was leaked in 2016, I think on the old Alien artefact threads, archived some time ago
I wanted to ask you, how was that leaked? From my own failing memory I think I recalled it as 'part of the emerging story', evolving, regarding the the sinister Cabal and all that. I didn't recalling any leaks though, but again I probably need to go back and refresh my memory on that part.
