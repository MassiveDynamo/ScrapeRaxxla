anyone know how to use the fleet carrier search in Inara, anything i use it it displays none in a 50kly radius..I mean that's impossible as mines 11k away and Inara knows this lol
Please send me a link to your search conditions into PM here or Inara, I will take a look at that. I guess it was caused by the conditions set, but better to check...
