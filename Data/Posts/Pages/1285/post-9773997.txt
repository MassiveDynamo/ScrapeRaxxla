One of those Twitch stream links includes one with DB (not sure if already covered), where he’s asked ‘where’s Raxxla’ and DB simply says ‘you don’t want spoilers’.

Doesn’t add anything really. But maybe relevant to make note of it (last question at the end).

Yes, I’m trying to track down the source of “the Thargoids invade and take over human bubble” long term storyline plan leak, which he asked at the end around 29:30 into that DB interview. No answer, but it was originally reported on one of the old threads...

And I do want a spoiler!! Or at least a useful hint!!!
Winter is coming...

Edit: currently in Shinrarta checking out various things. The tourist beacons all now have a single spelling (“Pilots’ Federation”), no sign of a stealth station at any of the close/nested moons, PF Local Branch at both Jameson Memorial and Gallun’s Inheritance, no sign of other cliques. Did get a Trading Beacon pop up for a PF mission, ignored it, relogged and it popped up for another faction (not different PF clique)...running out of ideas. Where is the clue???
P.S. after reading the “Mr Brookes please confirm...” thread this morning it seemed the original Dark Wheel is not canon for ED, so this idea of elite rank as a requirement to find Raxxla may be invalid.
