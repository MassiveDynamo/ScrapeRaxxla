Well...seem like thargoids are going to attack bubble and will most likely take most of it. Because of that there is a content of Srius being injected in to Old Worlds systems. I think Old Worlds systems are going to be only part of bubble controlled by humans. Sirius being injected in to Old Worlds systems creates a big problem because someone who created that content didnt know that Old Worlds where created because of colonist being forced out of central colonies by Sirius and because of that Sirius is a enemy to Old Worlds.
