Wow! A search of this thread and it appears I'll be the first to raise this here. I can't believe that's right.

Anyway....

I know I'm far from the first here to look at the current game manual pdf, I see others have mentioned the pilot's licence and similar. Surprisingly, it seems none have mentioned the watermark images on the pdf pages.

To me it looks like the background images on the pdf pages are an external projection of a cobra III, a cobra III's landing gear, an exploded diagram of engine componentry, the depiction of a terrestrial building entryway and on the cover an additional overlay of the external projection of a sidewinder.

Given it's context the depiction of a building (door included) strikes me as particularly odd. I'm left wondering if the arrangement of circles shaded to varying degrees, and/or circled reversed numbers across the bottom of the page (7, 1, 11, 18, 10), are of any significance.

(For that matter the pattern of circles on the cover could easily be viewed as an orrery.)

In case you can't find it on your launcher....the link.
