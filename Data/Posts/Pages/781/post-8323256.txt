When does the lore tour depart? Would like to do another expedition, but wrapped up in the Quest at the moment.

2nd April - Its now on EDSM Expeditions! Just this second signed up myself. Theres 2 threads on here by Drew as well but I haven't looked at them for ages.

Dunno whats happening with the Tour that Paige started or if anyone has picked up that baton at all but I enjoyed the first one and theres plenty of room for more.
