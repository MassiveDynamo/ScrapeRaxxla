Signals from Sag A? - Are they just the 'sounds of space'? ie the 'noise' we pick up through electro-magnetic telescopes etc that they put into the game like for GG etc. Is it what Sag A sounds like or is it something else? Complete novice in this field.

Thargoid data - Been thinking. If that code does mean anything, knowing DB and Fdev it will either be a message saying 'Scan Incomplete' or something easter egg similar or possibly a drawing of the ship. It might well mean something but it would probably be a tongue-in cheek little reward for solving it. IF it means anything, it might be deliberately nonsense to show that the scan couldn't get anything.
