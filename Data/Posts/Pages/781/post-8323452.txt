Answers why Salome came back to life to map some planets which has been mentioned on this thread - was purely for retcon reasons for some systems that were lore significant to her, also answers why she was occasionally seen in Open as she was doing this. No other mystery involved, they just didn't have the software available before she died. Also sometimes just accidental logins when clicked on wrong Cmdr login.

Again answers about conversation with DB about Raxxla - says DB said they knew where it was and it was supposed to be in game (no mention of 'we know why players haven't found it' or similar but not necessarily full recount) so again confirms the basic info in OP. Also expands on his own thoughts that probably DB and very few other people know where it is.
