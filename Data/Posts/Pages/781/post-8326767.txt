The last couple of days I’ve found it has started to take a really long time to refresh the page on this thread. No other thread I monitor exhibits this problem.
Is it due to the number of pages? Do we need to close it & start a daughter thread?

Edit: mmm, this posted immediately, but when I try to refresh the page the update bar sticks halfway through. Perhaps an ISP or FD server issue???

less than 1 second refresh, not seen the problem using FF.
Lore-forum in general can be sluggish on evenings though, but the thread have not given any such symptoms for me.
