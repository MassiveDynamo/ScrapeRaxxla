"Spiraling Stars" reminded me of the Milky Way (it is a spiral galaxy, so technically the stars are spiraling). Looked into galactic regions to see if anything caught my eye but it didn't appear noteworthy.

There's a lot of cultural variety in the naming conventions. The Japanese Izanami and Mayan Xibalba were particularly fascinating stories to research.
