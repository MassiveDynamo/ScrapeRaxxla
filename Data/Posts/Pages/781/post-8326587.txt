The last couple of days Iâ€™ve found it has started to take a really long time to refresh the page on this thread. No other thread I monitor exhibits this problem.
Is it due to the number of pages? Do we need to close it & start a daughter thread?

Edit: mmm, this posted immediately, but when I try to refresh the page the update bar sticks halfway through. Perhaps an ISP or FD server issue???
