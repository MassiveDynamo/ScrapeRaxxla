less than 1 second refresh, not seen the problem using FF.
Lore-forum in general can be sluggish on evenings though, but the thread have not given any such symptoms for me.

I browse the threads with my iPad so was thinking it might be that, but the thread refresh has just sped up to around the usual 1 second, so suspect ISP hangup. Perhaps related to the YT vids as Alexzk says above.
