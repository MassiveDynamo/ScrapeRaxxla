The last couple of days Iâ€™ve found it has started to take a really long time to refresh the page on this thread. No other thread I monitor exhibits this problem.
Is it due to the number of pages? Do we need to close it & start a daughter thread?

Edit: mmm, this posted immediately, but when I try to refresh the page the update bar sticks halfway through. Perhaps an ISP or FD server issue???
There are many embedded videos above. They start "minibrowser" to create preview (and use traffic to utube) ...in short...s.h.1.t.y slow web tech which imagine itself local desktop .
Text pages here refresh ok/fast.
