FE2/FFE's autopilot worked from a gameplay experience point of view very much like supercruise assist + docking computer: you picked your target and it took you through space to it for a few minutes, then if it was a station you'd dock with it and if it was a planet you'd stop in the vicinity of it (usually moving slowly enough to avoid a collision). It even had some of the same quirks/bugs as supercruise, though not necessarily for the same reasons.

From a lore perspective they were very different, though: FE2/FFE were extremely sub-luminal using (implausibly efficient) reaction drives, and so time acceleration was used to make the perceived time be minutes rather than days or weeks.



The original Elite used microjumps in most versions, but a few of the later versions (ArcElite? ElitePlus? PC Elite? Can't remember exactly) had a continuous-travel drive instead which also had that supercruise sort of free-form movement feel to it (though without realistic scale, it interacted a bit differently with non-empty space and didn't require either time acceleration or superluminal speed)
