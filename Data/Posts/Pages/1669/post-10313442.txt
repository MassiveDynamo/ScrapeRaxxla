Okay, different angle but maybe worthy of consideration since the story starts in Lave. Lave has the only known named asteroid belt - the Castellan Belt. Additionally, there is Warinus asteroid base. Warinus appears to be named for St. Warinus who is connected to the Franks. Are there lessons we should be taking from Warinus and Castellan that we can use to maybe push things forward. Somehow Lave isn't just what serves to unify the whole thing but must also be important to Dark Wheel and Raxxla. We're obviously missing something.
