I think the Venusian story is relatively resent. Probably after the game launch of ED.
The FDS is the first drive that features supercruise. In the 3200s we used the Star Dreamer to change time perception and ships with extremely high acceleration.

The bubble ship story line is a bit dubious, as I don't think it ever appears in the game Journals. It's just in the game code.
There are a few bits like that, that point to plans for a multiplayer sequel. For example the lecture ”‘The Limitations of Light’: Relativity Re-examined”.

I still think the toast might be a few hundred years old. Much older that anything going on in the 3260s.
I think that's a reasonably accurate assessment. Like I said, given we don't have firm dates it hard to tell if there is a conflict or not. I have to check but I think there was potentially something like supercruise assist in prior games but may be misremembering from reading the manuals. I do agree that Venusian was in all likelihood more recent.
