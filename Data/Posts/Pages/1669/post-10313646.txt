I think that's a reasonably accurate assessment. Like I said, given we don't have firm dates it hard to tell if there is a conflict or not. I have to check but I think there was potentially something like supercruise assist in prior games but may be misremembering from reading the manuals. I do agree that Venusian was in all likelihood more recent.
There were micro-jumps in the original game. Sort of instant in-system hyperspace jumps you could do, if no other ships were around.
FD originally intended to implement micro-jumps in ED as well, but the backers came up with the idea of supercruise. It was determined as a better solution for sightseeing.
