[The Dark Wheel minor faction presence]
With the exception of Shinrarta Dezhra that's all been through normal BGS movement caused by players, though.
(And with the possible exception of LFT 926, intentionally caused by players)

So far mostly what that's shown is that the faction does not appear to have any special rules or behaviour not expected for any other BGS minor faction of its known types.
