Okay, different angle but maybe worthy of consideration since the story starts in Lave. Lave has the only known named asteroid belt - the Castellan Belt. Additionally, there is Warinus asteroid base. Warinus appears to be named for St. Warinus who is connected to the Franks. Are there lessons we should be taking from Warinus and Castellan that we can use to maybe push things forward. Somehow Lave isn't just what serves to unify the whole thing but must also be important to Dark Wheel and Raxxla. We're obviously missing something.

Good point. I'm also interested in what clue(s) might be left in Leesti, Tionisla, Isinor and/or whatever unnamed system is 19 ly's from Isinor. With respect to Tionisla, Alex had made a 0.1 Ly jump to get to Rafe Zetter's system where his home (a retrofitted Conda) and some other abandoned ships were . But, there is no system 0.1 LY from Tionisla. While I acknowledge that The Dark Wheel Novella does not always or fully align with the system placements of ED, I often wonder if what took a hyper jump for Alex is now just a short SC (within the Tionisla system) for us today. 0.1 Ly is just 3,153,760 Ls in SC. Of course, a 3,153,760 Ls potential spherical target point from the Toiniisla sun is a lot of space to search, I wonder if Rafe Zetter would have set his hide-away a place that you get to by setting your directions to a galactic object. Iv'e tried targeting a prominent red nebulae and a couple other potential directions but have found nothing. Just a thought.
