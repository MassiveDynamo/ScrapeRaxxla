Actually, not true see generation ship Venusian which mentioned a ship initiating supercruise and vanishing. Additionally, the FFE journals have supercruise developed explicitly to hunt asteroid sized objects moving at relativistic velocity.





I suspect Venusian was intercepted some point in 3200s. There's another journal about a pirate lord hijacking a generation ship (or Bubble as the Imperials liked to call them).

It is actually entirely possible that still jives with the official FSD launch in 3297. There sadly aren't dates in the Venusian logs. That said, it is also within the realm of possibilities this goes .

I think the Venusian story is relatively resent. Probably after the game launch of ED.
The FDS is the first drive that features supercruise. In the 3200s we used the Star Dreamer to change time perception and ships with extremely high acceleration.

The bubble ship story line is a bit dubious, as I don't think it ever appears in the game Journals. It's just in the game code.
There are a few bits like that, that point to plans for a multiplayer sequel. For example the lecture ”‘The Limitations of Light’: Relativity Re-examined”.

I still think the toast might be a few hundred years old. Much older that anything going on in the 3260s.
