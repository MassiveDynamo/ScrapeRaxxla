There were micro-jumps in the original game. Sort of instant in-system hyperspace jumps you could do, if no other ships were around.
FD originally intended to implement micro-jumps in ED as well, but the backers came up with the idea of supercruise. It was determined as a better solution for sightseeing.

This makes me think it's quite plausible that Rafe Zetter's Conda home base still exists in what would now be a SC distance within the Tioisla systems. Could his now abandon place have clues left behind I wonder...
