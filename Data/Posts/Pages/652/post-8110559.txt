Space bedonkadonk?!

BTW, has that been implemented yet. I'm not aware of anything that constitutes this. Is it one of the missing features? Gives me an idea. Raxxla is sitting somehwere and all the missing features taht we really wanted are all parked or otherwise existing on it. They were not release because of a lack of story involvement to unlock them! If we find raxxla we get to control time and rewrite the game to have stuff.
