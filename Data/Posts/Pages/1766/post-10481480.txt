Yes! thanks for this - I vaguely remembered this but was not finding it. Your oracle is much less obtuse than mine !
Probably too much fumes from the Omphalos!
That bit about the gravitational anomalies is interesting. IIRC when I visited one of those sites I thought it was likely related to Thargoids. A gravitational anomaly ought to be fairly localised, so if we have several sites exhibiting them then I'm dubious about any hint to Raxxla's location, unless extremely close together, however it might be a hint to Raxxla's nature. E.g. black hole or Neutron Star, or perhaps even an Exotic Star which is allowed by the Star Types definition but we haven't found any examples...but then we havent found any examples of Rogue Planets either...
