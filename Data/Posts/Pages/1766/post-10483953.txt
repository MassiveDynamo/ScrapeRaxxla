Have you contacted Frontier Development to see if you've found Raxxla?

Think they will need your ship logs to confirm from the last time someone asked about it and the screen shot with the PLANET (weird italicised T in the correspondence)...

You may have found it or they may confirm it's something else?
Mm, bit disappointing if FD have to confirm the Discovery of Raxxla to its finder!!
