Mm, bit disappointing if FD have to confirm the Discovery of Raxxla!!
Well if you don't know what you are looking for and it doesn't have a big sign saying "RAXXLA" you may well have to ask? ;-)

If it's alien bird images from near the centre of the galaxy then how would you ever know?

Anything is possibly Raxxla from the Codex.... rule it out and move on (for any weird stuff that you can rationalise to be it)... and the only ones who can rule it out are DB, MB (RIP) and Frontier Dev....?
