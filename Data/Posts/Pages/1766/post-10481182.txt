Please share?

As much as I hate AI and doubtful of any benefit, other than destroying our society, as a toy it has place as a random abstract generator, therefore any stab-in-the-dark is worth considering, being that we are generally pretty much out in the cold; one never knows if it picks up some odd reference!
AI isn't generally very helplfull. I actually just wanted help getting an overview of what FD have said about it.

I asked: What has Frontier development said publicly about Raxxla?

Copilot replied:
***********************
Frontier Developments has been quite cryptic about Raxxla, maintaining the mystery that surrounds it. Here’s a summary of what they’ve shared publicly:
Existence: Frontier has confirmed that Raxxla exists in the game, but they have not provided any specific details about its location or how to find it123.
Clues: They have provided some lore and clues that players can use to search for Raxxla. For example, there’s a reference to a point of interest in the system Col 285 Sector BG-O d6-93 on planet 1D, which talks about a gravitational pull of some massive object1.
Search Mechanism: It’s been hinted that Raxxla cannot be found using traditional scanning methods like the Discovery Scanner or the Full Spectrum System (FSS) scanner. Instead, players might need to use gravitational anomalies to locate it1.
Community Engagement: The developers have expressed their enjoyment in watching the community come together to solve the mystery of Raxxla2.
Speculation: There’s been a lot of speculation within the community, and Frontier seems to encourage this, as it keeps the legend of Raxxla alive and engages players in exploration23.
Frontier’s approach has been to keep the mystery alive, which has led to a vibrant community of players dedicated to finding Raxxla. It’s clear that they want the discovery to be a significant and memorable moment for the community. Are you an Elite Dangerous player yourself, or just curious about the game’s lore?

Not much, but I found it interesting that it highlighted a clue about an invisible gravitational object.

I asked ChatGPT the same question, but it was no fun at all. Very vague and general.
