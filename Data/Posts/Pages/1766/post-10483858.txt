We dont know whether or not some of these objects (X, RoguePlanet) exist in-game, just that the Star Description specification allows for them (and it could be pure FD obfuscation!).
All things Frontier Developments at E3 2014!
Think it might be "Paradiso Outpost", then an illegible (to me) line and "Independent Jurisdiction" on the line below. Your guess is as good as mine re the build no. It is indeed Paradiso Outpost - it's a deep space exploration support station. Michael

This one has always bugged me.... and not in a Thargoid way...

and this....

The mind-bending science behind the planets of Elite Dangerous
Frontier reveals its secrets.
www.pcgamer.com

"Planets begin life as a disc orbiting with a a newly formed star at its centre. “The disc has material density and temperature information which reflects how lighter materials tend to get pushed further away from the star by the radiation pressure,” says Ross. “This has an iterative process applied to it as epochs of time are simulated, based on the rough known age of the system.”

Stable orbits are then determined for objects formed from the materials in the disc clumping together. Passing comets and rogue planets are also thrown into the mix, to disrupt the orbits and create fledgling planets and moons."
