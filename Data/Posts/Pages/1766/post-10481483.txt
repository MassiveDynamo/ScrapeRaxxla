AI isn't generally very helplfull. I actually just wanted help getting an overview of what FD have said about it.

I asked: What has Frontier development said publicly about Raxxla?

Copilot replied:
***********************
Frontier Developments has been quite cryptic about Raxxla, maintaining the mystery that surrounds it. Here’s a summary of what they’ve shared publicly:
.
Frontier’s approach has been to keep the mystery alive, which has led to a vibrant community of players dedicated to finding Raxxla. It’s clear that they want the discovery to be a significant and memorable moment for the community. Are you an Elite Dangerous player yourself, or just curious about the game’s lore?

Not much, but I found it interesting that it highlighted a clue about an invisible gravitational object.

I asked ChatGPT the same question, but it was no fun at all. Very vague and general.

Yes well this highlights the issue with AI, you have to remind yourself it ‘dose not actually think’ it regurgitates from a limited window of information.

The internet is not the repository of all knowledge.

FD hasn’t actually posted any intelligence about Raxxla, only certain conformational statements, whose reliability is eroded over time; and some very abstract imagery with a very wide and (IMPO) some very vague contextualisation.

AI is terrible at contextualising.

AI is not performing critical thinking, it cannot identify reality from fiction, the internet is literally filled with utter rubbish.

So in many of these situations it probably is just regurgitating our own ideas back at us, like an eco chamber filled with four chimpanzees and a 1986 primary school copy of Ladybirds ‘how toasters work’.

Granted, such situations might sometimes bring forth various abstractions which through study might provide insight into other unrelated areas never considered, but it also adds to the existing heap of rubbish….

Many years ago there was a prevailing existential threat of AI and nanobots as a gray-creep, that would devour humanity through self replication; personally I think AI has already enabled this, and it ought to be called the gray-info-creep. Where all knowledge and art is replaced by total twaddle, and humanity can’t tell the difference because they were actually the culprits who enabled it…

…. Sorry wrong meeting…
