Few questions:
Based on these assumptions, and within current and v1.0 mechanics, since the Star you lock onto with your Framedrive is the Mass of the star, then:

"The key to Raxxla is in a system that has to be jumpable from our Galmap"
- I think so from what I understand of the gameplay

"The thing we find in that system, when the light of the star becomes the key, would reveal where to select on our Galaxy map? OR would the thing we find act like a wake jump, allowing us to jump to a system that doesn't exist in the Galmap system (there is specific lore around what systems appear there, when they collated the data) ?"

- good questions, but I think only FD could answer them, and they take great care not to do so! So my advice is work out an hypothesis about Raxxla, then test it by playing the game appropriately; happy questing!
