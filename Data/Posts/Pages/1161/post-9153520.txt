I would have agreed until yesterday, when I googled it and found several sites saying it was a valid way of saying 30! Today many are saying it isnâ€™t ( google!!) but these do, and I like the second explanation
How do you write 30-50 in Roman numerals?
Answer: XXX-L and also XXL-L note that XXL means 50 minus 20. I am guessing that you would like to know the sequence of numbers from 30 through to 50 in Roman numerals? Fair enough, here it is... XXX (30) XXXI (31) XXXII (32) XXXIII (33) XXXIV (34) XXXV (35) XXXVI (36) XXXVII (37) XXXVII...

P.S. Raxxla is a word, not a door!

If XXL can be 30 then XXLA can be 35. A was a valid alternative for V, in middle age and renaissance roman numerals.

Also R is 80.

Lots of funny combinations to be made with coordinates:

85,20,55 - RA,XX,LA
85,30,5 - RA,XXL,A
8,5,35 - R,A,XXLA
85,10,45 RA,X,XLA

Take your pick. Don't forget the negative coordinate versions.
