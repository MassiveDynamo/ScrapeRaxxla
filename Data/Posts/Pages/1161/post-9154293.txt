Just checked the trusty OED - it concurs.... R in medieval latin notation is apparently 80... so are we looking for some medieval hermetic/kabbalistic text dealing with Abulafia permutations of the secret word that is both a key and a gate?
Very interesting and enlightning. I always checked the standard forms and rare variants, but those middle age forums are quite interesting.
