XXX would be more normal yes but in Roman Numerals its counted down in value from the left with any 'wrong' placed numerals discounted from the total like IV = 4 (-1 + 5) so technically its -20 + 50 = 30. Maybe triple XXX is something Frontier dont want in their games, even EDO is only 16+
Itâ€™s not like FD could change the name of Raxxla, to fit a specific number.
They had to work with what they had.
