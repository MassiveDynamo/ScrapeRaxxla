Come on, it's got to be at least as exciting as finding Soontill!
Isn't it just amazing?

And the Tionisla Graveyard,,, spectacularly awesome!

I find in this game that there is nothing that can't be achieved by continually lowering expectations.

I'm certain Raxxla will exceed all those beyond any expectation or recognition.

Brooks said it's been there from the beginning, imagine with all the updates how its been improved with each and every one.

I'm now legally required to inform you of my conviction of 4th degree Sardony.

[I know its not a word but it should be]

Maybe Raxxla is a sidewinder floating in space somewhere? [noob]
