Be careful, you’re likely to be eaten by a Grue.

Edit - Sorry, it’s bad I know, but I just couldn’t pass up an opportunity like that!

It's MacrosTB I feel sorry for.
He used to have this quiet little backwater thread where people wandered in occasionally and threw a little tinfoil around, then disappeared into the black again. The only thing he had to worry about was those pesky Raxxla kids peeping in through the windows while he was out, looking to see if there was anything worth nicking.

Then the Rift thread got closed.

At first it wasn't too bad. There were only a couple of Rifters who knew about this place, and they didn't make too much noise. But they told their friends. And they told their friends, and suddenly the place is full of cranky old Rifters cracking bad jokes and make the place smell funny.

Next thing you know, the Mods will be paying attention and the thread will get unceremoniously locked and we'll all be back out on the streets again.

[Edit]
Actually, we're probably okay until DrewW pops up, mutters something obscure and disappears again.
