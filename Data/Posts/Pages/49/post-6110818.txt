And if you're sticking to in-universe:

It makes sense Raxxla would be permit locked. Pilot's Federation controls the Permit Locks (they are a function of Hyperdrive nav software), and Dark Wheel are part of the PF - so if the DW are protecting Raxxla, then it follows they'd request it be locked so random explorers won't keep coming across it

That doesn't mean we can't figure out which permit lock it's likely to be under, maybe that's part of the puzzle to unlocking it. No-one knows what unlocks them yet!
Agreed on the Meta. Have said pretty much the same before, myself.

Also more or less agreed about the in-game rationale. Someone is controlling those permit locks.

Not TDW though. As far as we know they never found Raxxla. Which stacks up given the that the people on Raxxla had Jason Ryder, who was head of TDW, assassinated, and he'd only found evidence that Raxxla existed, not even Raxxla itself.

Anyone stumbling across Raxxla is almost certainly going to be insta-killed.

And meta around that:
