HD references usually work - I've visited around 100 Carina systems using a list of HD numbers from Wiki.
The 'invisible' HD 93359 system is in the right general area - it's in the Carina constellation at the correct approximate distance from Sol.

It's like they put the object at the right location but forgot to define what it is.

Might be an idea to simply bug report it.
