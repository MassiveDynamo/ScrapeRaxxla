Agreed on the Meta. Have said pretty much the same before, myself.

Also more or less agreed about the in-game rationale. Someone is controlling those permit locks.

Not TDW though. As far as we know they never found Raxxla. Which stacks up given the that the people on Raxxla had Jason Ryder, who was head of TDW, assassinated, and he'd only found evidence that Raxxla existed, not even Raxxla itself.

Anyone stumbling across Raxxla is almost certainly going to be insta-killed.

I find in this game that there is nothing that can't be achieved by continually lowering expectations.

I'm certain Raxxla will exceed all those beyond any expectation or recognition.

I'm now legally required to inform you of my conviction of 4th degree Sardony.
