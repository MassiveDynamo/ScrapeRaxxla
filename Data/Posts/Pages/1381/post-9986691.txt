The one word I detest being associated with lore in a game is 'fluff'.

Whenever anyone describes writing as 'fluff' it indicates that the writing is non-essential - a veneer, window dressing, etc. I totally get that description. But, as a writer, I never want to write 'fluff'. I want to write content that has meaning.

In Elite Dangerous, I think (I don't know) there have been several content creators and potentially a lack of co-ordination of that writing, which is why you get narratives that don't go anywhere and get discarded.

I think I mentioned in my Ph. D. that macrotexts need curators to stay on top of things. If there isn't someone updating the material whenever anything is put out, or if the hand over between curators is imperfect, you get these kind of problems and things that were originally strong narratives, become wayward and 'fluff'.
