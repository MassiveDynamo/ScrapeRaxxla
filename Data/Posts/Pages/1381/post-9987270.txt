I don’t mind a bit of fluff, but (correct me if I’m wrong because I honestly don’t read Galnet anymore), but initially FD had in place a very simple mechanism to identify fluff; if it had a Cmdr name attributed to it, it was fluff, we knew that and could do what we pleased, everything else was written by FD.

Logically I’d promote FD continue that method of identification, but expand it to include FD fluff where they use a Cmd name or a consistent NPC news reporter. Anything else is legitimate narrative driven stories / news?

I don’t mind fluff, but if FD are utilising Galnet to point us to places in game they need a method to distinguish between in game content and fictional events which add flavour.

If FD aren’t going to utilise Galnet for direct content / POI then stipulate this and move on.
