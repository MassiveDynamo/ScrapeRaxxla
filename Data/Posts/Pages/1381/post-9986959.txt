Personally, my desire was never to pick it apart. We actually were supposed to do that. The problem: most people dare not look in a mirror and analyze themselves much less a story. Also, most people are terrified at going against the crowd. My goal was to honor the old stories and show people how damn lucky we are to have a game like Elite Dangerous (and the rest of the series). This is one of those game series that deserves to be remembered forever for it's impact. You have no idea what it is like be like when you are one of the lone voices speaking out for how important small details were in the larger story. It was a very lonely journey, but I couldn't be happier for having gone on it (even if it was at times exceedingly lonely). I am very much looking towards the future but will continue digging into the past of humans and our fellow intelligent alien species in the game.
you have no idea the things i have ideas about.
