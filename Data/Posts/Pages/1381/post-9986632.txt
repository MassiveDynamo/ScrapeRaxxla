lol lore is one of the biggest problems in this game.
there are many sources to draw from, but only one path to inclusion.... and fdev isnt that forward about what will make the cut.
but... if we follow the in game narrative, thargoid tech was reverse engineered and we got our hyperdrives from that...
so, logically speaking... this creates two distinct possibilities.
either sirius (who host the tourist beacons that tell the story) are feeding us incorrect information for some purpose or another to be revealed at a later date...
or fdev has just decided on one story line over another.... and thats fair. not all the lore written about and around the elite world lines up, so it stands to reason that some of it must be trimmed... some of it trims itself by being so outside or contradictory to the lore that there would be no way to include it.
but without a clear list of what is considered cannon and what is not, we cannot know what story lines are worth pursuing and which are not.... and that list can only come from fdev, since they are the only people who can say with certainty what is included and what is not.
so until i see a list, i will ignore all "lore" that was written after game release, and all "lore" that is not proven to be adopted in the game.
raxxla is one such inclusion. its been verified to be there.
aside from that the line "there will be no clues" leads me to believe that picking apart the "lore" is pointless as well. its something that a commander will accidentally stumble upon one day.
