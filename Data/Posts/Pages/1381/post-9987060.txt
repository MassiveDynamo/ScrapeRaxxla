I love the so called fluff stories and think there should be more of them. I see absolutely no reason to not publish stories that are unconnected to gameplay or in game assets.
This type of stories can be used to make the galaxy feel alive or as pure entertainment. They can also be used to hint towards future development or to mysteries in the galaxy.

We just have to remember that most hints in this game, aren't about Raxxla.
