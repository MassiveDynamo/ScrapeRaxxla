I don’t mind a bit of fluff, but (correct me if I’m wrong because I honestly don’t read Galnet anymore), but initially FD had in place a very simple mechanism to identify fluff; if it had a Cmdr name attributed to it, it was fluff, we knew that and could do what we pleased, everything else was written by FD.
Galnet since its return in 2020 has had a consistently-used mechanism for articles:
- articles headed "Pilot's Federation Alert" refer to something immediately actionable in game (a CG, a new POI to find, a new module being available, etc.)
- articles without that heading might still be important for knowing what's going on but you don't need to hunt around every system mentioned in them just in case
Any particular story arc will usually have a mix of both types of article.

The actionable/unactionable distinction isn't quite the same as important/unimportant, of course, and I'd rather that they didn't feel that they had to highlight it even subtly like this, but overall I think the post-2020 stories have been stronger than most of Galnet's previous eras of storytelling.
