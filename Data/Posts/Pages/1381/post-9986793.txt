The one word I detest being associated with lore in a game is 'fluff'.

Whenever anyone describes writing as 'fluff' it indicates that the writing is non-essential - a veneer, window dressing, etc. I totally get that description. But, as a writer, I never want to write 'fluff'. I want to write content that has meaning.

In Elite Dangerous, I think (I don't know) there have been several content creators and potentially a lack of co-ordination of that writing, which is why you get narratives that don't go anywhere and get discarded.

I think I mentioned in my Ph. D. that macrotexts need curators to stay on top of things. If there isn't someone updating the material whenever anything is put out, or if the hand over between curators is imperfect, you get these kind of problems and things that were originally strong narratives, become wayward and 'fluff'.

As a backer I found the Galnet elements initially wonderful, because many pointed towards points of interest, as was the initial design, but ultimately the boundaries between what was real news and what wasn’t, got too difficult to distinguish, so I stopped reading.

Curators switching chairs and Cmdrs submitting content didn’t help matters, it needed consistency as @Allen Stroud points out. That’s were the fluff comes from, fluff can be comforting, it can fill a nice pillow, but that type of comfort is only temporary, you need a cohesive material to tell a story, like maybe a nice warm towel.
