I love the so called fluff stories and think there should be more of them. I see absolutely no reason to not publish stories that are unconnected to gameplay or in game assets.
This type of stories can be used to make the galaxy feel alive or as pure entertainment. They can also be used to hint towards future development or to mysteries in the galaxy.

We just have to remember that most hints in this game, aren't about Raxxla.
I can absolutely agree with that. But then I'd argue the content has a purpose if it's doing that, so it's not fluff.

I can, off course, be totally wrong. I get that my definition comes from the specific perspective of watching content I made being dismissed as irrelevant (not here) when I worked really hard to give it purpose and meaning, so the description of something being 'fluff' is to me, a label that defines failure of purpose.

I like works that make use of ergodic techniques. Games led themselves to that because they encourage active rather than passive participation, so people experiencing a game text expect to be able to interact with it. Writing can always be used to develop new ways to convey clues and things.
