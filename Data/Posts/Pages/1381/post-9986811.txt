As a backer I found the Galnet elements initially wonderful, because many pointed towards points of interest, as was the initial design, but ultimately the boundaries between what was real news and what wasn’t, got too difficult to distinguish, so I stopped reading.

Curators switching chairs and Cmdrs submitting content didn’t help matters, it needed consistency as @Allen Stroud points out. That’s were the fluff comes from, fluff can be comforting, it can fill a nice pillow, but that type of comfort is only temporary, you need a cohesive narrative to tell a story.

The player lore is part of the story and a massive part of it. It was honestly a mistake on the part of the community to treat it as seperate and uninteresting "fluff" or easter eggs. The player lore was precisely what unified everything. If FDev included it into the game it was part of the larger story. The first interactions with Thargoids is told via a bit of player lore that became the system description for LHS 6309 on the system map. It may or may not be on the Galaxy Map, too. This is why we have all those beacons in Teorge which are connected to tons of Salomé storyline. Additionally, Canonn Science had a large part in establishing the early lore when the Unknown Alien Artifacts (UAAs) were first discovered. These were later renamed as Thargoid Sensors.

Part of the problem, is that CMDRs forgot we were tasked with shaping the galaxy. Part of that was merely by telling our stories of our actions to understand what was happening.
