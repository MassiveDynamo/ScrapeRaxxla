I think this is partly a problem with claiming that the game is a simulation...a simulation represents reality. True, the game does in a way, but my current hypothesis has me looking for a certain type of system....I keep finding wikipedia and Simbad references to IRL systems but can’t find them in-game. So when FD imported extant star catalogues into Stellar Forge some “mistakes” were made in that import-omitting some important catalogues and not doing quality control checks on the data so there are conflicts, duplicates, systems clearly in the “wrong” position wrt reality... And more visibly the management seems to have had several hiccups over the years with strategic direction and storyline development, Gan Romero is just one example. We have to accept ED is a large complex game and in the nature of these things contains errors. But it’s a game, very loosely based on previous games, a way of spending time pleasurably, so just report errors to FD and get on with things.

To paraphrase a WW2 saying: “Fly your ship and carry on”!

And to anyone who complains about ED unreality and errors....go play Star Citizen

To Jorki's point: Yes, we are likely looking for a very specific system layout approximately like a simplified Sol in 2023 but not quite. I would pay attention to FDev cockpit customization planets from Sol which notably has Mars look like the 2023 version not the one in-game but without a ninth planet because Pluto got demoted already when Elite Dangerous was made. Look also at the designation on engine wash barriers as you land. I suspect those are not random but actually a hint. The pit when you lower your ship also has stuff in it if you use camera suite that may indicate details about each body. Wisdom comes from the dark just like stars are born from a collapsing nebula.
