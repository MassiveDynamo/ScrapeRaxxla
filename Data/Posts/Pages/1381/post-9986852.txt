The one word I detest being associated with lore in a game is 'fluff'.
Forgive me if you felt attacked by my comment. What I meant was that all of the "off camera" stories in Galnet were mixed into the ones with which we, as players, could interact. It became very disheartening to find out that those of us who were interacting with the "off camera" narratives found out that there was nothing with which to interact, despite those stories being interspersed with stories with which there was content with which we could interact. It felt like a betrayal of some sort and as such, I guess I used a pejorative word to describe them. For whatever it's worth, I've very much enjoyed your posts in this thread. Thank you for your time.
