yeah welcome to gaming 101... only a handful of people follow the narrative, as demonstrated by this forum in general.
Apologies, you might be mistaking my comment for a lack of awareness? I know the audience and sometimes the gig requires 'fluff', doesn't stop me wanting things to be different. My experience of working on games and discussing them has long since made the matter clear.

That said, when I worked on Phoenix Point, the regular 'dissections' of the lore released on Youtube by Retcon Raider were excellent and attracted a good audience. Do look them up if that interests you.

Forgive me if you felt attacked by my comment. What I meant was that all of the "off camera" stories in Galnet were mixed into the ones with which we, as players, could interact. It became very disheartening to find out that those of us who were interacting with the "off camera" narratives found out that there was nothing with which to interact, despite those stories being interspersed with stories with which there was content with which we could interact. It felt like a betrayal of some sort and as such, I guess I used a pejorative word to describe them. For whatever it's worth, I've very much enjoyed your posts in this thread. Thank you for your time.
Oh no! I totally didn't feel attacked and I totally get your point, and the point Thatchinho made really well. Mine was more about narrative purpose. Much as players and audiences can choose to ignore that part of the work, I don't really enjoy working on anything where the writing and story isn't important.
