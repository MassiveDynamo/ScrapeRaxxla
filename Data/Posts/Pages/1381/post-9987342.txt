I don’t mind a bit of fluff, but (correct me if I’m wrong because I honestly don’t read Galnet anymore), but initially FD had in place a very simple mechanism to identify fluff; if it had a Cmdr name attributed to it, it was fluff, we knew that and could do what we pleased, everything else was written by FD.

Logically I’d promote FD continue that method of identification, but expand it to include FD fluff where they use a Cmd name or a consistent NPC news reporter. Anything else is legitimate narrative driven stories / news?

I don’t mind fluff, but if FD are utilising Galnet to point us to places in game they need a method to distinguish between in game content and fictional events which add flavour.

If FD aren’t going to utilise Galnet for direct content / POI then stipulate this and move on.

Kindly look up TrA X-1 on GalMap (this is but one single example and there are multiple of these). Filter however you please. There is a glow. Coincidence especially given what is (not) in that system - likely not.

From the recovered logs of Gan Romero..

From the Gan Romero logs that were recovered:
“Our analysts have recovered a few fragments of these recordings, which appear to have been part of a dream journal. In them, Romero makes repeated mention of seeing ‘an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven,’ and being called by ‘voices that didn’t come from anything with a body’.”

There is no such thing as "fluff". There is only lore officially accepted enough to be included in the game either by Frontier Developments themselves or others.
