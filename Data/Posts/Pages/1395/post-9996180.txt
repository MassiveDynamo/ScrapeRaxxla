I thought about this connection to, especially as one of the greatest minds of all time related to space, Professor Stephen Hawking, spent most of his life in Cambridge even though he was born in Oxford.
Ive been reading through my Hawking collection for clues!
Small connections i know but hey straws and all that.

You’ll read some fascinating stuff, but I siriusly (pun intended!) doubt that Stephen Hawking had any interest in the game, or involvement in its development, so you won’t get any clues! His in-game tribute is the Hawking Gap, where one of the Dynasty Plot bases is located.
