Updated my Yggdrasil ramblings again:

Thread 'The Yggdrasil / John Milton conundrum'

An additional assumption, takes into account the key findings but also in addition the omission made by FD of any real clarification to identify a maximum range capability of early FTL travel during the early stages of exploration.

In so much that this can be interpreted as identifying Tau Ceti and the 2296 date in the codex as a mechanic to draw a spatial temporal map, or area / sphere of influence from Tau Ceti (centre) to Achenar (furthest discovered) and this when overlaid with another area of influence set by Sol to Achenar or relatively Pandemonium, identifies an overlapping area within the upper celestial hemisphere.

This it is assumed, relates to the ‘outer rim’ of a presumed John Milton spherical area, where in Paradise Lost, Lucifer walked upon the crystalline sphere and where he saw the gates of heaven.

This being an abstract metaphor written by Michael Brookes, for the general location of either Raxxla, something else or an archived narrative.

Upon the outer rim.

It’s all still very possibly, I accept, total projection and Space Madness.
