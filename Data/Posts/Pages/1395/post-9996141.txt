okay hold up, I had another wild thought. Hear me out here, what if... Raxxla... isn't Raxxla...

What if Raxxla, is a corruption of another word, or name, that ... hence just stuck?

so let's take the word 'Cookie', it comes from the Middle Dutch word 'coeke' or Cake, which is basically what a cookie is, a little cake. The British call them biscuits (which are not to be confused with scones, the fluffy pastry you eat for breakfast with gravy)

It could also work the other way as well... what if Raxxla, has itself, been corrupted into another word?
