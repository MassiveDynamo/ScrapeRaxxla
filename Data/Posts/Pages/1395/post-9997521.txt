Regarding the colour green, in Ancient Greece, green was associated with Demeter, the goddess of the harvest!

In the codex ‘Cora’ could be an allusion to Kore / Persephone, the daughter of Demeter, who on her travels sort of ‘got drunk and talked about pirates’.

Demeter was a wanderer (vagabond) of the earth who took on in the likeness an old woman named ‘Dos’ or ‘Doso’ [doh'soh]; at the city of Eleusis (at a well) she met the daughters of the king ‘Celeus’. They offered her a nice glass of wine but instead Doso preferred a nice pint of warm beer laced with drugs.

Demeter is assigned the zodiac constellation Virgo, the Virgin, by Marcus Manilius in his 1st-century Roman work Astronomicon. In art, the constellation Virgo holds Spica, a sheaf of wheat in her hand and sits beside constellation Leo the Lion. In Arcadia, she was known as "Black Demeter".

But that’s rabbit-hole thinking for you, anything can be attributed meaning if you dig deep enough.

From a design perspective green is a safe colour that generally represents…well nature, its popular because it’s well balanced, stable and harmonious with other colours. It’s just very functional.
