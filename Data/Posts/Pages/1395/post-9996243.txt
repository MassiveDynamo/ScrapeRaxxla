Mmm, seems you’re already on that road.... “Mimas Conspiracy”??? To prove a conspiracy you have to prove that its omission was deliberate based on ulterior motivation, as a way of obfuscating something. IMHO starting wild rumours is not helpful in the Quest. Many RL things are omitted from the game, doesn’t imply any conspiracy. Where is Ceres? Why is LAWD 26 a Wolf Rayet? Why cant we land on the moon? You’ve triggered my sceptical streak...not a good feeling over breakfast.

... Jorki... Prove to me that Gravity Waves play any part in Elite Dangerous please. Show me one single example of Gravity Waves existing in-game, please. Show me one single example of a reference to Gravity Wave detection in any part of in-game narrative please?

... Why, Jorki... are you starting wild rumours?! Jorki! That's not helpful in the Quest. Many RL things are omitted from the game.

Don't be so patronising.
