... Jorki... Prove to me that Gravity Waves play any part in Elite Dangerous please. Show me one single example of Gravity Waves existing in-game, please. Show me one single example of a reference to Gravity Wave detection in any part of in-game narrative please?

... Why, Jorki... are you starting wild rumours?! Jorki! That's not helpful in the Quest. Many RL things are omitted from the game.

Don't be so patronising.

in the astronomical sense, a Siren is a pulse of radio waves typically from a neutron star or black hole. A dark siren is formed from the collision of two neutron stars or two black holes.
