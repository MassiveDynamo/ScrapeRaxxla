Mmm, seems you’re already on that road.... “Mimas Conspiracy”??? To prove a conspiracy you have to prove that its omission was deliberate based on ulterior motivation, as a way of obfuscating something
Im not sure anyone is pulling the conspiracy card, its just another avenue of thought, the more thoughts the better.
It may have been deliberately omitted for future use or a genuine mistake, for now all they have said is that its not unreasonable to believe that in the future new moons will be made available to land on around Saturn.
Currently of the 6 only Titan is unavailable to land on so im calling new "moons" as something to consider.
