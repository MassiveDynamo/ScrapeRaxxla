Personal current favourite is the Delphi system idea, as it ties with the Tau Ceti reference (maybe the date is a red herring) and the logo makes sense - central dot and circle = omphalos, three prongs a tripod (oracle)â€¦ but still what does a hexagon relate to / describe?

Apart from Saturn none can provide an adequate explanation of the meaning behind the use of a hexagon. What could it relate to?
I remember (I dearly wish I could find it) ages ago - back in the days of the first Thargoid probe discoveries and the early trail leading to Pleiades - a tweet(?) from Fdev that basically said something like "we put stuff in-game, and if no-one finds it we drop another hint".

I guess I'm saying that I think Delphi, Saturn, Sol, Tau Ceti, green glow, exploration into the void, and a lot more ideas are all actually maybe different angles on the same puzzle - not mutually exclusive.

A great mystery is one you can solve from different angles or rather many people can see it from different angles and come to the same conclusion.
