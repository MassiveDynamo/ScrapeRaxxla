Some notes. I got the allied status with Shinrarta Dezhra PF selling the explore data.
I'm pretty sure Raxxla can do this for me. It's probably just a simple SQL-statement. And I'm sure that Raxxla can teleport me somewhere nice. Yes, a nice view, basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon.

Also, wouldn't it be cool if there were a system, with a faction ruling unopposed?
Its name shall be "Vektorboson's Cargo Cult".
That would be nice.
It also could have 6 planets called "Up", "Down", "Strange", "Charm", "Bottom" and "Top".
It also would be cool, if they had, like, 33° ecliptic prograde for the positive ones, and 66° ecliptic retrogade for the negtive ones.

I wonder if such a system could be forged?
