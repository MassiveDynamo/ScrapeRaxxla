Just picked "trinked of hidden fortune" dropped by pirate. Then all next pirates were scanning me and saying "from what I see better I go off". If I start attack them, then they launch breaching limpets.
So, it seems, that item is "pirate lord" mark or so.
So I wonder, will be same affect of "AI remnains" on guardins' robots? Is any other item for DW?
That is the nteresting. What’s more is i flew into a hip system day before yesterday and there was a bookmark on the 8th moon of a ne of the gas giants that I’m 1000% positive I didn’t put there cause I deleted all of my non guardian bookmarks. Flew around forever... landed and drove what felt like 1000 km and found nothing. Wonder if something like this could be a trigger?
