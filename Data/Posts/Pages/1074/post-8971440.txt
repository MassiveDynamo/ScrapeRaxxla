Also, isn't it funny that Drew Wagar and Dark Wheel have the same initials? I'm not saying Drew is The Dark Wheel, but Drew is the Dark Wheel.

Does that make me semi-legendary space combateer, a star-rider who made it my business to seek the truth behind the plethora of myths and romantic stories that filtered back from all corners of the Universe? I hope so.

Cheers,

Drew.
