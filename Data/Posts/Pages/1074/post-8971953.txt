Just picked "trinked of hidden fortune" dropped by pirate. Then all next pirates were scanning me and saying "from what I see better I go off". If I start attack them, then they launch breaching limpets.
So, it seems, that item is "pirate lord" mark or so.
So I wonder, will be same affect of "AI remnains" on guardins' robots? Is any other item for DW?
