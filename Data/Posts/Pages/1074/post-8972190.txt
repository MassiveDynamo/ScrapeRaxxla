System?
I’ll get back with you when I get off work. It’s a HIP system close to KN Muscae and it’s the 7 and 8th planet of one of those gas giants that’s rare where the description reads it’s almost a star. It’s 930 central time here and I go home for lunch at 11 so I’ll get on and let u know then..... by close I mean 150 to 200 ly
