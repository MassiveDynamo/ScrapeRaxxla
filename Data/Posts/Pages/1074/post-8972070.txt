I've found the Γαλλια / Gallia translation in several old, scanned and OCR'ed documents. I is translated to raXXla or raXXLa (always capital XX and small r).

It's just a result of the OCR software, misinterpreting the Greek letters. It would be very cunning by FD, if they used it in the mystery.

Some older mentions of this:
Γαλλια site:https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla - Google Search
A lot of those posts seem to stop at the name similarity and don't go much further.

Γαλλια / Gallia
This is a very curious one because it seems to connect some other aspects of the Raxxla codex entry.
Gallia being the Latin name for Gaul - homeland of the Celtic tribes seems to suggest there could be a Celtic influence in the clues.

Art Tornqvist:
Art - celtic name for Bear / champion
Tornqvist - thorn branch - hawthorn / fairy tree ? from celtic folklore

Astrophel and spiralling stars (note it is plural) - celtic symbols often use a spiral motif - one spiral - two interlinking spirals, or - three. Perhaps hinting at two or more stars orbiting each other? I wonder if Raxxla is at the barycenter of the star orbits
SPOILER: CELTIC TRISKELE

Omphalos Rift - a religious stone typically at the centre of the world - centre of the spiralling stars perhaps?
SPOILER: STONE
