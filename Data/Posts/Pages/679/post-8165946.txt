uhh...as i was traveling to CD-37 15492 on my way to tau ceti, i saw this weird looking pink star, that was so close to the system, and i wanted to check it out, but it was unselectable, and it had no name. no matter how hard i tried selecting it from all angles, it just didnt work. i suspected because i had my route going to CD-37 messing up with it since it's so close to it that my mouse prefers selecting CD instead, so i changed my route to CARENER but the problem persisted, i jumped somewhere else, just so i can select it to jump back. but now it's gone. not there at all. is it a galaxy map common bug? or is it a teleporting dyson sphere star? Raxxla intensifies...
