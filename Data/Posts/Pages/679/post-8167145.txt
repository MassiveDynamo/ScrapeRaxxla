Ended up in Merope with my bug squishing Chieftain, Invictus.

First time fighting the ‘goids, or even fighting in this ship full stop. So I just took it easy and had some target practice with some scouts.

I didn’t realise that the combat bonds you get from killing them give you rep with the Pilots Federation? Apparently I am now Cordial with them.
