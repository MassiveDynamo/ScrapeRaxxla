going back to my suspicion for raxxla as a planet, following that screenshot of the supposed translation 'mistake' in the russian version of the codex, where it states "the legendary planet raxxla". here is something i found that support's it too.
apparently, someone asked frontier for a "christmas hint" and received this message:
SPOILER
It may be a typo/not relevant, but ‘planet’ is italicized as PLANET (T is not italicized). Searching for ‘PLANE’ takes you to the LAVE system.
so, not only they did a "mistake" in the russian translation version by stating it's a planet, but also here? what are the odds? hmmmm

source of the image is from this text document, in page 14:

So following on this, if you put PLANET in the search of the galaxy map, it also goes to Lave. Probably because there is the planet literally named Planet Lave, which I find weird because I don't think any other planet in game has the word PLANET in front of it, unless I missed something. Also PLANET and RAXXLA both have 6 letters, weird that they brackets both those words, don't know if that has anything to do with anything, but I just found it weird...
