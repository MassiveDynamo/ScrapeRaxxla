So following on this, if you put PLANET in the search of the galaxy map, it also goes to Lave. Probably because there is the planet literally named Planet Lave, which I find weird because I don't think any other planet in game has the word PLANET in front of it, unless I missed something. Also PLANET and RAXXLA both have 6 letters, weird that they brackets both those words, don't know if that has anything to do with anything, but I just found it weird...
Galaxy map does partial searches so PLANET, PLANE and PLAN (eventually, keep clicking >) find Lave.
