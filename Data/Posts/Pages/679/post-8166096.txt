On a side note. It's interesting that Tau Ceti is in the Cetus constellation (Belly of the whale), Van Maanen's Star (home to the Guardians of the Free Spirit, among other things) is one of the stars of the Pisces constellation, the fish, and Epsilon Eridani (Home of WorldCraft and Maybe the Guardian AI) is in the Eridanus constellation, the river.
So small fish gets eaten by the big fish and gets out of the belly and swims to the river? Maybe?....
Not before Laving with the curative Waters of Shintara. Maybe.
