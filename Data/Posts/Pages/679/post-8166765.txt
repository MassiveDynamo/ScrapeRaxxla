@BluWolve - youre describing a mixture of things.
1. You only get the name of the 1st discovered etc if you sell each system individually, otherwise you just get a total of x 1st mapped, x 1st discovered etc
2. it is a bug that you get recognised as 1st discoverer when its already discovered - seems to trigger more for 1st discovered by * (stars - spell check filters them outr here * * * * * * *)which I believe is a swear word filter...and now sometimes get it when the 1st discoverer is 'Validating' which is a new one I think.
3. There are unmapped planets in the bubble, possibly some undiscovered if FSS not used so do check, try the 'South' towards Pleiades Sector way for best results (havent gone up and down on the plane much so may be more off the beaten track)

Edit: Also get 1st Discovered in Colonia a lot...like 20-30% of the time, all inhabited, all mapped, most by named players and not Validating - if bug reporting was easier, ie in game, id actually bother more. Anybody in Colonia on PC or PS4? I have a minor mystery needs checking out please (its probably a bug and certainly not Raxxla, just a mini mystery)

Which segues nicely into 'Fernweh' - I looked it up and in Codex its a desire for somewhere never seen (paraphrasing) but according to Wiki it means more of a journey or a longing to travel - may mean both, may be a subtle change, probably means nothing but a 'journey' has been mentioned before.
