Had what I thought was an odd experience today, and at the time I just wrote it off but it’s been bugging me. I’m severely sleep deprived at the moment (working night shifts) so forgive me if this is a silly question;

Has anyone ever been jumping through systems in the bubble and turned in the UC data, and gotten a congratulations message like a first discovery but no system or body name being listed? Is this a new thing related to Codex discoveries maybe? Or something like a bonus for using under par for probes with the new DSS?

Edit: My route was as follows;

Ithaca
Abrogo
212 Puppis
Puppis Sector EQ-P A5-1
COL 285 Sector KH-L C8-18
COL 285 Sector WY-X B15-2
Brestla

I have looked back through the systems multiple times and definitely have not first discovered anything. The only planet I mapped is the one in Ithaca.

Edit2: I also remember I had Chara on the page as well, because it was too close to Ithaca to cash in there.
