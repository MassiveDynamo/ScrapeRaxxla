Speaking of Lave.
I find it interesting that Lave defines as
a: WASH, BATHE
b: to flow along or against

"Lave is a simple, monosyllabic word that magically makes the mundane act of washing poetic. Shakespeare used it in The Taming of the Shrew, when Gremio assured the father of his beloved Bianca that she would have "basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands." And in Charles ens' The Old Curiosity Shop, Nell "laved her hands and face, and cooled her feet before setting forth to walk again." The poetry of "lave" is also heard when describing water washing against the shore, as in our example sentence, or even the pouring of water: "He â€¦ laved a few cool drops upon his brow" (John Lockhart, Reginald Dalton). Before washing our hands of "lave," we'll tell you its etymology: it, as well as "lavatory," comes from Latin lavare, meaning "to wash."

So basically it has to do with water. Oddly specific of them to make Waters of Shintara the rare in Shin Dez.
It reminds me of the head contact in the Demeter system, Brain Wade...yes Brain, not Brian. Wading is something you do in water. Baptism anyone?

The first day (This is really the 2nd day) of the Eleusinian mystery rites was to get in the proper garb (CMDR suits) and the right location (Demeter?).
The second day to "Alade! Mystai! "To the sea, Initiates!"

SPOILER: IT BE WHAT IT BE.
