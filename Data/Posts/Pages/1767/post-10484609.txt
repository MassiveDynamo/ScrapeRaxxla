Thank you for clarifying that. Yes my fuzzy midnight brain was also using the player journal guide as a reference, so I must have started confusing stellar mass with Jupiter masses. From a game system standpoint ED evidently uses RoguePlanet as a "star description" for the map. So these things must be unfathomably rare, difficult to target, or it is a vestigial feature that has been removed due to a redundant feature of some kind.

Like what Rochester had quoted from MB earlier here, it would make sense if a rogue planet is isolated enough from surrounding stellar bodies that our ships could lock to it. I understand we've barely scratched 1 micron of the surface of the galaxy's stars, but it's hard to fathom that players still haven't stumbled upon at least ONE of these little rogues.

Regarding Rogue planets, If anyone could confirm them being ‘in game’ as actively interactive rather than invisible like comets, Doctor Kay Ross could.

I certainly accept they are in the stellar forge, because they stated they were, and that they have a fundamental function, but I’d specifically like to know why they are not rendered graphically.

‘Stable orbits are then determined for objects formed from the materials in the disc clumping together. Passing comets and rogue planets are also thrown into the mix, to disrupt the orbits and create fledgling planets and moons’.
