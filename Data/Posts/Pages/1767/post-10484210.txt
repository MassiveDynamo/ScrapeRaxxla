Ive tried many times to follow npc jumping to permit locked systems. Especially from LAWD26 (itself an impossible system- a Wolf Rayet that near Sol would outshine our star! IIRC the nearest WR IRL is Gamma Velorum -the Guardian home system?) to Witches Reach...utter frustration! You cant of course follow them...your fsd recognises you dont have the permit! Darn Pilot(')s(') Federation!
