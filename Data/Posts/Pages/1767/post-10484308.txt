Weird been considering Witches Reach and also wolf rayets again recently...

Is there any link between Witches Reach and Facece you know of or a link to Jacques or Augustus Brenquith?
Great minds mate!
No, I don't know of any link though I've got a terrible memory- Han_Zen is much better at that.

Augustus Brenquith also intrigues me. Much seems to be made of him in a TB or two, but nothing else in-game? He would be an excellent candidate for TDW membership but I couldnt find any follow through. Its almost as though we're missing some lore...
