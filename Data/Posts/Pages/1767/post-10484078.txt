Have you contacted Frontier Development to see if you've found Raxxla?

Think they will need your ship logs to confirm from the last time someone asked about it and the screen shot with the PLANET (weird italicised T in the correspondence)...

You may have found it or they may confirm it's something else?
I haven't tbh, and I'm not really sure they would confirm or deny it anyway, to retain the mystery... I suppose I might as well ask, good idea

I suppose I could at least ask if the images in the Landscape Signal can be resolved further or that's as good as it gets - if Elite were real I'd have leverage my billions of credits to set up a research institute...

Edit: I can't really figure out how to contact support for this, it doesn't really fit into any of the categories. There isn't one for "unresolved mysteries"?
