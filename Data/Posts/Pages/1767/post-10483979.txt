Well if you don't know what you are looking for and it doesn't have a big sign saying "RAXXLA" you may well have to ask? ;-)

If it's alien bird images from near the centre of the galaxy then how would you ever know?

Anything is possibly Raxxla from the Codex.... rule it out and move on (for any weird stuff that you can rationalise to be it)... and the only ones who can rule it out are DB, MB (RIP) and Frontier Dev....?

True, very true!
But I'm expecting a big sign (at the entrance to a hollow asteroid which is actually a long-lost Guardian Ark Ship) saying "RAXXLA"; there will be a Guardian AI (in ye olde Alien Gift Shoppe) within who will give me the winning numbers for the following week's Euromillions lottery, the game will display fireworks and play Allegri's Miserere, and DB will phone saying there's a cheque for Â£1,000,000 in the post together with a crate of genuine Lavian Brandy!

Or maybe, just maybe, the screen will go dark and the words displayed will be just
RIGHT ON COMMANDER!


Edit
On further thought, how cruel could FD be? Even if we did find Raxxla, not knowing what it is...they might not confirm it!!
