You'll have to go through the Dev posts from the beginning of the forums on how FSDs and Jumping works, maybe #4 or #5.

Game mechanic wise, its because each system you jump to you is an API call to them.

Lore wise "Misjumps" from the game, have now been adapted to Thargoids snatching you out of witchspace. This would the closest thing to a 'misjump'. But we already know how it works API wise, and know its triggered from events at fdev servers based on thargoid activity in this case.

As for Raxxla, I don't think any of the clues points towards it being A system itself. And we have to stay within Game mechanics of this game. Raxxla itself could cause a portal to show up (like a wake jump style "portal", or infinite jump range or something, but we have to find raxxla first.

One of my main theories is that it is within 3-5 ls from whatever star the Raxxla Codex image is representing.

But did someone from Fdev say that there are no mis-jumps?

API's is a technical implementation of web based services... They could quite easily implement mis-jumps in an API
