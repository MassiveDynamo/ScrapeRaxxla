No problem, this thread is always (well, usually) helpful!
I think rogue planets might well be rare, they might not even be implemented in-game, but if they are then I could believe Raxxla could be one! If one exists then it would be the only body in its own system & you could fsd lock to it...
But to go trolling through low mass systems (A mass class designation) is dreadfully boring gameplay (yes, Ive done it. For a couple of hours a long time ago). But it might be a factor in conjunction with some meatier hypothesis (I dont have one!)
