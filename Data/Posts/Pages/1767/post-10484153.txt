You can't, in general circumstances, misjump to anonymous interstellar space. (And hyperdictions don't either, of course)

But if there was a hidden system not shown on the map, a misjump carried out in extremely specific circumstances might be necessary to reach it. What those circumstances are and how to trigger the misjump isn't clear, of course. (And I've tried all the plausible candidate systems I could think of)
I've often thought if you found NPC's jumping to a system not listed you could follow them as a mechanic with the wake scanner.... but it's just a thought... and not a mis-jump as such, just avoiding the curated travel guide that is the gal map....

it's how you would find a hidden system that has intrigued as well as weird stuff with the galmap (like LFT 509) or NPC's jumping to permit locked systems it intrigues me as it's trying to get to inaccessible places.....
