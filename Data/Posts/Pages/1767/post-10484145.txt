I haven't tbh, and I'm not really sure they would confirm or deny it anyway, to retain the mystery... I suppose I might as well ask, good idea

I suppose I could at least ask if the images in the Landscape Signal can be resolved further or that's as good as it gets - if Elite were real I'd have leverage my billions of credits to set up a research institute...

Edit: I can't really figure out how to contact support for this, it doesn't really fit into any of the categories. There isn't one for "unresolved mysteries"?
