No, you cannot mis-jump in this game.

Confirmed all the way back in Beta
You can't, in general circumstances, misjump to anonymous interstellar space. (And hyperdictions don't either, of course)

But if there was a hidden system not shown on the map, a misjump carried out in extremely specific circumstances might be necessary to reach it. What those circumstances are and how to trigger the misjump isn't clear, of course. (And I've tried all the plausible candidate systems I could think of)
