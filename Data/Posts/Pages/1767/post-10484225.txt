Ive tried many times to follow npc jumping to permit locked systems. Especially from LAWD26 (itself an impossible system- a Wolf Rayet that near Sol would outshine our star! IIRC the nearest WR IRL is Gamma Velorum -the Guardian home system?) to Witches Reach...utter frustration! You cant of course follow them...your fsd recognises you dont have the permit! Darn Pilot(')s(') Federation!
Weird been considering Witches Reach and also wolf rayets again recently...

Is there any link between Witches Reach and Facece you know of or a link to Jacques or Augustus Brenquith?
