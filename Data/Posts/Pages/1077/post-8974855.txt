Retirement is wonderful! You can fly whenever you want (I fly late morning to late afternoon, then park up for a Gin & Tonic come 17:00). And you donâ€™t have to please anyone else!

That sounds awfully like a work routine for me

I guess after work you like to go clubbing and dancing with the two ladies?

Tomie kind of reminds me of the Tribbles, but in a creepy way. Kinda cospiracy like.


Unless you have a spouse..

In which case I also recommend divorce!

I never thought of David Braben and Ian Bell as spouses. Those scathing comments about Raxxla not being possible because the ED-universe is too static?
I guess that gas giant appearing right in front of me, eclipsing the sun, is just a coincidence? It feels like the cloud bursts, Donner in the sky, I shout, and no one seems to hear.

I'm tired of chasing beacons that are running away. Yes, I have amazing powers of observation, which you too, have. I don't have a silver spoon on a chain, I don't do that kind of stuff.

I'm too lazy to look up all the names posting in this thread, but I have a hunch that a certain retiree might be Macros Black. Like Macros Black = MB = Michael Brooks.

It could be space madness though
