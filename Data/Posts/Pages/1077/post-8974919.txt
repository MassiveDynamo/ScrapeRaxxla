I haven't quite worked out for what, but I believe those to be important in some way for something.

I've recently came up with the idea that perhaps the hidden DW station might detect something in the trinkets and reveal it self to the nav panel.

Kind of a modification of a game mechanic/tracker that we know exists with the Thargoid doors and the Guardian Beacons. Nav Panel would be new though*, maybe it just 'pops' into sight instead? Guardian Beacons activate when within X km (is it 3 or 5 or 7.5km?), CZs activate when within 7.5Km. Carry something go somewhere and something happens....certainly one way they could have done it, one of the more realistic ones of how

Most things activate automatically within distance. (little bit obvious...)
Guardian Obelisks have symbol 'clues' on them as a key to what to carry. Bit of working out but it tells you what you need to do (little bit obvious...)
Thargoid Doors were after the UA were found so logical to try them eventually, certainly in most peoples top 10 list of things to try I would have thought. (MB chipped in when UA themselves weren't being solved so maybe a hint would have been forthcoming if nobody had got there)

What do these trinkets and other stuff look like? Maybe they are waiting to become 'useful' at the right time in the right place? Or maybe they are just Treasure Island type 'fluff' or as someone pointed out, 'lore'?

Edit: Bases and Crashed Ships etc appear or should appear after DSS so not totally new.
