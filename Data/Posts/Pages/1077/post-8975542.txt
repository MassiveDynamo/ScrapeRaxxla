I'm liking HIP 22711 today.

This system is listed as having a Guardian signal when no Guardian objects are present. There is a Thargoid base here. Body 7 is an unnamed class Y brown dwarf object, my favourite of the gas giants. You guessed it, there's 8 moons. The eighth moon is on a different orbital plane than its sister moons. The moon has a single ring split into three parts with space large enough to fly between the segments.

Thanks to its centrally located asteroid belt, HIP 22711 also looks pleasant when viewed from the orrery map view. Like, a giant wheel perhaps? Oh who am I kidding. All the systems look like dark wheels. : )
