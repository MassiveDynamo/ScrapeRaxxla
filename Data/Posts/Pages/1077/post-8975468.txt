Yes, I was about to order SunDragon & thought I’d order the follow up at the same time.
Then I couldn’t find it!

Reminds me - If you get Sun Dragon. There was a reference in MBs book Elite Legacy to a... childrens book about a Princess and an Alien Dragon
I think it was a reference to the Sun Dragon book, however I wasnt able to get much from that - except for the Tau Ceti Expedition - which wasnt part of the book - just that extra website with a few blog posts. I did get the impression that some of that related to stuff he was probably working on relating to the alien life forms living in the void as well as possibly the thargoid probes and their means of communicating with us... but beyond that ?
