I was looking forward to retirement.

Now you are trying to awaken my hunting instinct.

Retirement is wonderful! You can fly whenever you want (I fly late morning to late afternoon, then park up for a Gin & Tonic come 17:00). And you donâ€™t have to please anyone else!

Unless you have a spouse..


In which case I also recommend divorce!
