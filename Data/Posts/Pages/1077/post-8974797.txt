Retirement is wonderful! You can fly whenever you want (I fly late morning to late afternoon, then park up for a Gin & Tonic come 17:00). And you donâ€™t have to please anyone else!

Unless you have a spouse..


In which case I also recommend divorce!
Divorce sounds so harsh though. Might I suggest the phrase marital retirement?
