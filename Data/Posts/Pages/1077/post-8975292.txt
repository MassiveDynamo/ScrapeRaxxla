Yeah, that's kinda my point. Why have it in the game if it's only visible as we know it from Sol? I'm wondering if you can use it to find Raxxla. If you take into consideration The Toast of The Dark Wheel in the codex, and the speculation that the location of Raxxla is hidden in myths and stories. If your going looking for Raxxla, maybe start looking from Sol. That's all I got tho, really. Cassiopeia? Polaris? Permit Lock? Guess I'll give the wheel a turn. o7
Oh yes, absolutely agree! All of the clues that name constellations would likely be from/based on a perspective from Sol... definitely a good place to make any initial observations from
