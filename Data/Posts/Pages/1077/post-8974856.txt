I haven't quite worked out for what, but I believe those to be important in some way for something. They are practically worthless, and you can't buy them anywhere but there seems to be something special about them.

I've recently came up with the idea that perhaps the hidden DW station might detect something in the trinkets and reveal it self to the nav panel. Unfortunately we still don't know where to look. So be sure to keep some trinkets on you before you go check out the 8th moon of whatever gas giant you just found
