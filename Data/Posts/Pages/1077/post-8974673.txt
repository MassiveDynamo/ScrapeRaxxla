Lavian Brandy. Sounds like a good thing to hold in the cargo racks next thursday.

What else should there be in the cargo hold, when the hunting dog retires and turns into stone? stone... stone... stone... stone... stone...
Biscuits!
Any seasoned explorer knows that biscuits are essential (my personal preference is Digestives cos they’re also good with cheese). They can be dunked in tea, coffee or brandy as the social occasion permits, but need to be kept in a tightly sealed container to ensure the Tribble’s can’t get at them.

And Jaffa Cakes are cakes!
But American biscuits are scones!!
