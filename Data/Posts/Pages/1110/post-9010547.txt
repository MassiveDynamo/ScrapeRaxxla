Interesting, the german "Braue" is not use in regard of hills and peaks. "Stirn" just means forhead, and it gets used for everything that has a anatomical forehead. There are no relevant synonyms for "Stirn", just the ones i mentioned.

If you translate "Stirn" from german to english, brow shows up as an option in most translators, so maybe just lazy translation,
but "Braue" is specifically the brow ridge, and "Stirn" is specifically the forehead.
Its just wierd that they could have translated it 1:1 no problem, there are no words missing in german to have a 100% accurate translation (except mabye witchspace). The wording is natural, everything fits nicely, just the facts are off.
Well... when I hear the word brow without it being preceded by "eye", the first image I get IS of a forehead rather than the eyebrow area specifically. When used poetically, I think that's often the intention of it.

If stirn is being used in the German translation, I suspect it is to convey that same image. It may or may not be a relevant clue, it just be that the writer of the toast, or the translator felt the same as I do about the word brow, as used in English.
