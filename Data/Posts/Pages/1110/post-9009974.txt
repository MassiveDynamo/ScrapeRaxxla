All Quiet on the Orion Nebula, Running Man, Flame and NGC 1999 fronts, but Witch Head is crawling with Thargoids (and the Alliance of course). Other than the Alliance or other human activity, I wonder if there is some actual scientific similarity between California, Pleiades, Witch Head, and Coalsack Nebulae? (and possibly the locked nebulae also) that is drawing the Thargoid presence? Or is it just because of the evil human baddies expanding there? (Are we the baddies?). Why are there no lengthy Thargoid logistics lines/presence back to their home areas, or signs of them travelling from there at least? Do their witchspace routes only take them to certain nebulae? Another last thought for the night - Thargoids coming up from Orion way might be Oresrians, those coming from Coalsack way might be Klaxians? Or vice versa. Oh, and Raxxla. I'll get back to that at some point. Maybe after a quick trip out California way tomorrow, and then back via the Aquila Rift to finish up with Jorki's Great Rift theory. Oh, and because I want to get Beyond it. Heh heh. (already was but it is still a great pun).
