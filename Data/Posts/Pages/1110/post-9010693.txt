The old aliens threads are all dead, most of them haven't had a post since January and the mysteries thread hasn't had one since September last time I looked. Pretty sad. Maybe the Canonn are hoarding everything on Discord or somewhere else now.

Been through Lupus, Musca, Coalsack and Coalsack Dark Region already on the way out here, so going to do a loop and go back around through Aquila and as many of the others as I can, then pay Felicity a visit. I don't hold out much hope, my FSD was already engineered by her to the max some years ago, and pretty sure I sold her data then from some of these areas (by chance). Will see what is going on by then but may head back out here in time for the launch in case anything unlocks, or head to Sol perhaps.
