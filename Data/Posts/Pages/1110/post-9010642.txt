The old aliens threads are all dead, most of them haven't had a post since January and the mysteries thread hasn't had one since September last time I looked. Pretty sad. Maybe the Canonn are hoarding everything on Discord or somewhere else now.

Been through Lupus, Musca, Coalsack and Coalsack Dark Region already on the way out here, so going to do a loop and go back around through Aquila and as many of the others as I can, then pay Felicity a visit. I don't hold out much hope, my FSD was already engineered by her to the max some years ago, and pretty sure I sold her data then from some of these areas (by chance). Will see what is going on by then but may head back out here in time for the launch in case anything unlocks, or head to Sol perhaps.

Yep, Lupus was definitely one I visited, and all the variations of the Dark Nebulae regions. One thing I noticed was that according to EDSM the Galactic Mapping project has tagged HIP 84605 as The Great Rift, but also lists all the component nebulae (maybe that’s where I got the list from?) https://www.edsm.net/en_GB/system/id/176894/name/HIP+84605

Perhaps they regarded HIP 84605 as the centre of The Great Rift? But I found when I went out there that I had already visited it so couldn’t scan it again. But it would be poor game design if you couldn’t join TDW because you’d already visited a place on a previous expedition! (I spent a long time out in that area trying to match the view to some pic that I thought might be a clue to Raxxla...)
