Well... when I hear the word brow without it being preceded by "eye", the first image I get IS of a forehead rather than the eyebrow area specifically. When used poetically, I think that's often the intention of it.

If stirn is being used in the German translation, I suspect it is to convey that same image. It may or may not be a relevant clue, it just be that the writer of the toast, or the translator felt the same as I do about the word brow, as used in English.
So from the definition we are discussing we can have a assumption like this:

as @TrillClinton mentioned the definition of brow should be taken as forehead, not eyebrow nor the other meanings. I wonder how it could be interpretted from other languages? I know a lot of cmdrs speaking Spanish and Russian, may be they can enlight us about the Raxxla codex interpretation in their language?
