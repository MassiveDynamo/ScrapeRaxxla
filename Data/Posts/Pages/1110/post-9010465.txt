Very interesting find indeed. We should mention that brow also means top part of a hill, peak, mountaintop and also eyebrow. But what u say is the German translation is forehead. I would be glad if you enlighten me about the usage of this in example sentences, sorry i cant speak German. The word stirn, does it mean different things like in english? or is it only used for human forehead? For example if you talk about a sculptures forhead, or an animals, do you use stirn word? Are there synonims in german for that stirn? (like brow and forehead)
Interesting, the german "Braue" is not use in regard of hills and peaks. "Stirn" just means forhead, and it gets used for everything that has a anatomical forehead. There are no relevant synonyms for "Stirn", just the ones i mentioned.

If you translate "Stirn" from german to english, brow shows up as an option in most translators, so maybe just lazy translation,
but "Braue" is specifically the brow ridge, and "Stirn" is specifically the forehead.
Its just wierd that they could have translated it 1:1 no problem, there are no words missing in german to have a 100% accurate translation (except mabye witchspace). The wording is natural, everything fits nicely, just the facts are off.
