not exactly, because after bodies, you target stations and sometimes you crash despite they are present
Jepp, some Stations crash the Searchbar. I have no clue why. 2 of the 6 Stations Orbiting Pareco Comet crash it. Thats were i first noticed it. So SD 68 could be a Station. I sadly have no time atm for extended ED Gameplay hope it will change i a couple of weeks and i can go Hunting again.
This thread is amassing, keeps me hooked even i can't play atm.
