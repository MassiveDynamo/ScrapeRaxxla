I think i found something in ShinDez BUT i don't want to put too much hope on people.
It's a strange thing: i posted ShinDez system bodyIDs some weeks ago, pointed that there were 12 comets in the system but as i only was looking for bodies, i didn't pay much attention to ... stations!

SPOILER: LOOK AT THAT (SHINRARTA DEZHRA)


Do you see what is missing? (look at BodyIDs)


So i think now, as some people, that there is indeed something in Shinrarta Dezhra, and it should be located between the Star A and Founders World!
The problem is that targeting ID68 just crashed the game, ID69 (Jameson Memorial too but we can Supercruise Exit to it).

I looked for Sol too but there is no gap between BodyIDs, so either there is no hidden station in Sol or it should be after Titan City (BodyID:55)

BodyID68 is:

Yes, I see BodyID 68 is missing, and it is likely to be a station since Jameson Memorial is BodyID 69, but are you sure they are numbered consecutively? Because from the Start Menu pic I would have expect a hidden station to be at one of the twin moons of the AB planets.

Why does targeting it cause a crash? Probably some logic to prevent exactly this way of finding it!
But there must be another Way! ( darned Mandalorian!)
