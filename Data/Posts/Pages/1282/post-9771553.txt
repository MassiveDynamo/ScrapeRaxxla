OK
so how do I see/detect these comets?
Ive just arrived in Shinrarta, honked & FSSd, and they are not showing in my journal file!!


Mmm, I see from the journal file all the Tourist Beacon title spellings of Pilots Federation have been corrected. Was it all too obvious???
Might visit them to check spelling in the contents. There's got to be some clue in SD!
I think i found something in ShinDez BUT i don't want to put too much hope on people.
It's a strange thing: i posted ShinDez system bodyIDs some weeks ago, pointed that there were 12 comets in the system but as i only was looking for bodies, i didn't pay much attention to ... stations!

SPOILER: LOOK AT THAT (SHINRARTA DEZHRA)

SPOILER: NOW LOOK AT JAMESON MEMORIAL STATION

Do you see what is missing? (look at BodyIDs)

SPOILER: SPOILER

So i think now, as some people, that there is indeed something in Shinrarta Dezhra, and it should be located between the Star A and Founders World!
The problem is that targeting ID68 just crashed the game, ID69 (Jameson Memorial too but we can Supercruise Exit to it).

I looked for Sol too but there is no gap between BodyIDs, so either there is no hidden station in Sol or it should be after Titan City (BodyID:55)

BodyID68 is:
a comet (but cannot reach it as it crashed the game)
a body, but the nav beacon should see it unless it appears at specific time so you have then to scan the beacon to go to it.
a station between ShinDez A and Founders World (not a surface station)
