Yes, I see BodyID 68 is missing, and it is likely to be a station since Jameson Memorial is BodyID 69, but are you sure they are numbered consecutively? Because from the Start Menu pic I would have expect a hidden station to be at one of the twin moons of the AB planets.

Why does targeting it cause a crash? Probably some logic to prevent exactly this way of finding it!
But there must be another Way! ( darned Mandalorian!)
Yes, station IDs are consecutive regarding how close from main star they are.
For the crash, either someone else like Pyroboros who understand the mechanisms of overflowing search bar can explain us OR i don't know atm.
The crash occurs whatever the station is an outpost, asteroid base, orbis, coriolis or ocellus station (no pattern).
