OK
so how do I see/detect these comets?
Ive just arrived in Shinrarta, honked & FSSd, and they are not showing in my journal file!!

Edit: Just scnned the nav beacon & theyre still not showing! Though interestingly at that point Elite Observatory then reported Nested moons


Mmm, I see from the journal file all the Tourist Beacon title spellings of Pilots Federation have been corrected. Was it all too obvious???
Might visit them to check spelling in the contents. There's got to be some clue in SD!
