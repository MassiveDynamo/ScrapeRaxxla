Anything is possible.

I always imagined that the real DW station had voice acted data points, which you simply read… and they replicated the Older DW missions?!

I do hope both are in game, I honestly do…and I’m about 55% sure they are, may be…
I mean, I have always considered the DW Station could have existed just as any other station, and essentially have like a "ship yard" for their artifacts as well... but would display much like the outfitting screen... a 3d model with rotation, zoom, ect....

If that's the case, then absolutely yes, it could be even pre-horizons content.

BUT. BUT. BUT.

If that were indeed the case, why in the heck would fdev only just very recently acknowledge the station is not/has not been, in game? Regardless of Raxxla being in game, why wouldn't the DW station?

If it were planned as/going to be a simple, normal but slightly tweaked, implementation of a station, then it should stand to reason that the station should/would have been implemented in the last 7 years.... especially since the station is like, the main DW thing to find.... there is no other 'narrative' reason to not implement the station if it were just 'basic' with a twist.... and even giving us that, in the last few years since the codex entries, would be a massive stepping stone in the Raxxla narrative, even if Raxxla itself still wasn't accessible....

The only reason left to not implement until atleast this point, besides waiting for space legs is, fdev doesn't want the DW/Raxxla narrative to be played out until...? What, end of development? Idk... I think it's probably Space Legs, that fdev was waiting for, before advancing the DW/Raxxla narratives, which likely points to the need to have atleast Odyssey to get access to them when them are implemented....

Again, 100%, like always, anything is plausible with fdev at the Helm... but as usual, gotta make those educated assumptions lol
