OK so just trawling through my support history and found this.

I’d obviously omitted it previously because it doesn’t really say anything but, considering the recent morose discussion, about what is/isn’t in game etc I wanted to find something that was maybe encouraging?

Here I asked a similar question but with a different loaded perspective, now they don’t confirm nor deny it, but they follow on with a positive element of encouragement?

So maybe the DW faction linked to the invite isn’t yet accessible (based off FD previous indication) but Raxxla and the DW station are?

Is this proof of accessibility?
