Well, we know from Tourist Beacon0250 in Shinrarta that “There are also known cliques within the PF (The Dark Wheel is probably the most famous) that have their own agendas.” I’ve just been pointing out (again!) that there are several spellings of Pilots Federation and your answer from Customer Support indicated they are really different within game. Not too big a stretch of imagination to hypothesise that TDW may be one of them!
And perhaps the answer you got to the effect that certain factions are not currently in game means that TDW needs to be instantiated before they appear, perhaps there’s a gameplay chain here.

Perhaps:
“You've got to become élite, Alex” (Rafe Zetter in the novella, and possibly DB from unsubstantiated rumour) leads to Shinrarta, where the several Tourist Beacons there highlight the different PF spellings (and the wording of TB0250) hinting at the different cliques, and TDW may be one of them-> MB’s “it’s a personal journey, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious just so that people know what they are doing”. TDW stealth station may not appear until we’ve got the access permission, and maybe we need to do that & read their historical records (Galaxy Quest reference!) to find Raxxla?

So, I repeat, how do we contact and ally with
Pilots Federation (Local) - CG? Local to where?
The Pilots Federation ???

You could wait in system, for the right inbox mission, do them and see what kind of follow missions you get. Over time you may get enough status with the faction required.
