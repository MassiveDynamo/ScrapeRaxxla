I still dont see how you're getting comets in SD in your journal file, cos they aint showing in mine!
In my journal, after nav beacon scan, i sorted the BodyIDs.
Those missing first are either barycenters, belt origin, belt clusters or rings.

Then i have some gaps: 27, 29, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55.
To find what are these gaps, i use the Cmdr Pyroboros's spreasheet to target the BodyID and once i drop in the signal (this is why you see "SupercruiseExit" in logs), i get the line in my log file and copy/paste it to fill the gap.
And i repeat until i crash the galmap searchbar, which until now, indicated that there was nothing more over that ID.
