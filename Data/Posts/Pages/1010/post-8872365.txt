Does anyone have most or all of the galnet articles in document form minus powerplay? Bonus points if it is in epub format. I need to go through it all, the apps keep messing up for me, and my phone hates wikis.
Heinrich’s galnet archive was the best but the server seems to have gone down. This is an alternative for searchable news https://news.galnet.fr/en/
Don’t know of anything else; if you find anything let us know!
