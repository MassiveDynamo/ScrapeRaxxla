I thought that was in reference to the Zurara when it was mentioned scanning in a wing would have better luck finding it. Maybe Iâ€™m confused.

Drew W did say something similar about hunting for Zurara in a Wing, if my failing memory serves me correctly, but this was specifically supposed to be DB in a video on the FD webste wrt Raxxla & supposedly the video was removed......??
