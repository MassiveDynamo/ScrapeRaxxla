there is so much i dont know about elite lore that i just dont know where to even start

Read Holdstock’s original Dark Wheel novella: http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/elite/dkwheel.htm
Read through the known tourist beacons
Read the in-game Codex
Read the galactic timeline https://daftworks.co.uk/elite/index.php/Galactic_Timeline
Read the ED books (available in print or electronic via FD shop)
Drew Wagar did a series of videos about his ED lore tour, might be worth watching those (cant be sure, haven’t seen them!)
Ask questions here! Han_Zen and Thatchinho are knowledgeable on lore, as are quite a few others.
Edit: beware! a lot of old lore has been retconned out and is not canon for ED. And someone said don’t believe everything that is said, I think that’s a good philosophy both in-game and IRL!

Edit2: the tourist beacons sheet is here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1eu30UyjpQrWexAglwD1Ax_GaDz4d7l8KD76kSzX4DEk/htmlview#
