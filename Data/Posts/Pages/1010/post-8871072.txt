The only stupid thought is the one that starts you trying to change the plug on an electrical appliance after drinking a bottle of Lavian brandy!

(And no, I haven’t done it! I received enough shocks in my teenage years when I was repairing TVs to know better!)

I think that mention was me requoting Cmdr Koben who said he recalled DB saying in a video interview that Raxxla would appear if we were in the right place and scanned the area enough. It may be a false rumour, it’s certainly unsubstantiated since nobody has come up with the reference to that video and it apparently disappeared from FD’s website. I would really like to find it and put the reference in the FD Quotes thread if anyone has it!!!
I thought that was in reference to the Zurara when it was mentioned scanning in a wing would have better luck finding it. Maybe I’m confused.
