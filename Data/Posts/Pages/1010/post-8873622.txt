No, I think the dominant faction is not always the permit giver. And at least one of the locked systems is unpopulated, or the faction only exists within the system. See https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/updated-permit-list.122593/

@{SAS}Stalker: The answer to your question is ... nobody knows how to get the permits! though many have tried. There logically should be a way to get the permit since at least one (Witch’s Reach) was mentioned in an early change note as having had military convoys placed there, hence some gameplay that we should be able to access.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to investigate and solve this mystery and then report to the Secretary this thread on the way to get these permits. Should be a doddle for a SAS man!
(I’d suggest covert infiltration disguised as an asteroid, and set up a FOB with a good IR telescope, a pack of Digestives, and a bottle of Lavian brandy; it could be a long mission)
