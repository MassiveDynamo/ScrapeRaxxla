How to acquire the permit for Witch's Reach? Because my gut says that doing such an impossible task will answer some of these mysteries.

And it's Merry F'king Christmas!

What's the assumption on these permits? It it thought that they are obtainable because they are listed as "named" permit and not "unknown" permit?

I simply though that it had been a matter of not knowing what and or triggering the permit granting event yet, rather than being unobtainable.
