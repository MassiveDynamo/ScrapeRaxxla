i'm guessing we are not 'liking' this as seems like we are liking the injury of a CMDR if you know what I mean but gl Jorki,hope it isnt too bad.

ill have to track down that quote, if anyone looking it was on one of the major update livestreams (I think / hope) where they do a long livestream while servers are down and they get a few different devs on to give details. Cant remember if it was Ed or Will, think Will and it was the guy who does the missions updates (embarrassed to say cant remember his name sorry), short black hair, talks about new mission board (I think) the layout and rewards and then mentions the 4th reward. Its only a 20-30 minute segment in the livestream.

Thanks! Doesnâ€™t hurt quite so much this morning (down to dull agony!) & got some physio booked for tomorrow.
Did a quick google this morning after reading yr post & there was a lot of discussion about updated missions back in January, so guessing might be thinking of the livestream for the last major update (around October last year?)
