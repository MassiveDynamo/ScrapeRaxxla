Thanks Jorki, I'm already regretting committing to tracking it down but I half remember it as being 2018 so it may well be that one, Ill watch it in detail, the problem is I have them on on laptop while playing on Xbox so dont pay attention to whos saying what or which video at the time. Some progress however:

Its Adam who says it not Adam Woods but the other one, I never catch his name as the audio is so bad but it sounds like Braithwaite or Blake-White or similar but you'll know who I mean I hope. Sorry Adam if you ever read this, I love the ones you're on, they're always informative, its just the introductions that are muffled. Actually if you are reading this, does this jog a memory and are you able to say more yet or not, mainly, has the 4th reward been discovered / granted?

the search continuum....
