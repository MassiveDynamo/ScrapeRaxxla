Ice ?

Yes, using heat + cold pads alternately. Two ibuprofen tablets last night didn’t help. Smothered joint & arm this morning with ibuprofen gel & wondering about taking 1 ibuprofen tab+1 paracetamol tab. Trying to postpone medicinal brandy till later, else dog won’t get afternoon walk & I may not make it upstairs tonight!
