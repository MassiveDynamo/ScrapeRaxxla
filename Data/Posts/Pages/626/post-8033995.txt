In my last game session I complete a tip-off mission from an anonymous stranger after completing some "Founder or Elite" ranked mission for TDW, now I have an "Rescue Mission - Occupied Escape Pods" from another TDW allied partner 'Future of Arro Naga' that I haven't run missions for in quite a while but is on my tracking spreadsheet as having completed FoE missions previously.

Coincidence?

Does anyone know if the mission stack was re-vamped in the September update to offer more random missions directly to pilots?

Or am I being covertly tested...since I've never had one of these before (one can only hope!)?

Thanks for all the replies, I checked out the TO thread but this wasn't a tip-off mission. Just a direct rescue mission for me.

And damn! I didn't get time last session to complete the Rescue Mission for FoA that I posted about, and just logged in game, re-checked the message, navigated to the system (Arro Naga), and now when I check in my messages it's gone!? I only got it on Monday?! :-(

That'll learn me â€¦ next time I'm grabbing a screen shot if I get one of those missions.

Fly dangerously.
