This was just before I got up to feed the ship’s dog, returned to my (black) pilots chair & sat on my (black) cat who had purloined my space. Jumped up, jamming my arm under the armrest, cat went running off into gard(i)en space. Found I couldn’t move my left arm-think I may have damaged rotator cuff. In pain all night, less than 3 hours sleep.

Think the follow-on mission may have to wait!!!
Edit2: may have time to catch up on videos!

i'm guessing we are not 'liking' this as seems like we are liking the injury of a CMDR if you know what I mean but gl Jorki,hope it isnt too bad.

ill have to track down that quote, if anyone looking it was on one of the major update livestreams (I think / hope) where they do a long livestream while servers are down and they get a few different devs on to give details. Cant remember if it was Ed or Will, think Will and it was the guy who does the missions updates (embarrassed to say cant remember his name sorry), short black hair, talks about new mission board (I think) the layout and rewards and then mentions the 4th reward. Its only a 20-30 minute segment in the livestream.
