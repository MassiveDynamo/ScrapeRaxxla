The engineered module icons in the right panel are still showing red!
The red colour in modules screen is not a software glitch, it symbolizes your spaceship realizing its light nature, and spiritual transmutation from dead lead into gold. It's Chrysopoeia. Your modules have become philosophical fire, alchemical sulphur, prima materia, sons of Hermes. Reddening is the fourth stage of awakening, illuminated pure spirit, most intense fire, highest state of consciousness.

"Take the clean white, which
is a most great arcanum, wherein is the
true tincture; imbue sand therewith,
which sand is made out of the stone
seven times imbued, until it drink up
the whole, and close the mouth of the
vessel effectually, as you have often been
told. For that which ye seek of it by
the favour of God, will appear to you,
which is the stone of Tyrian colour.
Now, therefore, I have fulfilled the
truth, so do I conjure you by God and
your sure Master, that you show not
this great arcanum, and beware of the
wicked!"



Ancient hermetic philosophers were also quite keen on idea that the Red Tincture, Philosopher's Stone, Spiritualised Gold, is actually radioactive. You know, like a nuclear bomb.
