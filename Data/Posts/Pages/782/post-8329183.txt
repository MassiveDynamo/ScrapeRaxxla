I also checked some NS + BH or NS +BH+BH, tried to fly into BH charged by that NS as well.
Latest ideas about "sirens" are hot NS which are over 2.7 SoL masses and must not exist. It is magnetars with near 1 billion temp. Shiny in hyperspace. Some have BH with too, and 1 intresting has some POI with energy life which do like thargoids scanners break. Next time I will check it again with xeno scanner installed.
