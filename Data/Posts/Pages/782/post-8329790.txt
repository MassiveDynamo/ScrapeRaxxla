I'm on XB so don't have any other windows open, maybe its doing something in the background as well but have auto-update off usually and do it manually.

Theres just no rhyme nor reason to it, no obvious trigger for it, no consistency, at least none Ive noticed. Happened in the bubble and in the black.
