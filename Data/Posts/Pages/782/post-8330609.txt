I dropped into Van Maanen's Star to check the Tattoo of the Divine Galen Elliott. I was wrong, he doesn't have the neck tattoo of the engineers in my previous post, just the 4 leaf clover I'm loosely associating to the criminal gangs at the moment as per my previous post.

SPOILER: SUBLIME ORDER OF VAN MAANEN'S STAR - TATTOO (CRIMINAL?)

So I'll keep an eye out on other faction agents to see if they have the \V/ tattoo, and I'd appreciate if anyone else spots someone with it if they could post a quick note so I can track if it's a viable lead to follow.

And now I'm torn - have I been working against TRDW by helping TDW in SD? So the question is, are these related tattoos related to any faction alliances within Elite, or just eye candy?

Well, since I'm completely allied with TDW and almost a complete enemy of TBHG I'll keep working at being 100% opposites (allied with TDW and enemy of TBHG), then I'll start working the other way - to completely ally myself with those bearing the tattoos, and work against TDW in SD. I'll keep you posted.


p.s. If I just disappear one day after switching allegiance, look suspiciously at TDW in SD as being allies of THE CLUB! ;-)

Interestingly, I checked a couple of other 'enemies' of TDW from other systems (like Nuenets, Fong Wang etc) and they don't have either a representative, or passenger that appeared with either of those tattoos. Lots of criminal masterminds, no tattoos. Seems like there are two factions of Criminals(?) going by the tattoos. Those with the four leaf, and those with the neck pyramids.

I might have to go back to scratch with data collection about this - seems like a possible avenue that needs more thorough examination and data points before proving +/-.
