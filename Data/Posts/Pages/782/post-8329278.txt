Hmm...got weird bug or feature ... not sure yet. Will try restart.
Any way, came to big guardian site with a lot of big empty space on Anaconda. Trying to land. Somewhere at 10-60m altitude ship hits invisible wall, inside cabin black smoke, shield goes down slowly..
Most likely some bug as it was not stopping after jump at star too automatically.
Restart didnt help ...keep hitting something at 30m altitude, black smoke starts before hit and gets more dense...gona fly to another planet. Will see if repeats there.
Upd: ok ...black smoke that is how dust looks in night vision in dark ...landed ok on another planet. So that one just bugged it seems. Or not for big ships.

P.S. jump dethrottle still not working ... it shows in chat "dethrottle" then keeps going into star. I started to mention that last 2 weeks when came to bubble and changed ships. Any body have idea why ? >: Maybe some setting from another ship (it is ON on panel, tried OFF/ON explicit too)...
