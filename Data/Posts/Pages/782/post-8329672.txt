Same here, intermittently turns off auto-decelerate for no apparent reason. Re-log to home and back into fdev Server usually (but not always) does the trick but no idea why or whats happening.
I've had incidents where either a bug prevents keyboard usage just in Elite, or that some other application wins the race to become the topmost (active) application. The bug is sort of 'well known'.
If the Elite-window happens to loose focus then controls may stop work. It's been applications like Ed-app overlays, discord and similar apps that I have integrated while playing. I don't recall exactly which over the time. As of the Input shifting to active app, is by design in Windows.

Anyway, advise is to assume bug/minor problem rather than ingame mechanics, while keep maintaining vigilant for something that could debunk it as such.
