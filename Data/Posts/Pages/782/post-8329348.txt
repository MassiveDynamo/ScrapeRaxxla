It's fishy, but it would be a way for Raxxla to be in-game. Hopefully it's right

My 2 pints of scepticism:
Why the low-fi screenshot/picture? the signals (yellow ring, name and distance) show always the same size on the screen. Even if taken from the phone or high res screen, you wouldn't need to magnify it so much it would blur like that. At least not with something you would have at hand quickly to take the shot. Might be wrong on this one, but anyway. Also, the Raxxla type looks squeezed down compare to the other elements and the in-game font.
The other strange thing is the neutron highway, as it would need to be found to be plottable on spansh. Unless he means simply using neutrons on the route, what looks a random attempt to cross that void. if you are using NS on scarce star field you are always a jump away to get stuck and head to rebuy. So either the route was previously set or he really picked the right start and ending location by sheer luck.

Don't resurrect that mathmoss dude. It was a lie based on a fake image. Blacklist him and move on.
