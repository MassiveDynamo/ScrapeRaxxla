Has anyone else noticed that two of the engineers, both with noteworthy surnames have the same neck tattoo?

I'm sure I saw the same one recently when I unlocked the permit for van Maanen's Star, and it was on the Sublime Order of van Maanen's Star contact. Although they also had the weird four leaf clover tattoo that criminal masterminds seem to have as well.

Not sure how this relates to anything as yet, but might be a tiny bit obvious too.









I haven't yet unlocked Lori, so I don't know if she's also has allegiance to the Empire?

I dropped into Van Maanen's Star to check the Tattoo of the Divine Galen Elliott. I was wrong, he doesn't have the neck tattoo of the engineers in my previous post, just the 4 leaf clover I'm loosely associating to the criminal gangs at the moment as per my previous post.

SPOILER: SUBLIME ORDER OF VAN MAANEN'S STAR - TATTOO (CRIMINAL?)

So I'll keep an eye out on other faction agents to see if they have the \V/ tattoo, and I'd appreciate if anyone else spots someone with it if they could post a quick note so I can track if it's a viable lead to follow.

And now I'm torn - have I been working against TRDW by helping TDW in SD? So the question is, are these related tattoos related to any faction alliances within Elite, or just eye candy?

Well, since I'm completely allied with TDW and almost a complete enemy of TBHG I'll keep working at being 100% opposites (allied with TDW and enemy of TBHG), then I'll start working the other way - to completely ally myself with those bearing the tattoos, and work against TDW in SD. I'll keep you posted.

SPOILER: THE ENEMY OF TDW FROM SD - LFT 926 THE BLUE HAND GANG

p.s. If I just disappear one day after switching allegiance, look suspiciously at TDW in SD as being allies of THE CLUB! ;-)
