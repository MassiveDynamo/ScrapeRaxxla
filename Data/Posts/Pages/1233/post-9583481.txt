“Calico” Zachary Rackham: (Why they call him Calico is a mystery to me) After going over the articles mentioning him I think he is representative of The Club leadership which would explain why he’s portrayed as an adversary to the Arch-Corsairs in the article and why he chose the Duradrive over the Torc. Possibly even representative of Sirius. An Article mentioning Sirius wanting to host the Galactic Summit also mentioned Rackham wanting to host the summit at The Galactic Zenith seemed on the nose to me. That article quickly stated that Rackham wasn’t taken seriously as if to say he’s a joke and not worthy of consideration. Rackham has also been to the “Rhea Archipelago” a place that has been mentioned several times and is usually mentioned in conjunction with missing celebrities.

There was an early 18th century pirate named ‘Calico Jack’ his given name was John Rackham… maybe a distant relative? Also i am intrigued because of course Calico … is also a type of cat…
Ah ya missed jorki pointing it out
