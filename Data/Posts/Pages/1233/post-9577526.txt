[...]have you (or anyone else) done an analysis of the missions offered by PF and TDW in Shinrarta? If it is a front run by the real DW then Iâ€™d expect a few of those missions to direct the player towards the real DW faction. That would be consistent with DB sayings about we dont play the game as they expected & he knows there are missions that nobody has seen (because of that unexpected gameplay).
Sadly, no.
I was thinking along those lines myself. Gotta get away from the game for a while and approach it from a new angle when I get back.
I just realized something. Dark Wheel. Drew Wagar. DW. Is that just a coincidence? I think not!
