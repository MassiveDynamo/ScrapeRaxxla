You could join The Order in Van Maanen’s, I hear they’re running short of rock hermits!

Yes, it’s a great shame FD didnt try from the outset to represent the Mausoleum. They probably couldnt do the Holdstock description justice, but something, anything...

I still cant make my mind up about Luko. His dialogue seems ambiguous. He apparently put the TDW emblem in her ship after she abandoned it; was that to deliberately frame her? It was used against her at the trial. His speech at times makes it seem as though he doesnt know much about TDW, then he’s supposed to be a member, then someone pointed out that there’s a Giovanni in CIEP in AHTW...is it the same guy or someone else (common given name).

@drew : if you’re still reading Drew then clarification on this would be most welcome!
