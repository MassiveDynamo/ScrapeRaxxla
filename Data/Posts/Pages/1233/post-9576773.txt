chapter 12, p452 in my ecopy:

“The graveyard?’ Luko queried, ‘Ah … yes.’
‘You know about the graveyard?’ Hassan asked.
Luko pursed his lips for a moment as if considering what to say. ‘I have heard much of it. A strange place, no? They say it is connected with old stories. They say it was once the headquarters of the Dark Wheel …’
Hassan frowned. ‘The Dark Wheel? Aren’t they a faction in Shinrarta Dezhra?’
Luko chuckled.
‘Somehow I think they are not related,’ Luko said. ‘Hmmm … Life, she saw, hope.”

Such is the peril in searching in a rush - Sack-cloth and begging bowl for me

There certainly isnt anything to be found where the orbital wreckyard should be, or anywhere else - I did scour it several times, and for some reason (THS campaign) I cant seem to escape the place.

Good work !

PS the irony, that Luko was TDW all along - poor Hassan - so naive
