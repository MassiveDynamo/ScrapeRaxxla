Joker's Deck - then there's the association with the Tarot in that it also consists of four suits each with knave, king, queen and ace. According to some (misguided individuals), there's the occult link with the word tarot itself - Tora being law (Pentateuch/first 5 books of the bible (implied because early deck 'major aracana' trump cards were ascribed with a Hewbrew letter)) being an anagram of Rota (Latin wheel/turning) which when joined up moving left and character-wrapping from 'T' (T > A > R > O > T) reads tarot (borrowing from the same word group itself) with the final 'T' to make a wheel).

However, for myself making this association from Joker's Deck to try and 'find' an association with a 'Wheel' from the paragraph immediately above (Deck of Cards > Tarot > anagram = 'ROTA' = 'wheel') is too far-fetched and would be outside of the typical sanity and positive mental health of any normal person or player. I mention it because it's the first thing I thought (proves I am not all there!) and that sometimes, digging for these clues will take you down any old rabbit hole...

I blame for giving me the idea in the first place!

(POST EDIT: and that's before we even to talk about the joker!)

What have I done!? Sorry friend. Hopefully you at least enjoyed the dive down the rabbit hole.
