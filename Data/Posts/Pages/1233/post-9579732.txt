Mmm, heavy Thargoid invasion just as Colonia Bridge completed. Hardly a coincidence!
Methinks we’ll lose the bubble fairly soon, humanity will migrate to Colonia (with The Club ferrying the wealthy elite to FRift, Conflux & Hawking’s Gap perhaps? Unless FD dont want to complete Drew’s plotline).

Think we’ll have to find Raxxla-in-the-bubble soon, or be denied by goid hyperdictions!
