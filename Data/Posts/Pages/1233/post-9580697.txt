Seem to remember “Calico Jack” was a famous pirate, and this character’s history is murky.

Joker’s Deck sounds like a pack of playing cards, four card suits, one of which is Clubs. So I suspect these articles are hints that these characters are all members of The Club. The Club are ultra wealthy and consider themselves of elite social status, they use financial and media manipulation to control the population, and it seems likely that they would also promote use of “recreational drugs”, especially one that seems to be engineered to act as a trapdoor for other substances to be passed into the population when someone decides to do so. Possibly hexedit so the hoi polloi will be ordered to mindlessly fight the invading Thargoids while The Club make their escape.

Joker’s Deck reported wealth and status would tend to support this interpretation. I suspect they’ll soon be boarding Torval’s megaships enroute to FRift/Gap/Conflux in order to escape the coming Thargoid invasion.

P.S. I suspect the stolen valuable item will be an old playing card- the Ace of Clubs.
