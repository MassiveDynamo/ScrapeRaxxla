I’m going slightly batty. I know Drew posted recently a couple of links to two fan fiction books that, I think, he said carried on with the Salomé storyline & he recommended them. I downloaded them into my iPad iBooks. Now they’ve disappeared from my iPad (happens occasionally!) & I can’t find his post (thought it was in this thread) or the links.

Have I been hexedited?
Anyone got the links?

UnHexEdit: Ah, found them. Links on Drew’s site. Legacy of Salomé by M Lehman, books 1 & 2
