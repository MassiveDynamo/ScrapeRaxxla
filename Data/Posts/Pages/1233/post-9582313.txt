Doh!
For some reason I’ve always thought the spiky-haired woman in Premonition who gave the speech about TDW operating as a “loose conglomerate... wheels within wheels...TDW in SD is a useful front to hide the true Wheel” was Alessia Verde, Luko’s daughter...
But just re-reading Holdstock’s TDW (it’s blowing a gale outside, the copawlot is going to have to wait till this afternoon for his EVA!)...”She was quite small. Her skin was olive, her eyes dark. She wore her hair in a fashionable series of spikes, like a porcupine...’Trader Fields', she said, and touched the heel of her right hand to her left shoulder by way of salute. 'My given name is Elyssia. Elyssia Fields.' She smiled again. 'My brood mother's little joke.”
