I think you're speaking of another method to catch them.
I'm just questioning "if we drop out correctly sometimes" if the signal is flying away from us, to ensure having a higher chance at actually dropping out at something.
When we had 'runaway signals' it was clear that the stations / objects just kept flying away from us if we couldn't "arrest the signal" when in supercruise. I know, those were bugs, but I always wait until "the signal has been arrested" so to speak.
