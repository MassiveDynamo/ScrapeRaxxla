Yes the 64bit ID is the number in "SystemAdress".
To go to Halley's comet:
Go to SOL (else it won't work)
Open Galmap and enter in search bar "Wregoe AC-D d12-22020096" without quotes.
If it is far, use scanner to target it (concentrated signal sources, at right of unidentified signal sources frequencies)
IF you have a spuercruise assist, you can go in without having to do a loop of shame.

For Pareco, I'll post after finishing the listing of comets in the system Medusa (28 comets for the moment, heading to the 29th...)

This is interesting indeed.
Worthy note: You may have to get within 100km (fly slow) to be to get within it's influence. Otherwise it will just behave as any other 'runway zones' (like planets/statiosn that was bugged when you cant catch their influence zones)

As with the 'blue permit to drop', where the game indicates that you should be able to drop out on a POI like this, there has been bugs in the past when you did not drop ot at the correct location.

Just in case this is just one of the factors for finding anything in space:
- You can observe if you catch the influence and have a high chance of ending up in the correct drop zone if the Signal stops moving away from you.
Then you should be at the true designated drop-out zone. (Not that we expect to find comets, but who knows what else)
