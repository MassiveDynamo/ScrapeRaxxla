Yes the 64bit ID is the number in "SystemAdress".
To go to Halley's comet:
Go to SOL (else it won't work)
Open Galmap and enter in search bar "Wregoe AC-D d12-22020096" without quotes.
If it is far, use scanner to target it (concentrated signal sources, at right of unidentified signal sources frequencies)
IF you have a spuercruise assist, you can go in without having to do a loop of shame.

For Pareco, I'll post after finishing the listing of comets in the system Medusa (28 comets for the moment, heading to the 29th...)

Mmm, thanks but I’m no programmer!
What I dont understand is how to go from the body you’re trying to select, in this case “Halley’s Comet” , to “Wregoe AC-D d12-22020096”, and how you calculate this string for any other body of interest.
Why can’t you just type into the search bar “Halley’s Comet” or the body ID (10477373803 for Sol+21 for Halley’s Comet=10477373824, https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-9726705).
Apparently you can enter ”Halley’s Comet”, but I don’t know if it is then targeted if you enter the system https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-9590496).

Mind I’ve not yet tried any of this ingame!

Edit: mmm, looking at http://disc.thargoid.space/ID64, the bodyID is the most significant 9 bits of the ID64, not the least significant as I’d assumed.
