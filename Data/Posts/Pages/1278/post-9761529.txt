I was one of the first Elite in Exploration according to back then however Fdev would have to confirm as that's only going by Out of game tools and posts which not every player was using, Onepercent was first triple and won the 10k prize for it
Well, when was that?
I was harking back to what DW reported - that DB had said something like “we know where Raxxla is and why it hasnt been found yet” (although DW only said it the once & no corroboration as far as I know). If true it might mean that nobody had at that time got the Elite rank needed to gain entry to Shinrarta, where I suspect the next clue might be.

Edit: actually first one player to Elite might well have been reported in the Newsletter!
And have they stopped producing them? Cant remember when I last received one!
