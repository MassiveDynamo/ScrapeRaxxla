Comets get at least a position from StellarForge but are not in Game. We can figure out were StellarForge would have put them and drop there.
The BodyType: SmallBody is not in the Journal Spec probably cause they not in game.

Since Frontier decided to not put Small Bodys in Journal Spec, despite the Type exists. Makes me curious about Star Description: X (=exotic) again. I have scratched that from my mind because i thought it's simply not in Game.
Now we have a BodyType that is not in game and also not in journal Spec. i start to believe again, there may be at least one Star of Type X somewhere out there. And Rouge Planets as well.

So to my latest experiment:
I will repeat that, but this time i will sell the Data to TDW while docked with a breached canopy. Since the Game apparently makes a difference.
Any idea how i can crack my canopy open, without killing myself?

Is there any third party tool that will highlight when we enter a system with such body types as X (exotic star) or SmallBody (comet)? Was hoping EDDiscovery or Elite Observatory would, but now think they wonâ€™t.
