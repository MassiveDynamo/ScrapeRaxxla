Zuara was attempted brute forced and then given up by most until a virtual arrow was drawn, think someone got pretty close to the right system but an inch is as good a mile in these cases.

Jacques was found through a player noticing / filtering for 'human' in the GalMap and spotting the anomaly of a system in the middle of nowhere and went to investigate. Fdev admitted this was never meant to happen and removed the 'human' feature from undiscovered or something anyway to make sure it didnt spoiler future events. There was a whole GalNet storyline planned with clues to lead to Jacques but it all got cut after it was found.

Raxxla, where do we start brute forcing? Turning the Wheel is the best attempt at anything in this direction so far, in that Dark Wheel may be connected to Raxxla in some way, not like give you a map but more rumours or something.

Whats the advice for travellers? KGBFOAM, so hide it in a LYT binary with A secondary, not sure where CRANE comes in yet though

i was about to disagree about the human filter but i voided my own argument when i realized you meant previously undiscovered by anyone not just the one using it. I've found a lot of stations out in the black using that filter but they were already previously discovered
