This is the first part, where I reached out to her



Dh397 âš’Today at 21:16
ok, some one trying to tell me about the same CMDR


CMDR ThomasovToday at 21:17
She made her way to Nuenets and then went offline


FunyarinpaToday at 21:17
Hm, saw she was online. They were in Anyanway last I checked


CMDR Samantha SteeleToday at 21:17
Were you in Open?


CMDR ThomasovToday at 21:17
She's significant in the whole Salome saga, so not sure where / if she fits into Raxxla


leaderofstarsToday at 21:17
send the dark wheel to nuenets


aaron madridToday at 21:17
What did she say after telling us that the wheel has to turn?


CMDR ThomasovToday at 21:17
Yes - in open


CMDR Samantha SteeleToday at 21:18
Nuenets has that whole description about having a dark secret.


CMDR ThomasovToday at 21:18
Yes, Anyanwau then jumped to Nuenets
CMDR Samantha SteeleToday at 21:18
So, yeah, move TDW there and to Skeggi O, those two have weird system descriptions.

CMDR ThomasovToday at 21:19
Nothing - I thought that was all I was likely to get
CMDR Samantha SteeleToday at 21:19
They're a single jump from Shinrarta.
[21:21]
I'm a skeptic, IRL. I look for all of the reasons not to believe something, and weigh all of those things. This seems like someone picked the name, either because of Wagnar's stream thing, o because of the hype around what we're doing, and they're trying to Role-play, or troll people. That's what my skeptical instincts tell me.


[21:21]
But, that's me. I try not to run away with hype if I can help it
aaron madridToday at 21:21
I think we have to follow this lead
VulpinautToday at 21:22
is there a player lookup for Elite


Kai ZenToday at 21:22
So I think the spelling is off. I think the account is supposed to be Alissia Verdi therefore probably troll. to be clear not saying the troll is you @Cmdr Thomasov but someone.


CMDR ThomasovToday at 21:22
I don't know enough about it all (despite being a 1986 er) but i think it's definitely someone at fDev


Kai ZenToday at 21:22
wait


[21:22]
nope getting clarification the spelling might be correct
[21:23]
if so it's note Frontier employee but a Drew Wagar account
VulpinautToday at 21:23
if it was a brand new account after the stream, it probably wouldn't be in Nuenets yet, right? It takes at least a few hours of playing to get out of beginner baby space
Kai ZenToday at 21:23
(that was originaly created by Frontier)
CMDR ThomasovToday at 21:23
He's on holiday now (unless he was going to Apain ...)
CMDR Lord_Bear420 [NEWP]Today at 21:23
You'll see guys, it'll all lead us to Old Pink


CMDR ThomasovToday at 21:23
*Spain


EnragedRabisuToday at 21:24
There's really nothing stopping you from leaving beginner space immediately, afaik.


VulpinautToday at 21:24
don't you have to grind that first mission to get a permit out or no?


[21:24]
i forget how it works


CMDR ThomasovToday at 21:25
If it is DW, the account was already live - I searched as soon ass he said it on stream,


Kai ZenToday at 21:25
ok got confirmation that spelling of the name IS the Drew Wagar controlled account that was created by Frontier for lore purposes...

happening status: IT'S
leaderofstarsToday at 21:25
i guess they did this because we started expanding TDW's area of control

EnragedRabisuToday at 21:26
You start with a permit to beginner space, you lose it if you have a rank and land in a station in a non-beginner system. You don't need a permit to leave.
CMDR ThomasovToday at 21:26
Bear in mind, she didn't say anything about Nuenets; she just went there and logged off
aaron madridToday at 21:27
But maybe we should see if we get anything by getting the dark wheel there
CMDR ThomasovToday at 21:27
I thought she was heading to SD; so I made my way here and waited ...


[21:27]
Heading to Neumann camp to drop a load of lore toure data off


CMDR DJ_WylieToday at 21:28
Wow just reading. This is awesome


Kai ZenToday at 21:28
it is quite interesting
