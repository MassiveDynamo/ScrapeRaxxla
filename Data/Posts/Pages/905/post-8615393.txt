EDSM database says that there are 54,903,885 systems stored. You honestly want to tell me something can be organized to revisit all these systems? Keep in mind that in each of these the bodies have to be surface scanned if not already done so and they all are all across the galaxy. I couldn't even imagine how to plan such a thing and what sectors to assign to which player. Hell not even me who really likes to find RAXXLA would even think to participate in this. Also the problem that EDSM doesn't contain all the visited systems since not all players use(ed) EDSM all the time. Especially console players don't have that option AFAIK. So tell me how in you humble opinion is a community gonna achieve this? All these expeditions and other events you mentioned are nothing compared to such a task and it would take much longer then the period this game was played already.
Console players can use EDSM. I play PS4 and use EDSM.
