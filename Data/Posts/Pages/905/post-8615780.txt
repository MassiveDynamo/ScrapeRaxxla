@Emperor.
Mate, you’ve duplicated one quite long post, and then posted another very long post containing a whole series of comments on Drew Wagar’s TDW stream/video. Drew does not know anything about Raxxla and has said so (though he has some theories, like all of us here), none of the book authors do-FD reserved Raxxla for themselves and gave the authors zero information on it, hence none of Drew’s character creations know anything about Raxxla. That stream of Drew’s was a bit of fun and is totally irrelevant to our Quest.
