I did some research on galaxy's that had collided with our own some time back after a program by Prof Cox, i became facinated with the thought our Sol system may be from another part of the Universe, why have i got Kapteyn's Star written on my note pad

Sol's neighborhood is a very weird little corner of the galaxy. You may want to check the link I posted about Omega Centauri globular cluster ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Centauri ). The part of the article referencing the globular cluster's mention in fictional works had Kapteyn's Star being ejected from Omega Centauri. Kapteyn's Star is also very old having one of the older planets humans have discovered.
