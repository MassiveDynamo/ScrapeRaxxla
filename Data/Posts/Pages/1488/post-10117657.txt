A reminder from "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide"... We know EXACTLY what RAXXLA is, where it is, how to use for short-range travels, etc. It is increasing the design specs to be Intergalactic that has proven problematic - because the Oisir-Raxxlans screwed up. We reverse-engineered the whole damn thing and that is why we have Hyperspace. It doesn't look alien because humanity finished the design. Because this started going badly for the Oisir-Raxxlans in Egypt on Earth. You really think it coincidence that Primary Transport Authority is in Sol ( https://inara.cz/elite/station/151948/ )..

The components which amount to the following:
-Artificial power sources
-Artificial structures
-Surface installations
-Orbital installation
-Massive antenna at rear of large stations
-Massive antenna on outposts
-Triple solar panel looking antenna at surface ports
-Radio antenna at some surface ports and installations
-Large Dome buildings on fringes of small surface ports and the much larger stadium style surface ports.

RAXXLA looks human because we built it after the Oisir-Raxxlan task ship misbuilt the pyramids and a few other ancient monoliths.

It is spread across the Bubble in both inhabited and older uninhabited systems. It further seems to be aimed at a globular cluster in the Milky Way. We just reverse-engineered it and fixed the misbuilt portions.



So, do you want to help make Faraway (aka Talmor Lens) Intergalactic once more? We finished building it, we can very clearly upgrade it. I stand by the assertion that the globular cluster in question is very likely Omega Centauri (visible from Earth and largest globular cluster in the galaxy). It is thought to be a smaller galaxy's core the Milky Way Galaxy absorbed (more info: ).

I did some research on galaxy's that had collided with our own some time back after a program by Prof Cox, i became facinated with the thought our Sol system may be from another part of the Universe, why have i got Kapteyn's Star written on my note pad
