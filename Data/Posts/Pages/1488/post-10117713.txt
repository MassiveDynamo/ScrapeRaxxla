Do you guys ever notice that? Look a lot like spiraling stars to me, what do you think?

This logo is on some buildings that happen to have the Raxxla logo on their "antenna" pointing to the sky

Interestingly, these buildings come in pair with their respective antenna pointing in opposition Janus-Style (a FROM to a DESTINATION?)

Furthermore, there's numeral codes on them and it is possible that they form a path toward... something...
See below, on a side the marking AR 9 is normal, on the other side it is mirrored (sorry, forgot to hide the UI)





It could be a tip about a method for reading... something presented mirrored.
There's a station number on the building. This is Station 23. It would be interesting to see if others are different and if a sequence can be found.

And finally, there are strange sounds when positioning the ship directly behind the antenna at very close range ( a few meters).
There could be something.

Hot or not?
