Unfortunately FD has commented upon tip offs in that they are not linked to Raxxla (in this thread).

FD described them as just ‘a nice added thank you’ to players who assist a system continually, the mysterious stranger equally was described as not being nothing more than that.

A saddening bore considering.

More so is the fact FD continually fails to communicate with their community on what certain things do/don’t do, leading to speculation.

They talk of environmental story telling, but fail to apply it were it seems the most logical, never the less, such information does not rule these hypotheses out!

Such insight was obtained from Support, who have been identified as not holding all the cards, such information was ever only obtained from cross examination, forcing them to seek intervention from a Developer.

It’s still likely said Devs only give out limited information, if there was a culture of counter intelligence - to distract us away from Raxxla (!) then it would not be outside the realms of possibility…however, considering this is a game and content costs money, FD should want us to find it (unless it’s not that special). So take my ramblings with a pinch of salt.
