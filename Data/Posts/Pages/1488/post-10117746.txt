It is c class 2394 on the picture however
I haven't looked enough to be honest. However, AR-9 was a type of bi-directional radio ( https://www.qsl.net/k5dh/raytheon/ar9.html ).

Class C appears to indicate this device is involved with traffic into/out of the port ( https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/chap7_section_8.html ).
