Yes.

In the same way that the installation Prime Transport Bureau is in HIP98621

Installation names are entirely procedural - they aren't even unique. You cant read anything in to them at all. In addition they were not in the game until quite late (same time as CQC was added).

You only hook on the one in Sol, becuase its SOL. the above is just as significant a name for your theory. This is te same thinking that thinks 3 6s in a row is unusual - its no more unusual than any other random set of 3 numbers.

Because Raxxla and Earth are fundamentally linked (don't understand why people like to ignore that detail). Though, the way it described by Holdstock would allow for installations being way out. I know one of the multiple blackhole systems nearest the Bubble had a comms orbital installation. I was merely mentioning it because both "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" and "The Dark Wheel" by Holdstock make repeated references to Sol and especially Earth. Even Lavian Brandy in-game description mentioned oak barrels from Earth. The only reason Sol wasn't on the map in the first game other than IRL technical issues is certain parties edited it off the map.
