You really think it coincidence that Primary Transport Authority is in Sol ( https://inara.cz/elite/station/151948/ )..
Yes.

In the same way that the installation Prime Transport Bureau is in HIP98621

Installation names are entirely procedural - they aren't even unique. You cant read anything in to them at all. In addition they were not in the game until quite late (same time as CQC was added).

You only hook on the one in Sol, becuase its SOL. the above is just as significant a name for your theory. This is the same thinking that thinks 3 6s on dice in a row is unusual - its no more unusual than any other random set of 3 numbers.
