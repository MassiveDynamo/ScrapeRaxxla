I been working with Odd ball factions that are not player base factions and way outside the bubble just to gain rep with them. Some I can't do missions for due to rep problems as all missions are locked until I reach friendly and spent a lot of time waiting for the mission recycling from each faction.

As of now I can't raise rep with The Associates, Invisible Slayers, Black Rock Military, and Black Rock Gang. And will remain as neutral if I can figure out who they really are attached too.
Then do bounty hunting. When I was being heavily pestered by a pirate out in Seagull Sector near Hell Port (after collecting some Trinkets) I eventually got fed up and destroyed him. That got me cordial with Black Rock Military (and a bounty which I cashed in at an Interstellar Factor once back in the bubble), though I dont think I got the rep increase until I cashed it in..
