get any yet?
I have 20, stolen
They’re always stolen. Piracy is the only way you can get them AFAIK. There were rumours a few years ago that they could be found occasionally in signal sources, but not heard of any like that for a long time, & it could have referred to Convoy signal sources-apparently some explorer convoys had them. You’d still have to commit piracy!

Edit: this is one of the things that makes me suspect Trinkets &/or SAP8 are relevant to unlocking the omphalos rift to achieve travel to Raxxla- the TDW description of ‘adventurers and treasure hunters’ could be read as pirates. I suspect this was the message behind the long-deleted SD E/F missions. In the 15th & 16th Centuries pirates were sometimes termed “Gentlemen Adventurers”

And this is Elite Dangerous!
