I went to Neumann Camp, a settlement on Shinrarta Dezhra AB 2 H just to see what the deal is ( I just got my Triple Elite just now). This settlement I know is fully controlled by The Dark Wheel (presumably not the real one) the faction is in Outbreak. I check the system status of Shinrarta cause I never seen it in status before. Then I went ahead and check LFT 926 another place they have control over again this system isn't in Outbreak it's only in Civil Unrest.

So where the heck are they getting Outbreak status from?

Edit: I get the feeling Shinrarta is just bugged and doesn't want to update it's status.

Status isn’t system wide anymore but is owned individually by the various factions who have a control port in the system. So TDW can be in outbrake in SD when no one else is. I too was checking out their planet base since they’re the controlling faction. Nothing yet but I did a little work for them to get allied and also get them out of outbrake. We’ll see what happens.
