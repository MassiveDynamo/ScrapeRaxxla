Something I just noticed that may give is a better idea where or how far to look for TDW, and therefore Raxxla. There’s an Ad at the stations for Brewer, apparently the manufacturers of the Orbis style stations, and it says “Brewer, Looking down on worlds since 3100” with a very odd,possibly early Orbis station as the picture (looks much like the one in TDW codex entry). So if they’re in an Orbis style station left disused by someone else, as seems to be the case, that would mean they couldn’t have been in it before 3100 yeah?

This sort of info should be documented so it’s a little more obvious, thanks! But the Raxxla rumour has been around since before that date so it can’t be an Orbis.

However it might be an early Ocellus. Wiki says “Modern Coriolis stations are cuboctahedrons with a 2-kilometer diameter. When it was first introduced by GalCop, the design had a much smaller diameter of 1 kilometer, but beginning in the 3200's the size was increased.” “Modern Coriolis” implies there was at least one earlier version. This might fit the design shown in the Raxxla codex entry. Galcop was the era of the original game, so way back (edit: GALCOP arose on 2696 & dissolved in 3174, so that is the potential timeline for an “early ocellus” station type).

I think TDW hidden station is an orbis design which “originated during the early years of the Federation” (established 2242) “and persisted over the centuries with minimal changes”. It is clearly a wheel shape
