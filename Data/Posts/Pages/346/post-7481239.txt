What about star system not displayed in navigation panel / galaxy map? Time to travel to old systems and check sky map for star not in galaxy map? And if such star really exists travel to it without hyperspace jump?

That’s my idea. Those systems are unlisted so we can’t select them and investigate. There should be hundreds if not thousands of stars in the sky so it’s really hard to eyeball if some of them is missing on the galmap. And if Raxxla is a rogue planet (or on it / in an orbit around) it is impossible to see it with naked eye, even with telescopes. Those systems should require a special permit or high wake scan like action to be added on your map.
