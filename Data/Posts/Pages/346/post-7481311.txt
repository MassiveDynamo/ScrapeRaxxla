After reading "And Here the Wheel", i think we can safely say that the Soontill system is the correct system and Soontil 1 is THE Soontill. The "space fog" around the planet seen in the book was an instillation disguise wrapped around the whole planet. One of the many examples of technology the CIEP developed (themselves or through the services of other parties) to aid in their endeavors of political manipulations. Said instillation was likely removed or destroyed after Soontill's destruction.

The only remaining issue is that Soontill is implied to be a former Thargoid hive, which implies it was an ammonia world, and while there is still ammonia in its atmosphere, its physical location so close to its host star calls that detail highly into suspect.

Yes but iirc in And Here The Wheel the Soontill system is described as being a brown dwarf system, and Soontill 1 is 2au from the star with an asteroid belt between it and the star. Soontill in game is a class M Red Dearf and Soontill 1 is only 18ls from the star (instead of the 998 in the book) and thereâ€™s no asteroid belt between. Also, Soontill was somewhere on the way between Grandmort and the circle attack route. But Soontill in game is in the opposite direction of that.
As a Thargoid world, it should be cold and low G, in a system with an ammonia world or ammonia gas giant. None of these things describe the in game Soontill.
