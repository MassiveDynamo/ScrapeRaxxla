Hmm, I recently saw a movie about a similar search for a semi-mythical game object.

Has anyone tried flying through witchspace backwards?
Also, is there any virtual library that documents all of David Braben's personal interests & day-to-day interactions we could look through?

I feel like if we just knew what his favorite 1980s TV shows were, we could crack this puzzle wide open!

[where is it]

Also, the center of the Raxxla symbol is a circle with a dot in it.
Wikipedia calls it the Circumpuct, and apparently it's been used a symbol for .

It could be: our solar system ('Sol'), our sun itself (the main star of the Sol system), any solar system in general, gold, the egyptian god Ra and maybe Hydrogen.
I delivered ~780 tons of Gold to Sol > M. Gorbachev [its importing gold and it's orbiting the 3rd planet of Sol], and Ra > LeConte Dock [also importing gold, orbiting the 3rd planet of Ra].

Nothing happened...

Well, given that it really looks like a sun cross or solar wheel which usually incoperates a circumpunct. Sonnenkreuz In German. There are different versions throughout history depending on what was to be represented, 4 spokes for NSEW, or 6 spikes to include equinoxes, more spokes still for other reasons. The six spokes ones leave the center hexagonal with a circle dot in the middle

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_cross See the archaeological record section for a picture that includes an example of one.
