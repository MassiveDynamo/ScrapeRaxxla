Don't have anything new to add, sorry. But here's a stray thought: from the beginning, players searching for Raxxla have been looking for a celestial object, right? Planet most likely, maybe black hole. Because the tools available from release have been just the map and the basic / adv. scanner.

So with players looking for a planet since the beginning, how come the devs say "You don't know what it is" after a couple years of searching?

I mean, then it can't be a planet, right?
