But even assuming the Soontill in game is the actual Soontill, and the base is destroyed. There should be other CIEP bases, abandoned, to find. Which may give us some information on their current whereabouts and perhaps information on TDW. Has a CIEP base ever been found? I have noticed that the vast majority of bodies in that area (grandmort, Lanaest, Brohman etc) are not mapped. Perhaps thereâ€™s something there to find
