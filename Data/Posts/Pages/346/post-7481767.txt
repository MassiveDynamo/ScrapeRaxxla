Hmm, I recently saw a movie about a similar search for a semi-mythical game object.

Has anyone tried flying through witchspace backwards?
Also, is there any virtual library that documents all of David Braben's personal interests & day-to-day interactions we could look through?

I feel like if we just knew what his favorite 1980s TV shows were, we could crack this puzzle wide open!

[where is it]

Also, the center of the Raxxla symbol is a circle with a dot in it.
Wikipedia calls it the Circumpuct, and apparently it's been used a symbol for a lot of things.

It could be: our solar system ('Sol'), our sun itself (the main star of the Sol system), any solar system in general, gold, the egyptian god Ra and maybe Hydrogen.
I delivered ~780 tons of Gold to Sol > M. Gorbachev [its importing gold and it's orbiting the 3rd planet of Sol], and Ra > LeConte Dock [also importing gold, orbiting the 3rd planet of Ra].

Nothing happened...
