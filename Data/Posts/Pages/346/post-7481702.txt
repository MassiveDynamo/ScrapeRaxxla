Something I just noticed that may give is a better idea where or how far to look for TDW, and therefore Raxxla. There’s an Ad at the stations for Brewer, apparently the manufacturers of the Orbis style stations, and it says “Brewer, Looking down on worlds since 3100” with a very odd,possibly early Orbis station as the picture (looks much like the one in TDW codex entry). So if they’re in an Orbis style station left disused by someone else, as seems to be the case, that would mean they couldn’t have been in it before 3100 yeah?
