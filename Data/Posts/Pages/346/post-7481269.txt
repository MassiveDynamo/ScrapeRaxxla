I also don’t think Soontill that is in game is the actual Soontill (a ruse set up either by CIEP or TWD to keep their treasure hidden. Unless the description of Soontill was retconned immediately and they don’t bother to mention it to anyone, even their official author).

After reading "And Here the Wheel", i think we can safely say that the Soontill system is the correct system and Soontil 1 is THE Soontill. The "space fog" around the planet seen in the book was an instillation disguise wrapped around the whole planet. One of the many examples of technology the CIEP developed (themselves or through the services of other parties) to aid in their endeavors of political manipulations. Said instillation was likely removed or destroyed after Soontill's destruction.

The only remaining issue is that Soontill is implied to be a former Thargoid hive, which implies it was an ammonia world, and while there is still ammonia in its atmosphere, its physical location so close to its host star calls that detail highly into suspect.
