please for the love of science can we stop thinking that raxxla is behind a permit lock or other such nonsense, having researched raxxla, the formidine rift and other mysterious goings on in ED before ps4 launch. it was said that raxxla is the only planet apart from the core systems that is not procedurally generated (it was placed in a certain spot by FDev) it has been in the game since day one and DOESN'T need any special permits or equipment to get to where it is.

me personally I think that raxxla could one of 2 things either it is a unique looking planet around a very old star near the bubble, and possibly has a large unique station in orbit around it, or then again it could also be a rather bland megaship 3 million light seconds away from a neutron star. only David Braben and a select few others know exactly where and what raxxla is, and until someone can show the proof of finding it then, I for one will keep searching for as long as it takes.

It’s very safe to assume Raxxla is behind a permit locked system. There are many minor factions protect their main systems behind permits, why would Raxxla be so vulnerable? Also we can’t say if it’s in the game from the beginning it should still be accessible with the old mechanics. Formidine Rift story evolved as the game develops and new mechanics were added as the game progresses. I hope Raxxla is not a Coriolis station you can just safe disengage.

After Horizons it might be put down to a planet/moon surface and if we can’t find it by then, they may relocate it on an atmospheric planet.


BTW Is there any updates on that “Rogue Planet systems”? They are in the game files but none discovered ever as far as I’m aware of.
