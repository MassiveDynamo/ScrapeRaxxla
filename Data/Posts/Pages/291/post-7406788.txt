Well... technically it’s not going to be possible for anyone to prove that your memory is wrong. Also, your memory might be right, but the person who said it might have been wrong. What I will say though is I have seen the same kind of stuff many times and it’s always been someone who’s mixing up things Drew said about the FR mystery with things about Raxxla, or mixing them up with something else entirely.

The rumor of Raxxla's honked status is old and has never been confirmed. Not that it's even important at this stage.

We can not assume that Raxxla can be found by regular exploring(scanning). It's possible that it can be found that way but, Raxxla could well be in a highly trafficked system. We have no idea of the level of obfuscation.

The same goes for permit locks. We can not assume either way. All we know is that some at FD know how to get there(Raxxla). If it's locked, there should be a way to obtain the permit or to bypass it.
