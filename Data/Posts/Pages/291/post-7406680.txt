I'm fairly sure that someone in FD said that the system containing Raxxla had been visited, although this may be misinformation. Michael Brookes definitely said that there was no need for a second galaxy in the game until we have explored all of this one, bit that doesn't rule out the possibility that a star gate might be possible to another distant, possibly otherwise inaccessible location in our galaxy. The Dark Wheel is supposed to have travelled through this portal.... However, I'm not convinced fDev would have put code into the game for this rather niche circumstance. If Raxxla turns out to be an abandoned settlement, well, it would be better to travel in hope than to arrive.
