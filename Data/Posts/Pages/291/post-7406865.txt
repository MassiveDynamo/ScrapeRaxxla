The rumor of Raxxla's honked status is old and has never been confirmed. Not that it's even important at this stage.

We can not assume that Raxxla can be found by regular exploring(scanning). It's possible that it can be found that way but, Raxxla could well be in a highly trafficked system. We have no idea of the level of obfuscation.

The same goes for permit locks. We can not assume either way. All we know is that some at FD know how to get there(Raxxla). If it's locked, there should be a way to obtain the permit or to bypass it.
Exactly. However, I don't even think we're safe to assume that Raxxla is currently accessible through in-game mechanisms. It could, for example, include permit locks which there aren't currently ways to obtain, and which require FD action to lift (we've certainly seen Permit Locks being put in place which there's no known in game way of getting a permit for.)

On the other hand, of course, all it would take to hide it from being inadvertently found currently is for it to not show up as 'Raxxla', particularly if there's an atmospheric world involved.
