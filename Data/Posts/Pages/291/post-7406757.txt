please for the love of science can we stop thinking that raxxla is behind a permit lock or other such nonsense, having researched raxxla, the formidine rift and other mysterious goings on in ED before ps4 launch. it was said that raxxla is the only planet apart from the core systems that is not procedurally generated (it was placed in a certain spot by FDev) it has been in the game since day one and DOESN'T need any special permits or equipment to get to where it is.

Nonsense? How is this nonsense? Cite your sources for this misinformation that you’re spreading because I’m quite positive that no one has ever said this about Raxxla.

Can we also drop the “someone has visited the Raxxla system” rumor as well because that’s all it is is an unsubstantiated rumor.
