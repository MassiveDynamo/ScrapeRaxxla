It’s very safe to assume Raxxla is behind a permit locked system. There are many minor factions protect their main systems behind permits, why would Raxxla be so vulnerable? Also we can’t say if it’s in the game from the beginning it should still be accessible with the old mechanics. Formidine Rift story evolved as the game develops and new mechanics were added as the game progresses. I hope Raxxla is not a Coriolis station you can just safe disengage.

After Horizons it might be put down to a planet/moon surface and if we can’t find it by then, they may relocate it on an atmospheric planet.


BTW Is there any updates on that “Rogue Planet systems”? They are in the game files but none discovered ever as far as I’m aware of.

Yes, exactly this. All the circumstantial evidence points to Raxxla being permit locked somewhere. My guesses are in the Col 70 sector or Polaris. The rumor of Raxxla has been around since the very earliest days of interstellar travel which means it’s either in the Bubble or not very far outside it. If that’s the case then it’s very likely that someone would have stumbled across it by now, as the vast majority of the Bubble systems have been discovered. Same goes for much of the systems going out to the Pleiades.

Also, I doubt that they wanted Raxxla to be discovered before it was “ready” to be discovered. Hence tossing a permit lock on the system it’s in to safeguard against this.

I suspect that they want the new discovery scanner system to play a role in its discovery as well. Why add the Codex with a Raxxla entry at the same time as adding the new discovery scanner mini game system? This is just a hunch of course but I think it will play a role.
