unfortunately I can not remember which website/youtube vid/thread I had read it as it was almost 1 and a half years ago, but the information is out there and I am just passing on what I remember seeing and/or reading. I am sure someone out there will either prove my memory wrong or not.
Well... technically it’s not going to be possible for anyone to prove that your memory is wrong. Also, your memory might be right, but the person who said it might have been wrong. What I will say though is I have seen the same kind of stuff many times and it’s always been someone who’s mixing up things Drew said about the FR mystery with things about Raxxla, or mixing them up with something else entirely.
