It’s very safe to assume Raxxla is behind a permit locked system. There are many minor factions protect their main systems behind permits, why would Raxxla be so vulnerable? Also we can’t say if it’s in the game from the beginning it should still be accessible with the old mechanics. Formidine Rift story evolved as the game develops and new mechanics were added as the game progresses. I hope Raxxla is not a Coriolis station you can just safe disengage.

After Horizons it might be put down to a planet/moon surface and if we can’t find it by then, they may relocate it on an atmospheric planet.


BTW Is there any updates on that “Rogue Planet systems”? They are in the game files but none discovered ever as far as I’m aware of.

Can’t permit lock something you don’t know where is.
