You still remember those days being harmless, in that loan-sidewinder? Tanya would ask you to haul some cargo from Romanek's Folly, likely to see if you can jump into witchspace without passing out, I guess she had some other reasons too. You were instructed to choose the arrival system from contacts panel and go there, but, however you could check galaxy map also. And that map looked almost as if it was pointing somewhere, like a treasure map. Not the kind of galaxy map that opens up from where you are.

Now it probably means nothing, and you shouldn't take it too seriously, but I guess it wouldn't hurt to scan a few systems, since many of you are exploring around there these days anyway.
