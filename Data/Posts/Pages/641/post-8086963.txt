I did have a theory that Hawkins Gap INRA were on the way back from wherever they had been but they (Alpha - Beta etc) weren't in a geographical route order so that fazed out

I think its probably all we are going to find until late 2020 tbh but that shouldn't stop us looking

Project Dynasty & associated bases in Formidine Rift, Hawking’s Gap and Conflux were much later than, & not (necessarily) associated with INRA. I add the proviso because we know very little about The Club who were behind Project Dynasty and it’s possible they are the current representation of the shadowy power base that underpinned INRA; or perhaps INRA morphed into The Club.
