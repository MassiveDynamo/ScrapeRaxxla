You know that dark planet with the rings looks exactly like the one in the background of his picture. Or do we already know it's the same one?! Is there another planet with rings near it?

Maybe I'm seeing things.
Well these are definitly two areas in space. So, it's not like it's a random unsearchable idea. I'm not personally going to such areas until carriers are out though.

Ye, looks same, especially when approach and see shadow in cruise. Howewer it is some Y/T dwarf on his screen. Btw ...that might mean need to find massive star so dwarf orbits it. I doubt dwarf as main star could have rings.
