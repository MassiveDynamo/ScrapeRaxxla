You know that dark planet with the rings looks exactly like the one in the background of his picture. Or do we already know it's the same one?! Is there another planet with rings near it?

Maybe I'm seeing things.

Yes, you seem very keen on this so you should definitely go and check it out.
Personally I’m pretty sure it’s (yet another) hoax for several reasons, but you might just find something else if you don’t find Raxxla.
Well these are definitly two areas in space. So, it's not like it's a random unsearchable idea. I'm not personally going to such areas until carriers are out though.
