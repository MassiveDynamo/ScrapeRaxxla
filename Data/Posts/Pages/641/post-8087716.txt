I think I've seen dwarfs with rings. I thought all could. It might have been in odd 2mass or other systems though and not a main star. Although I think I've seen main stars also. Given the distance it's probably an odd system with extra stars. Not many double ring planets that near a dwarf star with rings.

Any idea what the object up and to the left of the planet is? I canâ€™t get a good look at it.
I'm assuming it might be the planet you were on. Did the dwarf star with ring exist close to it?

I also wonder what he meant by raxxla not being a planet or system.
