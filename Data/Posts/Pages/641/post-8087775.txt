I think I've seen dwarfs with rings. I thought all could. It might have been in odd 2mass or other systems though and not a main star. Although I think I've seen main stars also. Given the distance it's probably an odd system with extra stars. Not many double ring planets that near a dwarf star with rings.

I'm assuming it might be the planet you were on. Did the dwarf star with ring exist close to it?

I also wonder what he meant by raxxla not being a planet or system.
Nah, that screen is 33000ly from supposed destination. Just looks similar, and system didn't have any dwarfs.
