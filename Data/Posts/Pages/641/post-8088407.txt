You know that dark planet with the rings looks exactly like the one in the background of his picture. Or do we already know it's the same one?! Is there another planet with rings near it?

Maybe I'm seeing things.
Well these are definitly two areas in space. So, it's not like it's a random unsearchable idea. I'm not personally going to such areas until carriers are out though.

This mathmoss stuff really peaked my interest, as I do feel that this could be definitely plausible. I was debating on jumping in the anaconda and heading out that way. It could be true but it does seem kind of fishy. In the quoted pic it seems like it would be meant to imply that the semi-circle in the background could be something special. To me it looks like it could even be some type of gate. however if I look at the pic and turn up the gamma, brightness and contrast, on my monitor the semi-circle object clearly seems to have a square perimeter around it and stands out from the background. Could just be artifacting in the image, but to me it looks more like it was pasted in the image...
