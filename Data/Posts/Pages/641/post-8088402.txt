3. Following the same behavior as dubious claimants before him, mathmoss has claimed to self destructed in order to hide Raxxla out of respect for the game and other explorers. At the same time when he claims his source is a former Fdev developer... that seems pretty contradictory.

Honestly, Im just now reading up about all of this, as I keep getting distracted by life and other games. This part in particular reads much like irl conspiracy theories "I was told all this amazing things by aliens and I wrote it all down, but the government took it all from me so I have no proof that any of my claims are true!" kind of statement. Anyone searching for raxxla and posting the stuff will want to definately grab ahold of and be named for discovering it. They'll want the fame that people would speak tales about far and wide. So, "I self distracted out of respect for other explorers" to me is kind of like saying "I didnt find anything and I dont want you to attach my name to it when you all realize it"

Do we know if this guy did any sort of puzzle or content at all to find this or was just given coordinates? Frankly speaking, I do not think its the kind of easter egg that you will just "Happen upon" otherwise we'd never find it. My Hypothesis has always been that you need to do certain events to trigger something or you wont see it at all.
