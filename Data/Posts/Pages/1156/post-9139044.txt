I am wondering if these FSS signals are, in fact, comets since we have been told (somewhere, havenâ€™t got a reference) that comets are in-game but not visually instanced??
My money is on them all being Thargoid Motherships, which will be turned "on" with the flick of a switch when Odyssey goes live and all the stations in those systems are invaded by Thargoids on foot. Surprise!
