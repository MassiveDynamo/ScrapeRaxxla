The 3 hidden signals in Merope are in the first planet which is a pink-double-ringed gas giant.
I was there trying to pin-point its location but I was not 100% sure what I was looking for because close by there were 2 listening posts... and the hidden signals were in the "asteroid belt" frequency in FSS.
