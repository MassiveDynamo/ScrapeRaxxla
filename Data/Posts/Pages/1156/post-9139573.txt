Are there comets in game now? Or are we talking Odyssey? Or where they were supposed to be or what? Im completely lost
They are and are not. Their gravity is in the game, but there is no physical model.
There are stations orbiting comets but there is nothing there, if you fly to the center of gravity.

There are probably thousands of proc. gen. comets in the game. All invisible.
