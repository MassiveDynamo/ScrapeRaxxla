Agreed. Which is why the (tinfoil for now) theory of cloaked or hidden objects fits for me.
Maia and a few of the other ones I didn't mention by name are further interesting, in that they have NO asteroids, in either field designation OR as a signal in FSSS. And yet, there are mystery signals.
Did you look in Merope?
It has always seemed that there should be something hidden by Thargoids in Merope, but nothing was ever found.
