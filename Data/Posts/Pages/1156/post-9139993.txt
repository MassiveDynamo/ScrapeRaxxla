Ok, just figured out what's the (!) signal at the "Asteroid Belt" FSS range is... "Resource Extraction Sites"
The number of them present in the system matches the number below the (!) signal.
Special attention to Maia system which initially shows 3 (!) signals and the 4th only appear when you FSS scan a gas giant at 367.000ls off... then the count matches all 4.

Having said that, this still has nothing to do with actually missing "Asteroid Belt/Clusters" in New Yembo and Sol... so, the search continues!
