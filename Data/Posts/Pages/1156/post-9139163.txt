I’m confused (may be my age). If these “hidden” signals are seen in the FSS but cannot be located, then how can they be located at the first planet in Merope??

I am wondering if these FSS signals are, in fact, comets since we have been told (somewhere, haven’t got a reference) that comets are in-game but not visually instanced??
Could be comets. They share the icon with Concentrated Signal sources, but are very close(same) to the clusters in frequency.
