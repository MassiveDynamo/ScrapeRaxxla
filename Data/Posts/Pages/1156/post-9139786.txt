There are probably thousands of proc. gen. comets in the game. All invisible.

Were they ever planned to be scoopable or FSD Boosting? May explain the FSD overcharging message we been getting randomly or the 'Slow Down' message in middle of nowhere that implies a gravity well with no body? Ive seen it too many times to be a one off something so wondering if these missing Comets are the cause and too far from Pareco right now to check what happens when get near it.
