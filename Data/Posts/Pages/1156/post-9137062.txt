Did you look in Merope?
It has always seemed that there should be something hidden by Thargoids in Merope, but nothing was ever found.
Merope is a little tricky. Once you scan you get 9 asteroids clusters. You need to look before you scan, and you will notice 3 hidden signals. After you have scanned it, it goes RIGHT behind the 9, so it is hard to see/read. But yes, to answer your question.... 3 of them.
