Were they ever planned to be scoopable or FSD Boosting? May explain the FSD overcharging message we been getting randomly or the 'Slow Down' message in middle of nowhere that implies a gravity well with no body? Ive seen it too many times to be a one off something so wondering if these missing Comets are the cause and too far from Pareco right now to check what happens when get near it.
I don’t know. Can’t really remember much talk about them, until the one i Pareco was found.

They are nice for hiding mysterious things in orbit around them though.

Perhaps we should try to find Halsey’s comet? It should pop up in the nav panel, like the one in Pareco.
If it’s in the correct possition like the Voyagers, it should be at about 55% of it’s orbit from the closest point to Sol.

It turns inward at about 35AU
