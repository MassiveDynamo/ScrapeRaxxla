No braben keeps hinting to check station numbers for fed.

But does he? I thought the only mention/allusion to this was when he mentioned "numbered stations" but it has generally become accepted that he meant to say "listening posts." Is there more out there than this? I can't imagine that Federal Station numbers have anything to do with Raxxla.

CMDR Naysayer, out.
