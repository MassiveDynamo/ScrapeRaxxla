No braben keeps hinting to check station numbers for fed. Why do you think there is nothing interesting if it hasn't been mapped. A major hint could be in where the station number are and how they are layed out. It could be a map to the history of how the bubble was mapped out and reveal raxxla or something. If not a massive potential time puzzle that could help with anything. for all we know there are missing station numbers or things that give hints to the bubbles history vital to understanding other puzzles. Same thing with the numbered exploration nodes from transport missions. I don't get how some things in this game are exhaustively followed but others aren't. You don't say there is nothing there unless you do it completely. And you don't then because you can't know if you missed something. That is the whole point.

This is part of the problem. Telling people not to do it when you haven't. This is why nothing is every found in this game.

And why everyone leaves the game who want to. All the naysayers getting in everyones way.
