An idea from the salome thread:

Ceaser cipher:
0: Raxxla
1: Sbyymb
2: Tczznc
3: Udaaod
4: Vebbpe
5: Wfccqf
6: Xgddrg
7: Yheesh
8: Ziffti
9: Ajgguj
10: Bkhhvk
11: Cliiwl
12: Dmjjxm
13: Enkkyn
14: Follzo
15: Gpmmap
16: Hqnnbq
17: Iroocr
18: Jsppds
19: Ktqqet
20: Lurrfu
21: Mvssgv
22: Nwtthw
23: Oxuuix
24: Pyvvjy
25: Qzwwkz

Some of those words could be planets or stations in game.

Did anyone ever organize and exhaustive search for things like station numbers braben repeatedly tells everyone to look at. He keeps hinting at stuff and nobody is listening or doing anything about it. And some that are are so picky that the info they receive isn't perfect nothing will ever get done. People really just need to do things in this game. It's partly the communities fault nobody will just work together and get stuff finished. We have a massive resource like the internet and it's not utilized anymore. If we just put all our heads together it can be done over time easily. And pretty quickly. Just display all info given so it's naturally checked and double checked incase of oddities and do it on a forum post with links to later post or lots of reserve posts. Add websites if needed. But i have not seen a complete one done. Let alone checking for changes over game revisions.

I'm surprised the whole game hasn't been flipped to check these numbers yet. All it takes is people doing it. Doesn't have to be complicated. It just has to be done. People used to enjoy stuff like that in games.
