trouble is that folk have tried everything - all ranks, missions, tipoff - pretty much every mechanic in the game, and no invite.

btw - this lack of progress is visible on all fora - tumble weed everywhere - the community is just out of ideas..

Which is all the obvious stuff.
If it had been ranks/missions then someone would have gotten an invite during gamma. When you've got hundreds of thousands of players, you need to set some pretty obscure criteria otherwise things get found almost immediately.
Bear in mind that the last time FDev tried to run a treasure hunt, the whole thing had been solved before 90% of the playerbase had had time to even log in.
