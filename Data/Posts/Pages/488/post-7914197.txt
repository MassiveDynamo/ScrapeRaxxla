He does not confirm or deny it. He says it's a silly question and Ed says probably. He said Fdev knows where it is, but not that it's in the game. Could just be a screensaver, at the hq. Yeah... we see it every 20 min of inactivity. Or perhaps it's what they call the break room. Lunch time, let's goto Raxxla.
