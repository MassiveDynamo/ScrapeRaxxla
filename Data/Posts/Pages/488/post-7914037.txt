I'm not so sure the Salome storyline has really come to an end. Currently at Prism but will go on to Anumclaw, Teorge and so on. Btw. Denton Patreusâ€˜s Sigil looks alot like a square and compass. He seems to be no fan of the Club. As well as TDW.

If there's nothing I'll follow my Helix theory and go on visiting and mpping those systems.
