I think it's been said elsewhere before by others, but my money is on atmospheric rocky/ice planets first as they will be easiest to simulate. Perhaps further down the line we will have the option to visit water/ammonia worlds but true ELWs with vegetation and what-not will be last on the list, probably coming by end of 2019 or something (optimistic view).

Agreed. I suspect they'll do atmo gas giants first, that was always in the early concept art and DB mentioned that early on as an example of how you could use procedural generation to simulate the clouds and ammo effects. Also that would slot nicely into the new mining revamp. I'd love to see the giant gas mining platforms.

FD had said last year the Raxxla was out there and was accessible as they informed us we would know that we had found it, if we entered the system it was hidden in.

Obviously, many explorers are tackling the problem brute-force, going to the far reaches of the galaxy and scanning down system after system to locate Raxxla based on what FD said. They also said many more Mysteries are out there yet to be discovered.

Do you have the source for that? I've not heard that before. I've heard then say "it's out there and we know where it is", but that's about it, I'd love to know more.
