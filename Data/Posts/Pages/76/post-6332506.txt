I know he's quoting forum posts as I recall seeing the originals in posts from mbrooks and dbraben,
if only there was a way to search their postings.

I'm busy chasing my own rabbit,,, "Run, Spot, run!"

You may of course direct me to the first page! ... Especially if you want to get my hopes up only to dash them mercilessly!

The linked page is just the standard known info - it's in game, FD know where, and there's not going to be any clues. Fyrd Judge was saying something else.
