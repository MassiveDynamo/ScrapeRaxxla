I've noticed that in the livestreams for Beyond they have frequently referenced "personal narrative" - to me, that sounds a lot like they are setting the technical groundwork for a "journey everyone must take for themselves" .

I've noticed this too, it's definitely a deliberate introduction. I'm really excited to see how they flesh the personal narrative out. Elite really deserves it.
