FD had said last year the Raxxla was out there and was accessible as they informed us we would know that we had found it, if we entered the system it was hidden in.

Do you have the source for that? I've not heard that before. I've heard then say "it's out there and we know where it is", but that's about it, I'd love to know more.

Seconded on the request for the source! Haven't heard anything like that so would definitely be interesting to see where it came from!
