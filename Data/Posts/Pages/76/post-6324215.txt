If someone interested : one informant reports 13 Trinkets of Hidden Fortune scavenged from a T7 in Colonia. Credibility: 99%.

Dumb question from a Commander just starting out. I'm sure this has been discussed previously somewhere, but FD has said Raxxla is in the game and can be found, but that doesn't seem to suggest "can be found, right now." Is it possible that Raxxla is currently permit locked?

Yes. Nothing would surprise me coming from the FDevs.
