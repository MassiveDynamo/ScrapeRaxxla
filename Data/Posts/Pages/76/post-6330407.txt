Dumb question from a Commander just starting out. I'm sure this has been discussed previously somewhere, but FD has said Raxxla is in the game and can be found, but that doesn't seem to suggest "can be found, right now." Is it possible that Raxxla is currently permit locked?

FD had said last year the Raxxla was out there and was accessible as they informed us we would know that we had found it, if we entered the system it was hidden in.

Obviously, many explorers are tackling the problem brute-force, going to the far reaches of the galaxy and scanning down system after system to locate Raxxla based on what FD said. They also said many more Mysteries are out there yet to be discovered.
