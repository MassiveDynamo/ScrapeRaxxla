You may of course direct me to the first page! ... Especially if you want to get my hopes up only to dash them mercilessly!

The linked page is just the standard known info - it's in game, FD know where, and there's not going to be any clues. Fyrd Judge was saying something else.

As opposed to if you find it you wont know it? So its the confirmation of if tree fell on your head you would know it you're after.

1 in 400,000,000,000. Doesn't looks so bad just numbers, but how do you feel your odds are of winning megamillions 10,000 times, being struck by lightening 1 million times or getting to bang everyone on your pass list. I didnt do the math but I know its worse than this. Gotta run before Scarlett Jo sobers up,,,
