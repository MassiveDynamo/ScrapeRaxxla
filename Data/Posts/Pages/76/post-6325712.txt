My belief is currently that it's permit locked, or otherwise inaccessible (rogue planet, or time-phasing planet that only appears at certain intervals, etc.).

Simply because I think Raxxla is going to be something big when the game is capable of making it something really special - for example, I believe to really fully experience the awesomeness of Raxxla we're going to need to be able to fly down to it (atmo planet landings) and walk around and explore it (some version of space legs), plus any additional exploration tools they will have added by then to help us find something so illusive - and hopefully better instancing and multiplayer so we can do it with friends. There's no way Fdev will allow Raxxla to be just an ELW with a listening post in orbit.

You may be right. I, for myself, see Raxxla more like an Eastern Egg, intimately tied to Elite lore. Kind of a wink fo Elite connaisseurs. Then, out of the main storyline.
For this, landing or space legs are not obligatory, as Raxxla (lore) is tightly linked to witchspace. Many current game mechanics could allow its finding, as 'Raxxladiction' out of witchspace directly to a planet base, teleportation to a base or portal on a non landable planet when aproaching the limit/glide sequence, etc ... Besides access to a locked or very well hidden system, earned through rep and rank with determined factions/powers.
The mechanics, of course, being able to evolve with landings and space legs as the game evolves, like the lost Conda evolved to the Zurara.
