I think it's been said elsewhere before by others, but my money is on atmospheric rocky/ice planets first as they will be easiest to simulate. Perhaps further down the line we will have the option to visit water/ammonia worlds but true ELWs with vegetation and what-not will be last on the list, probably coming by end of 2019 or something (optimistic view).
