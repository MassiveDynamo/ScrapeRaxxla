Nope. FR thread found the FR. Raxxla thread not yet found Raxxla. The clue's in the name


There's nothing special about NPC Rob Holdstock -I killed him and claimed the bounty once, was disappointingly easy even for my poor combat skills. It was memorable for saying "Receive x bounty for killing the outlaw Rob Holdstock" or similar though, F10ed for posterity somewhere.

Agreed, it’s in the names. FRift thread found the Zurara but there may be more still to be found (has nobody yet ascertained which moderator recently unlocked the thread and plied him with alcohol/hexedit to find out why it was reopened?) but it definitely is focused on FRift/Zurara issues (and Conflux, and Gap, and Dynasty/Exodus plot); Raxxla may be anywhere, or nowhere (still think it’s probably a plot leading to permadeath, “a road we all must walk”) but I strongly doubt that FD will place it anywhere near the FRift (or the Pleiades).
