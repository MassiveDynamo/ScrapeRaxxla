Think the fr thread and raxxla thread should merge, both looking for same thing.
Nope. FR thread found the FR. Raxxla thread not yet found Raxxla. The clue's in the name

Seems there is a Cmdr Holdstock or something like that in the game. Robert Holdstock, iirc, was the creator of Raxxla in his books. For what's worth ...
There's nothing special about NPC Rob Holdstock -I killed him and claimed the bounty once, was disappointingly easy even for my poor combat skills. It was memorable for saying "Receive x bounty for killing the outlaw Rob Holdstock" or similar though, F10ed for posterity somewhere.
