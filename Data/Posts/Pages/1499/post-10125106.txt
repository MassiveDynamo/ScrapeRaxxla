Just thought about something, maybe it hasn't been done yet.
Have we tried to get in good term with minor factions in contiguous systems, so the commander gets a good reputation in a zone instead of systems spread across the Bubble?
There are few good areas where one could readily test this: factions Dark Echo (near Alliance/Independent space) and East India Company (border of Fed/Imperial space near Ackwada). Working with either should effectively open up a large region with good standing.
