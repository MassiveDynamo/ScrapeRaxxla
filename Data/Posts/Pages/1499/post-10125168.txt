Well Schedar is in the game. Empty quaternary system...
The deciding factor in most cases is whether there are distance data for a star as of 2014. Schedar does, and tycho SN (cas B,SN1572) does not.

The Simbad database online is a good tool for that sort of thing. Also it gives all the names of a star.
