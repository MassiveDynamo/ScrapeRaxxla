Space Madness! Such myth is not in-game!

But have you considered:
Constellations Draco, Serpens
George and the Dragon
Perseus and Cassiopeia (perhaps the sea monster was a water dragon)
Have you read Michael Brookes Sun Dragon book?
Spent time in all those - i read the sun dragon book but it was the add-on tau ceti missions that made me think. We go and colonize Tau Ceti and then Tau Ceti is linked to the struggle over the colonization of Cemiessâ€¦
