You wouldn’t believe the number of complaints and accusations there have been about higher forces only giving knowledge to their chosen ones. Largely completely baseless and untrue in most cases of course
So, please don't take this as anything more than curiosity. Why do believe these would be alternative realities and not merely products of human society changing over centuries? We have strong indications that names of systems changed just because Universal Cartographics coming into existence. Further, given Feds, Empire, and Independent Worlds had a large separation - cultural specific name scheme could be at play. One other thing, one the starter systems has the faction "LHS 3447 Academy for Novitiate Pilots". This is important because novitiates are initiates to a religious order. This is why I suspect Church of the Path is related in the Shibboleth system. Shibboleth is important because it implies that there are terms at play that distinguish one from an insider with special knowledge from outsiders. For the record, my goal is not exclusion but education. All CMDRs have a duty to help others.
