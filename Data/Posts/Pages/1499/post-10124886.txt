There are explorer missions ? I Haven't seen any.
They appear as passenger missions. I see them all the time. There's some interesting long-haulers out of Darwin Research Facility asteroid base in California Nebula. I think they are usually under individual transportation. I think group transit may have some oddball missions, too. Though, I really need to complete my Saud Kruger collection with a Beluga.
