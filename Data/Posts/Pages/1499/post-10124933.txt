I can forgive myself.
and I know the difference of a videogame to real life...

a new question from me:
is there anything special about marlins reach?
i am asking because of this
Alessia Verde was a role play character of Drew Wagar’s who wrote Reclamation, Premonition books around the Salomé storyline. She may have been the daughter if Luko from that storyline, ostensibly a member of TDW he might actually have been CIEP (AHTW mentions one of the CIEP elders was named Giovanni which seems suggestive).

Marlin founded Achenar colony which became the Empire.

Edit
Drew liked poetic clues, but fish stew? Yuk!
Fish comes coated in beer batter, with chips and plenty of salt and vinegar,
And a pickled gherkin!!
