Maybe we focus on the wrong things. Celestial objects, systems and station names.
It could all be about getting friend with the right faction(s) to get little breadcrumbs.
Just thought about something, maybe it hasn't been done yet.
Have we tried to get in good term with minor factions in contiguous systems, so the commander gets a good reputation in a zone instead of systems spread across the Bubble?
