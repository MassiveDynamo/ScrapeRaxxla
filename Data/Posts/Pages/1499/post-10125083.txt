Maybe we focus on the wrong things. Celestial objects, systems and station names.
It could all be about getting friend with the right faction(s) to get little breadcrumbs.
Fellow CMDRs initiate other players, not NPCs.

Have you been to Shinrarta Dezra? The beacon "Pilot's Federation - Influence" covers this and there are a lot of factions directly financed through Pilot's Federation. All these factions essentially work for the same people. This isn't to say they are secretive in the traditional sense. It is more an organization that has open secrets. Think of the Pilot's Federation as very similar to secret societies of Earth.

Plato The Statesman 258e â€”
Stranger: In this way, then, divide all science into two arts, calling the one practical (praktikos), and the other purely intellectual (gnostikos).

Younger Socrates:
Let us assume that all science is one and that these are its two forms.
