Mission update: Barnard's Loop

100% of the first two search area's are now complete. Most excellent work, CMDR's!

I've prepared 3 new cubes in the doc, this time listing 'short' names only. Of course you can explore as much as you like beyond the listed system names.

I have tried to plot routes to all of the remaining targets as listed in the new cubes from my current location in Synuefe LC-U D3-2. 10 of them were plotable, the others were not. Closest one for me is HIP 15245 at 387.2ly... 27 jumps. I'm on my way.
