The reporter said they were jumping without detailed exploration and saw the name. To prove or disprove this report it should not be necessary to fully explore each system via a conclusive search.

I jump honk check left panel, FSS the system. Check all names in nav panel. Inspect orrery. Check star ages, locations and features in system map. Follow up anything of interest with DSS or closer inspection. I had originally mapped each body and visited each asteroid cluster but gave up on that based on time taken and report criteria.

I am sceptical of the report but happy to try and help while poking around permit locked Col70 systems.
Ah, but there was also a suggestion by someone that the originator of this report most likely actually spotted a Children of Raxxla outpost (edit: ah, no it was rOmiLaYu suggesting it might have been a CoR staging post tourist beacon https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-9848975) in his nav panel. Michael Brookes said Raxxla is very difficult to find, so I’m quite sceptical about it appearing in a nav panel by happenstance. I suspect from that MB utterance alone that asteroid belt/planetary ring is a likely location.

Not throwing stones, but while you’re doing a search then be aware that unless you’re thorough then you might actually miss the real thing!
