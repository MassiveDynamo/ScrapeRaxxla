Not sure if it really time well spent doing a full FSS scan of every body if the system has been already explored by others. My method consists mainly of Jump, Honk, Nav panel for Raxxla's and a system map check just to be sure... if the whole map looks explored and/or uninteresting I generally move on. If anything looks particularly interesting (ie ammonia, water or earthlike) I might go map them if they are not too far out. I have not gone into belts based on the recent story of it being visible in the nav panel with just a honk. Am I being thorough enough?
Nope!

Since there is no evidence to say what Raxxla is then how can you ignore anything if you are doing a concentrated search. Raxxla may be a planet, moon or star...it may also be a ship, station, comet, NPC, Guardian AI, Thargoid Queen, wormhole or asteroid (or asteroid station, or Guardian arkship disguised as an asteroid). If you are searching thoroughly then you need to check out everything, including all the asteroid belts and planetary rings!
