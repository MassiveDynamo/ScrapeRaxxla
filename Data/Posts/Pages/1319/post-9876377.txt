How I scan:
Initial system scan
FSS Scan
Check nav tab for Raxxla, HD, HR, HIP, etc.
Click to expand...
Not sure if it really time well spent doing a full FSS scan of every body if the system has been already explored by others. My method consists mainly of Jump, Honk, Nav panel for Raxxla's and a system map check just to be sure... if the whole map looks explored and/or uninteresting I generally move on. If anything looks particularly interesting (ie ammonia, water or earthlike) I might go map them if they are not too far out. I have not gone into belts based on the recent story of it being visible in the nav panel with just a honk. Am I being thorough enough?
