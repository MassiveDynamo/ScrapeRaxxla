Nope!
The reporter said they were jumping without detailed exploration and saw the name. To prove or disprove this report it should not be necessary to fully explore each system via a conclusive search.

I jump honk check left panel, FSS the system. Check all names in nav panel. Inspect orrery. Check star ages, locations and features in system map. Follow up anything of interest with DSS or closer inspection. I had originally mapped each body and visited each asteroid cluster but gave up on that based on time taken and report criteria.

I am sceptical of the report but happy to try and help while poking around permit locked Col70 systems.
