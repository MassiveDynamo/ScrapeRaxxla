Just my semi-annual check-in to see what's going on. Glad (?) to see @Macros Black has finally succumbed to the space madness. Re the Halifax connection, I keep telling people the Space Whales hid Raxxla at Oak Island way back when with the lost works of Shakespeare, but no one believes me (except @simulacrae perhaps). Nice to see the penguin back. Almost reinstalled the game today to assist, got the launcher reinstalled, couldn't decide whether to install Odyssey or Horizons, and then thought "what the eff am I doing"? Time to check out the latest No Man's Sky in VR I think instead, or Elden Ring or something else for my brief summer vacation video game fix me thinks. Even getting lost in the endless procedural dungeons of Daggerfall beats brute force searching based largely on whims. Enjoy though, will check in around six months from now and see what, if anything, has changed. ;-)
I find your Space Whale / Oak Island theory intriguing…. Especially the Shakespeare connection. Cant think of any star loving shakespearian princesses though…
