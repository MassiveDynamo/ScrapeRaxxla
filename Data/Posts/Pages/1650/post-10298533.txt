Pondering upon the visions again, they may also have relevance to John Milton’s Paradise Lost, in so much that if the description of an area of space which glows or is bright not pitch-dark then one might begin to think upon Milton’s description of the Empyrean, which was of pure light in a universe of total darkness (or at least darkness visible).

The locations of the incidents may reflect upon a location far above them, in that their positions do put them with context to my hypothetical zones of the Empyrean, Chaos and Underworld, all of which still brings me back to the The Tuatha Dé Danann?
