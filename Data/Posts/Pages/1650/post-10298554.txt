I am not sure how to determine what is and is not significant in spectrograms of the landscape signal but if you find that kind of detail interesting then I will share three of my recent observations:

The first spectrogram is one that I took earlier this week at Praesepe (thanks to Han Zen for bringing that up - I had not been there before!). This was recorded in a Dolphin with non-essential systems shut down. Note the detail in the vertical bars, resembling a punchcard.
SPOILER

The same features are visible in Artemis (recorded in an Asp Explorer), though not quite so clear and not identical.

Yet in Azaleach (recorded yesterday in an Imperial Courier), these vertical bars are not present.

There may be more to the landscape signal than a mountain-like structure?

I'm very sure these are all ship noises. The fact that it changes depending on the ship type shows just how much detail Fdev put into the cockpit sounds

You can test this very easily by pointing 180 degrees away from the centre of the galaxy you'll get a 'non signal' recording, then you can compare! If the bars are still present, then it's ship noise.
