Many of these examples of instances of a mystical vision or even abductions, in my opinion might seem very similar to those of linked to The Tuatha Dé Danann.

This links into the theory of the interpretation of the Robert Holdstocks book Lost Realms, and the general concept that such entities - who supposedly were kings/queens of a pan-European migration circa 4-6,000+ years ago; due to the verbal history aspect were depicted to exist as Demi-gods; or as the Victorians interpreted as fairies, but that they existing within an otherworld which is described as a pan dimensional Eden.

Again this ties into my Lost Realms concept.

According to Our creating story, The Ever Living Ones (which like other religions needs to be taken with a small pinch of salt) the Tuatha De Danaan are the decedents of the Children of Danu created by The Dagda and Brigid under the great oak Bile.
Danu (the divine waters) is widely considered to be the Danube so pretty much all Celts migrated from there.
The Children of Danu later fought the Fomorii on the plain of Towers during new year (Samhain or Halloween for you folks) to claim Inisfail.
