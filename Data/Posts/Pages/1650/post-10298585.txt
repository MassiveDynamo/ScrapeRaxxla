True, but Drew not knowing anything about Raxxla doesn't mean anything in this case.

It's fully possible to write something without knowing what it means We also don't know if he wrote the site logs at all, or if they were written by him but with guidance from Fdev, or maybe (using the NDA-level writer's material) Drew just so happened to mention the sirensong aspect and that just happens to coincide with stuff already in the lore.

Plus, the Raxxla codex was released years after the rift mystery - therefore it was with full knoweldge of what already existed in the game

So yeah, maybe Drew can shed more light on it, but I don't think it's necessary to ask him to do so.

I sort of struggle sometimes with the Landscape signal/Sag A* being Raxxla... unless the reason no one found it was because they couldn't get there...

And they would have worked out the signal just like we did in game pretty quickly, so why were people heading off searching for Raxxla...

And why doesn't the Siren song affect everyone as we all hear it....

There's the logical reasoning that it can't be too far from Sol or the Old Worlds due to technology restrictions....

Just a thought
