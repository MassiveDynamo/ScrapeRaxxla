The ONLY other place Sirens as a word appears in the entirety of Elite Dangerous Lore (not system name) that I'm aware of is in the Formidine Rift Alpha Logs:

And Drew Wagar explicitly stated that this is linked to Halsey.

Since he created the Rift mystery and was involved with creating all the text, I assume (reading between the lines) this is him giving us word-of-god knowledge about this connection.

If you are linking the Formidine Rift to Raxxla then Drew has stated a few times he has no knowledge of Raxxla and it was off limits to the writers from the kickstarters who wrote the early books...

He is back and doing streams every Thursday talking about Elite lore amongst other things, so may well answer questions on the subject (don't know if he's back on here too), I asked him a few questions on Twitter back during the Formidine Rift story and he always replied, although they were always quite cryptic as it was an on going story....

As he's mentioned Halsey and Galnet in relation to the rift, he might be able to confirm/rule out the Guardian link though or give more explanation?

Or shed light on the Landscape signal ;-)

Edit:
OK Guardians not part of the Rift story...
Lore questions. :)
Hello Drew, I have one short question: who invited Salom√© to Colonia? I must admit, I can't recall at the moment. I will have a dig through my archives and see if I can find out. I did make a note of it somewhere. Cheers, Drew.

One of the posts indicating he doesn't know about Raxxla

There is more detail in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eu30UyjpQrWexAglwD1Ax_GaDz4d7l8KD76kSzX4DEk/edit#gid=0 This is a user submitted tourist beacon, so the text is a player's wording. The notes don't mention why he/she/it/they called it that: 0016 Celestial Gem...

This one mentions Halsey as something a possible future plot might be a good idea (along with other lore items)...
Mystery's continuation: New message from ''Salvation''
Oh boy - Drew is gonna have issues keeping up his "no lore in EDO" line :ROFLMAO: Hmm... I welcome the additional narrative, and there is a bit more lore here for sure, but it's not a lot of new lore. We already knew about the Guardian/Thargoid conflict. This appears to further cement that...

This one has him questioning his faith on whether there is a puzzle baked in to the game for Raxxla

Here's one confirming he knows nothing about Raxxla (well as much as we do)
The Quest To Find Raxxla
People have tried to make the Dark Wheel the controlling faction before (Fact: They were highly successful) but alas, because The Pilots Federation is in said system Frontier has it set up so the Dark Wheel can't take over (Likely because if the Pilots Fed. lost control of their system...well...

And this is the one I was looking for.... Says Formidine Rift and Raxxla are two different things..
The Quest To Find Raxxla
I probably dream when I listen to the Josh Hawkins BroCast where Drew was guested ? For those who never listen it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvcYNYIQZ8M Drew, in this broadcast, you said that you didn't know where was Raxxla but M. Brooks and D. Braben assured you that it was ingame. You...

And here's a post about the video he did on Raxxla and TDW lore

Tonight's rendezvous for the Raxxla Episode of the Elite Dangerous Lore Tour is in the Teorge system, CMDRs. https://twitch.tv/drewwagar and in-game. Cheers, Drew.
