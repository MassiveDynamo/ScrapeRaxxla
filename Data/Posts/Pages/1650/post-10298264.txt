That would explain it ... however think I need to do some more tests on internal ship noises.... not 100% sure it's the same timing when I am pointing at different parts of space..... and why the chirping in a DBX.... not exactly the ship creaking and banging that I usually hear with the sound down a lot more....
Cool, I've also wondered if the ship noises might actually be important too, so interesting to see what results you get there
