If you copy the settings I used do you see the slash marks and the possible lettering?
No sign of them at Praesepe (Dolphin) or Azaleach (Courier) but I do see them in Artemis (AspX).

I also did another recording in the Praesepe Cluster, at BW Cancri pointing at an Earth-like World, however Barnard's Loop was very close to it in the field of view, so it was not good as a control sample. It lacked the vertical striping but had a horizontal component that sounded and looked like whispers or wind.

I'm outside my comfort zone here so I will stick to occasionally recording in interesting places - I do not want to make this a focus of my playing.

Today I had a closer look at the centroids of the triangles of the Norns and Greek Fates, as these are very close to each other. I have now also visited all of the Norns, Fates and Morrigans.
Caerdroia seems like a good match for the Greek Fates but the Norn triangle is more extended and harder to place - I think it is around LU Velorum. These systems are ~30 LY away or less. The star density is low here and there's not anything on a line between them. Shinrarta Dezhra is not that far off...

Thinking more about the golden chain being a path of G-type stars I had another look around and below the lower two Norns, Veroandi and Skuld, in the direction of Axis Mundi is a G-type called Seer. This seems like a good first step on the path! The next is harder. Laedla has some interesting planet names (Swallowworld and two others).
