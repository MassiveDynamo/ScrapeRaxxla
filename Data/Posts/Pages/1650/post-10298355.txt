Lots of really cool ideas here. You've highlighted some things I hadn't really thought of before. The Sirius links are interesting.

I do think "mystical secret" is really important. I think a lot of people are expecting something very much like a stargate, but I don't think that's very mystical. Especially in a world where we routinely travel in Hyperspace and fight aliens.

As you say, we're really looking for something that's more described as "spiritual or magical significance that transcends human understanding". I think this really reinforces the links to Halsey and Gan, both of whom had visions, behavioural changes, etc. Very much spiritual transformations - and that transformation seems to have come about via a mechanism that's not understood, literal visions, dreams, and visitations from god-beings... biblical, if you will.

For me, that's yet another very strong link between Halsey, Gan and Raxxla. I really, really strongly think they're part of the quest. I doubt it's about following them or anything like that. I expect it's showing us how Raxxla was discovered and known about and how the myth has sustained for so long. I also expect they have been describing it literally, or parts of it.

Gan Romero is an unknown factor at the moment, although he was a starship technician which does parallel Art Tornqvist.
In contrast, Halsey was found again and her revelations pointed to the Guardian sites - as the Knowledge Base points out.
Gan on the other hand was effectively removed (stopped?) from the narrative due to being an "off-camera" character leading players into a wild goose chase. There is a chance he was intended to represent searching for more Guardian clues (25 May 3305 he is linked to Halsey), but this removal action creates uncertainty about what FDev are doing.
