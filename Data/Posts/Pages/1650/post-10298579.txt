If you are linking the Formidine Rift to Raxxla then Drew has stated a few times he has no knowledge of Raxxla and it was off limits to the writers from the kickstarters who wrote the early books...

He is back and doing streams every Thursday talking about Elite lore amongst other things, so may well answer questions on the subject (don't know if he's back on here too), I asked him a few questions on Twitter back during the Formidine Rift story and he always replied, although they were always quite cryptic as it was an on going story....

As he's mentioned Halsey and Galnet in relation to the rift, he might be able to confirm/rule out the Guardian link though or give more explanation?

Or shed light on the Landscape signal ;-)

True, but Drew not knowing anything about Raxxla doesn't mean anything in this case.

It's fully possible to write something without knowing what it means We also don't know if he wrote the site logs at all, or if they were written by him but with guidance from Fdev, or maybe (using the NDA-level writer's material) Drew just so happened to mention the sirensong aspect and that just happens to coincide with stuff already in the lore.

Plus, the Raxxla codex was released years after the rift mystery - therefore it was with full knoweldge of what already existed in the game

So yeah, maybe Drew can shed more light on it, but I don't think it's necessary to ask him to do so.
