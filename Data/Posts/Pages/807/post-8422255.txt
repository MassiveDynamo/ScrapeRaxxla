Well, apart from walking the copawlot I’ve spent all morning fruitlessly searching the forum for anything that DB may have said about Raxxla and Gamma. In fact I can’t find any reference of him saying anything at all about Raxxla in the forum; all we have is what he & MB said during livestreams (though MB did say something about Raxxla being something different from Shinrarta Dehzra

If memory serves the quote in question comes to us second hand. Drew Wagar had a face to face conversation with David Braben in which David told Drew personally that Raxxla exists in-game. I don't think (I could be wrong) that David has ever directly told the community at large that Raxxla exists in game.
