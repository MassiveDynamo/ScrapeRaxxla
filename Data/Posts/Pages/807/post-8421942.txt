For immersion's sake I'm choosing to believe that they noticed when I was first snooping around in my under-equipped ship and after my departure for a better equipped ship with an SRV, they packed up, tore down and relocated. For immersion's sake of course. this will keep me sane and let me accept this, happily believing I was almost on to something.
