Well, apart from walking the copawlot I’ve spent all morning fruitlessly searching the forum for anything that DB may have said about Raxxla and Gamma. In fact I can’t find any reference of him saying anything at all about Raxxla in the forum; all we have is what he & MB said during livestreams (though MB did say something about Raxxla being something different from Shinrarta Dehzra

However DB has confirmed Raxxla is in-game, and we can deduce from Drew Wagar’s report of DB’s words at Lavecon (5-6 July 14) that Raxxla has been in-game since beta 1.04, or earlier,
The Quest To Find Raxxla
Book, sirens, spiraling stars. Nothing more. On that note and its a tenuous one I admit but its the only way I can link this in in any way whatsoever, anyway: Been getting distracted by BBC radio version of James Follet 'Earthsearch'. Hadnt read it but it involves a spaceship returning to Sol...

Does this mean that Raxxla must be located in the old "beta galactic cylinder" that limited travel to around 500 systems? That was before I started play, but Han_Zen commented that the beta cylinder went approximately from Eranin to Sol, but the galaxy was regenerated on gamma launch and many things moved.
The Quest To Find Raxxla
Who else remembers coming home? Maybe "Earth" translates to "Raxxla" in some alien tongue?

EDIT: Don’t suppose anyone has a list of the systems in that beta cylinder so we can determine what moved out of it? (Assuming Raxxla was in it originally but was moved on the gamma regeneration )
