Pollux System description:

A quiet extraction system also known as Beta Geminorum. The home of the Daedalus Consortium. Formed at the turn of the fourth millennium, the DaedalusConsortium is a loosely bound group of individuals who seek power above all else.

Daedalus connsortium also mentioned in the system description for LAWD 52:

The Disciples of Daedalus were created by Marshall Tom Ledgerwood to rally the people into fighting back against the oppressive rulers of their system. They where offered a position in the Alliance for their honour and bravery. They agreed, and now are apart of the Alliance, dedicated to helping anyone in need.

Looks like there is some Alliance history in the area.
