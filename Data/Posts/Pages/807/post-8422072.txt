EDIT: Donâ€™t suppose anyone has a list of the systems in that beta cylinder so we can determine what moved out of it? (Assuming Raxxla was in it originally but was moved on the gamma regeneration )


From beta 1 patch note
-Expanded playable bubble to 21 ly radius (@50 systems)

From the gamma 2.00 patch note:
-Secret added

According to one of the comments on the Gamma, the whole galaxy was opened:
"So there are now 3.9 billion more systems with nothing to do in them but explore solo since I cant group or chat with anyone?"

Raxxla could have been there during the beta but out of reach as not included in the playable area. Couldn't find any other official reference (will edit if I do)

On a totally different subject, does anyone knows which col 70 sector systems are unlocked ? I think I saw some posts about few of them but I can't find those anymore.
I spent hours jumping around the area and using injection plots on the map to find a way in, without success.
