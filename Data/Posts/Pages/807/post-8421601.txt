Oh man, this just keeps getting better!

So, on this moon Cambridge, i just happened to come down right at a surface facility of sorts. It has no name and there seems to be very faint music coming out of the one building, that can barely be heard over the sounds of industrial machinery and my ships engines. Of course i just happen to not have an srv on this ship either. what lol? Im going to have to switch ships.

Anyways the system is Pollux, the moon is Cambridge and these are my planetary coordinates,

-39.8072°
77.7992°

If anybody would like to examine for themselves.
