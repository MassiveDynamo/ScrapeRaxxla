Both David Braben and Michael Brookes have confirmed that Raxxla is in-game, see first post of this thread for source references.

@Vetinari: As far as I’m aware DB said Raxxla has been in-game since the gamma release; what is the source for the interpretation that this was instead in reference to Zurara?

(Edit: it was because I believed DB said this of Raxxla that I produced a whole iPad Notes page on the gamma changelogs for analysis! But there was nothing evident in those )

(Edit2: Drew Wagar did say that the FRift story was finalised during gamma, which would imply that Zurara was implemented then, but I’m convinced DB said something about gamma & Raxxla that was different
Formidine Rift... what is it?

Of course, being in-game from the outset does not implicitly mean that it has been accessible from the outset; that is our interpretation based on understanding of how games are designed and expectations of fair play from FD. Since it appears that a certain (unknown) set of circumstances is required to unlock TDW and/or find Raxxla it is possible that set of circumstances was not available from the outset. For instance it could require a certain level of Thargoid kills & goids were not implemented from the outset.
