So, probably nothing, i happened across a lovely little system named Pollux. I thought it was interesting though because it has a named moon for what should be Pollux 2 a, called Cambridge, which is landable but has nothing on it visibly. Then i remembered Cambridge is where frontier developments offices are. The entire galaxy was created in Cambridge. I was wondering, why they would have named this moon after their office's home town? It doesnt appear to have anything there at all. No bases, no installations, no volcanism.

Then i started thinking. One place Raxxla may possibly be might be in fdev's office somewhere, in their home town of Cambridge. It would make a little bit of sense to me and i bet most people would over look this as too easy, or obvious and move along. Im sitting here fuel scooping, I dont happen to have a surface scanner equipped atm. Have any of you happened to have mapped this moon yet? If so, did you notice anything noteworthy or curious?

One of the moons in the system has a station named Naddoddur Survey. (I pronouced this in my head as 'not a door' survey lol)

Oh also there's a listening post. I'll let you all know if it has anything of interest to share in a few minutes.
