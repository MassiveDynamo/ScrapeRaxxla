We don't actually, that was the Zuara, at the start it was a Conda, then became a Megaship.

DB has said in a livestream, of course its real, no mention of it being in game specifically.

The other source is 'unofficial' as in not a press release or public statement but a conversation where he said its in the game, afaik he hasn't said that on any livestream or forum or anywhere. That is hearsay by definition.

People have worked out the conversation took place shortly after the release I think so we have a kind of timeline which implies its been there since near the start but hasn't been confirmed in any way shape or form by fdev...afaik.

The official line is 'We cant comment on anything not found by a CMDR'*

*reply to email from UC so a bit of RP involved.
