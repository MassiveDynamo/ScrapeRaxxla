Ok. Came back with an srv and surface scanner. Its gone. The trespass zone is still here and the occupied escape pod is here but everything else is nowhere to be found. Im more than a little irritated at this inconsistency.

There were 2 buildings, about 6 cargo canisters, what looked like a power generator, the escape pod and a handful of skimmers. All that was left was the escape pod. Apparently its nothing at all. Sorry for wasting all of your time

The randomness of installation poi does seem to reduce the immersion factor!
