Very curious indeed....

I checked out the listening post. It happens to be in french (i believe) which i though was interesting since i know the game is translated into a good number of other languages and i assume french would be among them.


I ran it through google translator and got this result...


I know google isnt always 100% correct so i wanted to cross check it here because i know where hail from all over the world. I wonder if this is some sort of code or cypher? Those arent my strong suit. Anybody good at codebreaking?

I found this wiki about the source of the quote.
