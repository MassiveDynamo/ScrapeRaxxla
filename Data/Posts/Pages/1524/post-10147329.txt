Hey all, been quite a while for me, but I came across something today that made me go “hold up”.
Elite is a British product and one thing that I’ve seen time and again is that, especially in British sci-fi, there is a love of slipping in references to other British cultural hallmarks. One of which is almost always made reference to, is Dr. Who.
In the lore of Dr. Who there is a being called the Timewyrm. In the books of Gallifrey (the time lords home planet) the timewyrm is described as a great dragon that encircles the universe until it eats its own tail, and to the daleks it is knows as “the twister of paths”. It can slip between dimensions and time, existing in the “in between space” and in any time, in any where. Several planets and persons are associated with the timewyrm and those may prove an interesting hunt if indeed they are part of the game.
But given it’s description as an ancient dragon that encircles the universe until it eats its own tail (TDW symbol) and it’s ability to be “internet-time and inter dimension”, it could fit the bill of the whisperer in witch space.
