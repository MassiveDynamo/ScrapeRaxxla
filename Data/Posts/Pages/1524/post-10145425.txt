According to EDSM, both Vega and Altair have the same system description texts apart from the tagged on player faction bit in Altair. Altair also features in the cowherd myth.
To dig further;
In that myth, there is a bridge that is formed by magpies once a year on the 7th day of the 7th month of the Chinese lunar calendar, to reunite the lovers (Vega and Altair).

The star associated with that bridge is Deneb (Alpha Cygni).
"In Chinese, 天津 (Tiān Jīn), meaning Celestial Ford, refers to an asterism consisting of Deneb, Gamma Cygni, Delta Cygni, 30 Cygni, Nu Cygni, Tau Cygni, Upsilon Cygni, Zeta Cygni and Epsilon Cygni. Consequently, the Chinese name for Deneb itself is 天津四 (Tiān Jīn sì, English: the Fourth Star of the Celestial Ford).

In the Chinese love story of Qi Xi, Deneb marks the magpie bridge across the Milky Way, which allows the separated lovers Niu Lang (Altair) and Zhi Nü (Vega) to be reunited on one special night of the year in late summer. In other versions of the story, Deneb is a fairy who acts as chaperone when the lovers meet."
Deneb - Wikipedia
en.m.wikipedia.org

"Deneb, also designated Alpha Cygni, is the brightest star in the constellation of Cygnus. Deneb lies at one vertex of a widely spaced asterism called the Summer Triangle, the other two members of which are the zero-magnitude stars Vega in the constellation Lyra and Altair in Aquila."

There is also a minor faction in Vega called "Vega Bridge Interstellar".
