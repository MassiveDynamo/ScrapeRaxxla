Currently debating on how to build a maelstrom explorerâ€¦. And woefully realizing the number of mats and doohickies i need to collect in order to get all the anti caustic whizbangs to protect the enhanced doodads i need for this operation.
Nah, construct a Silver Surfer and come ride the waves in the rings of Saturn in the search for Raxxla!
All it needs is a huge dose of baseless hope...
And a very large astronomical telescope...
But on further thought a hold full of Trinkets of Hidden Fortune might also be a help...
