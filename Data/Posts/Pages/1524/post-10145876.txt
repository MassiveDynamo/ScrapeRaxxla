Ive heard of Stone Roses, but not a Mineral Magpie?
Is that a punk band? Never was into punk!
The mineral magpie was in ED, way back. It was usually a T9 in as USS, that payed a little extra for mineral cargo.
It was a bit magical. If you flew close enough, it just took your cargo and gave you credits.
No scooping required.
