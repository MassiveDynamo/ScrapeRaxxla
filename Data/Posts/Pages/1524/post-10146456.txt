Nah, construct a Silver Surfer and come ride the waves in the rings of Saturn in the search for Raxxla!
All it needs is a huge dose of baseless hope...
And a very large astronomical telescope...
But on further thought a hold full of Trinkets of Hidden Fortune might also be a help...
Sounds like fun - will give it a go this weekend. Dont have any trinkets on me but always up for some zipping around in asteroid belts. o7
