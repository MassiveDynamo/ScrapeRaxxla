Maybe it is.....

“Our analysts have recovered a few fragments of these recordings, which appear to have been part of a dream journal. In them, Romero makes repeated mention of seeing ‘an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven,’ and being called by ‘voices that didn’t come from anything with a body’.”
The 'area of space, not black but radiant... glowing like heaven' is a good description of the Galactic Core.
The material quoted from Gan Romero's 'dream journal' is strikingly reminiscent of Halsey's experience whilst in cryosleep in her escape pod. Could they both have seen Raxxla? It would be great if the DBX that Gan Romero is flying was something we could find in-game. Keep your eyes peeled if you're doing a Sgr A* run!
