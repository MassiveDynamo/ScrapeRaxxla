The 'area of space, not black but radiant... glowing like heaven' is a good description of the Galactic Core.
The material quoted from Gan Romero's 'dream journal' is strikingly reminiscent of Halsey's experience whilst in cryosleep in her escape pod. Could they both have seen Raxxla? It would be great if the DBX that Gan Romero is flying was something we could find in-game. Keep your eyes peeled if you're doing a Sgr A* run!

Pretty sure someone would of seen something during Distance World 2 and the Community Goal, there were a lot of individuals in that area.
