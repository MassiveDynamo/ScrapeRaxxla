It's well worth paying attention to the Romero story. He was living in Vega.

Vega is one of the best candidates for Princess Astrophel.

Perhaps something can bee seen or heard, only in that system? Some spiraling stars or something?
What do we know about the cmdr who's dbx it was that was stolen? I forget the name but they say it the first galnews about the stolen dbx. I've been listening to the 4 galnews articles while playing and I'm pretty sure they mention a system but can't recall ATM as I'm at work.

I had mentioned I thought this stolen dbx might somehow be connected to children of raxxla (salom√©) but everyone got mad as hell about it.
