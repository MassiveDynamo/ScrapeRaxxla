Blunt question: Does anyone know whether DB is as mason? There are several names in the game that only make sense to a mason. So if he is a member there is a possibility the riddle is based on masonic symbolism.

E.g.: Rift/Abss. There is a certain part in an A.:A.: rite where the candidate is saved from an abyss/rift by „a friend“.

There was another guy a while back in this thread who said he "checked" all systems with words relevant to a master mason. I can't seem to find that post though.

It certainly can't hurt to check again, given that any location is as likely as any other right now.

I would disagree that there are game elements that ONLY make sense to a mason. There is an ordinary meaning to the term rift (and abyss). In fact, there's a whole RPG called "Rifts" that's centered around portals to other universes. If DB has locked some pieces of the Raxxla puzzle away behind membership in a secret society, that's not even remotely within the ballpark of "[I made the trail to Raxxla] a little bit obvious so you would know you're on the right track".
