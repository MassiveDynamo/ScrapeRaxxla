What do we know about the cmdr who's dbx it was that was stolen? I forget the name but they say it the first galnews about the stolen dbx. I've been listening to the 4 galnews articles while playing and I'm pretty sure they mention a system but can't recall ATM as I'm at work.

I had mentioned I thought this stolen dbx might somehow be connected to children of raxxla (salom√©) but everyone got mad as hell about it.
No other system is mentioned in the four articles. The DBX owner came to Vega from a deep space exploration trip.
