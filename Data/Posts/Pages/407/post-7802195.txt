“Our analysts have recovered a few fragments of these recordings, which appear to have been part of a dream journal. In them, Romero makes repeated mention of seeing ‘an area of space, not black but radiant…glowing like heaven,’ and being called by ‘voices that didn’t come from anything with a body’.”

It's well worth paying attention to the Romero story. He was living in Vega.

Vega is one of the best candidates for Princess Astrophel.

Perhaps something can bee seen or heard, only in that system? Some spiraling stars or something?
