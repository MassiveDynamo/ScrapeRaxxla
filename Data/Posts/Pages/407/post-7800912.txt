Theory:
4) Alec Ryder was killed outside of either Lave or Leesti and knew of Raxxla, as he told his son 18 minutes before an assassian blew up his ship and ejecting his son in an escape pod.
5) Alex Ryder was not Elite, as it is suspected that those of the Dark Wheel only admits those who are, and Alec was not a member, but only knew about them.
Just for clarity:
1. Alex's father was Jason Ryder, not Alec.
2. Alex Ryder most certainly was a member of The Dark Wheel. In fact, he was at one point the leader of The Dark Wheel. Its all in John Harper's novel And Here The Wheel.
