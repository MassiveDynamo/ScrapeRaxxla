Are you feeling dizzy from the spinning then?

I've been checking a bit on this too whilst on my way back from sag A* - now that there are fewer stars, I get less spinning and shorter jumps. When there is a nebula in view, it takes longer and there is more spinning. And when right near sag A* it use to freeze and stutter loading the stars for the skybox, and frequently I'd have a sky with boxy sectors of stars missing where its either run out of graphics resources to draw them or failed to load them - I have 40MB/s internet with Zen (who are awesome) and bandwidth is never a porblem. So for me it looks normal. Same goes for the objects in view - sometimes they are different but the black objects appear sometimes even though I'm nowhere interesting (Norma Expanse mostly lately - expansive..)

Just FYI:
The 'boxy sectors of stars missing' is an artifact of the way that the Stellar Forge created the galaxy, not a graphic resource issue. The skybox is drawing everything, it's just that the star density is not smoothly delineated between sectors.

There are plenty of threads about it, but I'm on my phone and can't search for a link right now. I'll try to find one later.
