And for this to be a truly scientific test it should be done by a range of pilots with a tange of internet connection speeds jumping between the same two systems and at a range of times of day to check FD server loading effects. I have said a few posts earlier I have seen occasionally a minor amount of rotation recently when out in vicinity of Heart nebula, nowhere near any permit locks. I have 100mbit/s optical fibre internet connection.
I have 80mbit/s fiber and I always get the spin. It's often very short, but it's there. The effect is more apparent when playing in VR.
