When travelling through the hypertunnel, the ship is just like a spinor. The jump "changes" the shape of space-time around and you end... elsewhere.
The thing is to find a way, or a place (that is not a place), which alters the total amount of spin. 360° or 720°, like in the plate/belt trick, or... how much ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_trick
That's what I call tinfoiling !
