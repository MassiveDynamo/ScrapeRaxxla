I'm glad someone appreciates it. It wasn't the whole time a lead for this but I definitely edited the post to put it in.

It just seems like my theories cause a schism in the thread and I don't like the duality it creates.
Some people are just a bit negative, they think they know what’s what and decide when someone may have come up with an idea to put them down to make them self look good for example look at the great scientific minds of history, Tesla ideas was rejected but he was the original creator of electricity even tho his idea was stolen and capitalised by the men who rejected his theory’s and inventions. don’t beat your self up because some people can’t handle brilliance
