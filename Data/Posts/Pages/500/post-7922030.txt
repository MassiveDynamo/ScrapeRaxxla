Nice hypothesis, well reasoned! Though given the basis in Halseys Caretakers I think highly unlikely to be Raxxla-related, but might be Guardian &/or AI.
However I keep saying I think the “fireflies” from UA & barnacles etc are the caretakers-I suspect they’re an nth dimensional species that the goids have captured and engineered into their technology.
