I’ll make som pics. Later this week. I don’t have to be in the system, to trigger the effect.

I think the Star of India dot is left an abow the star. The one in Deneb is far right and down.
OK, I've seen it now. I did not keep the view still but moved about constantly. It was not a dot but seemed more geometrical and appeared first at lower left, at about a hundred degrees from the top of the star. It was not initially present and didn't last for more than a minute, or thereabouts. After around three minutes' absence, it reappeared vertically above the star, where it remained for about a minute. It was smaller in this position. About four minutes after it faded it appeared, and larger, in the original position. It remained for a few minutes and was large enough that its shape could almost be seen, reminiscent of a Coriolis shape but certainly not conclusively so.
As you've said, from the way it moves it seems to be in between the star and the background projection of stars on the system map view.
It's an odd glitch to have but I think it is a glitch: has it been reported as such?

Happy birthday to Jorki and Drew \o/
