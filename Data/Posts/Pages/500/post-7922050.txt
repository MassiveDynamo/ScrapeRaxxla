Nice hypothesis, well reasoned! Though given the basis in Halseys Caretakers I think highly unlikely to be Raxxla-related, but might be Guardian &/or AI.
However I keep saying I think the “fireflies” from UA & barnacles etc are the caretakers-I suspect they’re an nth dimensional species that the goids have captured and engineered into their technology.
Maybe not engineered. Perhaps fermented into alcohol. The 'toast' of the Dark wheel might just be them getting messed up on a drink they call Raxxla and all this fighty intergalactic mayhem is just a bunch of pickled up old farts fighting over a beer. To ( hic ) Raxxla!
