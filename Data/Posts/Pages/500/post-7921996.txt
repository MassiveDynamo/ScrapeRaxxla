Happy birthday!
It's mine today too, though I'm only 49, you old fart

Happy Birthday young fish breath!
After being plied with rather sickly birthday cake this afternoon, Iâ€™ve started on the gin & tonic, before moving onto red wine with dinner and a brandy or three for dessert. I believe in life extension- my method is pickling in alcohol!

Thank you all for your regards, and have a nice fish supper DrewC!
