I've tried exactly that with 'visible jump' lines at Col 70 Sector, though I cannot claim to have tried it all around the sector.

~75Ly Anaconda and max fuel boost, so no luck reaching any potential unlocked systems ~150Ly inside the sector.

There's some interesting systems in the sector I'd like to visit, given the opportunity.
