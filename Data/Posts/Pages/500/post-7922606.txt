Officially 'it exists' and 'there will be no clues'...iirc it officially existed the in first few games as well so there's always that to consider and I'm not even sure how official the 'it exists' is, as in has Frontier actually officially said it officially and publicly rather than in conversation?

I'm seriously considering calling my next dog Raxxla just so I can stand in a field and let off some steam 'RAXXLA, RAXXLA, WHERE ARE YOU! COME HERE RAXXLA! RAXXLA WHERE HAVE YOU GONE!'
