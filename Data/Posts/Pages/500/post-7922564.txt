Want to throw another theory out there. You could potentially hide something in a permit locked sector AND have it be accessible. If there was ONE non-permit locked system in the middle of the sector and ONE path of unlocked systems that lead to it, it would be pretty unlikely someone is going to just casually scroll over it and see that a system in the sector doesn’t require a permit. It at least adds up to the “a cobra can reach it” prerequisite.
It might be possible.

I've certainly done my fair share of checking around Col 70 for that kind of stuff. Without trying to put a dampener on things, it would be an incredibly difficult thing to actually find though, especially for a big region, just due to the sheer number of stars involved.

You can check to some extent by looking at the 'viable jump' lines in galmap, but they only go so far, and so only can cover a relatively thin surface layer.

Were you meaning it in a sense of it being something you could obtain a 'map' for, rather than something that just had to be searched for? That'd be quite an interesting way for something to be done, but I guess we then come back to how one would go about finding the map.

Oh, and there's no 'a cobra can reach it' prerequisite. There's nothing official in terms of prerequisites. There's very little official at all really!
