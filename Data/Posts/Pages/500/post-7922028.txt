My latest hypothesis regarding Raxxla/TDW:

One of the star catalogues used by FDev when populating the galaxy was the Henry Russell. Stars from the catalogue are named 'HR [number]'.

Making the wild, unsubstantiated connection between 'HR' and 'RH' (Robert Holdstock), I postulate that visiting a certain number of these stars will attract the notice of TDW.

EDSM tells me I've visited 746 of these stars, though a small number may be duplicates. I'll let you all know when I've reached 1,000

Good hypothesis, though HR is not the only catalogue they used. Could be a long test process!!!
