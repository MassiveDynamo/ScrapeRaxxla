Im thinking the same.

Im dreading it But its more likely now than ever which is why Im clutching at straws trying to find anything that may point to / hint at something rather than visit every Belt in every system just to find nothing. So far afaik all Belt ones have been number 1, whether A1, B1 or C1 or whatever but can't hold to that and still cant bring myself to drop in on just them just in case. Hoping beyond reason that theres some sign, easily overlooked but something just to say 'This one is worth investigating by the way' if we know what to look for. Still havent been back to Hesperus ones though to check them out and even if they do then DW or Raxxla may not abide by the same rule...but its that or drop into every belt. All 16 of them round that L Star with nothing else in system at all and I can't, I just can't.
