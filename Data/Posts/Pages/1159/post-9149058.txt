Couple of old 2014 broadcasts from @LaveRadio for @Jorki Rasalas thread, dunno if you got these already or not. First is DB at Inside Games Showcase, second is LR interview with DB afterwards. Nothing about Raxxla or DW, bit of background lore though, and the 'Hold on a minute David!' thought that comes from his description of landing on lush planets filled with animal life...that you can hunt and chop off the horns to sell! The mans a monster I tell you! Although he does say afterwards its to highlight the ethics of killing large animals for tiny bits of them, but by then its too late sound is a bit dodgy as they say themselves but perfectly audible.

>The crew go planetside to visit Frontier at the Inside Games Showcase event held by Bafta. We sit in on David Brabens talk about the current development cycle.
