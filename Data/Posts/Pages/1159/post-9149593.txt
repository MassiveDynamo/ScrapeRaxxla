I am still under the impression that Raxxla is the area between hyperspace that you travel...A trip "everyone" has to make, which is in the game we just cant stop into the area yet, this area is always the same some variations are only depending on the rotation you take through it however even the new different looking version in Alpha is still the same variable rotation, where does the fsd bring you through to travel to stars and where its actual location is within the galaxy (has to be related with the creation of the fsd and where it was made within the core systems by Sirius corp) with the is the mystery as before fsd we had beacons, outpost etc navigated between systems which is still cannon yet they dont exist
