This game is infuriating at times. Yesterday I traveled 30 mins to the new horizons probe in Sol and was carrying an AI relic, anyway I dropped it near the probe for no other reason than "reasons" and instantly a search and rescue ship dropped in, fired a limpet out, nicked it and started to jump out. I obviously shot at it and was carrying hatch breakers so fired some out which instantly spawned a couple of system security.

I obviously lost the relic, it's such a stupid "breaking" mechanic having ships appear out of no where, 3million LS away from the star.
That's hilarious and infuriating all at the same time! Sad you lost a relic
