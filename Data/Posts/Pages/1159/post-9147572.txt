Funny thing about Altuxor. It has a sea called the Paluberion Sea. So does Lave.
Holdstock reuses that name, as well as the Raxxla name.
Ya i get the impression he had a fascination with Ideal Types.... he would pick up a theme and repeat it changing it throughout several books. Thats why I think that people who look at his Alien World or Dark Wheel for info on Raxxla might want to look at some of his earlier works to see how the ideas developed. ... Wonder what Paluberion refers to?

edit: Ah palus - latin for marshy.....
