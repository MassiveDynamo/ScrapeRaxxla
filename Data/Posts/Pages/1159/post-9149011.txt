Hi, I've been reading through a few pages here and there. Many interesting theories and ideas!

I was wondering how likely it is that finding Raxxla is tied to discovering something with a specific ship. Would it be possible to limit finding answers to a parameter like that?
While I do agree with the gang that it is not likely, I nonetheless have a kitted out Cobra MKIII that I do most of my system investigations in, just in case!
Additionally, I try to just keep my eyes out for things while flying different ships... it can't hurt (until you start putting major time into it, which I have no intention of doing).
