2014 EGX appearance and presentation by DB between Beta 1 release & Beta 2 due a few days after.

Again talks about hunting animals on distant worlds but most interesting for us here talks about Ocellus Stations being designed to have engines fitted and 'driven' to the System for various reasons such as a gold-rush mining location....could explain the DW Station and may even suggest its moving within / between Systems, like some of the Gen Ships did before being discovered.
