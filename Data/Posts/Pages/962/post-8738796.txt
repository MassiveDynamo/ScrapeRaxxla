I’m starting to think Triton (not Lucifer) is what we’re looking for. It’s a young “unremarkable moon” and was captured by Neptune in a way that indicates it came from the Kuiper belt (or outside our solar system in this case) making it a unique object in the solar system.
Raxxla was public knowledge by the time Tau Ceti was colonized...Tau Ceti was the first colony outside of Sol, meaning the Raxxla myth started either in Sol or Tau Ceti.

Alex Ryder tells us as much with the way he named his sons Neptune and Oberon. Neptune Ryder wanted to find Raxxla. Neptune is a hint to Triton, one of two permit locked bodies in Sol. The way to get these permits is unknown.

Oberon wanted to find Soontill. Both brothers found Soontill. Oberon is a hint to Thargoids. Oberon is King of Fairies in Midsummer Nights Dream. His Queen Titania and him begin quarreling causing a lot of confusion. This is reference to Klaxian Thargoids and Oresrian Conflict. Titania fell in love with a mechanic...perhaps this is a reference to the Ryder brothers working with Soontill. Liz Ryder and “terrorists” are using modified thargoid explosives, allegedly.

We need to copy the Ryder brothers and choose to go after Soontill rather than Raxxla. Raxxla is permit locked and being exploited. We have Thargoid Probe, Sensor, and Array. That had hidden messages in them, in audio and Morse code. Thats the Dark Wheels test. Use the probes, find Soontill, then comes Raxxla.

It's also said if you bend over far enough backwards you can see Oberon and Titania orbiting Uranus
