Updated this plugin in last 2 days:
https://github.com/alexzk1/EDMC_EDSMStatus

What it do, when you select system on map it talks (plays mp3 there) if your current selection is known for EDSM. Also it is shown in "Jump to".
Today I added automatic distancing. If you click 2 stars on galaxy map and both are known to edsm it will calculate distance and show there.
So cool tool to measure of farmost sides.

When I say "click" I mean "select as jump target".

Also on Linux you can regulate volume in settings. Did not implement on win/mac as I don't have them.
