Greetings again. In my latest travels I noticed the closest body was identified at one point as 'Sol 9+10'. This was observed near to Charon, travelling from the Ariel NPC when near Earth. After doing what I wanted to do on Charon, I again observed this closest body when returning towards Earth.

I don't recall seeing this closest body elsewhere in the Sol system, apologies if there is an obvious reason for it that I am overlooking.
(& have shared here as my previous efforts trying to find the comet in Pareco suggests I am no good at finding closest bodies)




edit: & now I'm looking at the closest body in more detail I'm seeing Sol9+10 elsewhere. Never mind, back to the drawing board
