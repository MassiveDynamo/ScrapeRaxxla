I was more interested as to whether the in game codex is translated as 'pearl' - there are links with the Alien Worlds book..

Also jewel and gemstone may need to be interpreted differently. If 'pearl' is closer to their intent, then thinking of gemstones is the wrong idea.
That would be an interesting distinction as the term 'jewel' tilts off in the direction of jewellery, where a semi / precious mineral of some description is mounted to form an item of greater perceived value.

It's not a single homogeneous item, it's more of a conglomerate, which more aptly describes planets.
