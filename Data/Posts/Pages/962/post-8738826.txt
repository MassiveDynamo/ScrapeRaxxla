Found my original copy of The Dark Wheel last night ecstatic! Found the games a few months ago but the novella was missing, thought Id lost it forever.

I have a Cobra iii called 'Flashback' with the ID of 1984...glad to see its not just me

Well seeing as we are now in the full spirit of Frontier by providing 'Patch' notes we should limit that patch to only people who contribute to this thread. No printing it off afterwards folks!
