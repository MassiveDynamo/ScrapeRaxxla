I meant that the pearl has a figurative meaning ...
perhaps it means something secret, unique

I was more interested as to whether the in game codex is translated as 'pearl' - there are links with the Alien Worlds book..

Also jewel and gemstone may need to be interpreted differently. If 'pearl' is closer to their intent, then thinking of gemstones is the wrong idea.
