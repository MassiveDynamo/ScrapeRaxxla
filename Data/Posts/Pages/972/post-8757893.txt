I think by "lore" they specifically mean Elite / Elite Dangerous lore.
Also there's an area of space LITERALLY CALLED "The Void". That particular wording gets referenced A LOT. Might wanna do a deep-dive there, if anyone has a ship with long jump reaches...
Quite a time ago, was it in this thread, someone mentioned a list of systems names containing the letters '…RA XX-L A…'. And I found that list even more appealing when I recognized that the only system in that list that not exactly contained RAXXLA – PHEIA BRA XX-L C7-0 – was buried deep in "THE VOID". Let me tell you, you do neither dive deep in the void nor do you climb high. You take whatever route you can get to your goal… (that could be a reason to have a FC )
In the end it was a challenging and therefore nice trip but surprise: No Raxxla! After visiting PHEIA BRA XX-L C7-0 I poked around in the void only a little but I did not find anything suspicious.
