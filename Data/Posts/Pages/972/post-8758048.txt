Just for information, I'm in the Void atm. Been there since last December. However, I've been inactive for much of that.

By NS do you mean neutron star? I believe the codex only ever shows the first one registered to it, and a second one for the first you visit yourself. I can definitely say I've visited more than one neutron star in the region.

Welcome back stranger! Not heard from you since DW2!
Yes, I forgot it only shows the first one...
