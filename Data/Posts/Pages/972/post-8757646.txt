Probably not important but I noticed that the name Imogen is used for the third time, for a Galnet character.

First: Imogen Gabrielini (aka Eccy G.), Aislings mother: https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/5f64d21fe255f63e2b17985a
Second: Dr Imogen Ryang, museum historian: https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/5c654c658e7e7d1ef82cf56c
Third: Imogen Luciana, Imperial Ambassador: https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/5f8eccd964813d010413e662

Coincidence or hidden message?
I’ve noticed this as well. From a writing standpoint you’d try to make sure there’s variation in the names of your characters. Not continuously reuse the same name unless.

Others will tell you it means nothing but I think it could be something. I have to find the exact quote but I’m pretty sure one of Drew’s characters mentions there’s a pattern and connection between various stories and events that get put into Galnet. She says that they’re all related and then ends up investigating Wreaken Construction.

Either you’re starting to see the light Han Zen or you’re descending into madness. 400 Billion star systems and a needle in a haystack. Statistically the odds are very much against anyone solving the mystery without a little nudge in the right direction.

The question is what are they making obvious?

Edit: From a quick read, Imogen is a character in two of Shakespeare’s plays. Once as a “Ghost Character” meaning a character who’s inclusion in the script appears to be accidental because they never take the stage and don’t have any lines. Once as an actual character with a role involving someone trying to seduce her and decapitation.
