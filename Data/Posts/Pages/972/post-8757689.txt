To add fuel to the fire which I’m sure I’ll be criticized for. Imogen is used 3 times like you said Han Zen.

Once in an article referring to stolen pieces of artwork. In that article 3 pieces are stolen. 2 of these works of art are real and you can look them up. One of these works of art is fictional as in made up by Galnet’s writers and named Terra Absentia.
Perhaps it’s a watchword for something missing or lost.
Terra: Land
Absentia: In absence or missing
Seems very much on the nose to me.

The name is used again in an article describing the discovery of a lost nuclear missile that was rediscovered.

It was used again in the article about dead mother of Aisling and wife of now deceased Harold Duval.
