Drew got to see behind the scenes for this last book, I don’t believe he’s telling the full truth about not knowing anything regarding Raxxla or Soontill or whatever we call it, nor could he admit it if he wanted to. NDA...

He usually says he cant talk about things due to NDA. He doesnt usually deny any knowledge.

Why would he know? Who would tell him and why exactly?

and interestingly nearby is “Wagar’s Reach”

Wagars Reach was an unofficial player named area. When they got changed from numbers to names Wagas Reach was submitted to Frontier and they chose something else. The map with Wagars Reach on is the unofficial player named map while they were still Numbers but before being named.
