I think by "lore" they specifically mean Elite / Elite Dangerous lore.
Also there's an area of space LITERALLY CALLED "The Void". That particular wording gets referenced A LOT. Might wanna do a deep-dive there, if anyone has a ship with long jump reaches...

Just for information, I'm in the Void atm. Been there since last December. However, I've been inactive for much of that.

In the Codex there’s one NS reported in The Void, Flyae Proae LC-S d5-2
it’s a long way out!!

And The Void is galactic region 42 (https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_regions), and interestingly nearby is “Wagar’s Reach”. I found Void Passage and it’s on EDSM-star islands need 100ly jump range so plenty of jumponium!

But I’m sure I’ve seen another mention of “void”...
Edit: “void extract coffee” (can I have one with my lavian brandy please?) but think also something like “Silentium Void”...
Edit2: ah, “Solitude Void”, region 40, left of Silentium

By NS do you mean neutron star? I believe the codex only ever shows the first one registered to it, and a second one for the first you visit yourself. I can definitely say I've visited more than one neutron star in the region.
