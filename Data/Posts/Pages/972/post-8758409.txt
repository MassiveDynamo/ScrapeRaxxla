Yeah, only been playing again in spurts. I actually haven't been back to the bubble since we set off. I did turn up long after everyone else had finished, made the detour to Colonia (didn't make it to BP this time around), had my Asp E transferred there, then headed out to the Void in it.

I got to BP then, because there was no official return route planned, went back via Jaques & scanned a few undiscovered BH on the way. But I decided to get back to the bubble & Quest for Raxxla/TDW again- itâ€™s addictive, but frustrating!
