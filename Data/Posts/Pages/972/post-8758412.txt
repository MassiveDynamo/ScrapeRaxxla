A few days back I was asking here about which star would be towards "east/right" on the galaxy... and here is the reason:

I arrived at Shinrarta, found a signal source Convoy [Thread 0] and decided to drop at it just to find 4 NPCs (the Keelback was loaded with 31 Trinkets).
The NPCs were chatting to each other as follows (see picture)

Let me know what you think about it and also consider the video

Happy hunting!

I’ve seen the same convoy messages, might have been in LAWD26 as I thought at the time there might be a way to get to the unknown-permit-locked Witches Reach which had convoys inserted ages ago.

So I think it’s just standard npc chatter. Perhaps Witches Reach is Neverland...any other in-game links to Peter Pan?


Edit: Mmm, where did I put htose red sparkly shoes...
