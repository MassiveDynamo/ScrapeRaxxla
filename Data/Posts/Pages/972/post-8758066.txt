Tiny bit obvious so players know what they are doing...

Infinite Scan

Thargoid bases - carry UA to open door - star map mechanism has holograms of objects needed - next bit hmmm, but Canon et al got there - follow the line - follow the line - land at the pointer
Tharg stuff - honk - 'listen to them' - solution (how to doesnt mean can understand what it means eg wireframe missed by many)

Guardian Sites - Key Sites - experimentation not that hard - selectable objects - Ground Sites - Towers pop up as you drive around - selectable objects hint - other towers similar to Key sites, once one charged by experimentation just a case of finding the others - end point selectable for BP

Guardian 'Doors' - ???

FSS now easily IDs sites & all POI / USS
DSS makes finding them much easier and scans Rings

Just musings about how much thought needs to go into 'activating' something currently. Most if not all players would get there with most stuff. Interpreting some of it is way beyond the average player I would suggest but individuals or teams have seen 'something' and built on it and often been proven right or revolutionary. Some of it is easily interpretable by selectable objects.

So are we missing something? Have we not interpreted something we already know about? All those sounds and beeps from objects all over, is there more than one layer somewhere?
