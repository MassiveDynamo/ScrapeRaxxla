Ah, but I don’t believe Lyta Crane’s claim that it orbits an 8th moon! I think the codex pours sufficient doubt on that claim that it’s likely a red herring. What about all the potential blue-green GG with 0, 1 to 7 moons? If you discount those you could have filtered the correct system out.

It could be something to mention to the Potato Hunters. I think they may send John Wick after you though... A full 500ly scan of all blue/green gas giants would surely run into the tens of thousands. Too much for a spreadsheet-based hunt. Their current one covers thousands of systems... I'll make sure that some of their guys see this


edit: A quick bit of research shows that I'm wrong. They are covering 67,000 systems... . I should let them point it out though... just for points!
