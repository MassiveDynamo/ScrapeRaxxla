I'm curious about where the 3 GG requirement came from as well. Is that something I somehow missed during all my manic querying?

I suspect Alexzk misunderstood what I was saying (don't think English is his first language). I was suggesting looking for a Type 3 gas giant which seems to match the “blue-green” description of AHTW.
