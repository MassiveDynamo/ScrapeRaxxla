That was the bit I missed somehow, all makes sense now, thanks



Aaaargh, trigger, youve seen the 'Combat Aftermath' with the Thargs right? The ones with 6 or so Imp Cruiser (a fleet) in smoke and sometimes theres a Tharg there? So a few more ships, we've all seen Asteroid fields! I mean! Since 1984! Its in Oolite and I never even knew of that until after ED!



Thats perfect English but I have no idea what it means or how to do it.

I use laptop for Internet and Office etc only. Not a programmer. Jason is a friend of mine, JSON I still have no clue, guessing from context theyre not a Drill Rapper (whatever that is). Jorki is way ahead of me in tech, I dont even know what theyre on about, but I got the idea of what they wanted to so and seen many posts asking for similar but different searches so hoped an online one could be developed for everyone like EDSM.

JSON is a data file format
Jason went walkabout sailabout on the good ship Argo, with some good-for-nuthin chums (nauts)

Oh, and SQL is standard Query Language to access databases. Not used that for around 30 years.
