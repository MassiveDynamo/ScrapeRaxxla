ay up, lad..

We already did that last year.. The issue with AHTW, is that it was written before ED was finished, so things like the dark systems don't exist, and the system description doesn't match exactly. The location is reasonably good, but leaves plot holes.

The JSON search of all 8th moons within 500ly of sol is being done by the Great Raxxla Potato Hunt group and is about 1/4 done I think....

Eyoop mate!
Ah, but I don’t believe Lyta Crane’s claim that it orbits an 8th moon! I think the codex pours sufficient doubt on that claim that it’s likely a red herring. What about all the potential blue-green GG with 0, 1 to 7 moons? If you discount those you could have filtered the correct system out.
