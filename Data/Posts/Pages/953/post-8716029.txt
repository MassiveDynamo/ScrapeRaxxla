Seems to me that a lot of the RAXXLA breadcrumbs have been blown way off course to lead to anything substantial. I've decided to go back to basics and look in game for RAXXLA. No lore books, Ancient Greek or Egyptian mythology etc. I came to a conclusion that some clues (if they were clues in the first place?) were/are being overly thought out way too much and kind of getting lost in translation. Nothing wrong in that, just a bit far fetched IMO.

So I've decided that I am starting to look for something that's not visible in game, if that makes any sense. I.E. Comets. Recently I saw a thread where they have been found (shown on nav panel) a little while ago. I've started in the Tau Ceti system. I have spent the last 2 days trying to find out what the hell "Avogadro Enterprise" is orbiting (maybe nothing, but!!). When I find out then I'll move on to the next when I discover where the next candidate is. (surely there can't be that many comets in game can there? lol)

Again this may be overly thinking on my part but RAXXLA may be somthing so simple as a comet or even a comet is the gateway to RAXXLA. Who knows? If I find anything then I'll find out one way or another. After all the journey is most of the fun and I've decided to simplify mine (So I believe!).
