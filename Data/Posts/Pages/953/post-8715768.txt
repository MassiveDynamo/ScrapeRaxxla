Not sure what "subdwarf" means >: Like body? But then main star must be huge O/B like and list is short.
For API limit was 100ly around, so doing next:
Center: Sol
Radius: 100ly
Main star: M dwarf
Must have at least 3 giants.

Why are you filtering on “must have at least 3 GG”?

If I remember the star classifications correctly “subdwarf” would be a type M VI ( that matches the codex pic after colour correction to make the rear station lights match those of Aulin Enterprise), however it might be safer to filter on any M type regardless of subtype. I guess within a 150ly radius of Sol since the Wiki says that is the size of the bubble.

AHTW says:

SPOILER

I don’t know if that means there is only an M type, asteroid belt, and a single Type3 GG in the system, or whether there are other planets. I suspect only a single GG in such a system would be very unusual? I’m also assuming the quote means a Type 3 GG from Sudarsky’s classification (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudarsky's_gas_giant_classification).

Edit: noting the statement about the station’s gravity level it might perhaps be sensible to filter on a radius around Achenar?
