I wouldn't hold my breath expecting them to make much match from the books. They couldn't even be bothered to put Tionisla orbital cemetery in. I can't imagine that would have been any harder than anything else they'd handcrafted.

Nah, it would need thousands of orbiting objects in one instance to do it justice. Fairly sure the game design prohibits that.
