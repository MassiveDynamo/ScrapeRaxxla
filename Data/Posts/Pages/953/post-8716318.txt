Nah, it would need thousands of orbiting objects in one instance to do it justice. Fairly sure the game design prohibits that.
It wouldn't need to be that big. Also if you replace the word objects with asteroids it describes every ring.

They would only need to be a shell not a functioning usable ship. I've seen some pretty crazy mods in some games, I bet someone could make a mod that could make every asteroid in a ring appear as a randomized ship instead. Idk about on elite or how any of that is done. But that is a pretty weak excuse for them. Game design shouldn't prohibit game designers. I feel like its only limited by their own willingness to do so
