A thought occurred that TDWâ€™s stealthy station might be the same in-game as in the AHTWheel story

That was the bit I missed somehow, all makes sense now, thanks

I wouldn't hold my breath expecting them to make much match from the books. They couldn't even be bothered to put Tionisla orbital cemetery in. I can't imagine that would have been any harder than anything else they'd handcrafted.

Aaaargh, trigger, youve seen the 'Combat Aftermath' with the Thargs right? The ones with 6 or so Imp Cruiser (a fleet) in smoke and sometimes theres a Tharg there? So a few more ships, we've all seen Asteroid fields! I mean! Since 1984! Its in Oolite and I never even knew of that until after ED!

Yes you can, if you clone whole SQL DB to own server (100+Gb) then you can type any wishes in console.
Until then you have to use allowed interface which is limited.

Thats perfect English but I have no idea what it means or how to do it.

I use laptop for Internet and Office etc only. Not a programmer. Jason is a friend of mine, JSON I still have no clue, guessing from context theyre not a Drill Rapper (whatever that is). Jorki is way ahead of me in tech, I dont even know what theyre on about, but I got the idea of what they wanted to so and seen many posts asking for similar but different searches so hoped an online one could be developed for everyone like EDSM.
