Oh, a mention. =]

The Great Raxxla Potato Hunt has a search radius of 200 lightyears, which is 68,000 systems, and we are about 31% complete as of writing. That's based on Drew's hyperspace development lore, which mention the limitations in travel distances when Raxxla was first mentioned. (This may or may not be accurate now.)

We do map 8th moons when we see them. I was pointed at an older list that someone compiled off EDSM, and that is available on our status tracker if anyone wants to target those sections. That said, we sometimes come across 8th-moons not on that list. I don't know if that's a red herring or not, but it's part of our procedure because it's worth checking.

I do believe that the Dark Wheel is related to finding Raxxla. I also think that relying on first-hand evidence by looking at the clues in the game itself is the best way to find leads. But the Potato Hunt is first and foremost a survey of the near-bubble region - a dragnet for clues - so we are certain that no obvious leads have been missed.

(Also, we can always use more help searching... o7)
