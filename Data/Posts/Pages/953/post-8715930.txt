What are we doing now? I'm lost

Whilst you people of programming are watching and here, in my mind I have an vision of a database we can all 'question' a la EDSM or Inara. Where we can choose number of Stars, Planets, Moons, GG and other system bodies or filters. Not to find the closest station but the closest system with an A star with 8 bodies, 3 HMC, 2GG & 3 IW, secondary G with 2 Ast fields, 6 IW for example?.

I only know enough to know / imagine its a ton of work but I dont know how much Im asking....Anybody up for having a go?
