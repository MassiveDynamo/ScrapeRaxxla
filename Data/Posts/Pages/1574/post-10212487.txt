I’m not all convinced about the 7th moon bit of the codex, sounds like obfuscation to me. Lyta Crane’s name sounds too made up also-LYT dark systems? Crane could be Corona Australis (CrA) or Crab Nebula?
(Edit: I’ve visited both!)

Yes, I think several systems (including Terra Mater) were permit locked with permits obtainable from adjacent system megaships a few years ago, i.e. well after game launch. But I don’t know if Terra Mater was permit locked before that.

It’s not at all clear how to find the “omphalos rift device” or how to activate it. I visited and honked the two installations by Terra Mater 6, docked and investigated the homing lights in GR8MINDS Coriolis....
The Terra Mater system was permit-locked at launch but the permit-giving faction did give out the permit from systems they had a presence in.
I made it my business in 3301 to get all the permits I could and the Terra Mater permit was probably the hardest to get, as the anarchy faction that gave it out had only a small presence in one system at the time (during 1.3 iirc), so missions for them were scarce. It took me the better part of a week, playing more than I am able to these days.
