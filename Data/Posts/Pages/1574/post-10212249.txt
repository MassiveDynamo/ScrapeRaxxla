I’m not at all convinced about the 7th moon bit of the codex, sounds like obfuscation to me. Lyta Crane’s name sounds too made up also-LYT dark systems? Crane could be Corona Australis (CrA) or Crab Nebula?
(Edit: I’ve visited both!)

Yes, I think several systems (including Terra Mater) were permit locked with permits obtainable from adjacent system megaships a few years ago, i.e. well after game launch. But I don’t know if Terra Mater was permit locked before that.

It’s not at all clear how to find the “omphalos rift device” or how to activate it. I visited and honked the two installations by Terra Mater 6, docked and investigated the homing lights in GR8MINDS Coriolis....
