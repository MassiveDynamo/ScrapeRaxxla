The Narcissus has an interesting Floral diagram:
No such thing as a silly idea…

The Narcissus diagram is a brilliant connection!

I think this is something worth considering… O7 we have touched on this concept of flowers before with Asphodels. But I never made the jump to Daffodils!

Not a botanist, but quick search, the flower Narcissus is commonly known as a Daffodil, a derivative of Asphodel / Asphodelus / Jonquil?

‘The poet’s flower’.

The system Persephone and ‘Asphodel’ are slap-bang in the Lost Realms area, very close to Axis Mundi, I’ve looked previously but couldn’t detect anything in ‘Legacy’.

Worth further scrutiny I think.
