Also, before the Emperor's ascension, her senatorial seat as a Lavigny was... Facece. A system which already raised plenty of suspicion, as it is.
Florence Lavigny has probably conducted the most masterfull coup in galactic history. She has taken the Empire from the Duval family.
Her husband Prince Aristid Lavigny was murdered by Emperor Hengist Duval, back in the early 3250s. Arissa was only a few years old at this time.

It's not quite clear if Florence actually had an affair with the Emperor or if she has manipulated the DNA of her daughter, as revenge for the murder.

The eventual death of Hengist Duval, very likely happened on her orders. The final act, when she knew she had consolidated the position of her daughter.

Florence, Felicia and Jasmina has shadow influence of one superpower each. It's quite a cabal of flower girls.
