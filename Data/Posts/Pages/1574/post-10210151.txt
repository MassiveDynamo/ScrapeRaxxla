Asphodel is realy a different flower. Probably just the Brits having trouble differentiating and messing up the names.

Never the less, asphodel is kind of important in the Greek underworld: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphodel_Meadows
Sources I just found said daffodil is an English derivative.

Daffodil is the common name in the genus Narcissus of which there are over 50 species. The name daffodil is an alteration of Asphodel with which it is commonly compared!

The Narcissus flower is of the genus Daffodil and Jonquil, while Daffodils are a particular type of Narcissus plant… So technically not the same but they are commonly associated together!

As mentioned previously we collectively have considered Asphodel, but on its own it wasn’t enough to warrant a genuine find, but that diagram of a daffodil is really far too close to the Raxxla logo, that might be the keystone to solidify that area as a key point of interest!

Certainly needs further scrutiny.
