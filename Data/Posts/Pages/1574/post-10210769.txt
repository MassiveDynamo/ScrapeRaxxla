Drinking might be ok? Eating is no no.
Still don’t see why you want those mini bottles, when you never fly without several full sized bottles onboard.
You’ve sneaked a peek into my cockpit!
But you missed several barrels in the galley!!

But I thought Raxxla was full of treasure...
which must mean the bottles of Lavian brandy are at least Methuselah or Salmanzar-sized,
minibar bottles dont count!
