Not in game today but checked EDSM and Asphodel is inhabited and has an Earth-like World, Irving World, which has a moon, Irving's Moon. The moon has two orbital stations: Saavik's Sanctuary and John Irving Station. I wonder if the names are from a Kickstarter backer? Or do they mean anything else to anyone?
I like the idea of taking something, in the legends a flower, and getting pulled into the underworld and wonder if this means that there's something in the system we need to take, e.g. into cargo, for the next step in the search.
