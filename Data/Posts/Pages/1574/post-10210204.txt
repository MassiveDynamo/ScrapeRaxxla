Silly hypothesis coming up!

I've been re-reading the abduction of Persephone myth. I think the story is interesting because Persephone has a system, a planet and a station in ED. In addition there are several uses of the name Cora. I've used this version: https://www.greekmyths-greekmythology.com/myth-of-hades-and-persephone/
The second version, that includes Demeter (no fun without her). the story is simple:

Demeter and Persephone descends to earth.
Demeter has some agri. business, Persphone plays with friends (Nerids and Naiads).

We have all read this story. Nothing new here. What I started to wonder about was the flower. It acts as a plug to the portal of the underworld.
The Narcissus has an interesting Floral diagram:


And an interesting Floral formula:




Notis the Mercury symbol.

Here comes the silly hypothesis:

Raxxla is controlled by a sinister cabal. They are not the wicked men that Rafe Zetter tells about. They are wicked women. They all carry flower names and control important positions. Examples are:

Also, before the Emperor's ascension, her senatorial seat as a Lavigny was... Facece. A system which already raised plenty of suspicion, as it is.
