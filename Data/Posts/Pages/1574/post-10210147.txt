No such thing as a silly idea…

The Narcissus diagram is a brilliant connection!

I think this is something worth considering… O7

Not a botanist, but quick search, the flower Narcissus is commonly known as a Daffodil, a derivative of Asphodel / Asphodelus?

The poet’s flower.

The system Persephone and Asphodel are slap-bang in the Lost Realms area, very close to Axis Mundi, I’ve looked but couldn’t detect anything in ‘Legacy’.

Worth further scrutiny I think.
Asphodel is realy a different flower. Probably just the Brits having trouble differentiating and messing up the names.

Never the less, asphodel is kind of important in the Greek underworld: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphodel_Meadows
