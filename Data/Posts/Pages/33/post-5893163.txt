I, for myself, take the word "universes" in a less specific way (my RP character helps...), like 'other distant parts of the MW" ... including maybe some exotic locked regions. No time 'travel' as relativity is slippery ground in E: D where even light is faster than light although lacking Le Guin's ansibles .
But I must admit I would LOVE to find Raxxla and eventually be able to 'jump' to Magalh√£es ...

Ah, my Bene Gesserit despising friend, given the likely contraction of 'other galaxies' to 'distant parts of the MW' with respect to Galactic Hyperdrives, would not Raxxla, when found, consequently transpire to be a portal other galaxies...

(And apologies in advance if my Portuguese / Frank Herbert masterpiece knowledge has let me down on that last word )
