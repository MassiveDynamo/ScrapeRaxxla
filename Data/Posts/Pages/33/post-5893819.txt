Dammit, I was going to ask Acid for the rationale, but I'll just have to respond to this instead!

I'm not sure it is logical for the Guardians homeworld to be Raxxla. In the end the homeworld was pretty much religous/anti-tech and that's coming from a general tech level that was ahead of ours but not by a huge amount. That's not Raxxla.

Potentially the Exiles could have returned to the homeworld after the main line of Guardian society was wiped out and continued their accelerating advancement there. It's not an unlikely scenario that they would have returned to the homeworld of their species IMHO btw - it's just there's nothing lore wise at present to indicate that it happened.

Also, wasn't it fossils that was found on Mars rather than an artefact? My understanding is that the (still unidentified) alien relic/artefact was found in space.

Good point about the homeworld! But if Raxxla is a Guardian world then it could be any of them, and probably one we haven't found yet. Or all of them together if the machinery was working -a mechanism to jump between sites??

tourist beacon 0175: "In 2280, the first non-human relic was found in space. The object was found buried on Mars; it was no bigger than a child's hand and is still surrounded in secrecy, even in 3300. No information has ever been circulated as to the properties of this item or its origin, other than it is non-human" so a relic rather than an artefact; could be a fossil of some form but it has properties, so seems to me more like it has some functionality, i.e. a device
