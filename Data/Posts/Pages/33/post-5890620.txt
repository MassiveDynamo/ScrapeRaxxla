Happy not Labor Day Meatbags!!

Just our weekly check in. We went to one of our old sites and activated it, downloaded the battle plan...erm...star map, and helped fertilize a few of the eggs. Can't let those "scavengers" have all the fun can we? During our journeys we have no new info on Raxxla, but we do have a lead to check on once we figure out where the constellation Orion is in game. For now, we are preparing for a storm.

use earth as a start point then point your ship at the orion constellation, then in put the names of each star in the search tab and it should show them. me personally i think raxxla is possibly in one of 2 places:

1) exactly opporsite earth on the other side of SagA

or

2) is some where in the center of the guardian bubble and raxxla was the guardian home world
