Decided to have a search on PS4 (already done some on PC from Colonia), CMDR now Elite, Allied with Dark Wheel, and in a Cobra MK3 (in case that makes a difference ).
Been to Ticushpakhi, LTT 16456, and Obotrimi but no clues I can see...

This did get me wondering: if Sir DB hinted it's possible to find, but this was before Horizons, then it can not therefore be planetary related.
Ergo must be a station, outpost, POI, module collectable via cargo scoop, and so on. Basic game mechanics only?

3) Raxxla is Sgr A*. Only fixed point in the Milky Way, supermassive Black Hole, opening a wormhole to other universes, Door and Key. A place, but not really a place.

Who is going to try it ? [big grin]
For science!
