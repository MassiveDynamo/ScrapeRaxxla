use earth as a start point then point your ship at the orion constellation, then in put the names of each star in the search tab and it should show them. me personally i think raxxla is possibly in one of 2 places:

1) exactly opporsite earth on the other side of SagA

or

2) is some where in the center of the guardian bubble and raxxla was the guardian home world

It would be logical for Raxxla to be the Guardian homeworld. They are the only source of ancient alien technology that we know of (though I'm still convinced there will be no gateway to other universes when it's finally found).

The way rumours work it might be in ED that a Guardian site was found and then it got twisted into "Raxxla", so since an alien artefact was found on Mars, then perhaps Triton as another possibility?
