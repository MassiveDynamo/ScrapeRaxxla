Good point about the homeworld! But if Raxxla is a Guardian world then it could be any of them, and probably one we haven't found yet. Or all of them together if the machinery was working -a mechanism to jump between sites??

tourist beacon 0175: "In 2280, the first non-human relic was found in space. The object was found buried on Mars; it was no bigger than a child's hand and is still surrounded in secrecy, even in 3300. No information has ever been circulated as to the properties of this item or its origin, other than it is non-human" so a relic rather than an artefact; could be a fossil of some form but it has properties, so seems to me more like it has some functionality, i.e. a device

Ah, fair enough on the Mars Relic then! I was going off that old interview with MB that was posted recently, but that tourist beacon statement is pretty clear!
