3) Raxxla is Sgr A*. Only fixed point in the Milky Way, supermassive Black Hole, opening a wormhole to other universes, Door and Key. A place, but not really a place.

Who is going to try it ? [big grin]

I've had the same thought, and I legitimately believe that it could well cover all the bases... although, the paltry lore we have on Raxxla means there aren't many bases to cover. But that pesky exclusion zone... Oh well.

I think that in the setting of a hard sci-fi novel, a supermassive black hole would be the perfect choice to represent Elite's Raxxla. In Elite: Dangerous, though... tough to wrap my head around getting it to work. Would require some way of breaking the known rules about interactions with non-landable bodies, most significantly the exclusion zone as mentioned above.

Maybe someone should take some SAP 8 cores and Trinkets out to Sag A*. Then if nothing becomes obvious with the special cargo, simply jettison them and let the behemoth swallow them!
