(though I'm still convinced there will be no gateway to other universes when it's finally found).

I, for myself, take the word "universes" in a less specific way (my RP character helps...), like 'other distant parts of the MW" ... including maybe some exotic locked regions. No time 'travel' as relativity is slippery ground in E: D where even light is faster than light although lacking Le Guin's ansibles .
But I must admit I would LOVE to find Raxxla and eventually be able to 'jump' to Magalh√£es ...
