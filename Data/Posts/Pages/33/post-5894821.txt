If Raxxla is connected to the Guardians, I don't think it's their home world.

I don't have any rational explanation for this. Raxxla just feels more like a far away place where the Guardians built an advanced structure, in their last days.

Perhaps the exiles used it to escape? Perhaps it was built by colonists from one of the three Arks?

We have three Guardian outpost regions, that are in the vicinity of Conflux, Hawkin's gap and Eafots. If these are connected to the three Ark's it means that they would have traveled for approximately 20,000 years. They may have arrived well after the fall of the Guardian bubble.
The network would still have been functioning though(it still is). They would have had access to all information about potential threats and to all new technology developed in their absence.

The homeworld doesn't seem likely to be Raxxla to me either, for reasons already given.


I think we can safely disassociate the arks from the outpost regions. The arks were the Guardian's first interstellar colonisation efforts, were non-FTL and were done primarily as to give a burgeoning population a means of continuing to grow. That pretty much certainly means they would have been to the closest suitable planets to the homeworld. Their arrival at their destinations is also covered. It basically goes:

- Arks Depart (the Arks remove increasing pressure over population levels and allow the majority of Guardian society to focus on researching interstellar travel & comms)
- FTL Comms developed & details transmitted to Arks while in transit
- Arks land and colonists establish FTL comms, putting in place the building blocks of their interstellar network
- Hyperspace developed
- Guardians expand into the universe


IMHO the only possible link between the Guardians and the creation of Raxxla is if it was made by the exiles, a long time after they were exiled.
