It would be logical for Raxxla to be the Guardian homeworld. They are the only source of ancient alien technology that we know of (though I'm still convinced there will be no gateway to other universes when it's finally found).

The way rumours work it might be in ED that a Guardian site was found and then it got twisted into "Raxxla", so since an alien artefact was found on Mars, then perhaps Triton as another possibility?

If Raxxla is connected to the Guardians, I don't think it's their home world.

I don't have any rational explanation for this. Raxxla just feels more like a far away place where the Guardians built an advanced structure, in their last days.

Perhaps the exiles used it to escape? Perhaps it was built by colonists from one of the three Arks?

We have three Guardian outpost regions, that are in the vicinity of Conflux, Hawkin's gap and Eafots. If these are connected to the three Ark's it means that they would have traveled for approximately 20,000 years. They may have arrived well after the fall of the Guardian bubble.
The network would still have been functioning though(it still is). They would have had access to all information about potential threats and to all new technology developed in their absence.
