It would be logical for Raxxla to be the Guardian homeworld. They are the only source of ancient alien technology that we know of (though I'm still convinced there will be no gateway to other universes when it's finally found).

The way rumours work it might be in ED that a Guardian site was found and then it got twisted into "Raxxla", so since an alien artefact was found on Mars, then perhaps Triton as another possibility?

Dammit, I was going to ask Acid for the rationale, but I'll just have to respond to this instead!

I'm not sure it is logical for the Guardians homeworld to be Raxxla. In the end the homeworld was pretty much religous/anti-tech and that's coming from a general tech level that was ahead of ours but not by a huge amount. That's not Raxxla.

Potentially the Exiles could have returned to the homeworld after the main line of Guardian society was wiped out and continued their accelerating advancement there. It's not an unlikely scenario that they would have returned to the homeworld of their species IMHO btw - it's just there's nothing lore wise at present to indicate that it happened.

Also, wasn't it fossils that was found on Mars rather than an artefact? My understanding is that the (still unidentified) alien relic/artefact was found in space.
