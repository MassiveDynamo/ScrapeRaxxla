Ok, visited Cass Z and Cass A, recorded the withspace sounds, both jumping to them and out of them, also had a previous recording from some random system.
All 5 were identical on the spectrum analyzer from 0 to 20kHz, so that's not where to look for the key to "Whisperer in witchspace, Siren of the deepest void". Either there's no key in witchspace sounds, or Cass Z/A are wrong systems, or that sound would appear only if you jump to the right system, either way - it's a dead end, IMO.

Did the same with Rho Casseiopeia out in the Formidine Rift, and also didn't find anything weird on the spectrum analyzer, nor in the system itself.

As a side note - google for "Siren of the void" does return a short story, written ~1y ago, the story ends this way:

And of course no coordinates were given

So, gotta get back looking for where that Siren of the void comes from and where it leads us.
If we assume, that it's greek mythology, are there any constellations, connected to Sirens?

There is an old former constellation from the 17th century called Siren:

Going counter-clockwise starting from the east, Siren is in the 8th sector (Libra), near the origin and next to Centaurus. I suppose you could derive relative position of the stars from the information given, but it's beyond me to identify which stars Siren is actually composed of.
