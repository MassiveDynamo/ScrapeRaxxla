FD must surely be grinning at reading some of the complex theories explained on here, they're wonderful ideas but maybe its a case of imagination filling in the blanks to make a story and there are a lot of blanks to fill with the whole DW and Raxxla thing.

Drew W is (was?) pretty sure only DB and MB know about Raxxla. Lot less of people grinning !
MB is a story-teller and made "..some of it a tiny bit obvious so people know what they are doing". He also made it as a personal journey.
The thing is... he's no longer the Maestro of ED and only the lost F/E missions gave that feeling of knowing what we were doing.... Imho.
I am not sure all this is still current...
But it was nice as long as it lasted...
