1. 48 O stars. All pointed at the Earth, because that's how the telescopes saw them, and the game data is imported from reality. But why aren't these stars numbered in order, from the tip of the arrow to the feathers? 33 34 46, 5 25 4, 10 9 3 12, 31 22 30, ... it's like a code. I'm looking for a piece of text to apply it to.

Well, Raxxla could be coded like 18-1-24-24-12-1
As for weired placed stars - there's not only that cupid's arrow, but much more of that kind, but don't think that will help.

Probably that DW toast should be read in constellations?
Like, we already found Cassiopeiae (Zeta, as far as we know, but might as well be Shedar, which is only yellow one out of main 5 stars of constellation).

I would not put to much into the various tourist beacons, that are outside the historical systems. The beacon at Merope 5C that mention COL 70 Sector(Out of sight. Not out of mind), was written by me.
Most other TBs are player written, as well.
Cupids Arrow is also a player invented name. The formation it self is just an artefact of poor distance measurement in RL star catalogues.
Part of those were put by dev's without player input, and some of those might be put in a way so they look like made by players, but they are not.
Might need a further investigaton. Is there a full list of those beacons?
