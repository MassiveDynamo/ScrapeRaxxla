Almost done with my survey of permit-locked systems (updated my post: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=7300892&viewfull=1#post7300892 ) but still have a couple of important systems to go (Achenar, Shinrarta Dezhra).
I doubt it's related to the search for The Dark Wheel or Raxxla but I'll mention it here anyway as it's one of the few things that stands out: in Facece (Imperial Navy permit-locked system), two of the six Capital Ship permanent POI locations turned out to be large wreck sites, in which a Majestic Interdictor then jumps in (The site closest to the star and the one around Facece 8). There has obviously been trouble if *two* attacks have taken place in the system housing the Imperial Navy's main shipyard. There was some radio chatter that was interesting: 'You don't think this is ... you know ... with all the rumours flying around?'. As I say, I doubt it's related to the search for Raxxla; I had been thinking that many wrecks like this could be down to 'Black Flight' but this seems a bit much, even for them. There was no sign of caustic clouds like when Thargoids attack, so maybe it is them, though?!
