What a great thread, ive only just found it.

FD must surely be grinning at reading some of the complex theories explained on here, they're wonderful ideas but maybe its a case of imagination filling in the blanks to make a story and there are a lot of blanks to fill with the whole DW and Raxxla thing.

I think Elite is the same now as before (80's and 90's) an old fashioned grind game where the games premise and objectives are very simple but appear much more complex because as above we the players make the stories.

So on that basis I'm guessing that both Raxxla and DW are just placed randomly in the galaxy and it is really just that simple. I am as i explore keeping an eye out and visiting the 8th moon of any gas giant when i find one. I would hope for some signal otherwise it would be impossible to manally notice a station in orbit or on any random planet in any random system we would simply all be long gone before anything was found if ever (more chance of monkeys with infinitie time writing the work of Shakespeare).

Perhaps there are objectivves to complete for DW to contact someone, Elite at one of the 3 and visited this or that place and maybe saved so many pods etc and it would then unlock the DW storyline but i'd have thought someone would have achieved this by now unless they are keeping quiet?.

All we've been told is that these things exist, lets hope its not just a myth someone in FD started to create curiosity and it got a bit out of hand so they all stuck with the story (myth)!. The mystery of their whereabouts is a clever touch but as i say i believe the answer is a simple one.
