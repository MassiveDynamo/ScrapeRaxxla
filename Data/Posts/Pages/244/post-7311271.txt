I'm just glad I'm not the only one who ventured to a distant star based on a hunch

Haha - I'm not alone then There was some logic behind it, based on it also being called "Herschel's Garnet" and appearing in roughly the right position to be at Cassiopiae's head. But yeah, nothing there except a couple of stars and a water world.

Am now heading back to Maia to get back on the tourist beacon trail.
