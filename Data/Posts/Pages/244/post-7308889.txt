Part of those were put by dev's without player input, and some of those might be put in a way so they look like made by players, but they are not.
Might need a further investigaton. Is there a full list of those beacons?

Most of the sightseeing beacons were submitted by players, in a dedicated forum thread. Those that are about local lore, are made by the FD.

Some are taken directly from Galnet or are edited versions of a Galnet post.
The Merope 5C TB, is taken from a Galnet article. https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/57c7fe999657badb5446a7f6

I don't think there are any complete list of TBs. There are many incomplete.
