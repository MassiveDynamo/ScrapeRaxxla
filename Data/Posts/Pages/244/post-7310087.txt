Ok, visited Cass Z and Cass A, recorded the withspace sounds, both jumping to them and out of them, also had a previous recording from some random system.
All 5 were identical on the spectrum analyzer from 0 to 20kHz, so that's not where to look for the key to "Whisperer in witchspace, Siren of the deepest void". Either there's no key in witchspace sounds, or Cass Z/A are wrong systems, or that sound would appear only if you jump to the right system, either way - it's a dead end, IMO.

As a side note - google for "Siren of the void" does return a short story, written ~1y ago, the story ends this way:
“I hear you saw a siren of the void. Mind tellin’ me where?”
They all blinked up at him stupidly. After a quiet minute, the greenhorn stuttered out the coordinates.
And of course no coordinates were given

So, gotta get back looking for where that Siren of the void comes from and where it leads us.
If we assume, that it's greek mythology, are there any constellations, connected to Sirens?
