I donâ€™t think we will find a cold station by scanning. We probably need to spot it manually and drop in manually.

I thought about flying around the planet trying to spot a station with the naked eye, but you would have to get really close to be able to see it. Another idea I had was to follow DW allied ships when they low wake to try see if you could catch one going there.
