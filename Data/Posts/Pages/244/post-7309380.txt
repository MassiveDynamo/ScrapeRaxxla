I have a theory about the location of the Dark Wheel station.
The codex entry for TDW mentions that the station is orbiting the eighth moon of an unknown gas giant.
I am also fairly certain, given Felicity Farseer's quote about imitators of TDW being silently removed, that the DW minor faction in Shinrarta is the real deal.
This leads me to believe that TDW station orbits Shinrarta Dezhra AB 2 H.

I don't know whether this is the right place to post this theory, but the way I see it, if we find TDW, we might get more information on how to find Raxxla.

I thought the same, although you could say that's the 9th moon. Anyways I had a scan of them a couple of weeks ago and couldn't find anything. Maybe you have to be invited by the DW first.
