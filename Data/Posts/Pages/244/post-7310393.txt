So just for the record: Iâ€˜ve been checking all systems that might contain words a Master Mason might find interesting. Count it off the list.

Sidenotes: Raxxla and its inhabitants dislike discovery thus I expect a dedicated defence upon discovery and currently use my Clipper which is severely armed but consider switching to Vette or Conda. Thoughts?

Second: Why is Triton Permit locked? Makes no sense.

Third: What do you all expect Raxxla will offer us? Another grindlocked Ram Tah receipe? Or something else like access to Andromeda?
