Might not be to do with raxxla but, on the cannon sheet of guardian ruins it is missing, perhaps unintentionally, 4 sites which is present in the NGC 3199 Nebula that a mate of me found, perhaps searching around them for some clues maybe an idea?
Gan Romeo had visions similar to The old president (her name escapes my lips), maybe he went to find more guardian sites or something like that? I’m not sure if his visions etc could have anything to do with raxxla but if they are and he’s connected to the old president who also ‘found’ the guardian sites, then perhaps they are related?
