Guess at that distance youâ€™d have to move nearer the ring to probe it (), effective range seems to be 0.3 to 1.0 ls.
Sometimes you also have to move to the other side of a gas giant to ensure you get 100% coverage

I keep forgetting that it was an L class star - so I couldn't probe it anyway

I'm pretty sure there's a bug report on gas giants with distant rings being unprobable though.
