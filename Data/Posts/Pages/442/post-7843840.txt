I believe we are on a fools errand cause of those perma locked systems...
I think that Raxlla if it is needed to go ahead with the 2020 update, is going to be discovered by someone that either gets to one of those 1st, or some random player gonna get a tip and find it...

Until i see proof that u can find it from FD without those perma locked areas being open, i think ill refrain from making my game all about this.
