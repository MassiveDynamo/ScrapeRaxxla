If four months spacing get you an entire system, I should go and spend that time near Tycho...
Who knows ?
Tyko Rasalas insists on at least one bottle of 5* lavian brandy before he allows anyone too close!

And I’ve just checked the forum to see what todays update is about, looked at FD online and Michael Brookes is-as Game Director!
So he hasn’t left us entirely, just gone quiet with his “hints”!!
How I miss the good old days-I’m coming up for 67, so I’m allowed to say that!

Edit: cant find any patch notes or notice on the update my PC is currently downloading. What gives?
