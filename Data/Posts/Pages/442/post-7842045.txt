In Tiapalan there is also a very large and thin ring. I crashed into it without seeing it. I wanted to scan that ring with the - how is this new scanner/probing thingy called - you know what I mean. My problem was that you have to target the central body and be close enough to fire the probes. I didn't manage to hit the ring that way. Perhaps you experienced the same with that ring? If somebody know how to hit such a ring with a probe I would be interested in how to do it. If there is no way to probe the ring, it would be a good place to obfuscate something in there…
On entry to a system you use the fss (full spectrum scanner) to identify and locate system bodies. When you find an interesting one you travel to it and use the dss (detailed surface scanner) by using it to fire probes. Target the body and approach it, select “surface scanner” (already set up as one of your fire groups), it will tell you when you’re in range. Zero throttle and enter dss. Fire your probes- move the reticle to align with the marker on the radial line to land a probe on the edge of the body, fire one directly at it, or go beyond the marker but not as far as the “miss” marker (I usually try half way between the two) to land a probe on the back of the body. If there is a body ring then if you move the radial line at some point it will say “ring”, fire then to hit the ring! You only need one probe to scan all the rings of a multi-ringed body.
