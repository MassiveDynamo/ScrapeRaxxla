So. Time for mission report: Went to Cimmerians DSS on all landables. Nothing found. Invaded some Imstallations got jaled and earnt some money. Yet nothing

Went to Styx: Nothing of interest.

Siidenote: Also went to Vega and used the FSS on Dixon. Now that might be interesting. Instead of garbled Nonsense there seems to be something about „Lakon“ when you use the FSS. As I'm on PS4 I'm a bit amiss about recording the message. Double checked with the base at Trikora btw. only garbled Nonsense there.

Did you hit Persephone (goddess of the Underworld) yet?
There's a system (contains nothing but an ELW), a station (in Avalon system) and a landable body in Sol system (which only got added to the game around v2.4). You might get some joy from the FSS and DSS.

Edit:
Also Osiris and Anubis might be worth a look-see.
