At 132 Ls out from the star, I was very much on the 'outer rim' of that particular ring

In Tiapalan there is also a very large and thin ring. I crashed into it without seeing it. I wanted to scan that ring with the - how is this new scanner/probing thingy called - you know what I mean. My problem was that you have to target the central body and be close enough to fire the probes. I didn't manage to hit the ring that way. Perhaps you experienced the same with that ring? If somebody know how to hit such a ring with a probe I would be interested in how to do it. If there is no way to probe the ring, it would be a good place to obfuscate something in thereâ€¦
