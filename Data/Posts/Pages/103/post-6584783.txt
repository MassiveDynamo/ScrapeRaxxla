Imho, Macros, you have answered your own question. FDevs did realize that someone inside a Cryo Pod can barely have an encounter with his own ghosts. So, instead of trying to convince us of their 'consistent' way of thinking, they just erase the whole thing and drop a couple of new Tharg ships into the playground to distract the pewpewKids.
Soon, Duke Nukem will offer more mysteries than ED...

About Cmdr Cly, I clearly remember crossing his way when searching for the first Guardian site, he was flying a Conda, congratulated him for finding Jaques, and then our courses diverged.

Honestly guys, I do not think the story situation is as bad as you think. To me it only seems like some threads of the tapestry have gone into the background.

I say this partially based on the AI side of things, which as far as I've seen has been virtually untouched beyond some initial seeds for most of the game so far, but is slowly starting to come back to the fore.

Perhaps I'm applying rose tinted glasses, but my genuine impression is otherwise. Or I hope so at least.
