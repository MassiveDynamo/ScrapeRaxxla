FDev did it when they realized people would notice plot-critical planets just popping into existence when updates were added. I do hope we get an in-universe explanation, though.

Perhaps we should call these regions "Content Locked" instead of "Permit Locked". There doesn't appear to be a valid permit to unlock those areas and they remain locked, presumably, because the required content for those areas has not yet been created.
