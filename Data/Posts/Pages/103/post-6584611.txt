I've also been waiting for more news on Halsey and her mysterious encounter with higher level beings... I'm still waiting for more news. Think you're right, some of the story arcs seems to have been for reasons unknown, abandoned.

Imho, Macros, you have answered your own question. FDevs did realize that someone inside a Cryo Pod can barely have an encounter with his own ghosts. So, instead of trying to convince us of their 'consistent' way of thinking, they just erase the whole thing and drop a couple of new Tharg ships into the playground to distract the pewpewKids.
Soon, Duke Nukem will offer more mysteries than ED...

About Cmdr Cly, I clearly remember crossing his way when searching for the first Guardian site, he was flying a Conda, congratulated him for finding Jaques, and then our courses diverged.
