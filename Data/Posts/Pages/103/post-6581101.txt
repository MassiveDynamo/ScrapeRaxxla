Lets try Galnet Connections possibly then. What about trying to rationalize and connect Halsey to the Mystery. Or anything else for that matter.

Jacques & Halsey.

Jacques encountered something. Something that was attracted by what we now know to be Thargoid sensors. We don’t know what that something was. All we know is that Jacques hasn’t shown any inclination to move since then.

Halsey also apparently encountered something. There’s nothing to directly connect the two except that Halsey has also not shown any inclination to move away from human space.

Space Madness? Brainwashing? A response to encountering a force so much more powerful that fleeing would be pointless? Or an encounter with something genuinely benevelont/reassuring?

On the Guardians front, I’ve said it many times, but prior to the exile, the implanted Guardians and their AI had pretty much reached a singularity and were starting to develop at a drastic rate. We don’t know what happened to the exiles, and we don’t know if they were hosting any AI when they were exiled. However, if that singularity was re-established, and then that rapidly increasing rate of development is extrapolated by 2 million years, then we get to some very interesting possibilities.

Halsey’s statements are very worth re-reading taking the above possibility into account.
