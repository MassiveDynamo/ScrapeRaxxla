Lave 2 is locked off for reasons related to Allen Stroud's Lave Revolution. It has nothing to do with Raxxla or Drew's Oolite Saga.

Speaking of Lave 2, did everyone spot this in the 3.0 patch notes:

"The inhabitants of Lave 2 have moved on after being isolated by their planet's permit and their settlements have been dismantled, so missions should no longer target this planet"?
