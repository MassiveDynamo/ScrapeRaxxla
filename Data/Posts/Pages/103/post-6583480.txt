I always wondered about the unknown CMDR Cly swooping in at the right moment, finding Jacques, and then swooping right back out again. Almost too good to be true. I've also been waiting for more news on Halsey and her mysterious encounter with higher level beings... I'm still waiting for more news. Think you're right, some of the story arcs seems to have been for reasons unknown, abandoned.

Latest patch seems to have deleted all the handcrafted local Galnet as well (assuming that is what they mean by "legacy" in the patch notes). Bets that when we can finally land on atmospheric planets that there is a heavy predominance of dinosaurs everywhere?

So much for finding any of the FR clues we might have missed there, among others.
