I think the most likely connection are the Guardians.
They have bases with artefacts, network portals and seem to be in to crystalls.

They are probably in some way connected to Halsey’s caretakers(constructs) and the Mars relic(implant).

If there is a planet out there, hidden from normal detection methods, they may well have putten something important there.

There’s certainly more going on with the Guardians story then goes out via Galnet.

The big question for me at the moment is who permit locked the core of what was the main Guardian bubble, when did they do it, and why.
