That is pretty much it.

A while back Drew had a page up on his site that supposedly contained all the related lore on Raxxla that he could reveal without breaching his NDA. The page has been pulled but others have archived it.

The only real Canon references I know of are the brief mention in And Here the Wheel and the existence of CoR in Premonition (CoR can't exist unless the belief in the existence of Raxxla is part of the Elite universe)

A bit late in responding, but the page was taken down as Drew's focus shifted (I believe), but was moved over to Canonn's site:
