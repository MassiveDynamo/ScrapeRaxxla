Honestly guys, I do not think the story situation is as bad as you think. To me it only seems like some threads of the tapestry have gone into the background.

I say this partially based on the AI side of things, which as far as I've seen has been virtually untouched beyond some initial seeds for most of the game so far, but is slowly starting to come back to the fore.

Perhaps I'm applying rose tinted glasses, but my genuine impression is otherwise. Or I hope so at least.

Next year is when we'll really get to see just how dedicated Frontier is to it's story lines. President Zachary Hudson should be up for a vote of confidence in June 3305. If that doesn't happen then it is good evidence that the devs have lost the plot. Hopefully the discovery of Raxxla doesn't hinge on any of these loose threads but, if it does, then we could be in a bit of trouble.
