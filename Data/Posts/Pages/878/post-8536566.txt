Even though I've given up on the hunt for Raxxla I still follow the tinfoil here daily. Thanks to everyone who keeps that going.

A legitimate wondering: A year ago a certain user posted leaked material of a 5 year Frontier roadmap that I learned about on Reddit. I followed up on that post not long ago and the leak is, short of covid-19 delays and such, pretty much spot on. The author of the post signs off by saying there is no Raxxla in Elite, and given the accuracy of the post itself I was curious if this has made anyone feel differently about searching?

Without having any in-game clues I've been forced to hunt for real life ones instead.

The Raxxla line was only added later to the reddit post by a supposedly different user. The original leak on a different forum did not have the Raxxla line at all.

Is it possible that the original poster added it in later on reddit? Who knows? However it is worth noting that there are some angry people who are insistent that Raxxla doesn't exist and do take every opportunity to jeer at it, claiming to have inside information from staff. However upon challenge, they are never able to produce proof either.

Anyway an archived version of the original leak exists without the Raxxla line, you just have to do some googling.
