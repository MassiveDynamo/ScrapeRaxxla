if you believe fdev then you have to believe when they said there would be no clues.

knit picking what you believe from fdev is worse than just not believing them and making a statement such as "it's not in there".

I believe it's in there. I also believe it's 100% easier to say it's in there and know that it's impossible for anyone to prove it's not. Where would their best benefits lay ? At having something they have no hope of ever making worth the effort to find be able to be found and all the work that would entail worth while? Or to keep it hidden? Who benefits from finding it and being let down by what they find ? ...and everyone is going to be let down. That's not a question. Raxxla best serves everyone by being something nobody finds.

If fdev was smart, they'd find a way to make sure it never does get found.
