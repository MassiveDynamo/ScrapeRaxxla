Even though I've given up on the hunt for Raxxla I still follow the tinfoil here daily. Thanks to everyone who keeps that going.

A legitimate wondering: A year ago a certain user posted leaked material of a 5 year Frontier roadmap that I learned about on Reddit. I followed up on that post not long ago and the leak is, short of covid-19 delays and such, pretty much spot on. The author of the post signs off by saying there is no Raxxla in Elite, and given the accuracy of the post itself I was curious if this has made anyone feel differently about searching?

Without having any in-game clues I've been forced to hunt for real life ones instead.
Nope. Everything in that post that has been proven true was already widely speculated.

I rather believe an MBE than someone who leaks data and signs off with a statement which is absolutely meant to be malicious towards FDev

Edit: there are in game clues. FDev removed the fluff due to leading CMDRs on wild goose chases but left the Codex entry in. Therefore it's not exactly far fetched to assume the codex is a clue
