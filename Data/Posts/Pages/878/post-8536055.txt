Nope. Everything in that post that has been proven true was already widely speculated.
One thing - the leak referred to Odyssey as being internally referred to as Project Watson. I happened to notice that the Odyssey eshot campaign was titled WatsonAnnounce. I presume that name wasn't known outside of Frontier at the time of the leak.
