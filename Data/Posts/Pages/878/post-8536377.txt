So, because we havent found a cure for cancer, by your logic, we should stop trying to?

That is a very defeatist line of thinking

Discovering that it's not possible to cure cancer is just as important as trying to cure it.

Now, proving the non-existence of something is much much harder than proving that it does exist, but we dont have to do either here.

I can make an argument that it makes much more sense for it not to be in the game than it does and be right. I could also suggest that it moves around and thus, even previously explored places could house it at any given time ...making discovering it even less likely than 1:4billion. But I can also say that finding raxxla is not the point of finding raxxla. The search for raxxla is the entire point. That's where value exists for everyone. Even if it makes less sense in participating in that fruitless search than having dozens of commodities in the game that aren't worth 1 million a ton and the game doesn't use commodities to create anything so why would anyone waste their time with them.

So search for raxxla. But hope you never find it.
