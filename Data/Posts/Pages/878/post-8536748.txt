Ever been to Communication Array Delta 69? It is a silent, spooky place. If you suddenly notice anomalous gravitational pull, get out, quick. A certain, mysterious body...

I was just watching Commander Mattius' youtube - He had an interesting Raxxla video on just that. It mentioned Communication Array Delta 69 from Col 285 Sector BG-O d6-93 as well as the Thetis.
I hadn't realized this Delta 69 outpost existed! Very nice.

The logs talk of a mysterious body that isnt one of the crew ... and it appears to be connected to a gravitational anomaly as well as a signal. the anomaly sounds alot like a possible wormhole/stargate that the stranger possibly came through as well as the signal. Very much a potential tie in with the idea of Raxxla as a gateway - this also adds credence to the idea that twisted men are already in possession of raxxla and are possibly studying/experimenting on its capabilities. The fact that the anomaly presented itself at this site is suspicious as well - Is this a club associated site? The fact that dead body seems to be coming to life at the end of the messages is another interesting bit... Not to read too much into it but the associations of death and rebirth seem to fit in with some of the thoughts around raxxla. I also like that the signal seems to be affecting the minds of the people much like the Thetis (As pointed out by Commander Mattius) - Possibly a siren call ? or maybe Guardian AI?

It provides an interesting take on the "personal journey" as well... Note this is a "person" showing up ... not a ship. What if the continuation of the Raxxla story was always tied to a first person point of view. At any rate ... Col 285 Sector BG-O d6-93 will be one of the stopping points as I make my way back to the bubble...
