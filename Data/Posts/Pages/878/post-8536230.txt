Dont dirty the thread up with facts.
Fact 1 - Question: "You have said that there will be no clues though?" Brookes: "That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious just so people know what they're doing. There's nothing to be revealed at this stage."

Some people choose to shorten this quote and miss out the last sentence.

Fact 2 - MB left the ED project in June 2017 - well before the Codex was released. Things can change in that kind of time frame.

Question - If people dont believe Raxxla is in game that's fine - but why hang on "The Quest To Find Raxxla" thread, rather than going to shoot at some goids, or something?

Regards Project Watson comment - regardless of it the leak was entirely fake or from a source in ED - the main point was the leak was overtly malicious to FDev. Couldn't claim it was in the public interest to know there plan. There is 0 evidence that the Raxxla comment was true
