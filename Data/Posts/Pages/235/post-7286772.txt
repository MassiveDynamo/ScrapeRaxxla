I think that was it. Then i messed it up with Raxxla context. Im sorry. Well this will remain a mystery for much longer then.

But imo FD did not hide it in some RNG System. I mean if its lore, it should be a System with some kind of name and history. Maybe a Star mentioned in ancient history.
I still think that the Raxxla-is-in-the-bubble theory should be checked to 100% first, because hiding it in some random nebular just seems "too obvious" for me.
Bubble is still obvious but not that much because people just dont expect it to be there
