Contemplation based on "forbidden" book and in-game content:

1. Raxxla is a rogue planet, traveling from system to system (like mega-ships in the game)
2. It can be followed (founded) by tracing gravity anomalies (anomalies are in the game)
3. DW is providing future tech to all powers (engineers)
4. Raxxla is a portal to Witch Space (another dimensional plane where Thargoids are hanging around, hyperdiction)
5. There is a task in-game to identify all traits of anomalies that leads to some discovery (bugged for now)
6. Anomalies are guarded with Thargoid weapons (wake-holes to Witch Space)

Sum, ergo cogito.
