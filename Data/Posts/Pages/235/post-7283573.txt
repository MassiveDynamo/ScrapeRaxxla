"For those with eyes to see" or something like this was the line about Raxxla earlier. Just some absolutely random fact about the animal 'eagle': " The eagle eye is among the strongest in the animal kingdom, with an eyesight estimated at 4 to 8 times stronger than that of the average human." -iPatrickDev on Reddit.

I see two scenarios here. One, following the lead previously suggested by Stonn Mrogg, heading to the Eagle nebulae to see what we can see - or perhaps the Eagle Eye is a reference to the program of the same name in Delphi, designed to locate Thargoids.

Furthermore, in Delphi there exists a Thargoid structure. Since Delphi is almost definitely related to the Raxxla story by viture of being the center of the 'world' in Greek mythology, and it is a hotspot for Thargoid activity, being Aegis' headquarters, can we assume the Thargoid/Guardian storylines and the Raxxla storylines are intertwined?

Isn't there an installation in Delphi called Eagle Eye Six?
