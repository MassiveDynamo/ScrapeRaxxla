I think there is quite a bit of omphalos symbolism in the Robotic Avian.

Small planet at the bottom, axis with up and down markers and a big winged creature at the top.

Aquila, Cygnus and Draco would be likely candidates as winged beasts of the sky.

Are you sure that’s a planet it’s holding & not a tortoise?
