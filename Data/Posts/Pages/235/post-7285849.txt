I can remember FD said that they are surprised that we didnt find it yet.
I mean if it is so "obvious" why cant Raxxla be near SOL? like 10-200 light years? maybe we are all looking in the wrong places and should check the "obvious" first?
If this were the case, then it'd be found and confirmed found by now. It's been a mystery for over 4 years now.
