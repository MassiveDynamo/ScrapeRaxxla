Frustratingly undertaking bonhomie so unable to get into ED, and I've an idea of where the title screen system could be, linked to the toast...

Its a pretty system of stars that has been well visited however if Raxxla is a low orbit station rather than a planet it could have been overlooked...

No chance tonight as the vino has been uncorked so unlikely to get into game for days...maybe Sea Baron is beating me to it?

Which ever way I'll post my findings so no-one makes the same crackpot connections.
