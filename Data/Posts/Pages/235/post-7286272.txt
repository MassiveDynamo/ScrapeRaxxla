I can remember FD said that they are surprised that we didnt find it yet.
I mean if it is so "obvious" why cant Raxxla be near SOL? like 10-200 light years? maybe we are all looking in the wrong places and should check the "obvious" first?
Do you have a source for this?

I certainly remember a ‘surprised you haven’t found a big thing in game yet’ from one of the streams but that wasn’t in a Raxxla context.
