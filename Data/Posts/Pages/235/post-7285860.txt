I can remember FD said that they are surprised that we didnt find it yet.
I mean if it is so "obvious" why cant Raxxla be near SOL? like 10-200 light years? maybe we are all looking in the wrong places and should check the "obvious" first?

Just for something different to do, I am casually looking for it following some very unscientific hunches based on everything I have read here in the forums....I am under no illusion I will magically find it, but it has been a good way to stretch my legs on learning the new explores tools just being back from a long break.
