To the road! To the journey!
To that which is sought, and to that which is found.
To Raxxla!

To those who were banished, and to those who overcame.
To the unification, to the singularity,
To Raxxla!

To those who were lost, yet found their way,
To those who passed amongst the stars,
And to those who remain.
To Raxxla!

To the relics of a bygone age,
Those we inhabit and those we find.
To the blessing and the curse,
To Raxxla!

To the stories untold, but the stories found,
To the nature, and to the heart,
To that which happened, yet never known,
To that which to hear can not be told,
To that which glisters, but is not gold,
To that which unfolded and may yet unfold,

To Raxxla!
To Raxxla!
To Raxxla!
