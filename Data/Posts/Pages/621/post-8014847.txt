The thing is... When they made these statements, people knew what they were doing, as some part of the Quest was a tiny little bit obvious.
It's past times. (The 'what a silly question'- thing only shows embarassment. Just look a their face !)
Who can pretend, now, that he knows what he is doing ( beside "questus interruptus" ) ?
No one knew what they were doing back then. We still don't know. The founder missions were never part of a quest for Raxxla.
If you read the mission texts in hindsight, the are most likely just a foreshadowing of the Guardians. Just like Halsey's visions.

That could of course be the same thing. We may just not have found the Guardian location that contains the Portal / Omphalos rift / Construct, we are looking for?
