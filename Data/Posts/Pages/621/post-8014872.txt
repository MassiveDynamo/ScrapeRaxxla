was going to say sorry for going off-topic but alas too late, hopefully we can drag it back by page 627...anyway. these Arx points, did you get them while scanning/mapping or just when selling the data, Ive scaned mapped a few today, played for a few hours and as far as I can tell earned a grand total of 3 ARX, whoopee! So please tell me its when you sold the data? I mean, be honest and tell me the truth but be aware of my feelings if you get 100 and I get 3 and just dont rub my face in it
I'm sorry to say that they were earnt by cashing the carto in, not by scanning itself - same with bounties - killing ship=0 handing bounty is what gets you ARX

Big poke in the eye for long range explorers - can't beleive FD have been so short sighted to not realise that folk who go into the black for a month can earn max 400 ARX in that month (unless they sell the carto in dribs and drabs over the following weeks, preventing them returning to the black again). Very poor design.
