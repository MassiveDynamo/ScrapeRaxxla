Is anyone surprised that FD has created another system that does not fit with how their player base uses their product? They have dropped the ball on development for this game and seem to be too apathetic to pick it up.

The state of this patch only reinforces my belief that FD at one point was going to implement a Raxxla quest line, decided to go with Thargoids instead, and quietly shut down the Raxxla mystery by making it flavor text in the codex.
