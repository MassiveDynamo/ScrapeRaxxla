Is anyone surprised that FD has created another system that does not fit with how their player base uses their product? They have dropped the ball on development for this game and seem to be too apathetic to pick it up.

The state of this patch only reinforces my belief that FD at one point was going to implement a Raxxla quest line, decided to go with Thargoids instead, and quietly shut down the Raxxla mystery by making it flavor text in the codex.
Thargoids were of course planned from day one. They are a core element of Elite. The Guardians were probably planed from the start as well.

I don't think there has ever been any plans to make a quest for Raxxla. It was put in the game in a hidden location and not much more has been done. FD are probably perfectly happy with no one finding it at all. When they drip feed some hints it's more to keep the interest up, than to actually help us find it.

The Zurara wasn't found even though it was only a few ly of the RR line. That one was meant to be found and we still had to be given the system name, to discover it.

I would not expect this to change. They may drop a hint or two from time to time, but we can't expect to be lead there.
