I'm sorry to say that they were earnt by cashing the carto in, not by scanning itself - same with bounties - killing ship=0 handing bounty is what gets you ARX

Big poke in the eye for long range explorers - can't beleive FD have been so short sighted to not realise that folk who go into the black for a month can earn max 400 ARX in that month (unless they sell the carto in dribs and drabs over the following weeks, preventing them returning to the black again). Very poor design.

Wow is this correct? Shouldn't this be brought up on the Arx thread...this is terrible and ultimately renders it a redundant element to us explorers.
