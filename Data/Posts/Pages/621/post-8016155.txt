The founder missions were never part of a quest for Raxxla.
So, a certain celestial body, you know what I am telling about, The Myth would not be Raxxla but.. a Guardian thing ? meh... Guardians never were any "myth".

If you read the mission texts in hindsight, the are most likely just a foreshadowing of the Guardians. Just like Halsey's visions.
That could of course be the same thing. We may just not have found the Guardian location that contains the Portal / Omphalos rift / Construct, we are looking for?
So ? Were E/F missions related to Raxxla or not ??

I don't think there has ever been any plans to make a quest for Raxxla.
Not a quest. Just a journey everyone has to take for himself. Or MB lied.

... it was only a few ly of the RR line.
A "few ly" out of a line that is thousands of Ly long.... And not even in EAFOTS..LoL !
