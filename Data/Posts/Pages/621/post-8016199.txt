from RAXXLA Codex:-

Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift, described
as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed. These details
however, were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to children's story Princess
Astrophel and Spiralling Stars, and soon lost credibility. Undaunted, some Raxxla
seekers insisted that the story's author had cunningly concealed facts about the
mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to see.

Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars
= PASS

- this just jumped out at me as being odd, especially considering the text at the end:

FDev state it exists and they know why nobody has found it - because its locked behind an access permit perhaps?
