may as well earn your farthings - arx while you wait - exploration isnt broken, and 800k worth of data got me 100arx, so it seems quite lucrative (if thats really the term for 1yrs worth of grind for a ship kit..)

was going to say sorry for going off-topic but alas too late, hopefully we can drag it back by page 627...anyway. these Arx points, did you get them while scanning/mapping or just when selling the data, Ive scaned mapped a few today, played for a few hours and as far as I can tell earned a grand total of 3 ARX, whoopee! So please tell me its when you sold the data? I mean, be honest and tell me the truth but be aware of my feelings if you get 100 and I get 3 and just dont rub my face in it

An inverted pyramid of speculation resting on a pin of fact.

Absolute genius, I'm nicking that phrase!

ARX = RAX! We are half way there folks its an obvious clue!
