Has anyone tried to get a Mingfu permit?
Got Pi Mensae, halfway through Peregrina -my last one (apart from Mingfu & those uninhabited systems). Then must buy some prismatic shields after today’s server tick & maybe start investigating why the systems were locked. For those military convoys but no permit (from release notes) the convoys seem to start in one of these attainable permit systems, so maybe we’re supposed to attack the convoys there instead of the locked destination? Just trying to suss out the intended gameplay here.

But first a cold shower, again hot & sticky (both me and weather) after a sleepless night.
