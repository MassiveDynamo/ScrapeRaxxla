Odd thing happened this morning, bug in crime & punishment?
Yesterday I travelled to Kagutsuchi & swapped out fuel scoop, fsd booster etc for extra cargo space ready to run missions for peregrina aristocrats. Did some naughty things this morning but paid off my bounties. Zero notoriety & allied with the aristos. Went back to Kagutsuchi to refit my modules before the permit mission only to find I couldnt- they were “dirty”. Had to pay through the nose to “clean” them. Is this a bug or have I misunderstood the system?
Bounties gained in srvs do not always show up for the ship correctly/right away after the last patch.
