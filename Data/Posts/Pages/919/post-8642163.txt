Zu ra ra!

But I do like Mother of Galaxies as “gravity”. I still think the DW toast is a guide to finding their station not Raxxla. I think membership of this secret organisation is another of the FD storylines, don’t think it will lead to Raxxla.
Has anyone tried to reverse engineer the toast? Since LFT 509 ( by memory?) seems to be the best candidate for location of the station based on FC system data analysis, has anyone tried fitting that location into directions derived from the toast?
I strongly suspect the start point is Shinrarta Dezhra!!

Did anyone try out my binary BH hypothesis out near the Pleiades? I got bored with that. Now got Crom, Isinor, Luytens & Van Maanens permits and working on Pi Mensae.

Now must go have a cold shower, even at 08:00 I’m sticky, yuk. Looking forward to the end of this heatwave and being able to sleep at night again!
