Maybe they wiped them out because of oppression. Remember the only history we have about them was written by a third party.

Exactly and also remember the AI seen both the Guardians and thargoids as a threat, thargoids are still around.... Perhaps maybe we are the AIs creation/failure, maybe they thought they may save the guardians in primitive form, drop us on earth and then we just turn into the same war hungry carnivores we are and the thargoid war resumes after all our tech matches well with guardians tech and has freakish simularitys for such a vast universe
