I think no one has found raxxla yet to this date due to the fact everyone has dived way to deep into rabbit holes
i sort of agree with this. didnt fdev say something along the lines of "can't belive it hasnt been found yet"? or is that just a rumor like the "someone has been there and honked it" statement?

I've spent the last few days considering all sorts of connections to the toast (persephone the lost daughter = parents grief, hades in love with persephone = lovers woe,etc etc) Lately i've considered the edges of the space map as indicator, namely the void, the abyss and lyra's song seem interesting to me, having connections to the toast (lyra and sirens are connected and the void seems like a obvious one) but even making these connections, what would you do with it? we don't know that we are searching for, or what a clue could even be. I've lined up multiple constellations with the emblem but with the scale of things its nearly impossible to determine a center or a point. Im not giving up quite yet but the lead is starting to dry out. Any tipps or ideas appreciated.

It has to be atleast a bit more obvious than scrolling pages and pages of mythology and 10+ year old ED lore for bits that lead into rabbithole after rabbithole... right?
