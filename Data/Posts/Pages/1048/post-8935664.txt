Ya the Linguistics and Ancient Aliens was just spitballing fun... but im ready to hang my hat on the Parijat Tale being the Childrens story of Princess Astrophel and the Spiraling stars... It hits all the points.

Childrens Tale - Check, The story of Parijat has been a standard Childrens tale for a long time.

Princess - Check

Astrophel - I have long thought that Astrophel was not the obvious Philip Sidney story but rather - someone who loved the stars, I kept thinking it was an astronomer.... but Parijat literaly fell in love with Surya the Sun. so Check

Spiraling Stars - Check, The Parijat myth is tied into the Churning of the Milky Ocean (Milky Way), wihich also hits all the Omphalos and Creation Myth Elements.
Ya I also think that Holdstock might have used Indian Mythology a bit in his writings. And ya I think the Raxxla Symbol is supposed to be a Yantra of some sorts...

But in general I think this points us to needing to look closer at Hindu Creation Mythology to use as a text for pulling out some possible clues.... The Confluence.... Again Possible ties to Sirius.... And the idea of Ratnas as the samarandara pearls

Give me a connection to Isis or the Two Ladies (Wadjet, Nekhbet) and we are onto something.

I also skimmed "Astrophel and Stella" by Philip Sydney and I was explicitly looking for any mention of "Psyche" since Cupid is mentioned. This would have been my connection to Isis, but alas, no mentioned of Psyche. So at the current time I only have dead ends.
