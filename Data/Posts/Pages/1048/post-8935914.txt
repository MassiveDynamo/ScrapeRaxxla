Ya to be honest I was just playing with ideas there... I dont remember a hard date for that - but also since we know the Thargoids are still around and suspect that there is a possibility that some Guardians or atleast their AI might still be around ... who knows maybe Earth was a later unrecorded skirmish?
All the Engineers use Guardian AI to voice and control all their Air Traffic Controllers at their bases.

(Unsubstantiated rumour of course )
