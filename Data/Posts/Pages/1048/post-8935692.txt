Seriously its probably flavour text and fluff. Reality is its more like a follow-on mission where its activated by your recent actions, doing missions for a faction for example. Some are just more 'mysterious' than others, if criminal or illegal goods or weapons they will hide their faces.
thought something like that, heard that previous posters had similar expiriences, the striking resemblance in colour to the dark wheel codex entry had my heart beating for a good while though. Thank you for easing my mind.

Question: Are you allied or friendly with any minor faction in the Lung-system?
My standing with the Green Party of Lung is on Cordial, have done some missions for them but not that many.

Also keep in mind the Children of Raxxla are a player created faction and it would be highly unlikely they or any of their related images are key in the quest to find Raxxla but thats just my 2 cents
true, but the emblem they use is older than the player faction and also depicted in the raxxla codex entry with no mention of the children of raxxla player faction. correct me if im wrong, im following this lead as of now.
still inclined to think that the 6 pointers on the emblem could be connected to the 6 descriptions of the toast.
