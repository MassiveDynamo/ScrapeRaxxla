Keep trying, you don’t suffer damage, just loss of time but thats why we play..to solve the mystery. Think I’ve done around 20 BH in the last couple of days.
You should search NS+BH pairs ...at least "NS" sounds like whisper if u FSS it + they have huge periods, means can be used pair as direction pointer and through BH lense u can see something hidden in that direction.
