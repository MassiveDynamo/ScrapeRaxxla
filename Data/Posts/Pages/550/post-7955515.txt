I just tried another one >: Same results ...nothing (as you see I'm even aligned with other stars there, they have 114000 days period, so basically will stay such position very long and could be used as targeting device)

Keep trying, you don’t suffer damage, just loss of time but thats why we play..to solve the mystery. Think I’ve done around 20 BH in the last couple of days.

That’s the attraction of this hypothesis- BH are not uncommon, fits the codex clues (omphalos, rift, spiralling stars, astrophel), they have been in-game from the beginning, people might try one or two then stop trying them, so a good hiding spot
