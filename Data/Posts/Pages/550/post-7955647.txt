I hadn't considered, find all 6 locations of the Toast, and plot what's in the middle of them, instead of waypointing them...

It makes sense, if you imagined looking out from Raxxla the way we do Earth, the Toast could be to their 6 most prominent astral bodies, the way we have constellations and the North Star (Polaris)...
