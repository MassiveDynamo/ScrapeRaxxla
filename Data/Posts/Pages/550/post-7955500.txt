I think the whisper in witch space may refer to ngc 7822, you can see it really far away. When your about to jump it seems to stay an extra second on the skybox(not sure if all this kind of nebula do that) maybe described as a whisper right before 'which space". Also thought I would ask about servasti logs referring to thunder child "going dark in '69". Could that mean they went dark in col sector 69.(big sector and not going to plot though it by accident since the permit locks around it)

I agree that NGC 7822 might be the siren in witchspace, according to EDSM it was named “Siren of the Spinward Stars” (I think fairly recently which in itself is interesting, but can’t find a date for that)
There’s a separate thread for GCS Sarasvati, though it seems to have gone quiet again https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/gcs-sarasvati-early-thargoid-lookout-megaship.380074/page-18
