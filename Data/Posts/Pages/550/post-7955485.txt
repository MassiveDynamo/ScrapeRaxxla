I followed the clues, the best I could IN/OUT of the game.

And your point is valid in logic but not circumstance. If this was a debate, you might get a point. I'm just here to present the data I have. And I am not saying it's correct, but I can tell you why I have the data and conclusions.

We have an artist (Max Centra) who loves posting on multiple sites that are public, images of their personal work, with a lot of detail about the work. He will answer information about everything that is commercial, except the work he did while at FDEV, that has the same background as the Eisler/Hodstock image, with the same type of robot, with imagery fits the current codex image for Raxxla. Even the dice markings are the same type (dice symbols for "hard" rolls) on his image created at the time he was technical director for ELITE DANGEROUS, same as the illustrated image from Eisler about Raxxla.

Given the markings, color, symbol, background desert, and robots nature, combined with the timeframe in which he created the piece and released it without labeling what it was in are all factors. I am not asking an unknown government group about classified things. I am asking an individual, about their life's work - which they made public.

You have a hypothesis, reasoned from your available evidence. The thing to do is see if it gives you any predictions that you can then test.
