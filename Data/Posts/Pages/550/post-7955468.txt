So what is the latest news about figuring out the locations of the 6 star systems in the Dark Wheel toast? Last I checked all evidence still clearly pointed to Zeta Cassiopeia as the first system. Is there a strong case for any of the others yet?

For those of you who have seen the original Stargate movie, there is a cool scene where James Spader's character explains how you need to know 6 points in space (the center of each face of a cube) to pinpoint a target location (the center of the interior of a cube).

I am still assuming that this is what the clues in the 6 lines of the toast mean, and that finding them will point to either Raxxla itself (unlikely) or to the next Dark Wheel clue, perhaps the system with the dark wheel station itself around the 8th moon of a gas giant.

So, where do things stand in this front? Any news or promising leads?
