I wonder if Raxxla could be a Thorne-Zytgow object that causes a massive FSD superccharge or unlocks other travel capabilities. There is a track in the official ED soundtrack that references Thorne Zytgow objects.

Interesting hypothesis, a red giant/supergiant with a neutron star at its centre.
Interesting because if you target a giant/supergiant it never locks on, the info box just keeps spiralling. Bug, or intentional FD feature to hide Raxxla? But presumably the neutron star lobes would still be visible & enterable, otherwise youâ€™d never get to the neutron boost.....
