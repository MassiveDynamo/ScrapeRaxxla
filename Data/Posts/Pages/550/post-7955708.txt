I really hope not... "The Club" makes me think of one of those silly Grisham novels with polo shirt wearing lawyers/politicians drunk on power playing golf in the ruins of Raxxla..... That would be horrible

They could atleast change their name to something like "the Xibalba Path" and i would have more respect for them.
I disagree. I would much rather find that the "powerful, twisted men" currently occupying Raxxla are a cartel of self-serving, greedy corporate types. The kind of people who would call themselves something just as mundane as "The Club". If they turn out to be some monastic order of "enlightened" cultists ... that, IMO, would be truly horrible.
