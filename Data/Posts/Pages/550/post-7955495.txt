I checked it out and a lot of the neighboring systems pretty thoroughly with the FSS.

But we know the dark wheel station is stealthy to avoid detection, so we assume that means it can’t be detected by fss . Perhaps only when quite close, or maybe a visual detection is required, by parallax, by dropping out of SC at the 8th moon...it could be that Raxxla is similarly stealthy (if it’s an astronomical body & not hidden in plain sight like a black hole that must be entered to trigger a hyperspace jump).
