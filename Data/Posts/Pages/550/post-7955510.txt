Got to be the correct BH!
I just tried another one >: Same results ...nothing (as you see I'm even aligned with other stars there, they have 114000 days period, so basically will stay such position very long and could be used as targeting device)
Damn ..won't attach screenshot.. any way tried with 27 gama cas, so when was entering BH 2 another stars were just behind me exactly.
