If it's directions then surely the last step is the only important one. Like, I can get to Heart and Soul without needing to go via NGC 7822, so just tell me to go to H&S. Unless Raxxla has magic powers and knows where I've been.

Doesn’t have to be magical, its protected by rogue AI that interrogate your ship’s travel history!

I still want to know why my PC crashed as I tested my penultimate hypothesis!!!
Just as the hyperspace transition went a bit weird...........
