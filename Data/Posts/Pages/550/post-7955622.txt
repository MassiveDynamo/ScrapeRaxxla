Just an observation, was messing around in Diso the other day and looking at the permit locked 5C, the one with the massive crater, tried to fly down and got the message so targeted for Lave and carried on. Realised the Lave target was in the near centre of the crater from my position, ie you could draw a a straight line from Lave straight though the 'meteor' crater and on towards where I don't know, was thinking more in terms of signals or similar myself, broadcast from Lave to Diso 5c or the other way round. Now I think that's just a coincidence but 5C iirc is tidally locked so depends on orbit whether its always true? Will be facing Lave 50% of the time and obscured by the planet 50%?

Haven't checked the line to see if it goes further, haven't lined up Lave 2 either. Not sure Id know how to interpret it if it does. Just observations, probably misunderstandings, just that its Diso & Lave so thought Id mention it.

Can I check, the DW are still the 'goodies' right? and the club are the new 'baddies'? The club or a cabal at the top may or may not know where Raxxla is but the DW don't know by all accounts and are still searching for it, yes? Anything ret-conned that I've missed / got completely wrong?
