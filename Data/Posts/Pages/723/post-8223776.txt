Yea, that seems to be a solid clue that it’s in an asteroid belt somewhere; assuming Will knows and it wasn’t FD humour! Actually it ties in with my current hypothesis
@Macros: reference on first page?
I agree, it's a joke. There's no need to look inside the asteroids for Raxxla

Asteroid belt's however, are another matter.

On another note, nothing found halfway between Sol and Alpha Centauri.
