I agree. Will doesn't have a clue, I think.
It's not the kind of info they give to community managers.

Do you have any evidence for that, or is it just assumption?
We’ve (me included!) always assumed in this thread that only DB, MB and maybe a few others in graphics department etc would know about Raxxla, but isn’t that our assumption based on the significance of Raxxla to us? It may actually be a widely known Easter Egg within FD, but protected by Spanish Inquisition-enforced NDA!
I know DB said in a livestream that “you don’t know what it is!” and that remark apparently might have been addressed to Ed who was present, but Ed looked surprised/confused on hearing it, so maybe it wasn’t addressed at him at all but to the person who raised the question (which would be more sensible); maybe all the Community Managers know about Raxxla. It’s just a game to them, not the ultimate question (that’s 42 & another meme ).
