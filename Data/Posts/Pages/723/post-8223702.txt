No worries. Its a bit off topic as about the DW station, not Raxxla but here goes.

Bet you wish you hadn't asked now

I’m not convinced by your assumption that DW was founded after the discovery of Raxxla; it may well have been them that first discovered it. I’m definitely unconvinced by the claim that they knew where it was and “lost it”! Much of what we “know” about them comes from Lyta Crane, a self-appointed “conspiracy theorist” who may have made up or misinterpreted any knowledge of TDW; the codex entry is definitely ambivalent about her veracity & reliability.

Nor that TDW station is abandoned. It’s in stealth mode, why? My interpretation is because the inhabitants don’t want to be found (lore-wise! In reality it makes it a better treasure hunt!!)
