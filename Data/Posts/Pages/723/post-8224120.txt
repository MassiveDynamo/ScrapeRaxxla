If i had to choose between a joke, or intentional planning, or accident with fdev. The winning money is ALWAYS accident. I'd heavily lean towards roid fields being an accidental clue on to the actual location of raxxla.

Also, it likely doesn't use any unique textures or assets or we would have heard about it already as the client would have to contain the data and that's been combed and how alien info was leaked prior to discovery. No such thing has happened with raxxla.
