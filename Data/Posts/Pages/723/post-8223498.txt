I've been doing a bit of research on the Jackson's Lighthouse system lately. The reason I got a bit interested is that it has a small hidden planet, in lore.
The book Wanted, describes a small metallic planet with a cave system. It's called Jackson's Cave. It is supposed to orbit the NS(a magenetar) to close to be detectable by scanners.
Jackson's Cave is actually searchable in the Galaxy map (takes you to Jackson's Lighthouse).

This isn't directly related to Raxxla, but I was interested in the mechanics. Is it possible that NS have a small unscannable zone?
I haven't found anything yet. It's a risky to search really close to the star.
