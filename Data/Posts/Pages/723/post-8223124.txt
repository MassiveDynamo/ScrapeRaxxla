Oh yeah, it was a station setup to mine the asteroid field but then they depleted all the asteroids and abandoned the station, thats why its in that non-descript meaningless system', sucks but its their game.

I'm quite curious about depleted asteroid field in relation to abandoned station... can you elaborate a little more on what are you trying to say here, please?
