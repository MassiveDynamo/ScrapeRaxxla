then all the words of the Frontiersmen that Raxxla is in the game and they know exactly where and the words that a certain commander was in the system with RAxxla and flew past without noticing-a lie?
Then everything is much easier. Recently in the diaries about the first step they wrote that only so many systems are open. Thus, if the words are true, then Raxxla is in these open systems.
