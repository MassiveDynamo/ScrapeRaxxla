Best thing would be that you read the book and try to relate as much as possible to the game. Compare what the book says about certain systems, compare what the book says about factions a.s.o. Since you are collecting information and data about TDW, you know best which subtle hints in the book will help you clear the road block.
i do not own the book myself yet otherwise i would have done so. i cant buy anything online for the next few months, hence why it felt like a road block.
