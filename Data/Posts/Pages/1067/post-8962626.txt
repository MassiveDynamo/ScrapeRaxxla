Ravenl0ft,
Why not?
I honestly don't think that it is available at this moment.
Elite started as KickStarter project, with very basic features available from start. So there were just no resources to code super duper galaxy teleport.
What is the point to spend resources for an asset that is none ever found in previous games?
I think that DW in Shinrarta originally was true one, but as game developed FD changed their mind.
By lore fake DW will be erased in no time.
So even if Raxxla existed in the game from start it was just some planet with Tourist beacon, but later as game evolved it was blocked for redevelopment. And we know how fast FD implement something new...
Raxxla is a synonym to endless exploration. Is it exist in the game? Yes

then all the words of the Frontiersmen that Raxxla is in the game and they know exactly where and the words that a certain commander was in the system with RAxxla and flew past without noticing-a lie?
