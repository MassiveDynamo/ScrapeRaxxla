following a series of clues about the dark wheel and it's conection to raxxla lead me to a road block that i wish to ask help with if possible. i need to determine for fact, if the dark wheel faction in shinrarta is a legitimate one or an impostor. this information will dictate where my investigation goes next.

doing some digging lead me to this clip from a drew wagar stream:
is the dark wheel faction in shinrarta a legitimate one? - clip

drew wagar suggests that he knows the answer but cannot reveal it due to NDA. and suggests that you can possibly extract that information by reading between the lines from his book premonition. having not read that book yet, and cannot do so for the time being. has anyone read that book and was able to confirm if any clues are in there as to the dark wheel's faction legitimacy in shinrarta? if so, i would love to hear the answer to that, and possibly a quote from the book to the section that reveals it.

If someone knew which quote it is, then we would know if TDW is real or not

Best thing would be that you read the book and try to relate as much as possible to the game. Compare what the book says about certain systems, compare what the book says about factions a.s.o. Since you are collecting information and data about TDW, you know best which subtle hints in the book will help you clear the road block.

Did you write your clues down somewhere in public?
