Ravenl0ft,
Why not?
I honestly don't think that it is available at this moment.
Elite started as KickStarter project, with very basic features available from start. So there were just no resources to code super duper galaxy teleport.
What is the point to spend resources for an asset that is none ever found in previous games?
I think that DW in Shinrarta originally was true one, but as game developed FD changed their mind.
By lore fake DW will be erased in no time.
So even if Raxxla existed in the game from start it was just some planet with Tourist beacon, but later as game evolved it was blocked for redevelopment. And we know how fast FD implement something new...
Raxxla is a synonym to endless exploration. Is it exist in the game? Yes

Thats what im talking about. There are 2 main problems about the discovery of raxxla. 1st one as u mentioned, what ever it is, im afraid it will never meet the hype requirements of the community. Second one, is a mere psychological question. ARE you ready to hear raxxla have been discovered? How the community will react to this? I mean imagine this: you are sitting in your krait, looking for stuff, and galnet bings a message, an unknown commander have made a major discovery. I know some cmndrs here doesnt want to get spoilers,neither it is to be found. its not about their wish for being the conqueror, but the void which people will feel after its over.
