It's not really important if the TDW in Shin Dez is the real thing or not. If it's the real thing, it's only the very outer rim of the wheel. If it's fake, it's allowed to continue because the actual Dark Wheel finds it useful. They could be using it to monitor interest, for example.

The main issue is that the Dark Wheel haven't found Raxxla, them self. They probably have access to info that we need, but we probably have access to something that aren't available to them.

TDW is deeply secretive and most likely have members in all parts of the galaxies important organisations. Anything known by Universal cartographists or the Pilots federation, would be known by TDW. The superpowers are probably well infiltrated. Even the Club have been partly exposed to TDW, by Rebecca.

Still they can't find Raxxla. We have to contribute in some way.

There is a good chance that our piece of the puzzle, has to be found outside the game. Mythology, old literature and children's books are all sources that may have been lost in the future.

I suspect that Raxxla is well hidden. Even in a system that is fully scanned and mapped, it will not reveal it self(unless extreme luck is involved). While FD has confirmed that Raxxla is in the game, they have never said a word about the Dark Wheel or their station. With all the knowledge players have about the game and the game mechanics and the fact that no one has heard or seen anything, makes me think that it's simply not implemented yet.

We basically have half the map. The problem is that we also have a hundreds of irrelevant maps and lack the info to pick the right one. Until we get TDW, we have to rely mostly on luck.
