Personally I hope they have split DW off from Raxxla so DW can have its own storyline without a route to Raxxla, so we can keep hunting for it.

Well what is it!? You cant leave us in suspense like that And does it still 'fit in' with current ret-con?


Oh yes I can!
I like Drew & won’t cut him out of any royalties due. If you want to know then buy the book!
But read Reclamation before reading Premonition! They’re both good reads!

And who knows what fits with retcon????? But strictly speaking they were proof read by FD (I believe MB) so should be totally compatible with any current version of the lore!
