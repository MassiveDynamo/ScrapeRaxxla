following a series of clues about the dark wheel and it's conection to raxxla lead me to a road block that i wish to ask help with if possible. i need to determine for fact, if the dark wheel faction in shinrarta is a legitimate one or an impostor. this information will dictate where my investigation goes next.

doing some digging lead me to this clip from a drew wagar stream:
is the dark wheel faction in shinrarta a legitimate one? - clip

drew wagar suggests that he knows the answer but cannot reveal it due to NDA. and suggests that you can possibly extract that information by reading between the lines from his book premonition. having not read that book yet, and cannot do so for the time being. has anyone read that book and was able to confirm if any clues are in there as to the dark wheel's faction legitimacy in shinrarta? if so, i would love to hear the answer to that, and possibly a quote from the book to the section that reveals it.

It is a while since I read it, but I remember getting the impression that faction in Shinrata was more of a "tribute act" to the real deal, likely often acting based on misinformation fed to the galaxy covertly through The Club...

I do entirely accept that my own "reading between the lines" might be wrong, and can't remember exact qoutes.

Problem is, many potential clues that people seem to attribute to, or relate to Raxxla, were actually meant to be about the Formadine Rift, and The Club, rather than Raxxla.

Though, I do have a suspicion that The Club is actually the real Dark Wheel... or whatever emerged from it.
