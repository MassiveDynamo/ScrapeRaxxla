Words about commander was in the system with Raxxla, are myth equal to Raxxla itself. They never answered what Raxxla is, or whether it is accessible. There are tons of blocked systems. So anything they told us could be true or false. We will never know until they allow us.
As I understand Raxxla is not main plot of Elite, it's more about Human/Thargoid conflict. But Raxxla is beautiful story that makes "Elite" world more mysterious and encourage to explore it
