Are you worried about men in black suits turning up at their house and flashing a light into their eyes erasing their memory? Would explain why we never get anywhere. Remember everyone, Moscow Rules from now on!
I think the commander is safe. TDW is good at hiding, but not at finding. How many centuries and didn't find anything?

I don't think it needs to be complicated. As far as we know from the book, the Dark Wheel is a community of Elites. It's true, you can only fly into Shinarta if you get an Elite.
They obviously are the best of the best of the best, sir!

Currently listening to "Wheel in Black" by Wheel Smith.
