Personally I hope they have split DW off from Raxxla so DW can have its own storyline without a route to Raxxla, so we can keep hunting for it.

And yes, there is a clue in there about Shinrarta Dezhra TDW Faction. It’s quite explicit, you don’t have to read between any lines.
Well what is it!? You cant leave us in suspense like that And does it still 'fit in' with current ret-con?
