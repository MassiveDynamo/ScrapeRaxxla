following a series of clues about the dark wheel and it's conection to raxxla lead me to a road block that i wish to ask help with if possible. i need to determine for fact, if the dark wheel faction in shinrarta is a legitimate one or an impostor. this information will dictate where my investigation goes next.

doing some digging lead me to this clip from a drew wagar stream:
is the dark wheel faction in shinrarta a legitimate one? - clip

drew wagar suggests that he knows the answer but cannot reveal it due to NDA. and suggests that you can possibly extract that information by reading between the lines from his book premonition. having not bought and read that book yet, and cannot do so for the time being. has anyone read that book and was able to confirm if any clues are in there as to the dark wheel's faction legitimacy in shinrarta? if so, i would love to hear the answer to that, and possibly a quote from the book to the section that reveals it.

I don't think it needs to be complicated. As far as we know from the book, the Dark Wheel is a community of Elites. It's true, you can only fly into Shinarta if you get an Elite.
