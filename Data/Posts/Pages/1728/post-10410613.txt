Hello Cmdrs,
Looking into the whole thing again, the Omphalos is probably a geologic formation at the surface of a planet, similar to a baetyl, as mentioned by @Jorki Rasalas in 2022.
A baetyl is an erected stone that is supposed to be a bridge between worlds. It comes from the Hebrew Beth-el "house of God".
The Greek Omphalos is only one of the baetyls. The reference is literal in the codex.
If it is a stone, it might not appear with a planet scan. Hopefully, it is of noticeable dimension, shape, and color. If it works like baetyls on earth, instructions, coordinates, and glyphs to decipher could be engraved on it.
Maybe visible from above, like the Nazca stones.
There was a reference some time ago to Burroughs's novel "Pellucidar", which bears some resemblance with what's written in the Codex.
Maybe that's what the reference to the novel, "Astrophel and the spiraling stars", is for: signaling there are clues in a book.
In Pellucidar, there's an ontological Omphalos rift located at long. 170 East, lat. 85 North of the terrestrial North Pole.
These coordinates could be of use in the quest for the Omphalos, it could translate to galactic coordinates.
Interestingly, if used on Galmap, considering Sol's "height" in the galaxy as the plane to search, the zones 85,0,170 and 170,0,85 aren't very far which is "compatible" with more limited technological means of exploration.
In Pellucidar, the main character comes from our world and becomes an emperor underground, an emperor of a federation.

For those with eyes to see: pellucid.
