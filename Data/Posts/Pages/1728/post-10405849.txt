Once again I go to Mark Moxon's Elite source code website to see where that Seed comes into play...
They bootstrap the entire universe as the initial values for system 0 in galaxy 0, and from then on the game's PRNG and procedural algorithms run wild.

The Stellar Forge equivalent must be known only to their backend team - unless they publicized it somewhere. Or maybe, with some hope, the good Dr. Kay Ross remembers it.
Maybe Raxxla is the seed word for the proc gen, in which case Raxxla would be everywhere
