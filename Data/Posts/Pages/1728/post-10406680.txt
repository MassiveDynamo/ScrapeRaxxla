Oh I think there is great progress being made, Raxxla is basically behind the next star or another after that, we're almost done here.

I have been using a combination of Remote Viewing and Tibetan singing bowls recently to uncover the secrets of the galaxy in Elite Dangerous with great results so far. There are numerous potential technosignatures and psychoenergetic pointers all over the galaxy. Side-effects include great spiritual healing and mental clarity.
