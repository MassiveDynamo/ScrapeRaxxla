Oh man, this is depressing me now haha, It's been 10 years since the release of the game and 6 years since the Raxxla entry was added to the game, but we are no closer to finding it since day 1.


I have a feeling the Paradise Lost reference was just a way of signing off to Brookes and his love of it. But there is nothing concrete or tangible either way.

We are lost, so is the Paradise.
