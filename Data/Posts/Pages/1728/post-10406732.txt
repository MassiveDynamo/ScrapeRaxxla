I think 17 Draconis etc are an obvious solution, however there are 4 main reasons I haven’t given it much attention.

One: in relation to everything else discussed so far, its location is too far removed. It simply does not fit the model.

Two: Paradiso and Limbo I suspect are not Miltonian concepts but fall within the canon of Dante. The two works are separate and although they share many of the same themes operate within different universes. Dante’s is based within the spheres where as Milton extends his universe beyond them.

There are other references in game to support this construct for Dante, I dont understand why it’s in game. It’s evident Brooke’s had written about it within his Drabbles, and I speculate like his other Drabbles they too are replicated in game, but the two concepts II believe don’t gell together, so I fall on the side of ‘Easter egg’?

Three: it has a player controlled faction? Bit too obvious!

Four: it is relatively too close to Polaris, a system acknowledged by FD to be outside the reach of players, due to a permit. This ultimately advocates this area is a ‘narrative gate’.

If this is the true goal then there is no purpose to the quest, as we have speculated previously, If the story is narrative then FD will only unlock it when they deem fit, it will be communicated and in some regards leaked and probably resolved in a matter of days.

Therefore on that logic I have not entertained it.

The image below shows the position of the system 17 Draconis in relation to the hypothetical area of the Empyrean, based off my findings. For it to be related there ought to be numerous systems between these that denote ‘heavens’ etc.

That is quite a gap, and answers my question thoroughly.
