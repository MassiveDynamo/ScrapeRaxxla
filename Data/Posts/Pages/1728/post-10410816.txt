The Quest To Find Raxxla
...2 streamers already mentioned Thargoid Probes found on planet near Galaxy center. Something is coming ... can be more detailed, what systems?

You mentionned baetyls, and went exploring asteroids fields in Sol, because historically baetyls are (mostly) "fallen stones" from the sky.
I think the baetyl aspect is right, and the "space baetyl" was one possibility.

Ah yes. I'd forgotten...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baetyl

The problem though is that meteorites are found on the ground but on game release planetary landings weren't possible. That only came in Horizons release, which IIRC was when I started playing. But would Michael Brookes have set up the Raxxla puzzle in game so it could not be solved until then?

Edit
That baetyl reference does mention "meta", the turning point in a chariot race. Now Omphalos can also mean "hub", i.e. a centre of rotation......
