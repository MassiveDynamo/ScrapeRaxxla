their punishment is essentially to dwell in ignorance and out of gods grace. They fill their time in folly, disillusion and vain discord. They perform the same duties as if they were still in heaven, including singing, which in hell although relatively beautiful is not as it was so in heaven, but like everything else a selfish perversion.
Definitely not the same Limbo for sure, but the singing and cheering gives me toast vibes. A whole bunch of vagrants cheering their saviour god.
