Do we have any FD source statements on what is now canon & what isn’t? Perhaps from the weekly livestreams?
I seem to remember Drew Wagar saying something about what he believed to be canon, maybe in his lore thread, but that’s not the same thing since he parted ways with FD in about 2017.

Edit: the current situation is, I imagine, like having Alzheimer's- we’re remembering things from our youth with no knowledge of the intervening history. I may be old, and have a poor memory, but.......

I think we have concluded this by looking back at how the Thargoids & other pieces of lore have been rewritten. I tend to agree with HZ though, the 5 or so novels at release time (re)defined most of the new canon. And this is how we have concluded by ourselves.

I recently dug into John Harper's videos and backstory. His journey from idea to concepts, blogs and updated info from the Writers Forum. It is interesting to hear what he and other writers discussed at the time as well as where MB put his foot down. (From his blogs & videos).
It's clear that some areas were completely cut off as "don't go there" while others appears as having been redefined later (in context of what Drew W. have told us).

If you want, you may have a look at Harper's video, kickstarter & blogs.
3 video references + my notes.

It was a nice story to follow, especially in context of how all the lore has evolved and the release of ED itself.
I just haven't had the time to buy & read his "And Here The Wheel" publication yet. Which I will.
