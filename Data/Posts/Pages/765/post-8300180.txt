I thought it should have been very simple. as they say if you want to hide something, put it in a prominent place. the frontiers were surprised that we had not yet found a planet. To be honest, I think we have found it a long time ago, but we are not aware of it. I explain. According to history, the planet was already known when 2 systems were mastered. then the planet should already be in the inhabited system is not so far from salt. itâ€™s quite logical

The quest for Raxxla, Riches and Glory Kid, Riches and Glory, is never far from salt but we manage here to keep it condiment free mostly

Depends which history you know about and when you knew it, not being cryptic although someone certainly is.

Salome said 'Everything you believe is a lie' so its not ret-conning, its the truth coming out and it changes as more truths are known....ahem.

Problem is theres no actual lore about people on Raxxla, theres talk of rumours of men in dark suits exploiting it (paraphrasing) but no one has yet claimed to have been there so 3 possibilities.

1. Its somewhere near inhabited bubble or within reach of earlier jumpdrives etc but nobody found it or died before passing info on...
2. Its somewhere near inhabited bubble or within reach of earlier jumpdrives etc and whoever knows where it is has somehow kept it secret for 700 years and seems to be doing nothing with it that we know of....maybe....or maybe reverse-engineered new tech is hidden as invention
3. An object or signal was received from beyond the stars or found on a nearby planet that made people aware of Raxxla but no one actually found the source.
