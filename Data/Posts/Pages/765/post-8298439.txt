Do we have any FD source statements on what is now canon & what isn’t? Perhaps from the weekly livestreams?
I seem to remember Drew Wagar saying something about what he believed to be canon, maybe in his lore thread, but that’s not the same thing since he parted ways with FD in about 2017.

Edit: the current situation is, I imagine, like having Alzheimer's- we’re remembering things from our youth with no knowledge of the intervening history. I may be old, and have a poor memory, but.......
Well, we know for sure that TDW can't be considered canon, as it's set in a different universe, specifically one in which the galaxy has a great many interestellar alien species, which the ED universe doesn't have.

That doesn't mean none of it has any resemblance to the ED universe, and as @Han_Zen says various characters are canon for ED, as are various places and things too.

Don't know if there's an official FD statement about TDW, but we don't really need one anyway as we can work its status out for ourselves.
