I thought it should have been very simple. as they say if you want to hide something, put it in a prominent place. the frontiers were surprised that we had not yet found a planet. To be honest, I think we have found it a long time ago, but we are not aware of it. I explain. According to history, the planet was already known when 2 systems were mastered. then the planet should already be in the inhabited system is not so far from salt. itâ€™s quite logical
