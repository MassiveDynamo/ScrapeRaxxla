Well technically orientation exists in the game, it's mostly just confined to the Galaxy Map. Sol is 0,0,0 and everything else radiates outward from it.

I have considered the possibility that the Toast could be a way to position yourself in a smaller space than people assume, though. Also consider the possibility that instead of referring to skybox landmarks the Toast is actually directing us to systems in a very close proximity to each-other; that would certainly explain a few of the strange system name changes we've seen in the past.

Out of curiosity, which systems are those AXP stars in?
Ye, start typing in game "AXP" and hit enter. Or in edsm. It is start of the star name means "Anomal X-ray Pulsar".
