I remember MB explaining that TDW had a legend status, but I can't find the source for it. It might have been an interview or a live stream. I'm not sure.

As you say, It doesn't matter that much. There are plenty of non canon stories from the journals and the old books that have been re-confirmed in the game.
Jacques, the death of Prince Aristide de Lavigny, Mycoid/INRA ending the first Thargoid conflict and Aslings mother Eccy G are all examples of non canon stories that turned out to be true anyway.
Yeah, (Edit - now you mention it) have got a vague memory of the MB explanation as well. If I think where it'll be and can find it, I'll post it.

And yeah, plenty of non-canon stuff has turned out to be trure, and I actually think it's kind of the best and only way for things to be. A lot of us played the previous games, but in ED, we're not Jameson, we're not a Ryder or anything like that, we're all just some random independent pilot. By all rights we shouldn't have anything which constitutes a priori knowledge, which a random independent pilot wouldn't have. It's hard enough to square things off with regards to things from the actual ED books, but once we're getting into stuff from well before we were born (in the in-game sense), that are not public knowledge, then there's a lot of stuff which we probably should not really know of at all, and certainly not be able to know of with absolute surety.
