Just a reminder, from the DJtruthsayer interview with MB, 1 min clip with the important bits

MB: "It's a journey everyone have to travel for themselves."
DJ: "You have said there will be no clues haven't you" ...
MB: "... That is true, but you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious, but so people know what they are doing. But, there is nothing to be revealed at this stage."
