I thought it should have been very simple. as they say if you want to hide something, put it in a prominent place. the frontiers were surprised that we had not yet found a planet. To be honest, I think we have found it a long time ago, but we are not aware of it. I explain. According to history, the planet was already known when 2 systems were mastered. then the planet should already be in the inhabited system is not so far from salt. itâ€™s quite logical

It's possible that we been there but no one didn't find it but was in the same system we just didn't look into it very well and sorta just assumed that was all to be seen in so said system.
