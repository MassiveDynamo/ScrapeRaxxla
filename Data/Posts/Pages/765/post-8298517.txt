Well, we know for sure that TDW can't be considered canon, as it's set in a different universe, specifically one in which the galaxy has a great many interestellar alien species, which the ED universe doesn't have.

That doesn't mean none of it has any resemblance to the ED universe, and as @Han_Zen says various characters are canon for ED, as are various places and things too.

Don't know if there's an official FD statement about TDW, but we don't really need one anyway as we can work its status out for ourselves.
I remember MB explaining that TDW had a legend status, but I can't find the source for it. It might have been an interview or a live stream. I'm not sure.

As you say, It doesn't matter that much. There are plenty of non canon stories from the journals and the old books that have been re-confirmed in the game.
Jacques, the death of Prince Aristide de Lavigny, Mycoid/INRA ending the first Thargoid conflict and Aslings mother Eccy G are all examples of non canon stories that turned out to be true anyway.
