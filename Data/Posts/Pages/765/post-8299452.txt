Missed why u do there ... but cupid arrow points to AXP star 1 of 2 in game ... I already flew that way - through arrow to axp ... and then came to 2nd axp as well... nothing I could see except exceptional light. However all others NS over 3sols have that too.
I just thinking .. all prev riddles were related to ingame tools. I.e. you could hear, see pattern on radar etc. And you don't have in-game orientation by the stars. You can't even point ship properly ...
However, you do have in-system orientation +/- ...so what if 1 part of toast points to star, then 2 other parts are in-system orienteering? ... and that seems bad idea as well. Because planets move. Except ...lagrange points, which retain relation to other bodies.
...or maybe 1st part is star, 2nd part is tidal locked body, 3rd part is point on body.

Well technically orientation exists in the game, it's mostly just confined to the Galaxy Map. Sol is 0,0,0 and everything else radiates outward from it.

I have considered the possibility that the Toast could be a way to position yourself in a smaller space than people assume, though. Also consider the possibility that instead of referring to skybox landmarks the Toast is actually directing us to systems in a very close proximity to each-other; that would certainly explain a few of the strange system name changes we've seen in the past.

Out of curiosity, which systems are those AXP stars in?
