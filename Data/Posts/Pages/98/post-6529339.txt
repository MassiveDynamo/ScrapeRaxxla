Dropped a bug report about that a couple weeks ago to see where that leads. Well, kinda believe thats a bug but, we will see.

Is the Founder's World tidally locked? If so then that might explain a lack of city lights. If the dark side is a frozen wasteland of perpetual darkness ... who would want to live there? Of course ... some other tidally locked Earth-like worlds DO lights on the dark side but I'm guessing that this is due to procedural generation. Surely Shinrarta Dhezra was designed and not generated procedurally. It always bothers me when I see city lights on a tidally locked Earth-like.
