I've been lurking here for a long time; thanks for the fascinating discussion. I primarily explore in the game and I'm always looking around for clues regarding Raxxla. I've noticed that Shinrarta Dezhra comes up in the discussion now and then. Have you discussed the fact that the Founder's World doesn't seem to have city lights on its night side? I'm not sure if it's always been this way, but I only noticed it in the last few days since I returned to the bubble after a long trip away. Of course, it might not signify anything. Perhaps the system population of 83 million is below some cutoff for ELWs and terraformed planets to have city lights. I did find it strange though. Also, if you look at the civilisation filter in the galmap, apparently Shinrarta Dezhra is not part of human civilisation. Again, this could just be related to some underlying game limitation related to PowerPlay: perhaps the same mechanic that protects the Pilots Federation's control of Shinrarta has these odd side effects. On the other hand, could it be a clue?

Nice discoveries I'm a big fan of the Founder's World=Raxxla idea so this adds to the mystery nicely. As you've pointed out, one of the amusing things about the Raxxla hunt is always "is it a bug, or a clue?"
