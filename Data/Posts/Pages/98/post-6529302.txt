Tin foil hats on!

If you set your filters in Galaxy Map for civilisations all human systems will be white, thargoids green and guardian blue. Now look at Shinrarta and tell what do you see? Couse I see NONE and ppl are living there. Even HIP 22460 has human civilisation with population 0. So what the heck is wrong with Shinrarta? Not even alien? No other system like that.

Dropped a bug report about that a couple weeks ago to see where that leads. Well, kinda believe thats a bug but, we will see.
