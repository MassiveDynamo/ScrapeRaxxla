if its been in the game before horizons, then its not planet based and like the zuara or radio lave, probably a sidewinder lost in space with some narrative about raxxla. Tionisla graveyard isn't there yet, just a tourist beacon.
So I dont think it will be much, like a voyager, some object floating around, like a comet, perhaps in shinatra dezhra, although how on earth (or in space) one fins it, who knows, take a long distance random trip in shinatra and hope for the best.

Fdev never said we could find/interact wit it (yet) - just that it's in-game and they know where it is.

Therefore, it could easily be a planet we've already found, but it's unlikely that it would appear on your scanner as "Raxxla", so we wouldn't necessarily know, and if the "important" bits of Raxxla are planet-based, and it's an ELW, we can't get to them yet anyway.

Maybe part of the puzzle is finding out how to identify Raxxla, not just finding a physical location. What if it's already been found, but the "obfuscation" is that no-one knows what they've found?
