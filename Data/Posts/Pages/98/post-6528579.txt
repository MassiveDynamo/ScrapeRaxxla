Since 3.0 I have been more or less convinced that Raxxla will be integrated to the main alien story of Elite. A long story arc, beginning from mysterious transportations of data crystals, to thargoid ships, scanning guardian spheres, and what ever lies beyond. I would say next we are going to see artificial intelligence aspect slowly starting to emerge, discover some new guardian modules, finally unlocking some system permit locks, and Q4 update. Maybe we are looking at a major plot twist or two of some kind, thinking what is really going on in the Milky Way or something, and Raxxla begins to be mentioned in the Galnet news every now and then. A personal journey of a kind.
