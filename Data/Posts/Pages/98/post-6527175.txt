if its been in the game before horizons, then its not planet based and like the zuara or radio lave, probably a sidewinder lost in space with some narrative about raxxla. Tionisla graveyard isn't there yet, just a tourist beacon.
So I dont think it will be much, like a voyager, some object floating around, like a comet, perhaps in shinatra dezhra, although how on earth (or in space) one fins it, who knows, take a long distance random trip in shinatra and hope for the best.
