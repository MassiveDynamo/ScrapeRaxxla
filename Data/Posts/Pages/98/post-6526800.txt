What’s DU?
I agree wrt SC. It will be great when finally released, but probably still 2 years hence. Focussed far too much on mouse & keyboard but too many controls. Spent the last 2 weeks playing around with HOTAS setup for it & still lots of problems. Also got the Mustang Alpha starter package- radar only worked once, cant hit anything. Making a bit of progress now EDTracker is almost setup, even with asymmetric Y & Z axes setup still cant look down properly to utilise cockpit controls, and Select doesn’t seem to work from joystick.....

want to get back to my planetary search in ED, but had bad cold/flu and then bronchitis over last week so only firing on one engine nozzle, and that’s still focussed on progressing my SC setup.
Sorry to hear you've not been well mate. Hope you get well soon (if you haven't already).
