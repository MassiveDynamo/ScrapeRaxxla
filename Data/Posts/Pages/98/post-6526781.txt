Well, guys, for who cares, these last days I've been struggling with the pre-alphas of SC and DU and my conclusion is that they will both be great games...some day, while ED is a great game...now.
Neither Raxxla there... (you never can tell.)

What’s DU?
I agree wrt SC. It will be great when finally released, but probably still 2 years hence. Focussed far too much on mouse & keyboard but too many controls. Spent the last 2 weeks playing around with HOTAS setup for it & still lots of problems. Also got the Mustang Alpha starter package- radar only worked once, cant hit anything. Making a bit of progress now EDTracker is almost setup, even with asymmetric Y & Z axes setup still cant look down properly to utilise cockpit controls, and Select doesn’t seem to work from joystick.....

want to get back to my planetary search in ED, but had bad cold/flu and then bronchitis over last week so only firing on one engine nozzle, and that’s still focussed on progressing my SC setup.
