Damn theres alot to read hey i'm new to the Raxxla hunt and i was wondering how i could help?

1) Accept madness into your life.

2) This is a good place to start: http://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/Raxxla

And an article on p41 of this awesome magazine: http://www.sagittariuseyes.com/issue-3.html

In short: There's a huuuuuuuuuuuuge amount of speculation and almost no actual facts, but that's where the fun begins.
