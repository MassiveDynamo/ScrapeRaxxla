Is it still possible to get the Obfuscated In The Outer Rim mission? If so, where?

Haven't seen them for a long time, so don't think it's possible to get them.

They were handing them out at Jameson Memorial but have since gone away...I think just shortly after 2.3 dropped.

Many other systems were also handing these missions out.

Don't give up hope, Raxxla is out there!

Don't think it's possible to give up hope with this kind of support [smile]
