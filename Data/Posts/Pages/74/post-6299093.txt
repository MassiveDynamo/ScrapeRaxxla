It's a bit scary to think that Raxxla was just another beige planet called Raxxla, that you could scan and sell data for a few credits, and thats about it. Thats just NOT fun.
You know, it has to be something like a starport built by yet unknown race, time machine, portal to the Magellanic clouds, an anchor set here before the Guardians constructed the hyperspace dimension and moved there and and reached level 3 on Kardashev scale of technological advancement. Thats something. Beige planet is just like getting wool socks for Christmas.
