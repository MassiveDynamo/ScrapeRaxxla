Thanks Jorki! Personally I don't think there's any clues to be had there - although, all the data is clearly incomplete - and also, it's not 'a tiny bit obvious'. Doesn't appear to be any leads from your initial data set... Also, I do not have the time at the moment to chase any of the other permits either way
You’re welcome!
No, I reread them while I was pasting them into the sheet and I couldn't see any basis for a hypothesis.

I think there are two bits to “tiny bit obvious”: firstly the martian artefact that clearly indicates aliens visited Sol in the distant past. Secondly MB’s “personal journey” leads to/via Shinrarta Dezhra so, as others have said, I think we need to look there for the next step towards Raxxla.
