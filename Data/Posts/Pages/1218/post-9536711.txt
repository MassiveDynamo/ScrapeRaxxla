@Macros Black, @Han_Zen, @simulacrae, @Factabulous, @Dommarraa, .... and anyone else who got to elite and tried these missions before they disappeared

I didnt start playing until after the E/F missions had, I think, been deleted. Certainly I didn’t get to Elite in the timeframe, so I don’t have first hand experience of them and need to rely on your collective memories. RDZ has raised an interesting point regarding these missions-who were the mission givers? Some of the missions seem to be against the Shinrarta TDW faction. So who was trying to get the info/data crystals/whatever? Was it The Real Dark Wheel and this hint was perhaps why those missions were deleted-perhaps they gave too much away? I’ve checked the posts at the beginning of this thread but the mission giver information was not supplied...
I tried a couple. Marcos did it all. I think they were the main reason he started this thread.
All evidence points to them being just regular missions, with flavour texts hinting to Raxxlas existence. The main thing they tell us, is that TDW and others are/were also looking for Raxxla. The NPCs that 'speaks' the flavour texts do not know Raxxlas location, so we can't expect them to lead us there.

Not that we will ever know but I suspect the data crystals (SAP8 Core?), did not lead to Raxxla after all. I think they lead to the first Gauardian ruins. At least I think that was the plan. Technical issues lead to us missing out on chunks of the planned story lie. This also includes the Halsey vissions, that are described in the Codex.
