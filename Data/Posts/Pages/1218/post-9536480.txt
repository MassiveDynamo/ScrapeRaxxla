We know it was placed in-game back in the gamma release, and DB/MB were responsible. Who else knows about it within FD, if anyone, is something we dont know.

Edit: Thought for the day: If TDW in Shinrarta are a front/obfuscation, then it’s possible those old E/F missions were also misdirection. One obvious reason for then deleting them would be that they were a bit too close to the truth!

Edit2: RDZ in IRH discord said “I wonder why the old raxxla related missions are given by the "nuenets revolutionary party" instead of the TDW.. and the reference of a secret in the system discription. (And why all the combat missions in the TDW seem to only target nuenets)..”. May be worth rechecking those old missions!
@Macros Black, @Han_Zen, @simulacrae, @Factabulous, @Dommarraa, .... and anyone else who got to elite and tried these missions before they disappeared

I didnt start playing until after the E/F missions had, I think, been deleted. Certainly I didn’t get to Elite in the timeframe, so I don’t have first hand experience of them and need to rely on your collective memories. RDZ has raised an interesting point regarding these missions-who were the mission givers? Some of the missions seem to be against the Shinrarta TDW faction. So who was trying to get the info/data crystals/whatever? Was it The Real Dark Wheel and this hint was perhaps why those missions were deleted-perhaps they gave too much away? I’ve checked the posts at the beginning of this thread but the mission giver information was not supplied...
