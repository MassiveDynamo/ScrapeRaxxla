@Comandante : Hi Commander. I said I'd look up the system descriptions of the permit locked systems for you to check. I've added them into my own permits list sheet here
ED Personal Journey Permits.ods
drive.google.com

happy theorising!

Personally- I'm wondering if it's possible to download a copy of the Codex text so I can theorise in comfort on my iPad rather than sat at my gaming PC, with my RSI playing up. Anybody any ideas???

Thanks Jorki! Personally I don't think there's any clues to be had there - although, all the data is clearly incomplete - and also, it's not 'a tiny bit obvious'. Doesn't appear to be any leads from your initial data set... Also, I do not have the time at the moment to chase any of the other permits either way
