I don't quite understand what you're saying.

Don't you read GALNET news inside the game? This is the storyline.
Galnet is a series of “news” snippets, published by The Club and anyone else with a vested interest in manipulating the galactic population, with the occasional unbiased article. The storylines are what is hidden behind those articles. There are several storylines, probably interlinked. One deals with the Thargoids, another the Guardians, another with Azimith, another with Wreaken, another with the Far God, another with Raxxla. I meant we need to find the Raxxla storyline, which is hidden from us. Those old/deleted E/F missions were the only thing that seemed to relate to the Raxxla storyline...
