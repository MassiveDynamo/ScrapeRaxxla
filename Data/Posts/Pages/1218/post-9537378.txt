All correct. The missions left me with a distinct feeling of just being 'regular' missions spread all over the bubble and not just isolated to Shinrarta Dezha, e.g.see Obfuscated In The Outer Rim.
I'm sure I did some as I had access to SD from the start... I wouldn't have been Elite back then tho... Went off to get combat Elite in CZs mainly...
