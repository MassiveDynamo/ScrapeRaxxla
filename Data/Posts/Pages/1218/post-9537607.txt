Hey,

I was playing Alien:Isolation recently and i saw something that looks like RAXXLA logo:

View attachment 266384

You will need to zoom at left shoulder of the poor girl.

The story is located in Zeta 2 reticuli in game.
In ED, Zeta Reticuli is a system composed of 2 stars: Zeta-1 Reticuli (System Name) and Zeta-2 Reticuli. Nothing intersting there, just a planet and a medium station.

for more infos.

I tried to get the G E and S letters from the "Gemini Exoplanet Solutions" and get the number letter (A=1, E=5, G=7, S=19) and look at galactic coordinate to look for a system but nothing.

Btw, i found amazing the post of someone that found 2060 Chiron symbol (a key).
So i looked for Gemini and the symbol could be a door? (like the japanese ones).

Maybe you will have more luck than me, i just hope it will help
