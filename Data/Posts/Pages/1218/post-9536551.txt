We know it was placed in-game back in the gamma release, and DB/MB were responsible. Who else knows about it within FD, if anyone, is something we dont know.

Edit: Thought for the day: If TDW in Shinrarta are a front/obfuscation, then it’s possible those old E/F missions were also misdirection. One obvious reason for then deleting them would be that they were a bit too close to the truth!

Edit2: RDZ in IRH discord said “I wonder why the old raxxla related missions are given by the "nuenets revolutionary party" instead of the TDW.. and the reference of a secret in the system discription. (And why all the combat missions in the TDW seem to only target nuenets)..”. May be worth rechecking those old missions!
I think also that TDW is a front for the real one.
