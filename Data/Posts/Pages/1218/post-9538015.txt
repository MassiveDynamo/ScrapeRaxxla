Still pondering the missing E/F missions. Apparently they disappeared when rank-locking was removed from missions in 1.5/2.0 update. 1.5 Patch Notes General Fixes/Tweaks said “Elite/Founder missions are now only available at the Founders World” https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/horizons-2-0-and-ships-1-5-change-log.211781/

Note-the change note said they’d only appear at “Founders World”, not “Jameson Memorial”. Founders World is not landable...was this the cause of the bug?
The other obvious thing that needs to be tested is if a logical AND was coded in, so they only appear for a Founder AND elite player vice a Founder OR elite player....

Interesting...have just scanned that same 1.5/2.0 change note and spotted, also under General tweaks, “Fix an issue with entering the reference frame of a space station while on the surface of Lave 2 by shrinking the station's reference frame size”. Can’t understand this as Lave 2 is not landable-it’s permit locked at the request of the author of “Lave Revolution” with no known way of getting the permit.
