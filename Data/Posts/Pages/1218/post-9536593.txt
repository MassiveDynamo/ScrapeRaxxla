@Macros Black, @Han_Zen, @simulacrae, @Factabulous, @Dommarraa, .... and anyone else who got to elite and tried these missions before they disappeared

I didnt start playing until after the E/F missions had, I think, been deleted. Certainly I didn’t get to Elite in the timeframe, so I don’t have first hand experience of them and need to rely on your collective memories. RDZ has raised an interesting point regarding these missions-who were the mission givers? Some of the missions seem to be against the Shinrarta TDW faction. So who was trying to get the info/data crystals/whatever? Was it The Real Dark Wheel and this hint was perhaps why those missions were deleted-perhaps they gave too much away? I’ve checked the posts at the beginning of this thread but the mission giver information was not supplied...
Afaicr all the factions in Shin gave elite level missions, but TBW tended to give the interesting sounding ones because of their faction type.
None of the missions lead anywhere at all, they just sounded interesting and were more difficult than normal.

There is no 'real' or 'fake' Dark Wheel, just the faction. Anything else is tinfoil. Any player claiming to be DW is similarly deluded.
