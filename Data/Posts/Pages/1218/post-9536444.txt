I might be completly wrong here but in an interview MB said this:
Brookes subsequently confirmed that Raxxla is in the Milky Way galaxy in an interview with player DJTruthsayer:
Question: "Where is Raxxla?"
Brookes: "Well it's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where it is. It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves."
Question: "You have said that there will be no clues though?"
Brookes: "That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious just so people know what they're doing. There's nothing to be revealed at this stage."

"At this stage". What if that ment that at that point there weren't any clues yet but they planned, and by now should have, released some sort of hint. Hidden or not. Maybe if we find it we can have some sort of clue what we are doing. Because let's face it right now we have nothing or very little.
