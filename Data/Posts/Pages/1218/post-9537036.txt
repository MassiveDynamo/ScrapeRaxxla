I tried a couple. Marcos did it all. I think they were the main reason he started this thread.
All evidence points to them being just regular missions, with flavour texts hinting to Raxxlas existence. The main thing they tell us, is that TDW and others are/were also looking for Raxxla. The NPCs that 'speaks' the flavour texts do not know Raxxlas location, so we can't expect them to lead us there.

Not that we will ever know but I suspect the data crystals (SAP8 Core?), did not lead to Raxxla after all. I think they lead to the first Gauardian ruins. At least I think that was the plan. Technical issues lead to us missing out on chunks of the planned story lie. This also includes the Halsey vissions, that are described in the Codex.
All correct. The missions left me with a distinct feeling of just being 'regular' missions spread all over the bubble and not just isolated to Shinrarta Dezha, e.g.see Obfuscated In The Outer Rim.
