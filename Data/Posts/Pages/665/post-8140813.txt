Ok so I'm new here and yesterday I went down the raxxla rabbithole. To me the most logical explanation is that raxxla isn't some place or object in the game world. It IS the game world itself. We are transported to another world when we play the game and maybe raxxla could be just the game itself or the trance-like state you find yourself in when fully immersed in the game.

Just a thought.
