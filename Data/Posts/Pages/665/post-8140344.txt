No. Salom√© had no particular combat rank at all. She was never a member of the pilots' federation.


Awesome, thanks Drew.

Assuming that that was thought about by Fdev at the time when you wrote/developed/submitted the storyline then that means there is no Elite prerequisite for joining the DW (in the mind of DB & MB and the holders of the Raxxla story today). Big assumption so place your own value of 'true' on it everyone.

If true then Shinrata and DW faction there are probably red herrings / not meant to be anything more than an in game reward or achievement. If true all associated missions may not be meaningful either. At least nor for this lore....maybe something to do with Thargs or Guardians or A.N.Other.

Doesnt necessarily point to anything but may point away from others...
