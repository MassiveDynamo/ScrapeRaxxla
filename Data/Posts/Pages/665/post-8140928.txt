Although I don't post on this thread much I do keep up with it. But recently a CMDR Toxophilite found a new undiscovered guardian site, presumably the last one in the game as seen here
Ram Tah mission log: JACKPOT! Found some undiscovered Guardian Ruins in COL 173 sector - Ram will be pleased. Humbling to think I am the first human to explore these ancient remnants of a great civilisation... #EliteDangerous #FatherhoodWing pic.twitter.com/gBk0a4QXRo

Which got me thinking, what if the Raxxla logo was the layout of a guardian site, like from top down view as they all have unique designs.

Dont know about the logo, but the look of that site with its amphitheatre like structure (and others like it) bring to mind the words in Holdstock's Alien Worlds where he describes how the Ancient Egyptian built the pyramids as part of the Talmor lens network. and says that " the significance and importance of shape was twisted and confused and ultimately lost. They built the stabilizers the easy way, with the points toward the stars" implying they were upside down.

The amphitheatre would be a pyramid the other way up (and round), so are these Talmor lenses/stabilisers etc.?

Unfortunately no info on the Guardians points to them being the reptilian warriors in that book.

Here's Old Sarum near Salisbury - even somwhere for the obelisks to be found
