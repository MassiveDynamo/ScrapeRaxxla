Zieman: whilst it's true in FE , there are plenty of places where names have changed or systems dropped merged or radically moved in ED.

So if Veliaze has vanished, then the lore may have got moved in ed to another system.
The most likely explanation is that FD sniped the name Veliaze from the old lore, without checking that it was in ED.
