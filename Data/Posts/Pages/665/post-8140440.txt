(3) This is possible, but again not sure how to tie things together - Ryder ties to Lave are quite thin - it was a holiday destination for Jason and Alex, menat to be somewhere safe for a trip with his son..
Holiday or recon mission?

Could the Ryders have been going to confirm something at Lave 2 (permit locked) or hidden within the Tourist Beacons: 0184 First Thargoid Contact, 0236 History of Lave or 0237 Walden's Dictatorship?
