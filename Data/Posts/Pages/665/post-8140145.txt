Part of the information purported by Hunterwithscales in the link off the reddit posted a page ago by Skyrock:
Micro Bit Computer Magazine 1990.
The reason why I know this. My last game save in 1991 is Raxxla.


Which is another untraceable assertion/hint re-enforcing my prejudice that this is all dis-information.

Is it just me who follows all the links?
