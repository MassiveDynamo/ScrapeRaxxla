Although I don't post on this thread much I do keep up with it. But recently a CMDR Toxophilite found a new undiscovered guardian site, presumably the last one in the game as seen here
Ram Tah mission log: JACKPOT! Found some undiscovered Guardian Ruins in COL 173 sector - Ram will be pleased. Humbling to think I am the first human to explore these ancient remnants of a great civilisation... #EliteDangerous #FatherhoodWing pic.twitter.com/gBk0a4QXRo

Which got me thinking, what if the Raxxla logo was the layout of a guardian site, like from top down view as they all have unique designs.
