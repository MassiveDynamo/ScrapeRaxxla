in general, I further tested my jumping theory. translated raxxla into numbers - 729952, jumped from sol. Let me remind you: system number 7 is selected in the list, I jump there, then I select system number 2, and so on. after all the jumps, a ship appeared! screenshot below.

after I tried to jump from lave, it resulted in more interesting results than I thought, I just went back to lave. really nothing else happened or I didn't see ...

by the same principle I will jump again, but using 18 1 24 24 12 1 from the points sol, lave, tau ceti

Is this for real?
