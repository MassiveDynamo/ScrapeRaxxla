Totally agree with the first part. But Raxxla's location in E could only exist after the gamma release in 2014. I was thinking more on the lines of an interesting coincidence. Either way, Orion nebula is pretty cool and I haven't been there anyway.
I’d rbe commend following the Hesperus survivors’ beacons https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/mysterys-continuation-new-message-from-salvation.581536/. Gives some lovely views!
