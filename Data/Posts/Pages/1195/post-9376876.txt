Wasn't Ursa Major supposed to be a princess?
True, in one version of the myth Callisto was a daughter of King Lycaon of Arkadia, and she got transformed into the Big Dipper. Jupiter's 4th moon is also named after her. Hm... ok, so we have two princesses among the stars. I ll add the Ursa Major constellation to the list of regions where I ll look for neutron stars.
