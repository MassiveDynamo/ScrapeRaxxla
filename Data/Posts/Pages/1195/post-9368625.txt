I was poking around some systems with interesting gateway like features, so I checked out Beta Muscae. Didnt find anything but I thought placing a black home more or less right in between the two jet cones of a neutron star could count as a gateway or tunnel as mentioned in the codex.




this is in SC edging closer to the BH


and this is when dropped in. Didnt find anything but pretty cool sight anyway. Also I think if there is some stellar phenomena acting as a gateway to somewhere, it prolly is something like that.
