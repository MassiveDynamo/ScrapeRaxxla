Alright, after a little more messing around with Neutron Stars, I ... still don't have anything But... my conclusion so far is this: out of all the potential clues given in the codex entry, the paragraph about the omphalos rift and the spiralling stars is probably the most legit. Assuming the clue is made in a way that doesn't require deep diving ancient poetry and mythology, googling omphalos will net the story about Delphi and the translation of "navel". And to that we add the fictional story of the princess and the spiralling stars which leaves us only with a princess reference and a type of star if we leave out Sydney and his poem.

And this is why I think this all refers to a system with a neutron star or several. Because looking at them in the ship HUD they spin. And the way they are depicted as a hologram is a spherical center with two arms. And that center could very well be interpreted and seen as a navel.

Now there is something else I noticed when listening to the sound a neutron makes. Not the one on system map, but the one when targeted by a FSS. I was really surprised to find that it is probably the most whispery, ethereal sound I have heard so far. Thinking of whisperer in witch/hyperspace, I always thought they prolly mean black holes. But a BH got nothing when it comes to strange whispering compared to listening to a neutron star on FSS, both when zoomed out of the NS, and when zoomed in.

So right now I am looking for neutron star systems within the Andromeda constellation, since Andromeda is the only princess up there in the sky. I only found one system so far, but didn't experience anything odd. When I query EDSM the nearest other neutron star systems all seem to be around Andromeda, and not in it. Well... I ll keep looking!
