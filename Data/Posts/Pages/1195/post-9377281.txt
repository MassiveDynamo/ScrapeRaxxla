I know this has been postulated before, but has anyone here read ‘Sun Dragon’ by M Brookes?

I’m in two minds as to buy it, but could this be the so called Children’s story referred to in the Codex - as referenced in his other work ‘Elite Legacy’?

If so has anyone interrogated it for references to John Milton, Norse myth, star gates or inter dimensional portals… does it repeatedly discuss certain themes, numbers or locations?

“I had no form of entertainment except for a book, a single book about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon. My father must have bought it on the black market. He couldn’t have got it from anywhere else. “I still have that book.” Elite Legacy M Brookes.

I read sun dragon (as well as the bits in the tau ceti mission web blog) - it is about energy creatures that come from tarantula nebula in the large magellanic cloud and feed off of energy from sun to reproduce (?) kind of like fish swiming up stream to lay eggs or something like that. I think the tau ceti mission was about contact with an alien race that gave information about the sun dragons... Its been a while since i read it. The Tau Ceti mission never materalized into a book though. I dont know if Sun Dragon had any Milton References off hand - but will give it a look.
