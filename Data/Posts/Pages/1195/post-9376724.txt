Does anyone know why the asteroid belt in Sol is in the middle of the sun? Or what happened to Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta, Hygiea or the other large bodies in the asteroid belt? Maybe a lore explanation?
Fun fact, one of the asteroids is Proserpina, the roman name for Persephone/Kore. And Ceres is the roman name for her mother, Demeter.
