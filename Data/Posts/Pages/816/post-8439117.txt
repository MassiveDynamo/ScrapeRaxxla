You guys hop in and out of game context when discussing lore and mechanics and also wrong kind of ''elitism'' imho (we have SOLO mode for a reason).
The handful of select commanders could very well be all players. Codex is in-game tool working in Elite universe. There are TRILLIONS of people in Elite galaxy. Even all the players would be just a handful relatively speaking.
I was thinking this too. Some systems claim a population of billions. Idk know how many active cmdrs there are but i think its only in the hundreds of thousands
