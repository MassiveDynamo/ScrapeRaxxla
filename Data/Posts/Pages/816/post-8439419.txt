Hmm, now you say that im in 2 minds myself.

At the time:

The messages didn't come from Drew ( but could have been an Alt account.)
He seemed to imply they were triggered by actions in game, getting to the destination etc (obviously not if just doing it himself)
He seemed to be typing something but not the full text just by the sound of number of keys being pressed, I thought it was comms with either fdev or fdev server to trigger the next (could have been cut n paste or switching between accounts now I think about it.)
The messages took a lot longer to arrive than just a normal inbox chat response, he often said 'Have you received it? It should be coming soon' or words to that effect.

So yeah, with proper thought youre probably right, my tinfoil hat was obviously on (or it worked exactly as intended and I got sucked into the roleplay) Was fun while it lasted.

Yes, I did comment on it before https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8162426
Couldn’t find the video, but now realise it was a part of Cmdr Plater’s 24 hour charity livestream. Will rewatch (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8160084) when I’ve got time. Tinfoil is tricky stuff, it partially exists in quantum n-dimensional reality, putting it on your head is dangerous!
