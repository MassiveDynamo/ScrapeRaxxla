Yes, I referenced Djadjok’s TO work a few posts earlier.

@ Vetinari. Only 12 minutes in so far of the 2 hour Drew Wagar part of Cmdr Plater’s 24 hour charity livestream As I thought, this is DW simulating a TDW invitation. At ~7mins in DW says “ you will get a friend request from Alessia Verde” this was one of DW’s accounts from the Salomé storyline, he was controlling this character. The typing you hear is Cmdr Plater’s, not Drew’s. At 11:25 Alessia says “my father was Luko Prestigio Giovanni” - this seems to be so close to the Codex mention of Prester John that this may suggest some hidden meaning (or link between Raxxla and TDW) on FD’s part, but FD aren’t involved in this “simulation” video. Although DW’s characters (Luko, Alessia, Rebecca) were part of TDW, I don’t think Salomé ever was. Luko left what was supposed to be a symbol (actually fan art) of TDW in Salomé’s ship; I don’t think she ever saw it or was interested in it, or knew of it until it was brought out as “proof” against her at her trial. Drew’s storyline got taken up by the Children of Raxxla player group and became intertwined with it due to roleplaying, but I don’t think there is an official link of either Drew or CoR with FD’s TDW. Clearly Drew knows something about TDW from the FD “lore bible”, in particular whether TDW in Shin Dez are part of TDW, but he can’t say anything about that (https://m.twitch.tv/drewwagar/clip/BombasticHyperScorpionWow). So we don’t know whether Drew’s book portrayal of TDW is going to be reflected in-game. Certainly this video is just a bit of fun, and I don’t think it represents TDW in-game invitation test. The codex says that will be disguised, so you only know it was an invitation test afterwards when you successfully complete it (& get the invitation).
