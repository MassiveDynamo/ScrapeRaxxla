This is excellent! Now I gotta go getting more books! Im hoping for a stargate too. A while back a CMDR posted something from Holdstock/Eisler that seemed reminiscent of the DW toast. Anyone have a link to this, or remember what Im talking about with it?

Ya i think that was the Dead World Scroll bit from the Tour.
