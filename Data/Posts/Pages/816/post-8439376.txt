@Jorki - the last one I liked, it should be in your notifications (bell), no Id never seen it and hasn't happened since either, nothing controversial in the post I can see, I may be able to go back in browser and get it. If so Ill try and post it here. Drew vid was played out in game though so must have had frontier involvement unless Drew hacked ED which is a non-starter as an option, more questions than answers.

Edit: I now get this when going back in browser, was exactly the same but with the other text about liking it?
Edit Edit: removed as either doesn't work or may give access to my account.

You guys hop in and out of game context when discussing lore and mechanics.
The handful of select commanders could very well be all players. Codex is in-game tool working in Elite universe. There are TRILLIONS of people in Elite galaxy. Even all the players would be just a handful relatively speaking.

I had to read this 3 times to see what you meant and then went 'Oh yeah' - a good point well made and completely wipes out my concern
