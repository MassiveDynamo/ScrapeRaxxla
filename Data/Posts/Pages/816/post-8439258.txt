@Vetinari: mmm, played & forumed (!) for 5 years, never heard of full screen (or anything smaller!) with 'Are you sure you want to like this?' message on it before. Which of my posts was it? Maybe I hit an FD nerve? has anyone else seen this?

I wouldn’t take phrasing in the codex too seriously. Filthymick & Mrrshal have just pointed this out but “only a handful get invited” is in relation to the in-lore galactic population, not the playerbase. I interpret it as another way saying you have to be Elite to stand a chance of getting the TDW invitation. Elites are only a handful in-game, though there are likely to be many Elite players IRL, and I think any player could get the invitation if they meet the criteria.

I think that DW’s lore video was entirely his own effort, don’t think FD were involved at all.

Edelgard‘s posts are always sensible!

Of course this is speculation, but based on what little we have been told and knowledge of the gameplay. I think personal journey means exactly that, each player has to make the effort; reading about others’ exploits doesn’t count. You have to play the game. So whatever the membership test criterion is, you have to reach it for yourself. A consequence of this might mean any activity involving a wing may not count. One possibility is that we have to succeed in a certain number of TO missions, just doing the odd one or two wouldnt count. Maybe the criterion is to do with TO received within Shin Dez?
