@Jorki - the last one I liked, it should be in your notifications (bell), no Id never seen it and hasn't happened since either, nothing controversial in the post I can see, I may be able to go back in browser and get it. If so Ill try and post it here. Drew vid was played out in game though so must have had frontier involvement unless Drew hacked ED which is a non-starter as an option, more questions than answers.

Edit: I now get this when going back in browser, was exactly the same but with the other text about liking it?

I had to read this 3 times to see what you meant and then went 'Oh yeah' - a good point well made and completely wipes out my concern

Ok. Last post of mine that you liked was this https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8437924
It was a long one, with embedded video link, so together that might have triggered something in the forum software. It does seem to play up a bit.

I’ll recheck that DW video on TDW, but I just remember it as being his speculation on how things might work & he sent the messages to the other participant via in-game chat so still don’t understand why you think FD were involved.
