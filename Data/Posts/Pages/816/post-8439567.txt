I think the test is coded into the game, not done manually by a database admin. But yes, we need to figure out how we should have been playing the game!
And itâ€™s a personal journey, so I think organising others to do something cant be a factor in that.

But we do know TDW invite you to a disguised membership test, so something demanding, not straightforward, not criminal, must be some form of mission-what else could it be?; that could fit with the TO mission mechanism, or something like it.

Personally I think the 'form of mission' gets hinted at in the manual of ED.

From the manual:

" ... All you need to know is that my organisation has a very specific remit: to seek out those who have the potential to become real movers and shakers, those precious few with the talent to mould and shape the galaxy around them, to create change on a grand scale."

Now think of shaking in a metaphorical sense - you move something up and down, or left to right, quite quickly.
So what if, to pass the test, we are supposed to work for a (maybe even certain) faction or superpower, gain max. reputation, maybe even spread/move this faction to other systems and then, afterwards, start working against them and keep doing this until we reach min. reputation (getting hostile to them), or to the point that the faction gets ousted from systems again.

There is also some in-game hint that this could be the right way. On several occasions, while doing missions, I had some bounty hunters appear which started shooting at me and sent me 'greetings from my previous employer'.
