Exactly. The journals are not canon. They never were, in the context of ED.

A large amount of the Journal articles have however been republished in ED over time. Most of them as TB messages. Some as Galnet articles.

If the article is not not about clones, androids or time travel, it can pop up as canon at any moment.

The asteroid destruction campaign is a plausible explanation to why there are no asteroids and only one comet in Sol.
