Ackwada at least may be indirectly linked to Raxxla (though by way of Augustus Brenquith). I am still trying to get solid dates on that. Also, we have another wrinkle to the story (this is from Ackwada tourist beacon):

The official discovery of this system and its habitable planet is nowadays accredited to Augustus Brenquith, although the Rockforth Corporation claim the land deeds and development rights to the system. Thirty nine years after the Corporation declared the system its own; an ancient message capsule (a common way for sending messages at the time) was recovered from outside the orbit of Jupiter in the Sol system.

I still intend to check the other systems Marlinists were originally from just in case there is additional backstory there on Brenquith. So, far though all available data strongly supports a Marlin Duval Raxxla discovery. Also, does anyone know for certain which Duval died in Capella? Is there anything in the novels about that? Also, of note, Capella also has a moon named Lawrence's Grave in addtion to the one named Duval's Grave. There are no tourist beacons there so I am temporarily working on the assumption this may be Marlin Duval but that is not certain (not to mention Capella is some 160.97 LY so this seems like it might be a stretch that was where she died. I am working on getting the Achenar permit to get additional information.
