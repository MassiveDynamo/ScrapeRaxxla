Pending Registration update to Pilots' Federation/EPF: TOP SECRET

Arrived in Ackwada this morning to begin research on the era between founding of Marlin's Republic in 2250 to approximately 2300. There is still the possibility the Marlin Duval death is not connected by anymore than an internal difference in desired political structure of the new colony and bad timing. It should be noted per Galnet Ackwada was a stronghold for Marlinists before the forced migration owing to the NMLA - see Imperial Crackdown on Marlinists (30 September 3306). Reports on this matter have been requested by Mars High, Olympus Village, and the Gandhi Institute in Alioth. Sirius Corporation government has started asking questions as there are now significant concerns being raised as to whether or not Duval lineage should even be seen as legitimate. This may jeopardize multiple treaties between the Federation and the Empire if Marlin Duval was killed explicitly to kill her Republic (the matter is made only worse by the potential connection to the myth of Raxxla). War is feared to be on the horizon.
