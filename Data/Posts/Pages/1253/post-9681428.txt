Well, I’ve been out for dinner, had three glasses of wine and I’m on my second brandy, which won’t be my last tonight...
So I wish you all a Happy, Healthy and Peaceful New Year!
While I still can

Edit:: and what ever happened to part three of the 3307 retrospective???????
Edit2: @sallymorganmoore : someone at FD forget to set the Galnet post to go out on the 30th??
