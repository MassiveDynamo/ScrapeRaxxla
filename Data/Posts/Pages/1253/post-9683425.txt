I wonder, heck suspect, that everything is likely to be a whole lot more simple than we’ve made it out to be. Given the limitations of the game and the relatively simple nature of previous things that were only made complex by FDvs vaguery coupled with the shear size of the galaxy.
to the point that I wonder if it’s not out by Barnards loop.
“a little bit obvious”, heck Barnards loop has been plastered all over this game, title screen, box art etc since the very beginning.
most everything is hidden somewhere in or around a nebula.
but of course Barnards loop has been explored and nothing reported (until people got to the Horse Head Dark region, found weird stuff, and then it got permit locked).
I am curious tho where the rogue stars from its formation are in game and if they’ve been fully vetted.
Barnards loop was formed from a supernova of one star part of a multi star system. The remaining stars were ejected and are now whipping their way through the galaxy at high speed.
AE Aurigae
Mu Columbae
53 Arietis

heck AE Aurigae has found it’s way into the “flaming star nebula” and is what lights it. Could be a jewel that burns on the brow and all that.
