My guess based purely on Marlin Duval death in 2296 per Elite Encounters RPG and Nemorensis official novel is something like either becoming the new Emperor or replacement of the Empire with Marlin Duval's ideals and getting rid of the monarchy entirely and return to a more Athenian model of government.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Nemorensis?wprov=sfla1 on Wikipedia. It should be noted Simon Spurrier's official novel is based on this myth and this is covered in the Wikipedia entry. Also, the CMDRs stand a significant chance of being clone slaves. In Rex Nemorensis, only a slave could challenge the "king of the Grove". Additionally, you'll note this was a fertility rite. The Club happened in part because of a lifeform from Baltahâ€™Sine (yes, it is in the game and was recently in Galnet re: Alliance and Sirius Corporation) in Nemorensis that has a peculiar reproduction cycle.
