Question: Concerning the Dark Wheel Codex, what new ‘mission providers’ were introduced on that date?

I cannot locate the original release notes (lack of sleep)… and Im looking to explore an assumption.

Assuming the older missions were linked to Raxxla and not just irrelevant fluff; when FD certainly removed them; did the Codex herald in a replacement?

If we presume the older missions were the invite, whatever was introduced along with the Codex could well be the new invite.

The old E/F missions apparently disappeared when rank-locking was removed from missions in 1.5/2.0 update. 1.5 Patch Notes General Fixes/Tweaks Dec 2015 said “Elite/Founder missions are now only available at the Founders World”. Dont have anything on mission providers, perhaps @Zieman might be able to help? Or @Han_Zen?

Edit: is there a way of going back to see the history of factions that operated out of a station?
(I’m assuming you just want to know the factions at Jameson Memorial before & after that time?)

Edit2: when did TDW Codex come out?
