46 IDs. Rings and barry centers arenâ€™t counted as bodies.
You're right.
In the log there is a key: "NonBodyCount" "53".
I can't get the count (i added stations, planetary ports, surface installations) and space POI but the count is either too low (with space POI i have 49) or too high.
Does someone know what does it count?
