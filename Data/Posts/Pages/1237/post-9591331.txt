Can anyone explain the blank spaces for bodies 6, 8, 14, 21, 23, 29 ?
It was below the table
Interesting to see that asteroid belts and planet rings are the same thing.
As you can see there are some bodyIDs missing. BodyID: 6 seem to be the asteroid belt (between Mars and Jupiter). BodyIDs 8, 14, 23 and 29 correspond to the rings of the Gas giants.

BodyID: 21 is unknown. It's an orbit between Saturn and Uranus. It could be the fabeled Halley's comet? I would have to do a similar check in Pareco, to get a better idea on how the comets are implemented.
