O7 Cmdrs, following my meandering around a fresh Cmdr profile, as you may have followed it inspired me to throw a few fresh questions at FD about in game mechanisms and how things are intended to work (see Polaris permits).

Below is a confirmation that the ‘old’ Dark Wheel missions (see page 1) are no longer in game.
