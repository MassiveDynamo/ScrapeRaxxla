Question: Concerning the Dark Wheel Codex, what new game elements were introduced on that date?

I cannot locate the original patch notes (lack of sleep)… and Im looking to explore an assumption.

Assuming the older missions were linked to Raxxla and not just irrelevant fluff; when FD certainly removed them; did the Codex herald in a replacement?

If we assume the older missions were the invite, whatever was introduced along with the Codex could well be the new invite.
