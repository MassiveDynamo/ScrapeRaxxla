But you may well not notice it unless you were looking for the right thing - 'you dont know what it is'

As for 'no clues' - surely thats been 'rectconned' by the codex? or else they're going to upset alot of people by raising up a puzzle that doesn't have a solution - for heaven's sake the name of the 2 biggest mysteries are up in lights!

I think we still need to have a good look in the waste basket of things we discounted..

I don't see anything in the Codex that I consider a 'puzzle'. There's some background lore, but nothing to actually 'solve'.
However, the Codes does say that you don't find TDW, they find you, so even if you happen to be in the right place you're probably not going to see anything unless you've been 'invited'.
