But all the missions disappeared, so they are just a 'shell' now - no point in making a noise about it..

by which I mean you can read Farseer's comment both ways..

Shinrarta Dehzra?
“It keeps the treasure seekers and wishful thinkers occupied,’ the woman said. ‘They believe they are onto something. They have their uses for occasional menial activities. The truth is far more subtle than they will ever suspect. Shinrarta is merely a front.”

Hypothesis: the missions disappeared because they led nowhere...Possibly FD a priori managing the salt they’d receive when Raxxla is found & revealed to have no relation to SD. They were “just a distraction to keep the treasure seekers and wishful thinkers occupied”! Often wondered why SD is supposed to be permit locked to Elite pilots, but it’s full of npc pilots that are of lower rank...

It strikes me that the Codex pic for the Raxxla entry might actually show the entrance to TDW station- more obfuscation. Whether finding that would help us find Raxxla is moot. But it does seem odd that it hasn’t been found so far; everyone is checking out 8th moons.
