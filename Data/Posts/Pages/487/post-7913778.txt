OK... If you think that the super secret base of The Dark Wheel, undiscovered for centuries, can be found by any biowaste trucker launching its FSS when arriving in the system...
Why not ? It's FD's ED, after all..
But you may well not notice it unless you were looking for the right thing - 'you dont know what it is'

As for 'no clues' - surely thats been 'rectconned' by the codex? or else they're going to upset alot of people by raising up a puzzle that doesn't have a solution - for heaven's sake the name of the 2 biggest mysteries are up in lights!

I think we still need to have a good look in the waste basket of things we discounted..
