I wan't really being that specific - in general you gotta notice what you're looking at. I'm perfectly aware of the possible interpretations of the livestream - thats not the point.

We have been given some fairly fat hints in the codex - they set a puzzle 5 years ago and we didnt find it - it must be driving them nuts. So they had to give us a nudge - but we still didnt get it - this is not uncommon when trying to set challenging puzzles.

Anyway - think my t-shirt shrunk in the wash - maybe time to give up on it and wear it for gardening...
