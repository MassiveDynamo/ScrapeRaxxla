I normally do a couple of orbits - equatorial and polar and look for any bright spec that moves (i.e. not in the skybox) - stations appears as a bright dot as can be seen when glass is shattered and no HUD - you can still find the way home.

not appearing in FSS - well I don't see why not. It can find the voyager probes, which don't emit much, so a station would be obvious - even low power - no I suspect we're not looking in the right places... we've discounted it or have just misinterpreted the hints. In general I suspect we've 'missed' on every clue, either because we're over complicating it or else we haven't come pre-prepared with the right starting facts.

For instance - abandoned stations - these are a thing in FFE II and I didn't know that - now I have the list, but it didnt help much - how much stuff needs to be known to put the pieces together? Do we have to 'be' DB at least in terms of starting info? I hope that amongst our number there are those who have played out all the elite games and read all the literature etc and know the myth, poetry, scifi books etc. Thats not me..

Perhaps the DW station is hidden in plain sight? did we discount all known stations? Is there a 'secret' entrance to a station we already know about or an installation - is there somewhere to insert a 'key' ?
