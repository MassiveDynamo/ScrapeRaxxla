Night vision might help when eyeballing possible orbits ? But only in normal flight... No ? Must be really tedious to low wake every now and then...

Edit: taking examples of the known stations, what would be the most probable orbit ? Equatorial ? And the distance from the surface ? Relative to the body mass ?
