But it does seem odd that it hasn’t been found so far; everyone is checking out 8th moons.
How is everyone or most of them, checking 8th moons? As I said, I don't think that FSS and probes, in SC, is enough to find it. You have to eyeball all along the probable orbits in normal flight.

Normal stations are visible in SC.....have I missed something?

Oops... I must have missed something... But I can't remember seeing any station in SC...

I’ve been mapping any 8th moon I come across; does seem odd that mapping has to be done in SC...
Imho, mapping moons will not reveal hidden stations on orbit. Only surface features. But only imho.
As the FSS will not reveal an obfuscated station. Too easy peasy !
Maybe the ship sensors in normal flight... When in range... But just maybe.
(Err.. Sorry, guys. Don't pay too much of an attention to my posts. Already 7 months playing other space games. I may very well have forgotten most of ED mechanics...)
