Night vision might help when eyeballing possible orbits ? But only in normal flight... No ? Must be really tedious to low wake every now and then...

Edit: taking examples of the known stations, what would be the most probable orbit ? Equatorial ? And the distance from the surface ? Relative to the body mass ?

Why only eyeballing in normal flight? Normal stations are visible in SC.....have I missed something?
Iâ€™ve been mapping any 8th moon I come across; does seem odd that mapping has to be done in SC...
