Scanning a system and mapping bodies may not be the best way to find an obfuscated station orbiting a moon.
But I bet you also orbited that 8th moon thoroughly..

I even fired probes out randomly, because you never know...

Edit:
Thinking about it, I didn't check the ELW dark side.
Fortunately, I'm parked on the 8th moon right now, so I'll check it when I next log in.
