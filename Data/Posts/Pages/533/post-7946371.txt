Ya true i had a similar book growing up "Spacewrecks" there was a kind of genere where they would take a collection of random evocative space themed art and fantasy art and string it together to create a narrative. Its very much about story telling and imagination. But after reading it i think it was a source of ideas for not just raxxla in elite.
Oh, I've no doubt. IIRC Holdstock also wrote a lot of the manual for the original Elite as well as TDW. There's a lot of stuff in there that isn't in TDW. Most of it never made it into Elite, FE2 or FFE. Some of it has made it into ED, other bits partly have, and other parts absolutely haven't. It'd be interesting to see how the manual compares to The Alien World.
