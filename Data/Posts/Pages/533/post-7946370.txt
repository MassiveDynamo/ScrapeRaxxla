Ya true i had a similar book growing up "Spacewrecks" there was a kind of genere where they would take a collection of random evocative space themed art and fantasy art and string it together to create a narrative. Its very much about story telling and imagination. But after reading it i think it was a source of ideas for not just raxxla in elite.
