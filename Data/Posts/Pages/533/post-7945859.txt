Every inch of Eafots has been covered by 1000s of CMDRs. There is nothing in the rift that hasn't already been found.....

Well I reached the CoR tourist beacon this morning. Then plotted a short route, 11 jumps directly above the galactic plane. On only my second jump.....39 bodies, 5 discovered, 0 mapped. That includes multiple moons with more biological and geological sites that you can shake a stick at, which no human has ever been near.

Weather I find Raxxla or not, I already feel somewhat vindicated! ;-)
