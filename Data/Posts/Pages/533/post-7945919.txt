I think only two engineers were confirmed by Premonition as having links to the Club: Elvira Martuk and Bill Turner. Still trust Felicity, want Lori’s phone number, Palin definitely untrustworthy.

Only two confirmed, but his comment by Infrastructure made me think the Club was behind the entire concept:
"
‘Of course not,’ Infrastructure gestured expansively. ‘What do you think
all this was about? The clandestine technology acquisition aimed at ensuring
that necessary advances took place according to a certain timetable, fanning
the ﬂames of war between the Federation and the Empire to ensure humanity
has a ﬂeet that has a chance in the coming battle. The encouragement of the
space-faring masses to grow their skills in the Arena and weaponise their ships
courtesy of those oh-so-convenient “Engineers.” We don’t intend to allow
humanity to be cannon fodder in someone else’s war.
