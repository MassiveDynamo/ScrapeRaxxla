Btw, who can say what part of the "continuation will be played out in the game" is/has been actually played ? Mmmh?
(Really interesting to us would be the part which has not already been played..)

I think only two engineers were confirmed by Premonition as having links to the Club: Elvira Martuk and Bill Turner. Still trust Felicity, want Lori’s phone number, Palin definitely untrustworthy.

the other evening was watching a dvd of a 1970s tv series (Lotus Eaters) where a woman went mad, saw tarantulas everywhere, and killed her spouse with a cricket bat to swat the spiders on him. Everyone in Scytale’s family- quickly remove any cricket bats from his vicinity! Perhaps he’s been reading Wind in the Willows late at night after wine & cheese

It might be that Raxxla is indeed within the bubble. There are a couple of locked systems there with no apparent source of the permit; Witches Reach (I think) springs to mind, but there is also an unpopulated system quite close to Shinrarta which I’ve had suspicions over. Since there is no faction there it seems impossible to get the permit, but possibly there is a route via TDW? (Edit: and Raxxla or TDW station might well be hidden in an unpopulated system). Having a permit-locked system would be an easy way for DB to be able to say they knew why nobody had found Raxxla- they know that nobody has the permit. It would be easy programming to monitor personal status and flag up an alarm when somebody gets a specific permit.
In which case in the Codex the DW toast, Omphalos, & Astrophel would all be filler with no substance.... discuss!

P.s. I’m friendly with all engineers (inc Colonia) but the new one, l5 with all but one I think (l3 with one in Colonia), but never received any invite. I think this line of thought is a red herring.
