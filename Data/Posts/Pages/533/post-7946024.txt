I'm jealous of that book you have, simulacrae. It's funny because I remember having that book as a child. My uncle played frontier elite on the commodore 64 and I don't think he had any idea there was a connection
Exactly the same as me. My uncle got me into gaming and Elite from 1984. He also had the book which he eventually gave to me ( probably had no idea it was linked with Elite ) I still have the book which is right on my desk now.
