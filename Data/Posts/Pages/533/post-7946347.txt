Looks decidedly low on the sci and high on the fi.

I don't mean that in any kind of derogatory way just to be clear. Just an observation about the nature of the situation.

The implication is that if there's any connection to the TAW, then it's going to be rooted in a translation from a sci-FI paradigm to a SCI-fi paradigm.

(Hope that the capitalisation makes sense there. )
Ya true i had a similar book growing up "Spacewrecks" there was a kind of genere where they would take a collection of random evocative space themed art and fantasy art and string it together to create a narrative. Its very much about story telling and imagination. But after reading it i think it was a source of ideas for not just raxxla in elite.
