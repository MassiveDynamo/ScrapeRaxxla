So, looking at the map posted by Simulacrae, I've noticed that the the human sector goes up and touches (or in some way you "enter") into the Devil's Shroud (The blue smokey-looking clouds). The Oisir-Raxla sector also looks to reach out to the Devil's Shroud. The Black Holes are also showing to be a way "into" said Shroud.
