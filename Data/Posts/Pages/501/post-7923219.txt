Hi All. I've been off the thread for a while, as I noticed that my new book was available for pre-order on Amazon, so I thought I better stop chasing ghosts for a while, and finish writing it! I don't suppose you have found a certain celestial body (you know the one I mean) whilst I have been away?

Found quite a few certain celestial bodies

But no, not the one you mean
