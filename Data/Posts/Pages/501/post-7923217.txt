At some point in the next couple weeks, I'm going to start an expedition around the outer rim. Im just starting to think about routes, etc. Any thoughts on places I should spend a bit of extra time exploring (following the "obfuscated in the outer rim" clue)? I'm thinking The Void should be in there. Any others? Probably The Abyss, but I suspect that's already pretty well explored?
