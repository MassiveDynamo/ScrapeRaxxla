My humble advice: just don't forget the meaning of obfuscated.
Thanks for the link! Really helpful!

Obfuscated....Interesting you should say that. Before I disappeared, there was a diagram in a post (it MAY have been yours, but I'm not sure). This diagram had a point in the center (Raxxla) with obfuscation around it. This is not my interpretation. I would say that if something is obfuscated, then it "looks like something else" (in this case, it probably looks like "nothing interesting". An ice moon 500kls from entry, or even an asteroid in a random belt, hence there would be no obfuscation "around it", if that makes sense.

On astroids....Have we given this serious consideration, given game mechanics at the point Raxxla was allegedly introduced?
