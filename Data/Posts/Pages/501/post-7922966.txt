I’ll make som pics. Later this week. I don’t have to be in the system, to trigger the effect.

I think the Star of India dot is left an above the star. The one in Deneb is far right and down.

I noticed that you have to move the marker up, to avoid the star covering it. This image can be some quite a bit for details.

Notice that the dot does not look like this all the time. It changes shape and brightness and will vanish from time to time.
