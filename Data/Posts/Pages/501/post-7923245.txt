I'm in NGC 7822 now, there's a lot of stars in a straight line, evidence of real astronomical data, and systems with a lot (8+ in some cases) of stars. To my surprise a service station is out there too, population 2500, but their beef jerky is decent. No Raxxla.
Like... WOW. The Gorgon Research Facility is amazing!! This station wasn't here the last time I was and I have never seen anything like this. Thanks for the heads up Commander. I'm docked there now in open. a few Commanders about.
