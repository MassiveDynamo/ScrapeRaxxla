I'm in NGC 7822 now, there's a lot of stars in a straight line, evidence of real astronomical data, and systems with a lot (8+ in some cases) of stars. To my surprise a service station is out there too, population 2500, but their beef jerky is decent. No Raxxla.
That station is so you can turn in your exp data before you try flying into all the damn black holes out there. There's so many in such a relatively small area. I have my name in a few places out there, look for me. It'd be cool if you seen me
