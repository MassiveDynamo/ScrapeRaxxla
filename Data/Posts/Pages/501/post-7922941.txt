Kinda off topic from current discussion, just wanted to post my findings.

78 Ursae Majoris - Azaleach Raxxla Gate

I seem to remember a cult that was doing something with escape pods, maybe the far God worshippers I think. But you could try collecting a bunch of escape pods and dumping them in 78 or Azaleach.

I wonder how much of whats in galnet news is low key clues.
