I've moved on from 27 Cass, through ( explored ) the nearby nebulae and heading towards NGC 7822 that, like Sam, could be seen on the other side of the 27 Cass BH. It's probably due to coincidence that it could be seen but it's shiny and pretty. Maybe see some other Commanders out there as I am always in open. Now I just need to get this ship off this hi-g world.

I'm in NGC 7822 now, there's a lot of stars in a straight line, evidence of real astronomical data, and systems with a lot (8+ in some cases) of stars. To my surprise a service station is out there too, population 2500, but their beef jerky is decent. No Raxxla.
