So, thought I might take a trip to Vela Dark Region, Puppis Dark Region and Puppis Dark Region B. Not sure if they are technically part of the Great Rift, but they are "behind" Coalsack/Musca and might have been destinations for the Hesperus, or the station of another Galcop listening outpost potentially (although more likely the latter, if it exists, would have been just outside Coalsack Nebula if they followed the model they did with Sarasvatii and had one out that way). There is also Taurus and Aries Dark Regions out near Pleiades and Witch Head, as well as Scutum and Vulpecula Dark Regions out past Polaris. That will likely keep me busy until new content drops.
