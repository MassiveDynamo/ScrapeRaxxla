So this is a bit odd. Just started out towards Vela, about 250LY out hit a proc-gen T-Tauri star, no other bodies but some asteroids, but it has 20 (twenty) Degraded Emissions signal sources. But nothing else. Usually if I hit those in the black in an otherwise empty system there are only 1 or 2. Just RNG madness or worth investigating? They are usually just junk, so I am thinking it is the former.
