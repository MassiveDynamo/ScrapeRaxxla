Sorry a quick question. In the guards you can activate in one since the SRV has a container with 2 seats.
Is it possible to activate the unknown device Thargoid alone (in solo game)?
And what does the Thargoid base look like outside at the time of activation of the device ? And also the planet itself with the base ?
