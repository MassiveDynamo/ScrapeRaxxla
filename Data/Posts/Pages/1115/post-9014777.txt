Hah, @Han_Zen this was amusing, opened up a browser tab just now and typed "Simbad" and google autocorrected it to a "recent" link I used, as usual. But in this case not so recent, and not sure why it's algorithm didn't pick the ones I was using on the weekend as opposed to the one from three or four years ago! http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=BD+66+1673&NbIdent=1&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcmin&submit=submit+id

EB, P... well, this one isn't a pulsar, but still amusing.
Thatâ€™s an old one.

Right on, commander.
