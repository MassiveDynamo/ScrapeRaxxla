Ha! Found it. Simbad designation is Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy. Unfortunately it has no child objects, so the catalog if it exists is not in the database apparently.

Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy

Other identifiers for it also at the bottom. None of them include the ones referenced on the Wikipedia page unfortunately. Clicking on its siblings though will give you a list of every other galaxy in the Local Group I believe, for anyone who then wants to click on their children to generate a list for each, and check each listed identifier of a child against the Galaxy Map to see if any of them are in game... ;-)


[Edit: that said, clicking on display for the CMa references will generate a list of articles, some of which will have a "Simbad objects" link under them for those stellar objects referenced that are in the database, so it may be possible to check some - the first article listed for example has 17 Simbad objects, unfortunately all galaxies or clusters and the like and no stars. ]
