And what does the Thargoid base look like outside at the time of activation of the device ? And also the planet itself with the base ?
I can't answer that question, but I can tell you that nothing happens outside the base when you insert three guardian objects (mine being tablet, urn and casket). I put them in, activated the structure, and whipped outside and back in my ship in under 2 minutes. Then I flew up into the outside center part of the base. I could still hear the device buzzing inside, but no visual effects were present from outside the structure.
