We're here to share an experience. We all have different 'beliefs' on how to progress.
If someone wishes to explore this little adventure in a way that is different from many of us, let's not deny them that privilege.
I see no point in trying to 'convince others that they are wrong, that my belief is better'

We should be including people, not excluding folks.
All of our personal theories are equally crazy, except in the eye of the beholder, me, you, ourselves.

: Yet again, not addressing your Post in particular , I love all your truly crazy stuff that I mostly disagree with - I have my own ideas hehe

Oh I wholeheartedly agree! Providing people treat each other with respect then they have always been welcome here, and we've had some lively, enjoyable and interesting debates. This is spiritually the successor to the old Canonn threads and its pursuit of in-game truth (we do often digress from pursuit of the One True Religion Mystery!), before it became a bit too intense and exclusive. Conversely disrespect earns my ignore list.
Though as a retired scientist I do often feel the need to gently and politely point out when hypotheses and logic are not soundly based! A fundamentally flawed hypothesis is like the screeching of fingernails on a blackboard!

I sometimes try to play Devil's Advocate, though I woul not wish to dissuade anyone from pursuing their own interpretation of things. IMHO we are probably all wrong!
