This IMHO does not fit with a planet randomly appearing during the hyperspace transition. For one thing hyperspace is supposed be another dimension or 3 (4?), so not sure it could be counted as being in the Milky Way. Does seem to be random, which is contradicted by the fifth line. And we have no way to get out of the hyperspace transition sequence so not sure we could be said to find it, it’s just being viewed not found. I think “found” semantically implies it has to be physically present, and this doesn't cut it for me.

So I still think it’s a graphics bug. And if this really is Raxxla I’m rage quitting!
It can be a bug, it can be a feature of something.

(PS Jorki, I'm not addressing you in particular even if I included your reply - rather all of us in general)
We're here to share an experience. We all have different 'beliefs' on how to progress.
If someone wishes to explore this little adventure in a way that is different from many of us, let's not deny them that privilege.
I see no point in trying to 'convince others that they are wrong, that my belief is better'

We should be including people, not excluding folks.
All of our personal theories are equally crazy, except in the eye of the beholder, me, you, ourselves.

NOTE: Yet again, not addressing your Post in particular Jorki, I love all your truly crazy stuff that I mostly disagree with - I have my own ideas hehe
