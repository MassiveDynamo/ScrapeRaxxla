Bah, just tried to comment in the update thread re the server status message; it's now locked so thought the game must be back up...
NOPE!
I really wish FD would learn to change the server status to OFFLINE during updates. I've complained about this many times, and @sallymorganmoore said after the last major update she'd investigate. It cant be a big job to change a message text.
FD have just wasted another hour of my life...
@sallymorganmoore , at 70 I haven't got all that many left!!!!
