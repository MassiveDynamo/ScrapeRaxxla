P.S. I wasnt digging at you re Canonn! I just preferred the modus operandi sharing information etc via the forum threads before they moved off to their own site - that seemed more efficient but less inclusive and enjoyable to me.
Technically I'm probably still a member...never resigned nor had a message that I've been disavowed!
Likewise - I do things in the open. I don't use any of the 'hidden channels' of any discords. No offense taken, I love your writeups. I wish I had the same skills
Cannon, AXI, whoever we are - in this thread we share the same passion.
