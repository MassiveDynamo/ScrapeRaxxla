It can be a bug, it can be a feature of something.

(PS Jorki, I'm not addressing you in particular even if I included your reply - rather all of us in general)
We're here to share an experience. We all have different 'beliefs' on how to progress.
If someone wishes to explore this little adventure in a way that is different from many of us, let's not deny them that privilege.
I see no point in trying to 'convince others that they are wrong, that my belief is better'

We should be including people, not excluding folks.
All of our personal theories are equally crazy, except in the eye of the beholder, me, you, ourselves.

: Yet again, not addressing your Post in particular , I love all your truly crazy stuff that I mostly disagree with - I have my own ideas hehe
