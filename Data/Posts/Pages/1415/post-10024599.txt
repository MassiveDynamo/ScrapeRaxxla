I have done countless honks and only recently noticed this planet screen flash / phenomenon / glitch / cosmic rays messing with the memory circuits / bug / thing. It has to have been one of the coolest things I have experienced in Elite for a while. It happened when leaving orbital cruise of a planet, locking on to the next port of call, yeeting out of the system - HO(image of Raxxla?)NK!

It took a minute or 2 later for me to recall what I thought I had seen and it was actually a pretty deep experience in that moment, something that usually requires a more potent meduim than a computer space game to bring about! Very cool!

Carry on CMDRs !
