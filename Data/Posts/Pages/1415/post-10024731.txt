From my previous summary
All we know about Raxxla (everything else is supposition!):

(MB) “It’s in the Milky Way” and “you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious so people know what they’re doing”
Q: founder's world name?...Shinrarta Dezhra... I'm a tiny little bit disappointed they didn't call it Raxxla - A: (MB) “Raxxla is something different”
(MB) “FD did look at a story involving Raxxla, but felt that was a story that should be played out in game rather than as a novel”
(MB) “It’s something in the game world (not text) and very hard to find”
(MB) “It’s not a random thing”
(MB) “Anyone can find it, and more than once”
(Allen Stroud) “it is a topic within the Alien lore book” that we have no insight into
(DB) “You don’t know what it is”

This IMHO does not fit with a planet randomly appearing during the hyperspace transition. For one thing hyperspace is supposed be another dimension or 3 (4?), so not sure it could be counted as being in the Milky Way. Does seem to be random, which is contradicted by the fifth line. And we have no way to get out of the hyperspace transition sequence so not sure we could be said to find it, it’s just being viewed not found. I think “found” semantically implies it has to be physically present, and this doesn't cut it for me.

So I still think it’s a graphics bug. And if this really is Raxxla I’m rage quitting!
