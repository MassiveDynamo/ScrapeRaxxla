yup.
PS it's a client-update, so you have to quit & update (in case anyone is sitting ingame waiting in suspense ... ).
P.S. I wasnt digging at you re Canonn! I just preferred the modus operandi sharing information etc via the forum threads before they moved off to their own site - that seemed more efficient but less inclusive and enjoyable to me.
Technically I'm probably still a member...never resigned nor had a message that I've been disavowed!
