maybe you don't jump there, you SC there, and instead of nothing like you normally find, you get a single planet hovering in the darkness.

The game-engine uses the jump to load the next system in question. Been tried with many other systems, you can SC to them because the load sequence of system-entities is never triggered.
Arguably if you can SC there, then it's part of the last system you jumped to.
