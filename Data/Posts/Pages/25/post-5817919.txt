Regarding the idea that finding Raxxla might require a literary approach through the reading of Robert Holdstock's novels and other works of fiction:

I've just ordered a copy of Holdstock's Where Time Winds Blow. The book was published in 1981 so its older then The Dark Wheel by a few years but is fairly contemporaneous with Alien World which contains references to both Raxxla and The Dark Wheel (though in apparently different contexts from their usage in Elite canon).

Where Time Winds Blow was published about half a year earlier then Alien World so it will be interesting to see if there are any crossovers between the two works.

Here's the dust jacket synopsis for Time Winds:


Out of rep for you I'm afraid, so have some virtual +rep.
