Well ... my copy of Holdstock's Where Time Winds Blow arrived. My alt account reached Elite in exploration this morning and arrived at Shinrarta Dhezrha... in the original starter Sidewinder. That account was in 100% Open Play and never earned a single credit from anything but exploration and never flew in anything but the orgjnal Sidewinder that it started with.

Think I'm going to start tracking the destinations of DW ships leaving the system like MacrosTheBlack is doing ... though I might try chasing them down to see where they are ultimately destined.

Just goes to prove- you do have to be mad to be a Rifter!
(or, for that matter, a RaXXler! )
