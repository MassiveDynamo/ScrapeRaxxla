Regarding the idea that finding Raxxla might require a literary approach through the reading of Robert Holdstock's novels and other works of fiction:

I've just ordered a copy of Holdstock's Where Time Winds Blow. The book was published in 1981 so its older then The Dark Wheel by a few years but is fairly contemporaneous with Alien World which contains references to both Raxxla and The Dark Wheel (though in apparently different contexts from their usage in Elite canon).

Where Time Winds Blow was published about half a year earlier then Alien World so it will be interesting to see if there are any crossovers between the two works.

Here's the dust jacket synopsis for Time Winds:

The Time Phantom was an ancient, shriveled figure; it was difficult to make out detail in the fading light, but he seemed to be staring straight at Faulcon as the viewscope peered down upon him, staring from shrunken eyes hidden in massive wrinkles of flesh and twisted facial muscle. Kris Dojaan is sure that the Time Phantom is Mark, his brother, lost on Kamelios a year before, though stolen is a better word to describe the disappearance of the rifters, those workers who comb the valleys for artifacts of past and future civilizations.
