Just discovered this mystery for the first time, and I've read much (not 100%) of this thread, so forgive me if I'm behind, but I just saw this on reddit:

My dad got allied with the children of raxxla and they gave him a passenger mission to a system just between the heart and soul in eafots. The passenger said it was the raxxla staging point he was taking him too.

Is this a known thing to you Raxxlers and maybe a useful clue?
