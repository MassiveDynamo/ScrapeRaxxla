I think the idea of having to supercruise to a rogue planet to find Raxxla may have merit, seeing as that's how FDev have hidden other things in game already (Thargoid attack sites, generation ships, mega-ships, etc).

The only thing we need is a system/body as a start point, and a direction. If anyone has any idea's based on clues from the lore, it's at least a testable theory in-game. Worth a try!
