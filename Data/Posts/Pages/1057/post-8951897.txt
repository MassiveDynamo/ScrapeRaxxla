there are two options:
1. they lie to us about the status of the elite.
2. Elite status is needed as it is connected with the pilots 'federation, that is, the pilots' federation has imposed a ban on the system and you can get there only with the elite status.

See i dont think the whole Elite thing was a lie, only times I seem them state this was in reference to triple Elite... Not just being Elite in one rank, so may need to be Elite in only one Elite rank to be deemed "worthy" however the issue as always is the issue is vagueness, if Raxxla definitely is able to be located why don't they just say a definite, no clues, no hints but a definite yes it's locate able would suffice which is strange that they won't do this, or maybe they don't do this as it was proposed to be placed, things changed and they never managed to make it work but instead of outright saying no (as they have already added the mass hype) they now just add it vaguely until they can get it to work while having that "Well we never outright said yes you can locate it"
