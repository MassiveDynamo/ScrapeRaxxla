Quick one, from a reddit thread months ago, can anyone confirm a source on this? did FD say that?

I researched this claim in much detail, talking to everyone I could think of who might have been a witness, hoping to establish its veracity. I was not able to confirm it, nor the identity of who was supposed to have said it. It resurfaces every few months.

The story comes from LaveCon in either 2015 or 2016 and was alleged to have occurred in a "corridor" conversation between some fans and an unidentified Fdev employee.

It may have been said, but no one (to my knowledge) has been able to corroborate it.

Cheers,

Drew.
