I think people done the search of dezhra for a voyager type thing before.... Not sure how that went however voyager was located using real life distancing etc which is how they where found.... Not sure how any would be found in dezhra with nothing to go by if only by mistake :-(
The signal source is only an example of how FD could do it. We don't even know if there is an elite requirement. If there is, that is one way to get around it.

We just have to keep an open mind. If you find a clue that you are think point to a specific star, it could be that it's a lodestar. Something we need to fly towards from Shinrarta Dezhra.
If we believe there is an elite requirement, Shinrarta Dezhra has a very high probability of being somehow involved. Either via the Dark Wheel or on it's own.
