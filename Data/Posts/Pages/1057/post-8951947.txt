again, if you need an elite status, at least one of the three, then our quest is connected with the federation of pilots, and this is a clue. just logically, how can you identify the elite or not, and you knew about it long before the titles were introduced

Not necessarily with the Pilots Federation, although maybe yes however the Dark Wheel contact those who have gained Elite rank in lore which could also mean those, so much has been changed and retconned however that who knows what we need, who we need to go to etc etc etc that's a good amount of the issues unfortunately, even with the lore intact it was near impossible to find now we have lore changes and recons with no confirmations as to what or which was actually removed or changed, for all we know now its actually the club that has access to raxxla, or cain or core dynamics...there is so many people, factions etc within Elite now who knows what or who we have to deal with... Or even what for that matter as it may be linked with the thargoids, guardians or something else we havnt found or encountered yet
