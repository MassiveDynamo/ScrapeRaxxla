then I suspect Raxxla is hidden in plain sight and needs to be actively searched for; it will only be found if you’re very close. Though why the requirement for Elite I don’t know, unless it’s to be consistent with the lore from the original Holdstock novella.
there are two options:
1. they lie to us about the status of the elite.
2. Elite status is needed as it is connected with the pilots 'federation, that is, the pilots' federation has imposed a ban on the system and you can get there only with the elite status.
