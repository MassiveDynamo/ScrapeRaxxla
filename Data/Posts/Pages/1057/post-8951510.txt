Quick one, from a reddit thread months ago, can anyone confirm a source on this? did FD say that?
That rumour has been circulating for years. No one has been able to confirm or come up with a source, so I doubt FD ever said that.

Personally I still think the content of the rumour is true. Raxxla is most likely in a system that has been fully scanned and mapped.
Finding something orbiting or even worse, just slowly drifting trough a system is really hard if it does not scan. Just finding the old Voyagers in Sol, was a challenge. We knew they were in Sol and they turned out to be exactly where they should, according to RL data. Still it was difficult enough.

For Raxxla we don't know any of the things we knew for the Voyagers. We just have some hints that we don't know how to read. We don't even know if they are hints.
