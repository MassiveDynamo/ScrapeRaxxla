there are two options:
1. they lie to us about the status of the elite.
2. Elite status is needed as it is connected with the pilots 'federation, that is, the pilots' federation has imposed a ban on the system and you can get there only with the elite status.
FD has never officially claimed that you have to be Elite, to find Raxxla. It's all derived from The Dark Wheel quote, where Rafe Zetter says: " You've got to become Elite, Alex".

If FD has decided to go with the old TDW route, it is fairly likely that they requires Elite status and that it's practically impossible to find Raxxla without them.
Another option is that there s something hidden in the Shinrarta Dezhra system. That system is the only natural gate that opens with Elite status, in the game.

It's easy for FD to put a signal source somewhere in Shin Dez, with some message or code that is needed for the next step. If they put it an ly out, no one is going to find that if they haven't figured out an exact direction. That way you have the elite requirement and you can put the actual Raxxla wherever you want.
