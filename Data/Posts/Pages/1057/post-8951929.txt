See i dont think the whole Elite thing was a lie, only times I seem them state this was in reference to triple Elite... Not just being Elite in one rank, so may need to be Elite in only one Elite rank to be deemed "worthy" however the issue as always is the issue is vagueness, if Raxxla definitely is able to be located why don't they just say a definite, no clues, no hints but a definite yes it's locate able would suffice which is strange that they won't do this, or maybe they don't do this as it was proposed to be placed, things changed and they never managed to make it work but instead of outright saying no (as they have already added the mass hype) they now just add it vaguely until they can get it to work while having that "Well we never outright said yes you can locate it"
again, if you need an elite status, at least one of the three, then our quest is connected with the federation of pilots, and this is a clue. just logically, how can you identify the elite or not, and you knew about it long before the titles were introduced
