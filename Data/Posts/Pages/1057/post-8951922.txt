FD has never officially claimed that you have to be Elite, to find Raxxla. It's all derived from The Dark Wheel quote, where Rafe Zetter says: " You've got to become Elite, Alex".

If FD has decided to go with the old TDW route, it is fairly likely that they requires Elite status and that it's practically impossible to find Raxxla without them.
Another option is that there s something hidden in the Shinrarta Dezhra system. That system is the only natural gate that opens with Elite status, in the game.

It's easy for FD to put a signal source somewhere in Shin Dez, with some message or code that is needed for the next step. If they put it an ly out, no one is going to find that if they haven't figured out an exact direction. That way you have the elite requirement and you can put the actual Raxxla wherever you want.

I think people done the search of dezhra for a voyager type thing before.... Not sure how that went however voyager was located using real life distancing etc which is how they where found.... Not sure how any would be found in dezhra with nothing to go by if only by mistake :-(
