The mention of the Formidine rift is just John Harpers nod to Drew Wagar. The quote is just an admiral bragging about his accomplishments. He is just listing stuff. The Thargoid stuff has nothing to do with the Rift voyage.
John Harper has no clue about Raxxla. It was completely off limits to the authors, at the time they wrote the books. It still is.

I would generally agree with this. The Formidine Rift was written by me alone (with in-game help from some long departed devs at Frontier) as a Raxxla-esque mystery. It wasn't specifically supposed to have anything to do with Raxxla (though obviously that doesn't prevent Fdev from conflating them in some way). Other authors were aware of each others work prior to publication, so you will find references to the Formidine Rift in John Harper's and (I think) Allen Stroud's book.

Cheers,

Drew.
