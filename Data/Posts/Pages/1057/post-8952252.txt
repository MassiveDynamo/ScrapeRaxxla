there are two options:
1. they lie to us about the status of the elite.
2. Elite status is needed as it is connected with the pilots 'federation, that is, the pilots' federation has imposed a ban on the system and you can get there only with the elite status.

Could also be a false memory/confusion of two different memories/ false rumour.
Might also be if/when you find it then you have a fight on your hands versus some/many elites
