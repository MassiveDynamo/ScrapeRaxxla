The biggest issue here is that FD have given us NOTHING.

Its like going into the middle of the ocean and not knowing if youre looking for an island, a shipwreck, a fossil, a whale or a piece of coral.

Its kinda stupid tbh that they've not even given the most vague of clues. For all we know its been passed by thousands of times. For all we know, they could just be trolling us and there's nothing there.

I mean, how long was Zurara floating out there? 5 years? And still nobody found it until they basically told everyone where it was. Who knows if there are even other project dynasty ships?

For what its worth, I dont think its anywhere near sol.

From the wiki about Dynasty, John Harper, author of And Here The Wheel, wrote in a Kickstarter comment:



For me, it's either in the Formidine, or more likely one of the sectors near to Formidine.

The mention of the Formidine rift is just John Harpers nod to Drew Wagar. The quote is just an admiral bragging about his accomplishments. He is just listing stuff. The Thargoid stuff has nothing to do with the Rift voyage.
John Harper has no clue about Raxxla. It was completely off limits to the authors, at the time they wrote the books. It still is.
