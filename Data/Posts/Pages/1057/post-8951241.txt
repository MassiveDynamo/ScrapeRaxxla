Quick one, from a reddit thread months ago, can anyone confirm a source on this? did FD say that?
Hi @Sekrit Dokuments,

Pretty sure this has been raised multiple times in the past without corroborating evidence ever being supplied. It's one of those 'myths' that keeps being raised.

Lots of people have claimed that someone flew through the system honked it and continued... but not official FDev statement confirming that has been documented that I'm aware of.

What we do know / have confirmed is in the OP by Macros who updates it whenever we dredge up something with official backing. Like videos, posts et al.

Misinformation/False Rumours
These are unconfirmed statements, we will assume they are false until we get sources for them.
X Someone honked the system but didn't scan it. This rumor states a source as Elitecon (oldest citation) and a Dj Truthsayer video (with no link provided)

Fly Dangerously,
/ Ra.
