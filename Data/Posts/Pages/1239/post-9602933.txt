And for now so is Raxxla both for us and by in game Lore Raxxla is the space equivalent....The point being the only clues we have are in the Codex and these 3 places are mentioned
Thats right, and all of the codex is written so as to be deniable. Everywhere its Statement x, followed by statement ~x. Some say its a place - others compare it to know myths that never existed. And so on.

Does the codex give any clues? If we read at face value, no. The opening is the toast of some hopefuls who never found it. It could just describe what they think it might be and why they are looking for it etc. Then the rest is just full of maybe and speculation.

Are there hidden clues and hints? If there are then they have utterly failed to find their mark. No further progress has been made since the codex was issued.

So if we assume that the codex is actually empty and not helpful then what? We need to go back to the story as it was at the beginning, and find what was apparent then.

This all assumes there is something to be found, but if you're in this thread then I assume you're on the hunt, like myself, though I must say my patience is wearing thin.
