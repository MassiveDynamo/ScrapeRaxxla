Agreed and i'm sure about 2 things:
either Raxxla is in an asteroid belt (how many people really visited them?, Now with the Great Raxxla Potato Hunt, nothing can go through radars but there are a lot of systems to scan).
Raxxla is not implemented in game. I mean either fdev lied to us or we need to first contact TDW and the missions are broken => so Raxxla is unaccessible.

We just need to wait players to fully scan all the asteroid belts.

While i'm writing this i just remember: the pulse wave analizer was at original state used for scan asteroids AND anomalies. But the release of the PWA were at same time as the Codex?

Asteroid belts would make ideal hiding candidates as us explorers get 0 credits for scanning them. So, there is literally no incentive to do so. I do it more so for completionist/accurate mining info on the public databases. The same can be said for rings.
