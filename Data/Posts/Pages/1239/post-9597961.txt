Hyperspace was available long before 2800. It was used on probes as early as the 2130s.
Achenar was colonized at about the time of the 2296 log of Raxxla, so the radius of operation was far outside Sol's closest neighbors.
That's still a hell of lot of systems. Really hoping the gazettes from First Encounters ultimately yield some clues. Specifically, that 70,000 figure for generation ships isn't something FDev pulled from thin air. All the systems in the First Encounters gazette where Bubbles (aka generation ships) were built are in the game under the identical name. I have a list of four systems I need to go visit that will hopefully either approximate direction these launched in, target systems, or similar types of info. Project Dynasty wasn't the only one interested in long duration voyages to the fringes of civilized space (though I'd argue most of the ones that are known fit the profile of the crew being sacrificed to keep the project under wraps). Even knowing the approximate zones the generation ships were sent would be huge boon for the Raxxla hunt as we might be able to at least make some sort of educated guess about where the discovery happened. I still think the pirate cache mention on the Tornvquist journal will be important as well as the journal being from Tau Ceti itself.

NOTE: Whatever the Mars Artifact was, clearly left an impression on whomever found it. It the discovery of Raxxla happened in the generation ship era, someone was deeply scared of what they found. One other thing, let's hypothetically say Marlin Duval was somehow privy to what the Mars Artifact was, that means INRA or its pre-cursor organization(s) came from this same era, too.
