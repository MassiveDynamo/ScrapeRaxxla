Missing Body IDs are probably comets.

List of bodies in Tau Ceti:
BodyID Body Ring ParentID
BodyID:0 Tau Ceti Tau Ceti A Belt
BodyID:1 Ring: 1
0
BodyID:2 Tau Ceti A Belt Cluster 1
1
BodyID:3 Tau Ceti A Belt Cluster 2
1
BodyID:4 Tau Ceti A Belt Cluster 3
1
BodyID:5 Tau Ceti A Belt Cluster 4
1
BodyID:6 Saunders's Claim
0
BodyID:7 Taylor Colony
0
BodyID:8 Bell's Wreck
0
BodyID:9 Tau Ceti 4
0
BodyID:10 Tau Ceti 5
0
BodyID:11
BodyID:12
BodyID":13 Tau Ceti 6
0

As you can see, there are two empty IDs in the list. These are located between Tau Ceti 5 and 6. In the game, there is nothing there.

It used to be though:

SPOILER: OLD SYSTEM


Avagadro's Enterprise used to orbit an invisible comet, between TauCeti 5 and 6. The station now orbit a planet, but the comet is probably stil there. It also seem to have a twin.
