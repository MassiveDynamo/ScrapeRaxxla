I havnt seen much of the reading into of the below places being sprung to action, they are also mentioned in the codex and there locations/hypothosis/storys may help in our search, there is one key thing about them all, each one was tied in around Ethiopia during a very close stage in the Seventeenth century, Astrophel and spiraling stars are somewhat referred to as the Seven stars of the Pleiades and may hint at the "Seventeenth century link and may also include other refences such as the Seven cities of gold in El Dorado and the Seven towers of Atlantis etc etc.

Also another place also with links to the above, there also is a system named the same and it references Delphi etc and not to far from Achenar https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperborea
