Based on the 2296 start of the rumor, based on the Tau Ceti tourist beacon discovery happened sometime between 2159 (Tau Ceti self-sufficiency) and 2296. Now this was the slow expansion period (generation ships and the beginning of megaships from large corporations and governments with the very first "slow hyperspace" drives (hours to weeks between systems). So, it is near Sol and there are few options that allow for much else. Even hyperspace probes would get so far they couldn't retransmit in time for the rumor to get going by 2296 unless you invoke faster than light communications. We didn't Faraway until 2800 (which is centuries after Raxxla myth goes mainstream).

Hyperspace was available long before 2800. It was used on probes as early as the 2130s.
Achenar was colonized at about the time of the 2296 log of Raxxla, so the radius of operation was far outside Sol's closest neighbors.
