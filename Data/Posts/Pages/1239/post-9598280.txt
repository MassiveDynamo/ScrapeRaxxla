The mention of a pirates stash, always intrigued meâ€¦

If we take the Codex as accurate and literal, then it gives us a search radius, if we continue to trust the Codex surely anarchy systems within or in close proximity to this area should be given priority over others, due to their natural attraction for pirates?
