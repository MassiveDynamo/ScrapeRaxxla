I've been following up on the Astrophel and Stella angle mentioned in the Raxxla codex entry, and I'm currently investigating this verse:

.
My mouth doth water, and my breast doth swell,My tongue doth itch, my thoughts in labor be:Listen then, lordings, with good ear to me,For of my life I must a riddle tell.

Toward Aurora's court a nymph doth dwell,Rich in all beauties which man's eye can see:Beauties so far from reach of words, that weAbase her praise, saying she doth excel:

Rich in the treasure of deserv'd renown,Rich in the riches of a royal heart,Rich in those gifts which give th'eternal crown;

Who though most rich in these and every part,Which make the patents of true worldly bliss,Hath no misfortune, but that Rich she is.

It might be serious tinfoilery, but I'm currently investigating Eos. Why? Well, Aurora is Eos by a different name, and while, by "Aurora's abode" the author of the poem clearly just means "east", methinks it's worth a shot. The whole verse is interesting in the context of raxxla - you've got a mention of a riddle, nymphs (siren in the void or something to that effect, from the Raxxla toast), rich treasure, etc.

Here's where it gets interesting, yet - most likely - inconsequential. Eos has a gas giant with eight moons, and an orbital installation orbiting the eighth moon of said planet.

I'm operating on many assumptions here, chief amongst them: that the TDW is important to finding Raxxla, and that the codex entries on the TDW and Raxxla might be a little misleading, which might mean that the whole "eighth moon" thing might lead to a clue to the location of TDW, not TDW itself.

Haven't done much of anything with the installation just yet, and won't for a few hours, but if I find anything - I'll report back.

Also, the "east" angle might be worth looking into, although I have no idea what that might mean yet. East of what? Sol? Lave?
