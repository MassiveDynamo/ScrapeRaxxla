I was asked 2 interesting questions about OLT3 in a PM, which I' replied to. Thought I'd also share my answer here.

Question: Must you get Allied with all factions on the benevolent list?
These are my assumptions/modus operandi: TDW gives missions to other factions which may or may not be secret local TDW brands. Getting Allied with these faction will, in theory, trigger the invite to the TDW dark station.

The good news is that I don't have far to go to be Allied with all on the 'good' list, the bad news is that I don't think TDW is done giving missions for other factions that must be added to the list.
