Hey so I'm trying to attack the DW toast from a different, more literal(?), angle. "To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies" - what 'jewel' 'burns'? Sapphire (fire). When i looked up sapphire on the galaxy map - it brought me to the Prism system, a system already deep in ED lore with Salome..

Not sure if this will actually take me anywhere, but hey, its worth a shot
