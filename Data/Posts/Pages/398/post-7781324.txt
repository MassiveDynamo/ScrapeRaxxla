Hey everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster.

As I was reading the codex entry for Universal Cartographics last night, I happened to notice that the text has changed somewhat. Notably, "Omphalos Infotech" has been changed to "Unified Infotech". Has anyone else noticed this? Probably nothing, but then again...
Good find.
