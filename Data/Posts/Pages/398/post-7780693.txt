I was asked 2 interesting questions about OLT3 in a PM, which I' replied to. Thought I'd also share my answer here.

Question: Must you get Allied with all factions on the benevolent list?
These are my assumptions/modus operandi: TDW gives missions to other factions which may or may not be secret local TDW brands. Getting Allied with these faction will, in theory, trigger the invite to the TDW dark station.

The good news is that I don't have far to go to be Allied with all on the 'good' list, the bad news is that I don't think TDW is done giving missions for other factions that must be added to the list.

Question: Are you looking for those specific missions in the not-so-benevolent list?
Whenever I go to Shinrarta Dezhra or LFT 926, I check the TDW missions and add benevolent & non-benevolent missions to the two lists. For now, I'm just doing the ranking for the factions that's in the benevolent list. If that doesn't provide any results, I'll consider getting hostile with the factions on the non-benevolent list and see if that changes anything.

Still a hail mary, tho
