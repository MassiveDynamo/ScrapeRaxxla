Hey everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster.

As I was reading the codex entry for Universal Cartographics last night, I happened to notice that the text has changed somewhat. Notably, "Omphalos Infotech" has been changed to "Unified Infotech". Has anyone else noticed this? Probably nothing, but then again...

"shocking -up - the mice were furious"

I'd noticed that just after the update - couldn't find any other alterations. If it was an error it, its a pretty shocking one, and I hope they've been more careful with the rest of it...
