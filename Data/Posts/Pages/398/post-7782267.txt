Ok so just a slight twist on the jewel on the brow bit...

I spent the evening in Alpheratz also known as Alpha Andromedae

Its the brightest star in Andromedae constellation.... Jewel?

Its arabic name surrat al-faras... Is the navel of the mare (omphalos)

Another name for it is "the head of the woman in chains"... Brow?

As to the mother of galaxies... Well the andromeda galaxy got its name from the constellation...

Anyway i spent an evening there popping in and out of USSs... Nothing to report
