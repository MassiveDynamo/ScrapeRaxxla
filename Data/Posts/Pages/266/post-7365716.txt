Guru's screenshot shows some interesting relations to the Eleusinian Mysteries, which is based on the myth of Persephone (Demeter's daughter) being kidnapped by Hades. For one the NPC's ship is called "Vicious Hades". Also the system he is in is right next to the "Demeter" system.

The last part of the Eleusinian Mysteries included a "reenactment" of the Demeter-myth. Could this screenshot depict that?

Maybe players must somehow complete the rituals in Elite. But where to start? The linked document states, that the first step is the "Gathering" at the Athenian Agora or marketplace, in front of the Stoa Poikile. There is a system called "Athena". Also there are the systems Demeter, Persephone and Eleu (=Eleusis?), which might also be relevant.

Another interesting detail of the screenshot: Guru's hull is at 12%. One of the requirements of participating in the Eleusinian Mysteries is to fast. Could a low hull be the Elite-variant of this requirement?

And the whole process reduced him to tears for most of the day, are you sure he didn't just discover "engineers"?
