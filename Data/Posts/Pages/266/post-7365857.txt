According to the linked document, there are also things to do before starting the ritual in Athen, which is: "the priestesses of Demeter and Persephone took the basket of Sacred Objects (Hiera) of the Goddess from her temple in Eleusis to Athens"

There is a Demeter Class Agricultural Megaship in Eleu. Could that be said "temple"? You can break the cargo-hatch and get some stolen goods from it. Next would be to take it to Athens (=Athena?). But where and what to do with it?

There are just so many vague connections between the game and greek myths, and also so many possible red herrings. It's hard to decide which trail to follow, and to be honest, without any kind of reassurance, that there actually is indeed a trail and a goal at the end of it, it's hard to stay motivated.
