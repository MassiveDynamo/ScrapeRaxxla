...but my gut feeling is that he's telling the truth.

Also mine but, anyway truth or hoax, as he isn't going to tell anything...so it actually doesn't matter.
A few Cmdrs already claimed finding Raxxla, and they disappeared. Into an other galaxy ? Would be so cool ! Another ED in another unknown galaxy ! With its own secret community, forums, etc ... !!
If it's true, let him enjoy the Portal. If not, let him enjoy not posting here anymore, as he himself wrote.
An other remote possibility would be... space madness. Poor boy, if so.
