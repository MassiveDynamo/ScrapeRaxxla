So, is there already any consensus about whether Raxxla was found or not?

CMDR Gurus posts sounds very mysterious and not clear at all for me, but my gut feeling is that he's telling the truth.

I think it would have carried more weight had he not claimed to have been reduced to tears for most of Sunday. I mean when was the last time a game brought you to tears?

So for that reason, I'm out.
