Aren’t we inside the pendant world? Shouldn’t we be looking for a way out, not in?

Seems more likely we are looking to release the devil from his cage… and i get the idea there is a possibility of either finding the sparkly creatures that saved the president or the Far God (or both?). I imagine the Far God is not the benign friendly type. And i have reservations about the sparkly ones too…
