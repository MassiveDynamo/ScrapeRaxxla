Polaris would of course fit most hints in the codex. It is the pole star. It burns on top of the galaxy. The other stars spiral around it. It is the Omphalos point. It is even surrounded by a dragon.
Polaris 4b is an unremarkable moon and a definite place. The transporter is an alien construct and Polaris is guarded by powerful, twisted men (INRA in FFE).

If the mystery is constructed this way, the permit is the challenge. Or even a module or nav-computer hack that allows us to ignore permits. This would make it easy for FD to implement the Elite rank requirement and they could effectively limit the number of commanders that gets access at all. Help from the Dark Wheel may be an absolute necessity, to access Polaris.

All this would be convenient, easy to implement and give FD full control.

What do you think? FD usually keeps things quite simple, when it comes to mysteries. We aren't as good at that.

Ya you are right- polaris has always been an obvious place to look. The fact that it has been locked up with a seemingly unatainable permit…. It will either be story driven and only unlocked when FD decides to -or there might be a way to get the permit … but i havent found it..

Spitballing…
The way most permits seem to work is u need to align with the controlling faction - usually in nearby star systems outside the permitted system. But we dont really know who the controlling faction is… and with all the player made factions taking over the bubble - the old faction might have been relegated to obscurity…

Im still working off the assumption that Sirius has something to do with it - will try making friends with all the Sirius factions…. While i continue to bounce around Lucifer looking for dark stations
