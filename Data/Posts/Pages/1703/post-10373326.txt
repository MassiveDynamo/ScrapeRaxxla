Something Raxxla WAS in the original(s) code at the beginning. Not working as a feature (I made Elite rank in 1985 on C64, knew it inside out, no Raxxla whatsoever ingame) but it was written in .
Ian Bell confirmed it was there (written in a code), and removed for the later editions.

So I'd gladly hex the crap out of the original, if only someone can unpack it.
A single line "Raxxla xyz" would make a breakthrough.
This has been done for all the older games. Elite, FE2 and FFE have all been reverse engineeed or had the code released.
No Raxxla in any of them.
The name generator from Elite, canâ€™t even make the word Raxxla.
