Petunias? I think mine are dead!

I've been suspicious of WHAT Raxxla is ever since Ram Tah disclosed his decodes of the Guardian texts and mentioned their ark ships. In conjunction with the old lore (can't remember that lore source) that Thargoids had planet/moon-sized ships I think that's a strong hint as to what Raxxla might be. Hadn't thought about trying to get into a hollow planet...good thinking there!

Mmm, hadn't realised that 6 of the middle garden lights match the positioning of the 6 trees, well spotted...another aspect of the garden design decided! 6 moons orbiting a ringed planet?

Going to go back to try something!! But would the entrance be at one of the poles? And what is the entry mechanism-would it mean the normal dropout distance when approaching a planet would be removed? And would this hypothesis mean that Legacy users would not be able to find Raxxla?
