I like @Rochester's idea of a hollow "planet", which would fit the Paradise Lost theme perfectly. Given MB's penchant for PL, and the effort he expended putting that theme into ED, and that the Brookes Tour ends with the "pendent world" quotation, I'm leaning towards that possibility. It could perhaps be a reskinned Coriolis, which could fit the game mechanics and explain the logo. I'm assuming the entrance port would be fairly small and somehow hidden-maybe at the bottom of a ravine?
I've long since said and believed, Raxxla is a " Rogue planet", potentially hollow or a "large" asteroid station, and that it could be moving, like the Thargoid Titans, between set systems, there by making it a path/trail that must be traveled to find it...

it's always made sense (if you believe some of the non-/cannon stories influenced its design) and makes more and more sense as time goes on...

IMHO, we need to find the path/set of planets/stars it travels too/around.
