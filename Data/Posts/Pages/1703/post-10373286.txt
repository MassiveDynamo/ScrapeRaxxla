In concern with talk of ‘data-mining’ yes that’s a total no-no and FD will take action.

Not wishing to actually dive into this area, but others have seen a plethora of ‘oddities’ within the code, not including code for unused content, some of this was named appropriately, other stuff used aliases.

It’s very likely that such code does exist but, its structure etc is held on the server, not the PC, so one might not be able to reconstruct it; all you would have - theoretically - would be a placeholder name, such as ‘insert Petunias here’.
