Technically I don’t believe objects can physically travel between systems, as we exist in game in instances, surely there is no actual interstellar space aspect in game, otherwise FD should have utilised it?

If it moves FD just increased the complexity of the puzzle unnecessarily, to do so, one would need include additional temporal clues to advertise this, I can’t see that currently within the Codex, although granted somewhere else, but any clues to date are I believe intentional vague.

I think rogue planets exist in game, but that these are either represented either as Brown Dwarfs or ‘captured bodies’, at most they might be a redundant element of FDs more complex and initial designs, which although promoted heavily, never actually made the cut.

Note M Brooke’s identified the existence of dark systems in his book Legacy, even named one. These were originally, as per DB promotions, to be how some mysteries were to be seeded and may have identified rogues?

That said, I am siding on it being a fixed traditional body, certainly something big and probably repurposed, for it to move essentially is, in my opinion counterintuitive to the description of a ‘pendant globe’ eg of it being ‘fixed’ in place?
