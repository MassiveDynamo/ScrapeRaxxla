I like @Rochester's idea of a hollow "planet", which would fit the Paradise Lost theme perfectly. Given MB's penchant for PL, and the effort he expended putting that theme into ED, and that the Brookes Tour ends with the "pendent world" quotation, I'm leaning towards that possibility. It could perhaps be a reskinned Coriolis, which could fit the game mechanics and explain the logo. I'm assuming the entrance port would be fairly small and somehow hidden-maybe at the bottom of a ravine?
Aren’t we inside the pendant world? Shouldn’t we be looking for a way out, not in?
