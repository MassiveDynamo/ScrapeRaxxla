Seems more likely we are looking to release the devil from his cage… and i get the idea there is a possibility of either finding the sparkly creatures that saved the president or the Far God (or both?). I imagine the Far God is not the benign friendly type. And i have reservations about the sparkly ones too…
This is also a possibility, nobody ever said Raxxla would be beneficial to our health!
I think the Far God was supposed to be the Thargoids Titans. Ive always suspected Halsey's "tiny yet gargantuan...real caretakers of our galaxy" are the fireflies that exist around Thargoids Sensors and Barnacles...possibly (given MB's interest in this and his Sun Dragon novel) Guardians evolved into a plasma lifeform. Or it might be another lifeform entirely- we know of Intelligent AI (though from the Zurara expedition base logs I suspect they're in Bovomit sector). Either way they may not be friendly to humanity.
But if Raxxla is about releasing the devil from his cage then from PL the location should shift- I was looking around the Empyrean region (still trying to resolve the anagram hypothesis, my spreadsheet programming skills are negligible!), and I think the PL cosmology and pendent world reference points to this, but the devil should be in Hell- @Rochester do you have a system that is around the centre of Hell? I'm guessing Tartarus? Hell bubble size around 80 ly to correspond to the Empyrean?
