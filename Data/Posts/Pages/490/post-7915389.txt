"Finding TDW station" and "getting an invite fom TDW to be one of ours" have not to be mutually exclusive. They are two different things.
Imho.
There are "8th moons" in SD. I would laugh when the station will be found orbiting one there... Under our noses, undetectable.

(Dual Universe is still running in Alpha 2, for kickstarters and so. It's a pure sandbox, no story lines other than those you build yourself. But you have a total freedom to do what you want in one unique instance, the same for everybody. Very different from ED. (Some crazy organized people even started the construction of the Death Star... Years ! LoL !)
