I also believe the journey to Raxxla may involve a black hole. A black hole could be described as a "Dark Wheel".

Considering the Dark Wheel as a description of a special type of a black hole would make sense.

The station was a toroid design that was kept on minimal power to avoid detection, hence the name "Dark Wheel".
