Orbits compley with Keplerâ€™s third law.
This does not limit the size or angle much. If it orbits close, it orbits fast.
Right. My point was, if that station is so well obfuscated, so dark, anybody who wants to find it will have to explore (I bet in normal flight) different possible orbits.
Is there a way (ofc it is doing some statistics math) to determinate the most probable, based on the average values of a set of already known stations? In other terms, are the station orbits totally random in ED or do they follow some rule, probably based on planetary parameters. Knowing that formula might help those who want to look for that hidden TDW station. Because, as I said, I don't think that FSS, probes, and randomly orbiting the body in SC a couple of times may be enough to unveil it. Would already have been done.
(I am not saying I am waiting for our brilliant Herr Professor-Doktor to do the work and figure out that formula, but it could be interesting to investigate if there is such a feature in ED . Canonn nerds never wondered about it ?)

So, when was Raxxla created?..snip..
The thing is, we even don't know if the "ED Raxxla" follows the lore of " TDW novel Raxxla". We just don't know what FD have done with RH's creation.
It could be just as Rafe Zetter described it, or it could be just anything else that DB and MB imagined and deigned to implement into the game, with much, little or none respect for the original. Is it a functional gate to other universes, or is it a barren Soontill-like planet, another petty, shortviewed and finally uninteresting FD creation ?
Best question which should be asked to DB is not "Where is Raxxla " but "What is Raxxla". The Codex doesn't help, but succeeds in muddying the waters even more.
(I, for myself, always liked the "Oolite Raxxla". Not saying it is what we have in ED.)
