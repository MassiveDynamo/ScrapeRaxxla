Itâ€™s not occurred to me that TDW station might not be visible in SC.
Well.. It's just my own humble opinion based on rational statements, Pa !
As ED is becoming more and more arcade-ish, maybe TDW station can very well be detected in SC when you approach it or even when launching the FSS as soon as you enter its system as an "unknown contact" of sorts (and soon even still docked at Eravate with the incoming Extended FSS ! Cool !).
Would just be.. "FD-esque". The legendary TDW home base,supposedly in silent running, as easily detectable as any other space debris. LoL !

it then it might never be found
I think it is supposed to be very hard to find. But certainly "findable", because of the 8th moon clue thing. Or just a new FD's carrot?
Now, who finds it will provoke a major turn in the ED general story line. Almost as huge as finding Raxxla.
Nothing will be the same like before.
