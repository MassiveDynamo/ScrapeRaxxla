To me, that says we're not intended to find the Dark Wheel station.

I’m beginning to think you’re right, though there is the very woolly codex hint that it’s orbiting 8th moon of a gas giant somewhere. It does seem that this “treasure hunt” has no real clues. I have one Raxxla hypothesis left for Tyko to test, then don’t know what I’ll do.

Don’t fancy the look of any of the other games around, including Dual Universe...
