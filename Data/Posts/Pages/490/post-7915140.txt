My own statistics that could potentially (though these are of course open to discussion) have relevance:
ranks: Triple Elite (since Dec 3304)
superpowers ranks: Admiral, Duke
superpower reputation: friendly with all.
Engineers: all grade 5 except Etienne Dorn (not given him any occupied escape pods)
outstanding fines and bounties: none
max distance from start: 65222 LY
total distance travelled: ~2.4 MLY
systems visited: 71K (from ~93K jumps)
to add: combat and trade stats not yet recorded with screenshot
trade profit: ~979 MCr

It might perhaps be worth adding the number of System permits acquire/the Systems unlocked. I don't know whether we ever pursued the idea of unlocking all known permits.
