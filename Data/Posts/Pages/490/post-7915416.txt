I’m beginning to think you’re right, though there is the very woolly codex hint that it’s orbiting 8th moon of a gas giant somewhere. It does seem that this “treasure hunt” has no real clues. I have one Raxxla hypothesis left for Tyko to test, then don’t know what I’ll do.

Well they did mention that there would be no clues

We, the players, want there to be a treasure hunt, but that doesn't mean that there is one.
The Rift wasn't a treasure hunt until the very last day when DrewW gave us the system name hidden behind a mythology pop-quiz and some non-canon information - and that was only because there was a book to launch. And when it DID become a treasure hunt, it was solved within 24 hours.

If there's a way to find Raxxla beyond random chance, it'll come via an invitation from the Dark Wheel, not because of 'fernweh'
