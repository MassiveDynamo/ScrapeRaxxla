So, when was Raxxla created? Is it older than humanity? Yes. Is it older than the universe? No.

So, what is Raxxla? It is a gateway between universes. A traversable wormhole fits all the criteria of being Raxxla. What is not certian is if Raxxla is natural or manufactured.

After my last post I did more research into what we know about wormholes. My last post was horrifyingly inaccurate and out of date! I'm a bit out of my depth here. I'll update you all if I find out how to narrow down our search.

Edit: It is entirely possible for a wormhole (and also Raxxla) to be massless as it would be a purely geometric phenomena! Your FSD wouldn't be able to jump to it. Hope this helps.
