Here is my take on all this. Raxxla is a black hole, or seems to be. Unlike regular black holes this one will charge your engines to a near infinite capacity. A one jump passport to anywhere in the galaxy. I would assume that this is where the Dark Wheel might have gone but unlikely as they have eyes on what is going on here. But here is a hint. Read the codex, follow the clues and astrology might lead the way.
