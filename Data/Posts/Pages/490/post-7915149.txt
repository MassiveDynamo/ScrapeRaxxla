It might perhaps be worth adding the number of System permits acquire/the Systems unlocked. I don't know whether we ever pursued the idea of unlocking all known permits.
I have all of them except for the CQC system permit (this was one of my early priorities before Engineers and various other 'unlockables' were added to the game).

EDIT: some of the system permits are no longer available. e.g. the Phekda permit lock was released and the system can now be reached without it. (This was a change made a couple of weeks after the release of 2.0). Certain permits are also tied to navy rank. The condition of 'all permits' is therefore not going to be attainable for most players, however a subset of permits does seem reasonable so it is something that is worth recording.
