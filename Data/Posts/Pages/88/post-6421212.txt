They are the same colour as the poles axis line, so conceivably they are some other kind of map reference, but I don't think so. There is a lot of variation, looks quite random to me. Three circles on the three axes planes would make sense as a reference. These RNG lines don't look like any kind of reference to me.

*shrug*

Whatever they are, they're everywhere, so I'm not going to worry too much about them.
