I may have seen what your talking about.

Recently been doing a bit of mining for engineers. Was using eddb.io to look for pristine metallic rings. Lots of the bodies being shown in the list as having them were landables,quick check on gal map showed them as landables with no rings though. Zoomed in to see of rings were there but just thin. Saw what looks like a load of much smaller bodies in orbit with what looks like a trail behind them. Not orbit lines but could say they do look like comets.

The objects and lines were not blue though,they looked grey to me. No idea what they are.
