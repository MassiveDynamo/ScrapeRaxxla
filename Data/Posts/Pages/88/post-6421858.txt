Well, I think we should diferentiate where is Raxxla and what is Raxxla (R is possibly everywhere, a place that is not a place and Oolite's witchspace and MB's "oh, it's in the Milky Way"). DW knows the what is, and doesn't know the where is (meaning "how to get access"). So, I take for granted Raxxla is what DW describes in his novels. He wouldn't have denatured the subject Raxxla after reading the alien background secret book from Frontier. What concerns me, is the "a certain celestial body"-thing which could refer to the access entry ( 8 accesses ? ) to R and could then be anywhere...and moving.
EDIT: which makes me wonder if the "obfuscated"-thing missions showed us R access moving from Ticushpakhi to Varati to 49 Arietis and Hip 8603 clusters ...most of them being in the (outer?) rim of the bubble. In this way of tinfoiling, we lost R access trail around HIP 8603 ...or maybe it's still there ?


TDW faction, Doc ?

Place that’s not a place cos it’s everywhere, door that is the key- - - it is the system/station on the start screen!
it’s everywhere because its located at each player’s location. It’s the key because they’re telling us to look for it & it’s in plain sight.
