Greedy boy !

Not at all. I do in no way condone substance abuse.

I suspect this has happened to all of us.
You sit at your desk in the back of the cockpit working on mysterious science, when suddenly the tinfoil hat starts to slide forward. As you catch it just above the ceremonial candle on the desk, you bump your knee on the desk leg.
The bump inevitably cases a scientific sample of onion head and noe on the special Canonn biscuits to fall into the hat. As you pause to analyze the situation, a strange fume starts to fill the cockpit.
Next thing you wake up confused and a little shameful, but with plenty of new drawings and theories spread all over the place.

Happens to me almost every week. [noob]
