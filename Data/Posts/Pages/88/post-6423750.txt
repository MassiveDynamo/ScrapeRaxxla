You'd worry if the Thargoids were everywhere wouldn't you?

If this is the case, and unless Frontier introduces some kind of interaction with the Goids that doesn't boil down to blasting them to bits, I'll be taking my leave. Thargoids right now are pretty shallow content in my opinion and if they end up forcing that content on the entire player base ... well, I guess I'll be praying for Star Citizen.
