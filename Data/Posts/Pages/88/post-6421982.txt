I think its the same planet but from a different angle/orbital place & just added station for Horizons

and its a little obvious!

Its a completely different station though. The orignal wallpaper features a Corilolis and the moon is off in the distance. So your looking for a system with an Orbis starport orbiting the moon and a Coriolis orbiting the planet. The moon, of course, is landable and the station is in a VERY tight orbit around the moon ... practically scheming the surface! Meanwhile the moon itself is in an awfully tight orbit around it's planet.
