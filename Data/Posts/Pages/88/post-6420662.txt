Can you post a pic? I suspect you're talking about the blue circlet that indicates you can land on the planet.

Edit: Jorki you Ninja!

No, not the blue circlets. Here's a video, but I've noticed that they are almost invisible on some monitors. They are quite prominent on my centre monitor which I use for playing the game but nearly invisible on both side monitors (I am using three) despite one of them being nominally exactly the same model. It's not possible that I am the first person to see these? Is it?

I think those blue lines are the drop zones oflandable planets. Orbit lines are orange.

What are dropzones? The blue orbit lines are animated, indicating motion of a satellite. Or something.
