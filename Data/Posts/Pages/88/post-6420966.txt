Where is the source for the quote “Raxxla is not a POI”? It’s the first time I’ve come across this & as far as I know the only clues we have from FD are that Raxxla has ben in game from the outset, they know where it is, and there will be no clues related to it.

Is this a misinterpretation of DrewWagar’s quote that the Formidine Rift mystery is not a poi? (It wasn’t-the mystery was the Dynasty Conspiracy and their Exodus plot, but it was revealed through a poi which was the Zurara).

Yes, I made a mistake here, that quote was relevant to the Formidine Rift mystery. I have no notes, had a bit of a headache yesterday (not onionhead related), trusted my creative intuition while more focused on searching for a comet. Such nice think-outside-of-the-box type of gameplay.
SPOILER

I kind of like the idea that somebody found Raxxla already, and just didn't tell rest of us yet. Emergent, community driven story and all that..

Drew Wagar did interesting description of Raxxla in his Oolite novella Mutabilis. It's not lore, and nor do I wish it was, but the impression of Raxxla being Guardian tech was there, and it was quite entertaining thought.
