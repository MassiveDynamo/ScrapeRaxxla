Its a completely different station though. The orignal wallpaper features a Corilolis and the moon is off in the distance. So your looking for a system with an Orbis starport orbiting the moon and a Coriolis orbiting the planet. The moon, of course, is landable and the station is in a VERY tight orbit around the moon ... practically scheming the surface! Meanwhile the moon itself is in an awfully tight orbit around it's planet.

Mmm, yes the orbital height is a bit low!

You'd worry if the Thargoids were everywhere wouldn't you?

I think in another 6 months time!
