I've always assumed they're a visual cue to help you see movement when you rotate the view.

They are the same colour as the poles axis line, so conceivably they are some other kind of map reference, but I don't think so. There is a lot of variation, looks quite random to me. Three circles on the three axes planes would make sense as a reference. These RNG lines don't look like any kind of reference to me.
