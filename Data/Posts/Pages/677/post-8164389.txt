On DW2 I had problems with a couple of NSP, it was difficult to drop out at them. I’d drop & they’d be 100km away & that happened several times until I hit just the right drop point, getting very close before exiting SC. Think it’s a bug, don’t know if it’s been addressed by FD- you could check the last couple of change notices.
For me I could not see them using the FSS and they did not appear in the Nav panel at all so I couldn’t even try dropping into them sadly. I even tried detailed surface scans of the planets and rings but couldn’t find anything.

The system I was looking in was BD-12 1172.
