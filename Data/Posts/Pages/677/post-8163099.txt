That may or may not be similar / confused with the Sumerian Annunaki denizens of the Nibiru system described by Sitchin who came to Earth and created the human slave race to mine monoatomic gold.

That was supposed to be on a significantly shorter ~3600 year cycle but there are others listed here.
No, it's pukka astronomy/paleontology, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_(hypothetical_star), "Claimed periodicity of mass extinctions"
