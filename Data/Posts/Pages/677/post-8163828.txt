Guru's hypothesis is that Nemesis may be Raxxla.

Could be, might be, could not be. Just thought it was an interesting thing that seems to be missing. Pretty stoked some of y'all seem to be interested in the idea and see it be potentially valid. Not sure myself if it aligns with the codex or the toast, but not so sure it doesn't either. As always, nothing appears to be solid in this whole process.

Also if anyone ever finds Alexander the Great and/or Alexander Saunders flying around Eden, please let me know. Tell them I said hello and thank you.

SPOILER: ALEXANDER THE GREAT
SPOILER: ALEXANDER SAUNDERS

Noticing that Alexander the Great's ship name is Carmine Pavilion. Carmine is a deep Crimson Red. Red is the opposite color of Raxxla green.
Crimson is also commonly used as a name among pirate factions. Could also be Carmina.....Carmina Burana? O Fortuna?

SPOILER: CARMINA BURANA- O FORTUNA LYRICS. ALL TOO APPLICABLE.




































And back into the deep end I go.
