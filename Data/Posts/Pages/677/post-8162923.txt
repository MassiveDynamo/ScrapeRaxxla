Well at least I found something in Alpha Centauri.

SPOILER: SYSTEM MAP SHADOW

This is the same type of object that can be seen in Alpha Cygni and Star of India. It pops up after watching the system map for a minute or two. It starts of small, grows for a while and then starts fading. After growing for a while a bright spot emerges in the center.
This object moves in a separate plane in the map. It's deeper than the stars, planets and the sun bursts, but higher than the grid and the background stars. When you move the map, it moves about half the distanse of the regular bodies. Background stars are stationary.

Object in the yellow circle.

These map objects have always made me think of a dense reflection cloud that obfuscates a planet. Sort of like this one:
SPOILER: EXPLORATION CODEX

I will definitely give Alpha Centauri a bit more time.
