I asked about that system 100 or so pages ago. I think the penguin responded saying he was pretty sure it was just another random permit locked system. I do not recall any other responses. I did spend a while trying to find an NPC that went there to try and high-wake follow, but that didn’t work.

Edit: forgot to quote Jorki’s inquiry to Alpha Hydri!
