The Nemesis hypothesis makes some sense as the article was published in January of the same year the original game released (1984). Although I think TDW was written before then, it makes for an easy connection between a mythical place and a mythical planet/sun after the fact. The question remains if FDEV would stick to it after the Nemesis existence was disproved by the WISE mission in 2014 (about 9 months before the release of ED coincidentally).

As I understand things Wise didn’t disprove it, just changed the probabilities. A group of Spanish astroners quite recently think they’ve found Nemesis, though I think there is still some argument over whether it is a brown dwarf or expanding supernova remnant- see my earlier post. FD aren’t going to continually change things in-game, at least not for things that may impact important storylines.
