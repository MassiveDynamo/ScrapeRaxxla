I asked about that system 100 or so pages ago. I think the penguin responded saying he was pretty sure it was just another random permit locked system. I do not recall any other responses. I did spend a while trying to find an NPC that went there to try and high-wake follow, but that didn’t work.

Edit: forgot to quote Jorki’s inquiry to Alpha Hydri!

Thanks!
but I’m thinking these permit locks may not be random but maybe part of the Raxxla storyline. It seems to me too coincidental that Witch’s Reach (“whisperer in witch-space”?), NFT 509 ( linear alignment with Sol/Sirius/Alpha Cent? see my earlier post on current hypothesis), now Alpha Hydri (Beta Hydri permit obtained from Feds on CPO promotion; possible use of Alpha as a headmark when searching in Sol for Nemesis?) are all locked. I have suspected for a while that this is why TDW “lost” Raxxla- might be because Pilots Federation put it behind a permit lock. Finding Raxxla as a worthwhile endgame might well require the effort to gain several permits; the one for Witch’s Reach might be the TDW test of skill & courage (according to galmap the star could be the right type to match the codex pic; according to a forum post it has 2 stars and a GG-so perhaps a moon?), & why would FD put military convoys in there (stated in change notes, possible clue?) when we can’t get into the system?
