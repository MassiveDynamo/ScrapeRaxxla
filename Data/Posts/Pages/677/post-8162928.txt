Wait, are we talking planet X / Wormwood theory here? [Edit: ADS range is supposed to be infinite.]

There may be IRL a Planet X - that's Persephone in-game. There is also IRL a theory that mass extinctions occuring on a 27 MYear cycle are caused by a red/brown dwarf (hence named Nemesis) located towards the edge of the solar system disturbing comets in the Oort cloud which bombard the inner solar system. Guru's hypothesis is that Nemesis may be Raxxla.
