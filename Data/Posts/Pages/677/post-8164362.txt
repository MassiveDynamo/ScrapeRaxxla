I recently went looking for some Notable Stellar Phenomena in codex reported locations and couldn’t get them to show either. I thought they may have despawned or it was just my game playing up with the horizons bug I have been experiencing lately. I’m not so sure now, maybe it is a more widespread issue than I first thought.

On DW2 I had problems with a couple of NSP, it was difficult to drop out at them. I’d drop & they’d be 100km away & that happened several times until I hit just the right drop point, getting very close before exiting SC. Think it’s a bug, don’t know if it’s been addressed by FD- you could check the last couple of change notices.
