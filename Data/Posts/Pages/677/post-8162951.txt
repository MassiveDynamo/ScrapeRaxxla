There may be IRL a Planet X - that's Persephone in-game. There is also IRL a theory that mass extinctions occuring on a 27 MYear cycle are caused by a red/brown dwarf (hence named Nemesis) located towards the edge of the solar system disturbing comets in the Oort cloud which bombard the inner solar system. Guru's hypothesis is that Nemesis may be Raxxla.
That may or may not be similar / confused with the Sumerian Annunaki denizens of the Nibiru system described by Sitchin who came to Earth and created the human slave race to mine monoatomic gold.

That was supposed to be on a significantly shorter ~3600 year cycle but there are others listed here.
