Could be, might be, could not be. Just thought it was an interesting thing that seems to be missing. Pretty stoked some of y'all seem to be interested in the idea and see it be potentially valid. Not sure myself if it aligns with the codex or the toast, but not so sure it doesn't either. As always, nothing appears to be solid in this whole process.
The Nemesis hypothesis makes some sense as the article was published in January of the same year the original game released (1984). Although I think TDW was written before then, it makes for an easy connection between a mythical place and a mythical planet/sun after the fact. The question remains if FDEV would stick to it after the Nemesis existence was disproved by the WISE mission in 2014 (about 9 months before the release of ED coincidentally).
