Noticed that Interstella Phenonomonononononomuh are not spawning on System panel when you arrive at certain systems.
Oort 2 when passing through, popped back and both were not there and the one with the research ship (Community goal one, starts with a B in the Codex cannae be bothered to look it up). First visit all IP were there but the ship was not, popped back on return trip and only the ship was showing. Probably just another bug, but could make Raxxla hunting impossible for now.
I recently went looking for some Notable Stellar Phenomena in codex reported locations and couldn’t get them to show either. I thought they may have despawned or it was just my game playing up with the horizons bug I have been experiencing lately. I’m not so sure now, maybe it is a more widespread issue than I first thought.
