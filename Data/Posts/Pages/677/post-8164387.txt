Thanks!
but I’m thinking these permit locks may not be random but maybe part of the Raxxla storyline. It seems to me too coincidental that Witch’s Reach (“whisperer in witch-space”?), NFT 509 ( linear alignment with Sol/Sirius/Alpha Cent? see my earlier post on current hypothesis), now Alpha Hydri (Beta Hydri permit obtained from Feds on CPO promotion; possible use of Alpha as a headmark when searching in Sol for Nemesis?) are all locked. I have suspected for a while that this is why TDW “lost” Raxxla- might be because Pilots Federation put it behind a permit lock. Finding Raxxla as a worthwhile endgame might well require the effort to gain several permits; the one for Witch’s Reach might be the TDW test of skill & courage (according to galmap the star could be the right type to match the codex pic; according to a forum post it has 2 stars and a GG-so perhaps a moon?), & why would FD put military convoys in there (stated in change notes, possible clue?) when we can’t get into the system?
The Pilot's Federation could have control of some permit locked systems and be letting TDW in, not us.
