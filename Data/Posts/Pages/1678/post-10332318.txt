Time to crunch some numbers!
The systems where Bei Dou and Core Sys sectors overlap (golden ladder?):

Asellus Primus - yes, a system under direct control of the Pilots Federation.
Dahan
GD 319
Bei Dou Sector BA-A d96
Aulis
LP 98-132 - has a landable, ringed planet called Anahit. Huh.
Ithaca - how about yet another Odyssey reference?
