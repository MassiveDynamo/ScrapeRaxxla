Aurea Catena Homeri - The Golden Chain of Homer

John Milton’s cosmology and primarily his image that it hung from a golden chain, has its roots likely in Homer’s Iliad where similarly Homer described a golden chain that linked earth with heaven.

‘Hang me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it all of you, gods and goddesses together - tug as you will, you will not drag Zeus the supreme counselor from heaven to earth; but were I to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth and sea into the bargain, then would I bind the chain about some pinnacle of Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid firmament.’ - Homer.

This concept was transmitted into medieval western alchemy, as the path from 'chaos' to the universal quintessence, referenced in the work '', published in 1723 by Anton Josef Kirchweger.





Within game I suspect this Miltonian cosmology has been utilised somehow, but my question, as ever is - how much.

Now it’s supposedly evident that there could exist a Miltonian axis in game which I believe runs through a series of systems named after deities attributed to the ‘sun’ or the ‘north’, denoting a northern axis, one such being the system Olorun, a deity from the Yoruba creation myth, which describes similarly a golden chain.

So what other systems could align with these theories? We have the Norse dragons / serpents also in game, so in theory, if a similar representation as above exists in game, are there any systems high above similarly named?
