Not much time to read now, but a quick glance saw you talking about the Greek compass.

Tascheter, or as we know it Aldebaran, was one of the royal stars of Zoroastrian astronomy - the Watcher of the East, observing the Pleiades. Its western counterpart Satevis, however, is Antares - quite a bit too far at ~554ly from Sol.
