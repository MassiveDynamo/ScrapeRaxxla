Well, my hypothesis about selling exploration data or running trading missions for Pilot's Federation in Dromi, Otegine etc is a non-starter, they're all locked.

(edit2: Just got back to Shinrarta/Jameson Memorial & I'm Allied with "Pilot's Federation Local Branch" there- #3 in my numbering scheme, which seems to disagree with EDSM which put #5 at ShinDez)


So instead sold over 127MCr (edit: 138.4MCr) worth of data to Felicity's UC outlet; that should be enough to get me a DW invite (if she IS a member!); except she must have a slow connection since my total hasnt incremented in the 10 minutes since I sold it. Or perhaps she's on the blower to the inner circle.......

AND while out gathering it I couldn't help but notice how many Thargoids are hanging around in the Coalsack. Each system had 50-100 goids. Alliance seem to have done a nice job of getting them riled up and ready for the major invasion that The Club were preparing for. Book your tickets to Colonia now people!

Yea that's the locked new cmdr starter zone. You can only get there on a new acct. I can practically guarantee it's not need for Raxxla as it was relatively recently added
