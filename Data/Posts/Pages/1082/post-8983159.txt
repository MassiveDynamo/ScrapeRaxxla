Ok here is a quick look (rough map) at some of those systems that raxxla might have passed.... but they kind of line up....

That’s some good work, maybe Herpin isn’t related then?

It looks out of place doesn’t it, and the story IMPO is a little vague, magic rainbow dust making people disintegrate when they sleep, odd nonetheless, but no mention of that mysterious gravity well, or signals.

Anything within the triangle of stars near to Thetis, what common themes, name meanings do they share? (Currently not able to log in game at present).

But great work.
