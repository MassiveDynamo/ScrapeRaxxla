Thanks - so here are my thought on the sites I chose.

Delta69 / Thetis / cd-31 1974 (signal tourist beacon) all deal with some sort of signal that is broadcast. Though in the case of the tourist beacon at CD31 1974 we have no real idea if it relates other than it was apparently a strange event.

Delta69/Thetis/Herpin have encounters with foreign objects. In the case of Delta69 a gravitational anomoly, Thetis passes a moon that sends the signal, and Herpin has dust falling from the sky - I think in the case of Herpin meta the authors are referencing the movie The Night of the Comet

Both Herpin and Delta 69 have people who disappear from within closed rooms - the difference with Herpin is they identify what is happening - ie people turn to dust when sleep

If you look at my silly little animation below you see the sites are constrained NSEW to an almost linear feature - the Up/Down shows some variability. And of course this is such a tiny dataset ... which is why I want to search along this corridor. There are things like the disappearance might fit in to this - It is described as anomalous ( like the description of the ship in the Herpin Logs). But I couldnt get a location for the Consuela Disappearance ... also an anonymous source claimed to have found her in Rhea (in hiding) - but no proof was ever given. So ya still looking for more points to add... Will definately put more effort into the triangle area (herpin is out of the bubble so possibly an outlier or we got with a settlement that far out and on the path...)

It’s a great start, really good work.

Agree with ‘Night of the Comet’ reference, underrated movie.

Spatial mapping, such as this can be incredibly insightful. Keep up the good work, wish I had more time for this.
