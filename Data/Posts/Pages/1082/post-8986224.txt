When I reset my second account about a year back, I managed to get allied to the Pilots of Federation Adsminstration faction before leaving the starter closed sector but didn't notice anything special... tried even to plot a rout from Dromi to the Cone Sector Nebula and other locked areas with my Sidewinder and they all were still locked (using galaxy map). As the maximum FSD I found on the starter stations was really low-tier, I wasn't feeling like going that far exploring.

Going from the spellings Could be there are just 3 factions. From my numbering scheme (a couple pages back):

1 Pilots Federation Local Branch -PFDemocracy AND 5 The Pilots Federation - IndependentDemocracy
Seems Davanix got Allied with #1 after combat in the recent Jupiter Rochester HIP 54530 CG??

2 Pilots’ Federation Administration - PFCorporate AND 3 Pilots’ Federation Local Branch - PFDemocracy
in ShinDezAccording to game screen in station Jorki Allied!

4 PilotsFederation - no detail! -rank via rescue missions or Thargoid kills-Jorki Allied!

Will keep an out on Galnet for any more CG or permit-related items to see if Jorki can get allied with faction 1 (& 5?) then see what happens. I suspect this might be related to DW gameplay thread-DW are a faction within PF after all! (Tourist beacon!)
