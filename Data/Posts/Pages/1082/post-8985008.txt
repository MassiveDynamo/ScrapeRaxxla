Iâ€™ve prepurchased the Elite Dangerous Odyssey Alpha but never played an alpha version before, when it comes out how do I prevent the alpha testing phase messing up my EDD and EDSM commander history & statistics?

It's good habit not to launch the usual uplink/API tools (EDMC, EDdiscovery etc.) when logging into an Alpha or Beta unless you have a good reason to.
