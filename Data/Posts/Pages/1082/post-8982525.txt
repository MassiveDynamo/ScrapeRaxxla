Cthulhu Rules KO !!!

Well, my hypothesis about selling exploration data or running trading missions for Pilot's Federation in Dromi, Otegine etc is a non-starter, they're all locked.

(edit2: Just got back to Shinrarta/Jameson Memorial & I'm Allied with "Pilot's Federation Local Branch" there- #3 in my numbering scheme, which seems to disagree with EDSM which put #5 at ShinDez)


So instead sold over 127MCr (edit: 138.4MCr) worth of data to Felicity's UC outlet; that should be enough to get me a DW invite (if she IS a member!); except she must have a slow connection since my total hasnt incremented in the 10 minutes since I sold it. Or perhaps she's on the blower to the inner circle.......

AND while out gathering it I couldn't help but notice how many Thargoids are hanging around in the Coalsack. Each system had 50-100 goids. Alliance seem to have done a nice job of getting them riled up and ready for the major invasion that The Club were preparing for. Book your tickets to Colonia now people!
