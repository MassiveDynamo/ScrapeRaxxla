Yea that's the locked new cmdr starter zone. You can only get there on a new acct. I can practically guarantee it's not need for Raxxla as it was relatively recently added

When I reset my second account about a year back, I managed to get allied to the Pilots of Federation Adsminstration faction before leaving the starter closed sector but didn't notice anything special... tried even to plot a rout from Dromi to the Cone Sector Nebula and other locked areas with my Sidewinder and they all were still locked (using galaxy map). As the maximum FSD I found on the starter stations was really low-tier, I wasn't feeling like going that far exploring.
