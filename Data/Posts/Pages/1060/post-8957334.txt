So a good few years ago (cant remember what thread i posted it in) I randomly selected a system in which i would keep track of after each update to see if there was any changes made as some people noticed some before, turns out to be correct, in the image attached the L dwarf star its belt and those two planets never existed a few months back, yes the system was fully scanned thoroughly by myself and the first located CMDR Apex and Baconofdeath, now i fly out here after about a year since we last checked and it has a new star and planets......is it possible that FDEV is changing star/planet locations from system to system on the fly (Potential Raxxla being Rogue) and the system you searched last year that came up as not containing it now holds it.....

Can i get a dev to confirm on whether system changes of rogue planets happen at least, I doubt one will but would adleast confirm it as a yes or no.

They can change systems within limits. I believe that they can only add to the outer bounds of a system , so they couldnt add a new planet between A1 & A2. Cant remember who said this , might have actually been MB.
