Histroically FD have intervened to stop the player base chasing ghosts (referring to the Gan Romero storyline in particular) so the fact that they haven't done that with Raxxla, is an encouragement.

I dont want to know if this is the case, I think it could kill the game for me. its always there in the background.

If we're considering this true, and personally I'm taking it with a pound of salt, it means a couple of things:
1) the system has a high chance to be present on EDSM or EDDB (IF it was scanned and IF the data was sold to UC) - MB said it has been entered AT LEAST ONCE
2) if the system was scanned (and DB said we only need basic scans to find it), it didn't show up, at least not with only one scan, so we still need to know what to look for

1. 0.5% of the galaxy has been 'visited' - CM in a recent post - approx 0.1 in EDSM. Means approx 80% not on EDSM.
2. Honk n jump was and is a thing, actually stopping and looking around was frowned upon
