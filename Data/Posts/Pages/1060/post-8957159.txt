footage or official post from a dev saying the players CAN find it?
Strictly, beyond reasonable doubt, no.

About all we have is this:


■ Raxxla does exist:


- "What a silly question, of course!" - He didn't say "You don't know what it is" as an answer to the question, he said it to the guy sitting next to him. However, we don't know what it is since we haven't found it yet.

- "It's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where at this stage. It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." - There will be no clues, " I think you'd have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious so people know what they're doing."

■ FDev doesn't share information on Raxxla with writers, including Drew Wagar: -

- The subject of alien races came up and, as a writer, he reminded me of an 'Alien background doc' given to the writers as research material. I do have this, but I'm not allowed (due to NDA) to publish it. Raxxla is part of that. None of the writers were allowed to explore Raxxla, it was very much reserved for 'in-house' development (not surprisingly!).

Then DB came out with his statement. I was a little surprise at what he said, but it was in a public space and others overheard it too.

Raxxla definitely exists in ED.

So in balance of probabilty, I'd say that is yes..
