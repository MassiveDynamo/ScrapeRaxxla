As a big fan of Soul searching... I dont want to dissuade you from your quest, but just so you know... Fdev in their wisdom has allowed player groups to write up their own system descriptions... so I would take that Soul Syndicate with a grain of salt.
I know. This does not mean that it's not a hint.

There are about 2-3 hints per system which reinforce a certain interpretation. And with that description I'm confident that the Herme-system is about Hermes.
