They can change systems within limits. I believe that they can only add to the outer bounds of a system , so they couldnt add a new planet between A1 & A2. Cant remember who said this , might have actually been MB.
Ok, so....the reason we may not be making much progress on their exploration data is most likely due to them adding more and more each time that we dont know about? Seems very bad considering there is enough to explore in Elite for centuries as is :-( As for the Raxxla topic so they could be potentially adding and removing this planet from system to system each Thursday provided it is not included in the current line of star orbits.......
