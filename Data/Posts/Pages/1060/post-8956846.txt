I guess that FSD from the current Community Goal means that I will delay my investigation of the Soul and Heart Nebula.

After reading a little bit of mythology-stuff, there are many threads merging; I now also see why people see Cassiopeia-Andromeda as the possible reference for Mother Of All Galaxies (although Hera is the other obvious possibility).
I've read a bit into the Perseus-myth, which is also a possible connection since the Soul/Heart Nebulas are in the Perseus arm of the Milky Way.

There are a few points where I'm unsure:

the Orion-constellation seems to be special (especially since the ever watchful 'eye' of Barnard's Loop is in there) in real-life mythology and ingame
I have three very special systems, where the names of the deities are written wrong:
Herme = Hermes: related to Soul
Ma'a = Ma'at: related to Heart (your heart is weighed against gold for entrance into the afterlife)
Odins = Odin: don't know how to relate to the Soul/Heart Nebulas
I currently have 3 deities from 3 different cultures/mythologies where the name is wrong; the systems all have a description which relates specifically to a trait of the deity
I don't know if there are more deities where the name is wrong; I currently assume there might be two more deities, one male, one female:
one from the Hinduistic "parthenon"
one from another mythology; Sumerian/Babylonian? South-/Meso-American?
if there are two more deities with the feature "name missing a character" or "name having an extra character", then this would be a different interpretation of the Isis-puzzle
perhaps I can solve the Dahan-puzzle before heading out?

On the other hand, perhaps now is the ideal time to head out to the Soul/Heart Nebula as everyone will be working on getting the double FSD? Tinfoil hat on: The club will be moving Raxxla away from the Heart/Soul Nebula while everyone is distracted
