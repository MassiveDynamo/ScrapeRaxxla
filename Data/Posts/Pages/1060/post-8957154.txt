is there any actual proof that raxxla CAN be found?

No is the short answer, nothing from Frontier that specifies that.

We have witness statements (unsubstantiated as in no backup witness statements, or a 1 to 1 convo) but many werent written about at or near the time, and in fact have evidence to the opposite, with one notable exception

Frontier refuse to confirm any unsubstantiated accounts for many years....and now the last time we got a go at it they wouldnt even confirm what DB had said on record on video. Coz a 'We can confirm these statements or 'known' facts are correct and Frontier authorised' would go a long way.

In game its written as part myth part reality (or perceived reality) so take your pick

Nobody in-game that we know of has actually been there or seen evidence of it.
