Its worse than that, theres debate about what 'exists' actually means.
I'll try not to worry until we start detabting what "what" and "mean" actually mean.

I dont want to know if this is the case, I think it could kill the game for me. its always there in the background.


1. 0.5% of the galaxy has been 'visited' - CM in a recent post - approx 0.1 in EDSM. Means approx 80% not on EDSM.
2. Honk n jump was and is a thing, actually stopping and looking around was frowned upon
Not a criticism, just claryfing for someone who doesn't check these things: I believe you might have the decimal point in the wrong position. It think it should be 0.05 and 0.01% (actually EDSM currently says 0.015421% as I write this).
