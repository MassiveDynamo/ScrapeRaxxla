Hi all,
I am a lurker who has read as much discussion of Raxxla as I can find. Lately I have been researching the Zurara messages and I think I came up with the answer to the penultimate line:

A final word, a course to follow, a poor miser's sum

The answer, I believe, is dead reckoning. Death is finality. A reckoning is both a course to follow and a final accounting / sum.

I have not seen this offered up as an answer to this line anywhere, so I figured I would contribute.

EDIT: Misspelled Zurara as Zuraya
