"I was in the room when Michael Brooks said the thing... the system where Raxxla is has been entered at least once by a commander, they just jumped and off they went. ...They either scooped and gone...He didn't say anything else but the system where Raxxla is has been visited. So it's not in the 99.99999999% of the rest of the galaxy... we have been there. Whether you trust my word or not.... is.... that's a thing... but I was there when he said it, because he said it at Lavecon and it was in a Q&A. Erm so it's not in a locked system but we just don't know how to find it or what even it is... or what even it is.... I do think the Dark Wheel have something to do with it..."
If we're considering this true, and personally I'm taking it with a pound of salt, it means a couple of things:
1) the system has a high chance to be present on EDSM or EDDB (IF it was scanned and IF the data was sold to UC) - MB said it has been entered AT LEAST ONCE
2) if the system was scanned (and DB said we only need basic scans to find it), it didn't show up, at least not with only one scan, so we still need to know what to look for
