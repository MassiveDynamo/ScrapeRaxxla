On the subject of hyperdrive tech, and Drew's book premonition: Drew has mentioned that FDEV have changed the in game lore recently on drive tech, and that there are now incosistencies between what was published in his book and elsewhere in older game lore, and what is now the in-game canon.

Drew suggested we stick to whats in game, based on Galnet + Tourist Beacons etc., and to disregard previous data. Please see Drew's questions thread on this forum:
