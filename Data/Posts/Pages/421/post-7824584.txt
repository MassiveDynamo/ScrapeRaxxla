Hey, like I said, I wasn't accusing you of anything and I said the source might be wrong.

The only point I'd make there is it's probably worth sense checking what the sources say.

I use FTL as faster than light. If we're talking about travelling, which we are, then it's FTL travel.

Quirium Drives were Hyperdrives. The fuel used was called Quirium. Hyperdrives in this context being a drive for transiting through hyperspace. It's a form of FTL travel.

Wormholes would also involve travelling - they need to be entered, traversed and exited.

If we're talking realistically then you be moving faster than the speed of light, and all hypothetical forms of FTL travel involve getting around that restriction in a form where you don't locally move faster than light (which you can't) but still arrive at the destination faster than light would (if that light was travelling the 'ordinary' route through normal space).

Regarding wormholes you don’t travel faster then light whilst traversing them but they would transport you to a location faster than travelling at the speed of light but personally you’d arrive instantaneous so is a much higher form of travel
