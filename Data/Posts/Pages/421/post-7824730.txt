The Zurara logs were written by Drew Wagar as part of his in-game narrative that paralleled his novel "Elite: Premonition". Drew Wagar also authored the "Oolite Saga" which is a collection of non-canon stories that take place in the "Oolite Universe" (Oolite is a remake of the original Elite game from 1984. In those novels the two main characters have their memories altered via a process called "Hexediting". I'm 99% sure that the inclusion of the term in the Zurara logs is simply an Easter-egg for those of us who read Drew's old fan fiction (which itself was an Easter-egg referencing how gamers would use a hexeditor back in the 80s to modify their CMDR's game save to change their stats (you could give yourself millions of credits.

There's always a possibility that it could mean more but I think that the only interest in the "Hexedit" theory is because of a recent post on Reddit that got picked up by Obsidian Ant. I don't think Ant or the original Redditor who made the post were aware of Drew's previous use of "Hexedit" in his fan fiction.
I have seen this but frontier aren't in the Easter egg business and there is no proof to suggest it is an Easter egg donâ€™t get me wrong it could well be. it is however a possible code when decoded spells Raxxla
