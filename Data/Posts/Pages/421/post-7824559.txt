Cool I didn't know and really have no way of know what is and isn't related.

How do we know something in game seemingly unrelated WONT be connected?
Well, we don't, we don't know anything, but....FDev promised "no clues" which to me, means no encoded beacons pointing us to a location, etc. Also, in this case, I believe this is part of the Formidine Rift mystery. It was discussed on here a few pages ago, that the author who came up with this has no idea where Raxxla is, making it unlikely to be related.
