I don't see how it spells Raxxla. The keyed Vigenere cipher image that you uploaded only contains the passphrase (hexedit) and the message text (raxxla). It cuts off the resulting cipher text which, in this case would be "yeuboi". Does yeuboi mean anything?
Well if you mean yea boiii thatâ€™s a gaming term
