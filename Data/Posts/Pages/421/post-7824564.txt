Well, we don't, we don't know anything, but....FDev promised "no clues" which to me, means no encoded beacons pointing us to a location, etc. Also, in this case, I believe this is part of the Formidine Rift mystery. It was discussed on here a few pages ago, that the author who came up with this has no idea where Raxxla is, making it unlikely to be related.
FDev is infuriatingly vague about the things they say and leave a lot of room for interpretation. The way I understood that was to mean FDevs wouldn't be giving us clues in things like interviews or q&A's but anything in game that would serve as a clue or an informative source would be part of the actual search process.
