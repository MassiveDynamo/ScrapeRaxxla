Regarding wormholes you don’t travel faster then light whilst traversing them but they would transport you to a location faster than travelling at the speed of light but personally you’d arrive instantaneous so is a much higher form of travel
Welcome to the chase Tacticus. I don't get on here as frequently as I used to and I've enjoyed reading your posts. Don't let us "old guard" folks put you off too much. Its easy for some of us to lose patience ... some of what you've posted is 100% canon, some of it rumor, some of it related to non-Raxxla (as far as we know) mysteries and a little bit come from some very excellent fan fiction that helped fill the years when there were no official "Elite" games under development. No worries. With what little we know about Raxxla it is hard to say where the inspiration will come from that will finally crack this thing open for us.

In regards to this "Faster than Light" argument ... You and Thatchinho are both right. FTL can refer both to something moving faster then the speed of light as well as to traveling to somewhere faster then light could ordinarily get there. True "FTL" doesn't exist in our universe as far as we know and every theoretical method of achieving faster then light velocity is, in reality, on "apparent faster than light" travel as it involves some way of warping the fabric of space-time so that the object traveling is moving at subluminal velocities. In general though, and especially within science fiction, any kind of travel that can get you from one place to another faster then is physically possible gets lumped under the term "FTL" whether it is Star Trek's Warp Drive, Dune's folding space or Star Wars' Hyperspace.
