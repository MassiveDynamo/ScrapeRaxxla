For me the martian artifact is a very curious incident. Mankind's capability in terraforming and space faring take a sudden leap forward after it's discovery, but nobody has ever seen it since it was discovered. It's only a small thing, too - what could have such significance? A data store or key of some kind?

For myself I seldom take much interest in convoy dispersal USS - don't know about others - but maybe we need to find a convoy with cargo at the right place..

Thinking about the mechanisms whereby we could find out about this artifact might help..
Maybe but Iâ€™m not sure how that could be coded.. I for one have been to the Zeus system and there is a large number those convey dispersal
