Indeed. Something I've said in the past on this thread is that should Raxxla ever be found, FD probably shouldn't acknowledge that it is in fact the Raxxla that they intended. I think the Raxxla of Legend is more compelling and interesting than anything it could actually be.

If it is found, many people might be satisfied that it is Raxxla, but disappointed in the result, but as long as it isn't officially acknowledged, enough people will be convinced it was a red herring and the search will continue.
Maybe. Or they could come up with other mysteries to solve if Raxxla is indeed found! I like the idea a problem is solvable.
Besides, it would be nice to drop some in-game reference from time to time, no necessarily clues but NPC could mention Raxxla or the Dark Wheel in station/settlement bars or concourses discussions.
I've heard some pieces of information this way, but never a thing (oral or written) about Raxxla/TDW.
