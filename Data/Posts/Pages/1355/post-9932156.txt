Maybe. Or they could come up with other mysteries to solve if Raxxla is indeed found! I like the idea a problem is solvable.
Besides, it would be nice to drop some in-game reference from time to time, no necessarily clues but NPC could mention Raxxla or the Dark Wheel in station/settlement bars or concourses discussions.
I've heard some pieces of information this way, but never a thing (oral or written) about Raxxla/TDW.
Speaking of which that totally makes me want to hang around in Shinrarta Dezhra and listen to NPC's
