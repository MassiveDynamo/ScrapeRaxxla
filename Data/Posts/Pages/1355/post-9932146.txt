It is a guarantee that if ever "Raxxla" is found .... It will be a downer... could never live up to expectations. This however in my estimation would be far better than some random Icy Rock turning out to be "Raxxla"... Though ya I would much rather find the Dark Wheel station first ... and follow some sort of logical path than have a swirlly thing out past Barnards Loop be it.
Indeed. Something I've said in the past on this thread is that should Raxxla ever be found, FD probably shouldn't acknowledge that it is in fact the Raxxla that they intended. I think the Raxxla of Legend is more compelling and interesting than anything it could actually be.

If it is found, many people might be satisfied that it is Raxxla, but disappointed in the result, but as long as it isn't officially acknowledged, enough people will be convinced it was a red herring and the search will continue.
