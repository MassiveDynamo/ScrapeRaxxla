I still think following the events of the original story that came with elite might be worth a crack. I know he traded lavian brandy and stuff and went to exact planets. They are probably all in game. Did somebody try that or not. I don't remember. I wonder if rank matters. At some points we know he was below a certain combat rank.

I just re-read it fast ... ha-ha, just recalled story with me week ago - was charging from star too close, near overheating and pirate interdicted me but I had time for 1-2 turns well ... he never came back - I think burned - same as in novel. But I had to start away using heat sinks too.
