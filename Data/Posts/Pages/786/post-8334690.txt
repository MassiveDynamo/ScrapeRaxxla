Hm..imagined new (old?) idea ...
We know for sure game can track cargo. So what if toast points to what/where to buy RARE goods ? Then once you have it on board and, lets say, docking Jameson Mem, you get quest from DW?

For example, "mother of all galaxies" can be "Lave" ...as it was start point for all galaxies in old elite and it sells brandy (toast?).
