can anyone tell me the closest guard system from Sol? how many light years?
It's about 10 jumps on jumpaconda to all different sites. So it is 700-1000 ly.
However there is megaship flying there from imperial region and outpost deep there (no large ships), i think Zion or Zeost something like that in bubble.
