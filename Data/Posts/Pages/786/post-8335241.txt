I still think following the events of the original story that came with elite might be worth a crack. I know he traded lavian brandy and stuff and went to exact planets. They are probably all in game. Did somebody try that or not. I don't remember. I wonder if rank matters. At some points we know he was below a certain combat rank.
They're not ive already tried. No tionisla orbital cemetery in game. Just a tourist beacon that offers clues to the formadine rift mystery
