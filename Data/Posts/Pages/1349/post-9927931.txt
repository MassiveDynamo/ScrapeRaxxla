If you want a large/bright star then go to LAWD26. Iâ€™ve pointed out several times that this is a Wolf Rayet star only 26 ly from Sol and totally out of place in the game. IRL I think the nearest WR to Sol is Gamma Velorum (~1100 ly and still visible to the naked eye, WR are that bright!), which is supposedly the home of the Guardians (TBD!). IRL if LAWD26 was a WR it would outshine our own sun!! Since David Braben is supposedly keen on astronomy & accuracy this discrepancy is glaring!! (Pun intended!! )

But Ive fruitlessly searched it several times and also checked for comets.
