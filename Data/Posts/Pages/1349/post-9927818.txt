Regards Trinkets, see my post a few pages back, I’ve had some information and edited the post, which confirms they are simply a ‘curiosity’ and nothing more, the ‘story’ they were linked to is ‘inactive’.

Of course this doesn’t rule out such an asset doesn’t have some relevance, eg within the context of ‘Fortuna’ relating to ‘eyes to see’ but technically it currently is an idle asset - based upon my interpretation.
