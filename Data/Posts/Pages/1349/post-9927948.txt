Details please!!
That sounds like the Rogue Planet bodytype from the journal spec. Youâ€™ve actually found one??
It is where the thargoid mothership willl be shortly

-- but I mean the point in Tau Ceti that is orbited by a station (pepole say its a comit) has a hyperbolic orbit. If you look at the station it gives orbital information for orbiting a point in space but the station will move up past the other planets right next to the star then way out again. -- I was trying to calculate lagrange points once I just moved on idk.
