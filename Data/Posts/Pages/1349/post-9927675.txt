I was thinking it is about NS/white dwarfs. Some of them were unusual shiny when jump to it too. However, current animation shows bright stars for anything.

Btw..while we're on it. Closest to bubble NS "beacon" is fake star (meaning it is absent in real Milky Way). Could it be part of RAXXLA puzzle then?
