But weren't they somehow linked to Salomé? She was a lore NPC..
True, and Drew Wagar’s character creation (his Elite authorised books Reclamation and Premonition are good reads, and give some lore to flesh out the game). But Drew confirmed several times he knew nothing about Raxxla, other than DB had confirmed to him that it is in-game. So COR are likely a role playing leftover, and it seems to be getting more obvious that TDW faction in-game may also be a red herring. I suspect that TDW (including SAP8 & Trinkets) were part of the “Raxxla storyline” that MB mentioned, but it may have been dropped on his departure, or perhaps he left because it had been dropped?
