Well not an NPC as such. Salomé was a "sort of" official lore based player character played by Drew Wagar as part of his tie in novels. Heavily involved in the Formadine Rift stuff. Although, during one one game event, she gave out that little tidbit about the first known mention of Raxxla on record. Supposedly, that was meant be official lore, but there were tensions between Drew and FDEV at times over retcons to work he'd done for them, so I'm not 100% certain how official that statement is anymore.
Greetings stranger! good to see you back in the thread again! Thought you’d abandoned us after DW2 for journeys around the outer rim (of the galaxy)
