Sorry, but Hexedit is specific to Drew Wagar's tales, and by his own admission Drew is in the dark about Raxxla in ED, so it probably not safe to assume they are associated. I dont think we have any evidence from the lore or in game that Hexedit relates to Raxxla.
Spoken like a true Club member. We all know the power of Hexedit! I suspect all connections of Hexedit and Raxxla were Hexedited - And thus there wouldnt be any ... even if there were....@#$%^@*@%^&@#!@# ..... wait what was I talking about?... Darn I was just Hexedited!!
