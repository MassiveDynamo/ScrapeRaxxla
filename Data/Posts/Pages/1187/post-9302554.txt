True, but the name Guardian sounds a lot like what she was describing. Some sort of guardians over the galaxy.


Yes, absolutly. Been doing research about that for some time now. Trying to see if the puzzle-pieces fit together. But this sounds more like the Construct, doesn't it? Either that or indeed, the guardians somehow locked themselfs in the monolith network. Maybe they are trying to contact us true those visions, hoping to be set free? I guess time will tell.
I think she communicated with the Caretakers, and that they showed her a vision of the Guardians and their society of the past. Not a 100% sure, but that's the way I read it.

The guardian logs tells of the accelerated evolution of the individuals with construct implants. Given a few million years the AI may have completely merged with their host, to form a new species that can exist independent of both a body and the monolith network.

Perhaps MB was researching them, when he wrote this: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/is-vacuum-based-life-possible.176750/#post-2723790
