True, but the name Guardian sounds a lot like what she was describing. Some sort of guardians over the galaxy.


Yes, absolutly. Been doing research about that for some time now. Trying to see if the puzzle-pieces fit together. But this sounds more like the Construct, doesn't it? Either that or indeed, the guardians somehow locked themselfs in the monolith network. Maybe they are trying to contact us true those visions, hoping to be set free? I guess time will tell.
We talked about it a lot in the thread at one point.

SagI covered it, but made a complete balls up and frankly misrepresented it.

Here’s my letter to the editors about it all:

Post in thread 'OUT NOW: Sagittarius Eye Issue #10 (Get Your Copy Today)!'
https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ue-10-get-your-copy-today.432774/post-6790869

It’s obviously written in response to the SagI article, but it still covers the main points.
