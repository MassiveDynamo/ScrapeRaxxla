Ok. So I came up with a thought earlier today. If anything is off then please feel free to correct. Hexedit and raxxla are supposedly related, right? So hexeditors are color editors as everyone knows. So what if we change the colors on the raxxla logo with like a zero tolerance fill. Perhaps it will reveal a mesagae or something. Again, just a newbie spitballing here.
