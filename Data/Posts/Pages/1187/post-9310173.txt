Uf cors hexedit an Raxxla r related! Hex meens six, an their are six sydes in the Raxxla logo...so proovin bee yond any dowt guv!!!

But there are six moons of Saturn in the game! The only one of Sol’s with six moons. Mmmmm ....
Still pursuing 2001 Space Odyssey potential link. Spent ages looking in craters on Iapetus. Nothing so far!
Oh, and omphalos means “navel” hence the crater search, specifically for craters with central peaks because they often look like the conical omphalos stone in Greek myth.
Also unsuccessfully tried to approach Saturn’s poles, no hexagonal storm shown which in itself is surprising as it was known well before game release.
