Quick question, and forgive me if I missed it in that very big summary - has "The Dark Wheel" faction ever won control over the Shinrarta system? I'm assuming Shinrarta follows the same BGS rules as other systems. I just wonder if The Dark Wheel has to "come to power" in order for "things to happen". If nothing else, it would be a fun project for BGS players!

People have tried to get the Dark Wheel to take over ShinDez, but this system seems specially hardcoded to always be controlled by the Pilots Federation.
Even if TDW gets past 50% the system won't go into conflict.

Until recently, this also meant that TDW could never enter 'expansion' state and expand out of the system, but recent changes to the BGS have allowed them to leave for the first time.
