Here's a thought. "The search for Raxxla has been compared to the search for Atlantis, El Dorado and the Kingdom of Prester John".

- Atlantis is a system
- El Dorado is not a system
- Prester John is not a system (closest match: Preston's Star)

Dorado, however IS a whole constellation in the southern hemisphere.
The origin of the name is not related to 'El Dorado', the lost city of gold, but still... nearly all of it's stars are in Elite Dangerous.
It was "discovered" (by white people, at least) in 1592 or so.
Isn't that right around the time that godawful poem Astrophel and Stella was written (1580)?
I doubt our homeboy Pip Sydney was aware of it though, what with his head being so far up a dark region of its own.

Another fun fact about Dorado; It's the star region containing the Large Magellanic Cloud .

Anything interesting about the LMC? Oh, not much, except...
It's one of the Satellite Galaxies of the Milky Way
It's classified as a Magellanic Spiral galaxy; the only spiral galaxy out of all the Milky Way satellites
It's the 4th-largest galaxy in our local group, behind Andromeda, the Milky Way and Triangulum
It's the biggest thing visible in the skybox/galaxy map in Elite
It contains one of the most luminous stars known... S Doradus
S Doradus is in M119, an unusual spiral formation nebula within the LMC
Some of the stars in the LMC are actually closer to Sol than Sag A* (though there's no way to get there across the void).

Dorado is represented as a Dolphinfish (Dorado is the Portuguese word for such a fish), and also (incorrectly) as a swordfish or goldfish.
If it were to have a "brow", that'd probaby be Zeta Doradus (I checked it, no planets), but calling a fish the mother of all galaxies is kind of a stretch.
I guess you could imagine the fish as a female, "laying" the eggs of the LMC if you like thinking about that kind of imagery.

Most of Dorado's stars are close to the bubble. The rest are 160k ly away, outside the galaxy.
Yes, as soon as this idea occurred to me I made a beeline straight for 'Lambda Doradus' ("L Dorado") but I didn't find anything.

Here's a list of Dorado's stars, from brightest to dimmest:
I had a look at some of these systems already.

HR 1227 > (HD 24863) A4
HR 1540 > (HD 30610) Checked, K0 (Giant), M8, USS, no terraformable, no gas giants
XY Doradus > ?? not found
XZ Doradus > ?? not found
AB Doradus > ?? not found
HIP 20606 > (HD 28254) G5, planet
HIP 21850 > (HD 30177) G8, planet
WASP-62 > F7, planet, 1100 ly
RW Doradus > K5, K5
Ptah > (Gliese 163, HIP 19394) Checked, Federation, 1 Gas Giant (no moons), no terraformable, already mapped
BB Doradus > (Multiple names, all not found)
S Doradus > (Multiple names, in N119 Spiral Nebula 160k ly away)
AA Doradus > ?? not found

Downside to this theory: I only found a couple Red Dwarf/Red Giant stars in the list.
I checked both, and neither were very dark; not good candidates for the dark wheel codex picture.

Here's another weird tidbit I noticed when I went to sell my exploration data at Delphi.
The Oracle has a lot of facilities, but no Universal Cartographics. Universal Cartographics used to be Omphalos Infotech.
So there is no Omphalos at the Oracle of Delphi. You can sell at Donar's Oak in the same system though.
