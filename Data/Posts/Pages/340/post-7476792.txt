Well I wanted be quiet but ... yes there are many possibilities when we know code but no idea about meaning. Some sectors have "RA-X" in system name - for example Praea Euq RA-X b15-0. I'm using check AA-A hx (where x is number) systems for wolf rayet and other rare stars. There is logic behind naming systems (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-the-system-name-reveals-the-main-star-mostly). Is something uncommon for systems named RA-X? Is it worth of effort to try find some RA-X hx because hx contains special stars often and we all know Raxxla is very special ( haha maybe really rogue planet or rogue (intergalactic) star ) ?

There are several systems with ......ra XX-L A in the name.
romilau have checked most of them. Itâ€™s all documeted in this thread.
