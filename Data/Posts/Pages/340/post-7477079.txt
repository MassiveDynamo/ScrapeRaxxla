+rep for making me laugh with that marvellously comically constructed sentence




Yeah, that has been puzzling me for a while too. It seems bizarre that a huge Orbis station wouldn’t have a UC post.

I’m sure it hasn’t escaped everyone’s notice that Delphi was the location of the Oracle in Greece, considered to be the centre of the world, and also the location of the Omphalos of Delphi, a stone monument marking that site. Zeus was said to have sent two eagles flying from the Eastern and Western ends of the earth, and where they met was Delphi - the centre of Zeus’s mother, Gaia.

So the fact that there is a missing Omphalos (in this case, UC, neé Omphalos Infotech) from the centre of the Oracle at Delphi where they really should be one, is a bit of a mysterious circumstance..

Makes sense in a mythological sense, why look around when the god knows where everything is at. In this case why need a Universal Cartographic when it knows everything is at. Could be on purpose or a hat tip to the myth itself. Or it doesn't need one as itself is the center of everything.
