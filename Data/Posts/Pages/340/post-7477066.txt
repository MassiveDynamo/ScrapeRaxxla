I doubt our homeboy Pip Sydney was aware of it though, what with his head being so far up a dark region of its own.

+rep for making me laugh with that marvellously comically constructed sentence

Here's another weird tidbit I noticed when I went to sell my exploration data at Delphi.
The Oracle has a lot of facilities, but no Universal Cartographics. Universal Cartographics used to be Omphalos Infotech.
So there is no Omphalos at the Oracle of Delphi. You can sell at Donar's Oak in the same system though.

Yeah, that has been puzzling me for a while too. It seems bizarre that a huge Orbis station wouldn’t have a UC post.

I’m sure it hasn’t escaped everyone’s notice that Delphi was the location of the Oracle in Greece, considered to be the centre of the world, and also the location of the Omphalos of Delphi, a stone monument marking that site. Zeus was said to have sent two eagles flying from the Eastern and Western ends of the earth, and where they met was Delphi - the centre of Zeus’s mother, Gaia.

So the fact that there is a missing Omphalos (in this case, UC, neé Omphalos Infotech) from the centre of the Oracle at Delphi where they really should be one, is a bit of a mysterious circumstance..
