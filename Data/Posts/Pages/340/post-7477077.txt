Quick question, and forgive me if I missed it in that very big summary - has "The Dark Wheel" faction ever won control over the Shinrarta system? I'm assuming Shinrarta follows the same BGS rules as other systems. I just wonder if The Dark Wheel has to "come to power" in order for "things to happen". If nothing else, it would be a fun project for BGS players!
