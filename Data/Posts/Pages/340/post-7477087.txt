Quick question, and forgive me if I missed it in that very big summary - has "The Dark Wheel" faction ever won control over the Shinrarta system? I'm assuming Shinrarta follows the same BGS rules as other systems. I just wonder if The Dark Wheel has to "come to power" in order for "things to happen". If nothing else, it would be a fun project for BGS players!

Well Lore wise they are just people using the name but they use the word "think" in the sentence. The Dark Wheel ( real one) probably leaves them alone due to the fact (imo and view) is a high populated station. While the others that try to claim the name disappear.
