The book was investigated, with the only real hard to get book of the same title by a women named Burnell.
1. The book
We purchased the book from Amazon [1] and read through it. The clue in the codex is "for those with eyes to see" so we relied on the pictures. There were three pictures or pulsar 1.a PSR B1509-58 (hand of god), Circinus Pulsar
1.c PSR B0355+54 (so far not found in the game)
The Hand of God pulsar is heavily traveled and at a distance of 17k Ly we have not made the travel yet.


Investigating locations with 'Burnell' in the name
We have visited at least three of these locations but there doesn't appear to be any correlation with Burnell or any people or projects she was associated with. There is apparently no pattern to the location of the stations other than each station is 10-15ly further than the next station. We are currently not pursuing any leads based on the station names. Stations are listed in the image attached to this article.
