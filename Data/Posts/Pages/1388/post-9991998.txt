Just because it's in Sol, it seems special.

But if you search eddb for installations with Delphi as their 1st word, there is a long list. That's just because it's in the dictionary list for installation names. Same for the 2nd and 3rd words too.

It's just the same as getting freaked out by rolling 3 sixes, but it's no more unlikely than any other combination - just humans that think its special..

Not really. We're trying to find significant correlation between a large number of different "clues" each of which could have different meanings - but presumably only one configuration is correct.

Just like doing real history research, you don't find one document and build a thesis around it, you look for corroboration, and also things that dont fit, as you try different arrangements of ideas and facts to build something that's a "best fit" given what you have to work with.

Highlighting specific things here to each other is a way of doing just that, it's saying, "hey there's a few things here that seem significant, let's investigate".

If you disagree that something is relevant, or want to suggest new ideas, that's what it's all about
