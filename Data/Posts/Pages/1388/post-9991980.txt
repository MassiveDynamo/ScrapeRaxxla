Just because it's in Sol, it seems special.

But if you search eddb for installations with Delphi as their 1st word, there is a long list. That's just because it's in the dictionary list for installation names. Same for the 2nd and 3rd words too.

It's just the same as getting freaked out by rolling 3 sixes, but it's no more unlikely than any other combination - just humans that think its special...
Isn't that one due to AEGIS Core being based out of Sol (GalNet refererenced the move even)? Actually, unless we REALLY don't understand orbital installations this is probably unconnected. There are tons of these orbital installations containing the word Delphi. This could, though, be bad if the Stargoids go, "That's a mighty fine planet you got there. It would be ashamed if something happened to it..."
