The problem with Sol is unnamed gas giant. That has always been the stumbling block if TDW is guarding their hidden treasure. Shinrarta Dezra on the other hand has unnamed gas giants with correct amount of moons.
That's a good point but does it mean literally an unnamed gas giant ie one with no name or just because they never gave the name of it, if you get my drift.
