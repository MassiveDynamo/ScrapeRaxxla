This is 2รท2=5.

Just because it's in Sol, it seems special.

But if you search eddb for installations with Delphi as their 1st word, there is a long list. That's just because it's in the dictionary list for installation names. Same for the 2nd and 3rd words too.

It's just the same as getting freaked out by rolling 3 sixes, but it's no more unlikely than any other combination - just humans that think its special...
