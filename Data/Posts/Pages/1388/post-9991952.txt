Sounds like an interesting one.

Probably OT for this thread, but something that I think is an interesting topic with regard to Aliens in ED is the concept of a homeworld. In ED, humanity has been an interstellar civilisation for just over 1,000 years, and while the species has an original homeworld, the homeworld for most of the human population of the galaxy isn't Earth. If Earth was to be destroyed it would be a tragedy, but the impact on the civilisation as whole would be far from critical, and for many it would make little practical difference to their day to day lives. Yet when it comes to other civilisations many still treat them as though there will be a singular homeworld, the discovery of which will be of huge significance, whether for trade, science, or military strategy.

The Guardians are one thing as they appear to have existed as an interstellar civilisation on timescales similar to that of humanity (I'm talking about the main Guardian civilisation that went extinct here, not offshoots or descendants, obviously.).

The Thargoids on the other hand have been an interstellar (and possibly intergalactic or even interdimensional) civilisation for at least several million years. For a civilisation of that nature, the question is not just whether they have a singular homeworld, but whether they even still have the concept of their having one.

The follow on from that is that if the homeworld is a concept which humanity tries to use as a framework for dealing with an alien civilisation which no longer has the concept, what mistakes in interacting with them would it lead to.

Very good point.

Asimov explores this concept in the Robots series. The Galactic Empire of his works only happens because Earth is destroyed, freeing humanity from a nostalgic chain to their origins and past.
