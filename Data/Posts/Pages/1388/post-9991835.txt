Really? I did not know that, I've always had it cos of being a kickstarter. That's very interesting
Per Pilots' Federation Secrecy beacon in Shinrarta Dezra:

Much of what the Pilots' Federation does revolves around secrecy; and this has many layers. Within the Pilots' Federation, the Elite Federation of Pilots is even more mysterious and secretive, and at the centre of that is the elusive 'Founders World'. It is the only system directly controlled by the EFP, and even its location is closely guarded. The secrecy is maintained by the EFP using 'misinformation' - there are a great many rumours of its rough location - and they all contradict each other. Only a select few - the members of the EFP - know the truth. The system is governed by the EFP and it is here that the organisation's headquarters is based. EFP members are allowed to retire here in relative anonymity.

This practically screams that something really important is hidden deep in Shinrarta Dezra. By the way, Shinrarta Dezra isn't that terribly far from Lave. Does Jameson Memorial look different somehow from other Coriolis stations? Is it Vetitice where the Coriolis is first designed? The first full scale one is built in Lave. But a prototype was designed in another system. Not saying there isn't another station buried deep in Shinrarta Dezra. Just wondering out loud.
