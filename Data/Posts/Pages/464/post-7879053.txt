I'm allied there now (was meaning to pick up the permit as part of my collection) and there doesnt seem to be much special about it. The greeting is amusing, something like ' we sang for you at evensong' etc. but I asume most people get this message if allied.

Anything to look out for? I notice that Hutton Truckers control the Coriolis, which is a bling type with parks with statues - very smart, but nothing to buy there.. The planetary outposts belong to the sublime order - but nothing very interesting.

Old lore for Van Maan's star include a short story about them called 'On the wrong side of the law' by David Massey in which a ship with passengers is dropped out of hyperspace into Van Maan's system which is run by a strict sect - different name to the sublime order though. This is part of 'Tales from the frontier' - google is your friend

Good work, thanks @yelboc !

I think I will still have a nose when I get back from this long range DW mission though. Look at the list of systems and compare it to Galaxy Map...
