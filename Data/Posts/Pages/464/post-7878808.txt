But this is a hypothesis as to how Raxxla may be instantiated, so is worth spelling correctly.

And speaking of instantiation, does any old FRifter remember how the PC glitch was resolved when the Dynasty bases were found? I remember the PC crashed & something about the bases not being properly instantiated. Did it need a game update to resolve? My memory is hazy (old age, lavian brandy....)
Maybe we shouldn't. Look at how DW refer to it. All variations on "the planet that shell not be named"
