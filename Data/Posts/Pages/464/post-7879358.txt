I'm coming back to the Bubble from Colonia for "The Enclave" and since the opening CG is for exploration data, I'm fully FSS'ing every system along the way. Yesterday, I hit a gas giant that had eight moons 250k away from jump in point. Of course, I had to fly out. I probe it and nearly fell out out of my chair. But the surface signal spelled "Human" wrong. The fumaroles were pretty, though.

Alas, carry on.
