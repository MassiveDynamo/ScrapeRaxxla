I did miss it, lost in your wall of text
Ha ha ha, yeah, it was a bit of a long post! For what it's worth, it was 'a , can't believe this is going to have to be sorted out again' moment with GV/Regor and the Guardian homeworld. - so thought I'd better try and do it comprehensively!

Edit - ‘what are you doing’ is not what I typed! Nor is it what’s there when I’m editing! Forum must be doing a little bit of translation - and getting it wrong. The original is an expression of exasperation, not directed at anyone in particular, 3 letters, all capitals, one letter changed from FSS.
