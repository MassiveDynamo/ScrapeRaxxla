I'm coming back to the Bubble from Colonia for "The Enclave" and since the opening CG is for exploration data, I'm fully FSS'ing every system along the way. Yesterday, I hit a gas giant that had eight moons 250k away from jump in point. Of course, I had to fly out. I probe it and nearly fell out out of my chair. But the surface signal spelled "Human" wrong. The fumaroles were pretty, though.

Alas, carry on.
Ha ha ha!

On another note, what AEGIS are setting out to do is going to be an utter disaster for humanity. It's a short term knee-jerk response to commercial pressures, and all of humanity is going to pay the price if AEGIS succeed.
