But this is a hypothesis as to how Raxxla may be instantiated, so is worth spelling correctly.

And speaking of instantiation, does any old FRifter remember how the PC glitch was resolved when the Dynasty bases were found? I remember the PC crashed & something about the bases not being properly instantiated. Did it need a game update to resolve? My memory is hazy (old age, lavian brandy....)
Yes, it needed a client update to fix (2.2.03 iirc). This took some time - months - and nearly derailed the plot line, requiring some extra hints to the location of the Zurara to help things be solved 'in time'. I think this minor update was also when military compartments were added, along with some other tweaks and balances.
