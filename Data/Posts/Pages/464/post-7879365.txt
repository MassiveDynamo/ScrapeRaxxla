Well quite, and I did say 'GV/Regor' earlier in the post when describing its relation to the Region Permit Lock.

It wouldn't make much sense for there to be a decision to make a Regor sector and then locating it around Regor being a secondary consideration, so I'm going to make an educated guess that that's not what you were saying and you'd missed my mention of GV being Regor and were just pointing it out!

Edit - just for absolute clarity, I meant there's reasons why a permit lock area would be put up around GV / Regor.

I did miss it, lost in your wall of text
