so, im wondering if anyone is any good at, or knows a place I can, triangulate a star system based on 3 other systems.

So for example, I have 3 known points in space, they make a near perfect equalateral triangle in space, but a rather large one, on an angle, not just on the galactic plane. I want to figure out exactly which system is as close to dead center from all 3 points as possible.

Ive had a therory for several days but have not been able to come up with a system or group of systems to check because im having difficulty finding a center point....
