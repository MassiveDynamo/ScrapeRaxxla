If they are the same things viewed from two different systems it should be possible to triangulate their position? Or at least to estimate their distance.

Edit: Already considered. Never mind...
I've tried to make something out of it, without success. I have no idea if there even is a direction in the system map?
If it's a distance thing, it's closer to SOI than Deneb.

SOI is interestingly at almost exactly RA 20h (Right ascension: 20h 0m 14.621s / Declination: 35Â° 20'26.916''). One of it's 'clouds' is dead center, in the horisontal direction. That might mean something?

I would love to find a third system, out in the same region.
