well if anyone wants to help me, lol...

I was looking at these three systems; Maia - Polaris - Zeta Cassiopea
They make a near perfect triangle on the galmap...

Zeta Cass being the jewel from the story, Maia I cant remember of the top of my head why now lol, and Polaris being permit locked for no reason what so ever, just feels like its a beacon or somthing. Anyways... if I can narrow down some systems in the reight area, i want to give them a look...
I've pretty much come too think Raxxla is not inside the bubble, because i remember somewhere reading that the real Dark Wheel station was supposed to be in a system "far from civilization, far enough to be considered of no value", now yes that could just mean, a place like the voyager craft, out in the middle of nowhere inside a system, but i think it more likely means the system itself is far enough away 99% of people would consider it worthless to bother going there for any reason.
