And seem to remember DB said ED was the first time Raxxla had been placed in-game, though cant remember the source. Would be worth adding to the OP references list if anyone has it.
Public FD Raxxla statements:
DB:Does Raxxla exist?
MB:Positive confirmation for Raxxla in the Milky way - DJTruthsayer lore interview with Michael Brookes
DW:Raxxla exists and we know where it is
DW:Raxxla exists, we know where it is, and why people haven't been able to find it...
