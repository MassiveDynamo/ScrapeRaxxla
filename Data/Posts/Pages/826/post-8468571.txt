Just watched video, psychologist was showing brain illusions which lead to believes & tin foils.
Damn, I saw something. That he started to explain what I should see, I like "oh hell, he is right, now i see it", then he said - "it's all wrong, proper is " and named what I saw initially.
...seems like I have some sort of immunity to theories. Question is does it help or not to find raxxla?
