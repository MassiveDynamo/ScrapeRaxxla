The only two systems I have found them consistently are Alpha Cygni(Deneb) and Star of India. There are two of them in each system. In Deneb they are quite close to each other, in the bottom right part of the map. In SOI there is one center / top of the star (it's behind the star unless the sysmap is zoomed out a bit) and one low left.

It takes about a minute in the map before they start to show.
If they are the same things viewed from two different systems it should be possible to triangulate their position? Or at least to estimate their distance.

Edit: Already considered. Never mind...
