im trying to use the pricipals for Stargate Travel, using 6 points in space to find a star system, but do it with only 3, it wont be as accurate, but it allows me to try mulptiple theories ive had about possible locations for Raxxla.... most of them require some form of use of this...

For example the sound map thatshows those two star systems, and the thargoid items, I believe requires using a distance calculation and the two systems shown, to find a third system...

all theories of course, but Im willing to give them a shot and track them down...
I've already got Elite Trade and Explorer Status, lol, so I have no issues running around the universe on the hunt, lol
