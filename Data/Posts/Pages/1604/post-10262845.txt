Based on this assessment I don’t believe we should look too deeply into how ED looks, what is / isn’t in game.

It’s very evident there is a great deal in game we can’t see, because either it’s broken or unfinished since launch.
I still think given the Antares, Starship One, and that every last ship manufacturer uses the Saud Kruger Astrogation Console, it may be worth taking a Beluga Liner and doing passenger missions from Titan City (given it is the furthest starport). Even then, with one of them being an Ocellus the soonest it could be in place was 3260 (Ocellus are the newest starports). Tour of Universe has a very notable temporal anomaly and has stargates (with some in Sol) in addition to a liner very much resembling a Narwhal Liner.

Dark Wheel were noted for investigation of temporal anomalies and parallel worlds.
