Very interesting rationale. I think there's a lot of big questions overlooked by our community.

Why would Guardians be named this way by the writters, what are they guarding?
After exterminating the Guardians, what did their AI do/where did it go?
Why are we "unable" to jump into the Regor Sector/Hen 2-333?

This doesn't seem to be a permit lock by the Pilot's Federation but rather a technical limitation:



I think a jump is necessary (thus a FSD) to reach their home systems because my squad has performed experiments trying to reach this sector and although we were able to get into the location, the game mechanics would not load the system itself.

The jumping anomaly is discussed here...
