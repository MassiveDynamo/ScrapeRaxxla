It’s easy.

You discovered X in game, but can’t actively engage with it. However there is no element in game to state X is inactive according to in game information it is active eg it’s go no lock upon it. It has not been logged via ticket as it cannot be identified as a bug. Please acknowledge if X is intentionally locked or if this is a bug. If X is not a bug, nor locked then evidently it’s accessible. What in game mechanics are advertised to access it.
I rest my case

And will use it as a template on my next ticket
