I wonder if anyone has asked support?
Honestly, I am beginning to wonder if Guardian Beacons cannot lock sectors. Those errors from the FSD aren't the garden-variety blocks. That said, given all the cross-roads gods and protectors of travelers, I am forced to believe we still may possess they way in if we understood. FDev has proven it is quite capable of having the "personal journey" be a mechanic unto itself (e.g. only certain CMDRs who participated in specific events are given follow-ups). Hecate was the "Kleidouchos" or "Keybearer", "Angelos" or Messenger, "Enodia" or "of the crossroads", and "Soteira" of "Savior / World Soul" amongst others. I think we are supposed to be our own savior.
