Good question!

View attachment 374508

I never actually knew that Gamma Velorum was the centre of the Regor Sector, that's cool

I have some questions:

1. Do we assume this is the Guardian home system, since it's a famous named star in the middle of the Regor Sector?

If so:

2. How could Guardians evolve in that system? The stars are too young from what I can tell??
Given the apparent connection to asymptotic giant branch stars of both Thargoids and Guardians (and the very real possibility they were fully developed technologically when humans were in caves), the assumption is they probably have had several homes and it rotates. This, though, might be the historical origin point. What you need to understand is this: this particular stellar evolution pathway cycles through main sequence several times before the star dies. Additionally, if these species started out before us it is entirely possible they evolved in a system with a massive star at the core of system - possibly much larger than 8 solar masses (perhaps a population II star). The other option is a very stable mid-mass M to G class which are much more stable. Humanity, had the benefit of a likely 3rd generation star (population I star). Asymptotic giant branch would necessitate moves once star gets hotter, bigger, or enters a period of instability.
