1. Do we assume this is the Guardian home system, since it's a famous named star in the middle of the Regor Sector?

2. How could Guardians evolve in that system? The stars are too young from what I can tell??
This is back to the question earlier about Wolf-Rayets - it can't plausibly be the Guardian home system itself: it's a famous named star because it's bright enough to be visible as one of the brighter stars in the Sol sky from over 1000 LY away, which means it's far too large and young.

Thinking about it, if the Guardian homeworld is anywhere near it, they got really "lucky" to be able to evolve, develop technology, spread into space, and finally wipe themselves out before the impending supernova of Gamma Velorum irradiated their biosphere.


(Fortunately for humanity, the Wolf-Rayet Gliese 293 B is fictional - it'd be visible during the day otherwise!)
