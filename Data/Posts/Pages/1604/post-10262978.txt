It's still working hours here, so I cannot check, but...

Is Regor itself (which, despite being in the Regor Sector and all, is called Gamma Velorum by GalMap) explicitly shown as permit locked?
Good question!



I never actually knew that Gamma Velorum was the centre of the Regor Sector, that's cool

I have some questions:

1. Do we assume this is the Guardian home system, since it's a famous named star in the middle of the Regor Sector?

If so:

2. How could Guardians evolve in that system? The stars are too young from what I can tell??
