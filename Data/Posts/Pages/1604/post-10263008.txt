That star is very, very real. It's LAWD 26 per SIMBAD and in-game (listed GJ 293). In-game the system is called LAWD 26 but the Wolf-rayet is Gliese 293 B. The reason it isn't visible in daylight is most emissions are ultraviolet instead of the visible light spectrum.

From Wikipedia on Wolf-Rayets:
All Wolf–Rayet stars are highly luminous objects due to their high temperatures—thousands of times the bolometric luminosity of the Sun (L☉) for the CSPNe, hundreds of thousands L☉ for the population I WR stars, to over a million L☉ for the WNh stars—although not exceptionally bright visually since most of their radiation output is in the ultraviolet.

The naked-eye stars Gamma Velorum and Theta Muscae, as well as one of the most massive known stars, R136a1 in 30 Doradus, are all Wolf–Rayet stars.

Just because you cannot see it, doesn't make it fictional. A gentle reminder...
