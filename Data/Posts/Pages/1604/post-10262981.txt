Very interesting rationale. I think there's a lot of big questions overlooked by our community.

Why would Guardians be named this way by the writters, what are they guarding?

From Ram Tah's original work on decoding the Monolith data we recovered:
Language 4: From the data packet you’ve discovered here I’ve gained a sense of a very cooperative society – one in which all elements worked in unison towards a common purpose. I also believe they shared an expectation of mutual protection. I’m still delving into these mysteries, but I believe ‘Guardians’ would be a good name for this species.
