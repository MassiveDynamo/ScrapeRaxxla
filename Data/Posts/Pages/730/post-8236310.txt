That's actually kinda cool a system with no star but unable to route to though the location exists. I recall something of people talking about systems with no stars or dead stars or something of that nature.

It's possible that the galaxy map could be bugged might wanna submit a ticket see if you can get this verified as a bug or as intended. If it's not a bug then it becomes a more interesting system from most we seen so far.
