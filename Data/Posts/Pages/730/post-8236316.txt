In front of bunkers door at Guardians structures. To me, it does not fit to what we usually see there.
Second layer is one of the reasons for my speculation on Guardians - Raxxla relation.

Right. For me I checked the doors with tne ramp in front. That was more thorough and there is nothing behind. Regardless I did do a free cam check for the rest of the GS, not as thorough as the door with ramps, but there shouldn't be anything. You can try again.
