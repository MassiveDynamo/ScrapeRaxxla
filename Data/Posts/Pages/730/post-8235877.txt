You are talking about Ancient Ruins or Guardian Structures? If Guardian Structures, I had checked recently and there are no hidden assets behind the doors currently. You can try again, maybe you can see something different.

In front of bunkers door at Guardians structures. To me, it does not fit to what we usually see there.
Second layer is one of the reasons for my speculation on Guardians - Raxxla relation.
