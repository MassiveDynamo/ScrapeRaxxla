Update on the HD 144218 star:
UGC 5944 (Galaxy)
UGC 5944 (Galaxy)
in-the-sky.org

The game goes to the same blank spot when entering:
HIP 78821
HD 144218

It's apparently 8-sco? If this is a major star why is it not there? Or is this a dim star?

Given that hutton orbital is the nearest star and whatnot. I'm starting to wonder if raxxla isn't literally the hutton orbital joke....
