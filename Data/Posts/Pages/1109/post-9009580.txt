That makes sense. In my travels the areas where it seemed to match most closely from spinward were the distant views from the Orion Dark Region, which isn't that far from Cone Nebula, for varying definitions of far. I'm just a couple of years behind the times and wanted to check it out myself (plus somewhere I have an image of the Pleiades from a video that looked very similar also, so still hanging on to the remote chance of that theory).

Did you or anyone else manage to get into NGC 2264 or Cone Nebula before they were locked down to check the views?
Galmap isn't locked down

I've spent quite a bit of time in the past trying to find a direction from which the view of BL provides a match for the Barnacle logo. No joy at the time, but I'd still suggest others give it a try.

AFAIK, no conclusive match for the Barnacle logo has ever been made. There's been quite a few 'it's X' type claims, but never personally seen one that's stood up to close examination.

Something worth considering though is that there is nothing to say that the logo is based on the same EM spectrum range that we see.
