Is that a dot dash I see in their latest social media (an A)? Are we going to get one letter a day now for ten days?

On first assessment there doesn’t seem to be anything here that looks ‘super weird’, but I’m only using basic filters and colour sliders on an IPhone.

There is however a full and very clear skybox image behind all of the front layer, it’s very clear and detailed I can even distinguish dust clouds and star colours, does it mean something? who knows.
