So, this is not the image I was going to use to illustrate my Thargoid ship design theory, but it illustrates that point plus what I was talking about with regard to the Milky Way often cutting across the view of Barnard's Loop et al (which I don't think happens when you look at it in the Galaxy Map BTW), as well as one or both of the Lesser and Greater Magellanic Clouds also being very close and in view. Neither of those, nor the Milky Way, appear in the Thargoid logos I believe, so if it does represent BL the viewing point needs to be further away - this only seems to happen once you are at a certain distance, and is less likely the further away you are, so the Cone Nebula hypothesis may still hold.

Note the small "standard" Nebula to the top right. The darker central core is very similar in shape to the Thargoid flower ships. I had another image where this or another similar nebula were backlit by the Milky Way, and in the centre of Barnard's Loop, and all that was visible because of that lighting was a very ethereal central core, and it took me quite some time to figure out exactly what I was looking at and for a second thought an Interceptor was in front of me. Was very cool, will find that image and post it here also. Just more supporting evidence perhaps for the links between Thargoids and nebulae generally.
