where's the best place to get a Guardian Ancient Key? I gather markets aren't trading them
Go to the system Zende and there is megaship transport service out to the area. Megaships Sadler's Song and The Conduit swap places on Thursday and will transport you to Synuefe EN-H d11-96. There are Guardian sites in the area where you can pick-up a Ancient Key. Would suggest using in-game codex for confirmed or reported locations of Guardian Beacons. Getting the key involves activation with a laser-based weapon. This is probably the easiest way to get an Ancient Key.
