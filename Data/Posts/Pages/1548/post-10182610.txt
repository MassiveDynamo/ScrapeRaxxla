What you call obfuscation is most likely just the huge amount of semi-random data, the is mixed in with the data that might have actuall meaning.

From an in game perspective, most systems are named by it’s early settlers, not an all knowing central body.
The same can be said for the RL galaxy generation. A «few» systems are named and placed manually. The rest are made by ‘the machine’. The machine uses lists(a lot of gods from all over the world in these lists) with different themes to name inhabited proc gen systems.

I did quite a bit of searching of the Egyptian Pantheon, back when Horizons came out. There were so many systems, planets and stations. The seemed so ordered. I was sure I was on to something.
It all ended up with nothing.
Just cos ya found nutin dont mean there aint nutin to be found!
