Never tried the luxury passenger path my self, but I think there is a lot of unknown info to gain from it.
Might be the best of all paths, at the moment.
I asked because, reading Wikipedia, Green & Black seem to have written a significant reference relevant to Ishtar mythology and I think that goddess is related to the puzzle. With the report of a crash dump attributing some Raxxla remark to a female passenger ....Green in Black might make sense!
