Perhaps more obfuscation? Since being convinced by @Rochester ’s graphical analysis of the tight spacing of the “Underworld” region I’ve got interested in the mythology around the Eleusinian mysteries, Demeter and Persephone’s journey into the Underworld. One thing that has struck me is the sheer amount of obfuscation MB put in. There’s the Mars Alien Artefact, that caused me to focus overlong on Sol (which also has station names that fit the toast), there are Persephones all over the place, including a Persephone station in Avalon, etc.
What you call obfuscation is most likely just the huge amount of semi-random data, the is mixed in with the data that might have actuall meaning.

From an in game perspective, most systems are named by it’s early settlers, not an all knowing central body.
The same can be said for the RL galaxy generation. A «few» systems are named and placed manually. The rest are made by ‘the machine’. The machine uses lists(a lot of gods from all over the world in these lists) with different themes to name inhabited proc gen systems.

I did quite a bit of searching of the Egyptian Pantheon, back when Horizons came out. There were so many systems, planets and stations. The seemed so ordered. I was sure I was on to something.
It all ended up with nothing.
