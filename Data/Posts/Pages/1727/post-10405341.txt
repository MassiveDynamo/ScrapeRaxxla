Yes.

Raxxla was created by Holdstock, not from Elite lore but Holdstock’s. It’s a repeated theme concerning lost realms or otherworldly Edens, and the original ‘a place that’s not a place a door which is also a key’ etc flows from these inspirations. Otherworld’s were liminal spaces opened by ethereal magical objects or ordinary natural doorways or barriers.

My suspicions are, that given the heavy references within the Codex identifying the dense fulcrum of systems all named after such mythical locations, that FD are honouring a large part about where and what Raxxla is by utilising Holdstock lore and or influences. It is not a new invention.

Granted it likely will be mixed with Lovercraft and Milton…elements all of which share similar themes and influences.

Any new text will hopefully provide some fresh perspective. Not necessarily towards understanding Raxxla, but how key players may have interpreted the source material. Or at most provide a fresh perspective lens to view such texts, which may / may not advocate certain repeating themes?

One may but hope.
