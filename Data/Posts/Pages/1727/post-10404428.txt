There are various systems in game which in my opinion could support Dante’s work.

But in my opinion these present a very obvious goal. It’s plausible, but although the two story’s are relatable and share many of the same inspirations, the ‘universes’ they are set in are very different.

I suspect there might be some cross over in game, as it does seem like the author has utilised various sources to build their own creation. Contextually this is not accurate, from an academic nor historical perspective, but creatively anything goes and that could be where this falls apart, because if as I suspect some segments of this story have been sidelined the ‘context’ is lost. I think that’s where the codex comes in, I see it more of an index or redux.

There is so much in game which may or may not be relevant, no one knows for sure. I presume the point of Raxxla is it will make sense of this all?

Odysseus as a tragic figure led astray by the allure of forbidden knowledge does tie up the Dark Wheel's toast and the Paradise Lost allusions neatly.

Something else I had in mind: assuming Raxxla is, or hosts, forbidden fruit, it might be a thing that leads to knowledge yet all superpowers agree on never unleashing upon humanity - I'd argue machine sentience fits that description very well.
It's also strongly associated with the Guardians (already prime suspects per Halsey's visions) and ultimately doomed their civilization...
