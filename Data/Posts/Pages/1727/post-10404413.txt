Wait a second - so Dante only had the Roman portrayals of Odysseus to go by, and thanks to Cicero's reimagining of the Sirens he was no longer moved by nostos, as in the Homerian original, but had very much a vagabond heart.
And some literary critics see him as an Adamic figure, led astray by his lust of knowledge to search beyond the limits set by God.

I've occasionally thought about the Divine Comedy as a possible inspiration, but never got around to investigate. At the same time, I was puzzled by the dissonance between the Dark Wheel's goals and their toast's Odyssey allusions - this explains it neatly.

Ya on a basic level I like it because it has Odysseus now as the explorer - not just trying to get home. He is out there looking for knowledge - the bit about Cicero and the Sirens is great! It definitely fits in with the Idea that the Sirens were associated with the music of the spheres and as such would have access to "forbidden knowledge".
