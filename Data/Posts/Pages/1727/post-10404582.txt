Well, hello there, my fellow Raxxlers! Back after a few years and it's so nice to see you all again and going strong. Also seeing you haven't found the almost-proverbial IT. Tsk tsk tsk...

Anyway, I got a challenge for y'all fine people:
Looking for an interesting system, Kepler-70 is the name given in 2011, in preexisting catalogues aka WISE J194525.47+410534.7, aka all of the ones below (SIMBAD).

UCAC2 46165657 KOI-55 TIC 184427882 Gaia DR3 2076819620539690880
Kepler-70 KPD 1943+4058 UCAC3 263-170867 Gaia DR2 2076819620539690880
KIC 5807616 2MASS J19452546+4105339 USNO-B1.0 1310-00349976

None of them are present in Galmap. Apparently it's around 3600 lys in the general direction of delta-Cygni and it has 2 planets as hot as F-STARS, results of a planetary mitosis. Mitosis, which is formed by the separation 2 ASTERS, ('member that no-good Astrophel chick?), in a structure strangely similar to an OMPHALOS. It almost looks like a RIFT. With an (unconfirmed) 3d planetary body between the first two. I wonder what we might find there, hmmm?

Also, we might be after a white-dwarf, since Elite time is about 1300 years later than 2011 and Kepler-70 is about to go pop.

Gimme a shout if you find its name, or a lil' credit if you find IT there.
