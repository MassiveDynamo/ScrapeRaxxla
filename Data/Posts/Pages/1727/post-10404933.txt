Well, hello there, my fellow Raxxlers! Back after a few years and it's so nice to see you all again and going strong. Also seeing you haven't found the almost-proverbial IT. Tsk tsk tsk...

Anyway, I got a challenge for y'all fine people:
Looking for an interesting system, Kepler-70 is the name given in 2011, in preexisting catalogues aka WISE J194525.47+410534.7, aka all of the ones below (SIMBAD).

UCAC2 46165657 KOI-55 TIC 184427882 Gaia DR3 2076819620539690880
Kepler-70 KPD 1943+4058 UCAC3 263-170867 Gaia DR2 2076819620539690880

None of them are present in Galmap. Apparently it's around 3600 lys in the general direction of delta-Cygni and it has 2 planets as hot as F-STARS, results of a planetary mitosis. Mitosis, which is formed by the separation 2 ASTERS, ('member that no-good Astrophel chick?), in a structure strangely similar to an OMPHALOS. It almost looks like a RIFT. With an (unconfirmed) 3d planetary body between the first two. I wonder what we might find there, hmmm?

Also, we might be after a white-dwarf, since Elite time is about 1300 years later than 2011 and Kepler-70 is about to go pop.

Gimme a shout if you find its name, or a lil' credit if you find IT there.

Good find. Even if it doesn't lead to any Raxxla clues, it would be an amazing system to visit if it exists. Theoretically the hottest known planet in the ED galaxy.
NASA has a great visualiser for it

I would initially speculate that it just wasn't generated by Stellar Forge, or the algorithm for calculating its future state and position meant that the system 'dropped off' the radar. However, given the special interest value of it I think it would be a great discovery. ED is famous for allegedly predicting the location of the Trappist 1 system, so who knows how many other planetary systems like it have been accurately predicted.

SPOILER: TINFOIL SHENANIGANS!




Another Titanomachia thought came up in my reading:
If Uranus imprisoned Gaia's children - the Hundred-Handed, and Cyclopes, in the Underworld, and they were guarded by the dragon Campe, then a comparison could be made here.

If my earlier idea that the Hundred Handed are ED's equivalent of Engineers - Humans. Then a further extrapolation could be:
If the Cyclopes are a race of skilled and powerful wall-builders and who crafted the lightning bolt for Zeus, then they could be an equivalent to the Guardian race.
The guardians created walls = shields to protect their settlements, and the bolt for zeus = lightning theme across the Guardian tech.
That leaves the dragon Campe. Described as a "jailor", she had the appearance of a female torso with a scaled, snaky sea monster below and was compared to Scylla (thus, a link to Milton's daughter of Satan - him being a figure who sought to overthrow the established power just like Zeus).

So from this perspective, it could be said that we Humans, along with our genetic cousins the Guardians, right now exist in the Underworld, which is being guarded by the serpent-like Thargoid "dragons" who monitor us and keep us imprisoned.

The theme of Legacy is uprising / revolt, and the Beaumont 'clue' within it alludes to this same idea so it does paint a strong theme for what we might see in the game. The question would be what represents Zeus as the figure that 'liberates' humanity and guardians from the dragon? and what power exists that needs to be overthrown - aka Cronus? Are plans afoot to reveal the elder race that created the Thargoids? - assuming we 'conquer' these Titan prison guards...

Are we the star-loving maidens? whose ancestry ('royal' blood) grants us a prophesised birthright to inherit the galaxy? thus we are trapped in a prison of spiralling stars by a paranoid authority who is fearful of our prophesised return?? Is the Omphalos akin to the Stone of Scone? Stone of Jacob? Lia FÃ¡il? the Arthurian 'stone' of Excalibur? thus a symbol of obtaining true inheritance of the galaxy? Is Raxxla the Key to our Salvation?

Speaking of Arthur, have there been any associations with Sir Kay? what if MB was making a play on words and it's - 'the door is the "kay"'
