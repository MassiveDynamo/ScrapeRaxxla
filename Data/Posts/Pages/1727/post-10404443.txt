I had mapped these previously but did not follow them up any further. Below I have tried to replicate your work, and maybe identify a few findings.

Many of the Titan names are actually replicated in game as named systems, bar two?

Cocijo ( 31.31 -52.62 19.03 )
Hadad ( 9.88 57.84 20.59 )
Taranis ( -52.53 18.47 -28.69 )
Thor ( 60.38 15.25 -9.25 )
Indra ( -60.66 -18.12 -7.50 )
Leigong. No associated system?
Oya. No associated system?
Rainjin ( 121.47 -68.87 -0.37 )

Here are the actual titan locations:
Cocijo = Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18
Hadad = HIP 30377
Taranis = Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6
Thor = Col 285 Sector IG-O c6-5
Indra = HIP 2056
Leigong = HIP 8887
Oya = Cephei Sector BV-Y B4
Rainjin = Pegasi Sector IH-U b3-3

Titan actual systems:
Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18 = ( 157.28 14.97 -103.87 )
HIP 30377 = ( 178.78 -81.72 -47.94 ) m
Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 = ( 88.44 -74.91 -122.00 )
Col 285 Sector IG-O c6-5 = ( 125.50 -169.75 -97.12 )
HIP 20567 = ( -2.81 -63.81 -162.44 )
HIP 8887 = ( -66.44 -144.41 -106.28 )
Cephei Sector BV-Y B4 = ( -97.81 44.31 -83.84 )
Pegasi Sector IH-U b3-3 = ( -147.56 -61.78 -27.50 )

All the titans (as we all already know) share a common naming meaning:

Cocijo = lightning
Hadad = storm and rain god
Taranis = thunder god
Thor = lightning, thunder, storms
Indra = lightning, weather, thunder, storms, rains
Leigong = thunder
Oya = wind, lightning and storms
Rainjin = thunder

The following image shows systems that share naming with Titans, overlaid with systems named after the older gods ‘deities’.



Assumptions: it’s possible the Titans naming are utilised to advertise these ‘storm’ systems and the wider cosmology eg the zone of chaos?

The following image shows the Titans linked to their namesake systems.



Assumptions: there does not seem to be any direct correlative pattern or relationships linking Titans with their namesake systems.

The following image shows all Titans linked together into two diamonds, in relation to their namesake systems.



Assumptions: these Titans would seem to encircle these namesake systems and or the general bubble but nothing is conclusive. A centroid may advocate a focal point.
