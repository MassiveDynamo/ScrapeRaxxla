Ok so I looked at the stargoids and a possible relationship to what we are seeing in the bubble. The way they are setup is almost like they are arcing around something - but not quite. I suppose there would be a mathematical way to do this but I played around with triangles and trial and error. I am not at the "center" but i think it is close to the area we are looking at. I put the lines (with distances) between Arcadian and each of the Stargoid Locations. Its no where near a perfect sphere but they do seem to pointing more in this area then say Sol.

I had mapped these previously but did not follow them up any further. Below I have tried to replicate your work, and maybe identify a few findings.

Many of the Titan names are actually replicated in game as named systems, bar two?

Cocijo ( 31.31 -52.62 19.03 )
Hadad ( 9.88 57.84 20.59 )
Taranis ( -52.53 18.47 -28.69 )
Thor ( 60.38 15.25 -9.25 )
Indra ( -60.66 -18.12 -7.50 )
Leigong. No associated system?
Oya. No associated system?
Rainjin ( 121.47 -68.87 -0.37 )

Here are the actual titan locations:
Cocijo = Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18
Hadad = HIP 30377
Taranis = Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6
Thor = Col 285 Sector IG-O c6-5
Indra = HIP 2056
Leigong = HIP 8887
Oya = Cephei Sector BV-Y B4
Rainjin = Pegasi Sector IH-U b3-3

Titan actual systems:
Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18 = ( 157.28 14.97 -103.87 )
HIP 30377 = ( 178.78 -81.72 -47.94 ) m
Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 = ( 88.44 -74.91 -122.00 )
Col 285 Sector IG-O c6-5 = ( 125.50 -169.75 -97.12 )
HIP 20567 = ( -2.81 -63.81 -162.44 )
HIP 8887 = ( -66.44 -144.41 -106.28 )
Cephei Sector BV-Y B4 = ( -97.81 44.31 -83.84 )
Pegasi Sector IH-U b3-3 = ( -147.56 -61.78 -27.50 )

All the titans (as we all already know) share a common naming meaning:

Cocijo = lightning
Hadad = storm and rain god
Taranis = thunder god
Thor = lightning, thunder, storms
Indra = lightning, weather, thunder, storms, rains
Leigong = thunder
Oya = wind, lightning and storms
Rainjin = thunder

The following image shows systems that share naming with Titans in yellow, overlaid with all the systems named after the older gods ‘deities’.



Assumptions: it’s possible the Titans naming are utilised to advertise these ‘storm’ systems and the wider cosmology eg the zone of chaos but there are only eight Titans where as the storm gods are more prevalent, they do not form any succinct pattern neither.

The following image shows the Titans linked to their namesake systems.



Assumptions: there does not seem to be any direct correlative pattern or relationships linking Titans with their namesake systems, there is no focal point nor common alignment cross over paths.

The following image shows all Titans linked together into two diamonds, in relation to their namesake systems.



Assumptions: these Titans would seem to be in a distinct pattern, each side although not precise is relatively the same distance, and their midpoints are similar. They would seem to encircle these namesake systems and or the general bubble but nothing is conclusive. A centroid may advocate a focal point but these diamonds are not uniform.

Assumptions: these Titans would seem to encircle these systems and or the general bubble but nothing is directly conclusive. Their pattern although distinct shows they don’t focus on one particular group of systems namely eg the zone of chaos nor the Lost Realms, their focal point looks to be just off here. A centroid may advocate a focal point but these diamonds are not uniform.

My older assessments still stand, I’ll attempt to access a better more mathematically accurate centroid…

Assumptions: Hypothetically one might roughly calculate the fulcrum of the Mealstroms, but as each ‘diamond’ is not equal it’s an unreliable theory.

Undertaking a very rough projection my investigation places this location somewhere upon the outer rim equator of the zone of Chaos aka the bubble of storm deities, very close to Mat Zemlya; Cocijo and Mamaragan but also Veroandi of the Norse Norns!
