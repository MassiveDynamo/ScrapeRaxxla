Also- Et in Arcadia? … Here there be Monsters…. Oh and the Myth of Grief… Hmmmm very sus

Edit-

Ok so theses are all themes identified as relating to the works of holdstock - the et in arcadia ego - is a reference to a lost world and probably where Holdstock got that idea for his “Lost Worlds”. These are themes explored by holdstock in his books…. Will be an interesting read.
