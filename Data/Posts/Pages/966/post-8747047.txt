Rafe said: 'Raxxla's no alien.'

That's a bit different than 'Raxxla's not alien.'

Rafe also says that Raxxla is a planet with an alien construct, on it.

"Branches they bore of that enchanted stem,
Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave
To each, but whoso did receive of them,
And taste, to him the gushing of the wave
Far, far away did seem to mourn and rave
On alien shores; and if his fellow spake,
His voice was thin, as voices from the grave;
And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake,
And music in his ears his beating heart did make."
