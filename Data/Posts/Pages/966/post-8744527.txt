I feel as though I’ve made a breakthrough. I’ve never been able to discern a system hidden in a Galnet article before but this time I found two articles, so far, that point to the same place. This isn’t Raxxla that I’m likely to find but instead perhaps the real Soontill. Hopefully finally discovering it will help zero in on Raxxla.
I’ll test this hypothesis and then update you all. It’s convoluted and I’d rather verify I’m not completely insane before I cause a goose chase.

Edit: If RNGeezus would bless me with a Thargoid Probe I’d have been able to get this show on the road already. Can’t catch a break for the life of me. Found one first try the last time.

Edit 2: Got the probe, sensor is easy but not sure if I should get link as well just to have all bases covered.

Edit 3: Hyperdicted lost probe en route to get sensor. I really didn’t think it would be this difficult to get the items I wanted to bring with me. Show time might not be tonight at this rate.
