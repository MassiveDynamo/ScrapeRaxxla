Concerning the wreckage in Facece. How can you tell it's been exploded? I mean, there could be other explanations, like crashing with an unidentified flying object or somesuch. Not talking about aliens of course, let's not jump into conclusions. Rafe said Raxxla's not alien remember? Maybe look at some satellite images or something, dunno.
