Concerning the wreckage in Facece. How can you tell it's been exploded? I mean, there could be other explanations, like crashing with an unidentified flying object or somesuch. Not talking about aliens of course, let's not jump into conclusions. Rafe said Raxxla's not alien remember? Maybe look at some satellite images or something, dunno.

Sorry, who said what about Raxxla? Reference please, let’s keep things organised!


Ah, Rafe as in Holdstock’s novel? Not a new FD employee called Rafe?

Thought Holdstock said its an alien gateway on a planet controlled by evil elite men (TDW implied)? But no problem, fairly sure FD have retconned it all!

Ah2: just checked. In Holdstock novella Rafe said “
Raxxla's no alien, Alex. It's a ghost world. A planet. A legend” meaning it’s not an alien named Raxxla.

“
Your father was chasing the mythical planet Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life . .
”

Mmmm, so it’s the Omphalos which is the alien gateway? Just been struck by the phonetic similarity between Omphalos and Oompa Loompa; forget the Argonautica, we should be referring to Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!
