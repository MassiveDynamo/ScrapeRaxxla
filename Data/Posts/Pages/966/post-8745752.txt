Strange event last night, may be normal or old but never seen it?

In Facece, theres a Capital Ship signal approx 0.5LS from the Star. Dropped in and it was all wreckage, another Capital Ship then 'warped' in just like in CZs. Green Military ships appeared and chatted:

OK Secure the perimeter, we have a job to do, lets do it.
You dont think its connected to.....after the recent events?

WHAT!?

Im 99.9% sure its gonna be an old tale to do with Thargoids.....and its just me linking it to Station explosions or Starship One conspiracy reveal so posting here first as you people deserve it if its new or save watiing a thread if its old. Its the first time ive ever seen NPC chatter thats meaningful (like the old military convoys used to with UAs), but what does / did it mean?

Does not look like Thargoid damage (no green gooey). Curious.
