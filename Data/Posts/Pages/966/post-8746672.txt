Sorry, who said what about Raxxla? Reference please, let’s keep things organised!


Ah, Rafe as in Holdstock’s novel? Not a new FD employee called Rafe?
Thought Holdstock said its an alien gateway on a planet controlled by evil men (TDW implied)? But no problem, fairly sure FD have retconned it all!
Rafe said: 'Raxxla's no alien.'

That's a bit different than 'Raxxla's not alien.'

Rafe also says that Raxxla is a planet with an alien construct, on it.
