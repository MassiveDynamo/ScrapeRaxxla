Ancient Greek references for the day ... The tale of Psamathe

SPOILER: THE SHORT STORY







Full story here:

https://www.theoi.com/Olympios/ApollonLoves.html#Psamathe

It has Omphalos, Apollo, Prinesses, Heros slaying dragons, Parents grief and lovers woe, even some Hecate connections though I didnt see any Sirens or that filthy Astrophel.
