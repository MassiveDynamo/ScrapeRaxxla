"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witch- space, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!"

There are three elements to the Dark Wheel toast:
The jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies
The whisperer in witch- space, the siren of the deepest void
The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts
To find anything located in 3 dimensional space you need three coordinates. X, Y and Z axis. I think that if we can figure out which systems are referred to in The Dark Wheel's toast then we'll potentially have the coordinates for The Dark Wheel's home system. Something along the lines of: X coordinate from System A plus Y coordinate from System B plus Z coordinate from System C equals the X, Y and Z coordinates to find the One True Dark Wheelâ„¢.
