Hey guys, I cam up with another theory yesterday night.
I see i has been searched to some extent, but probably not that much as far I can can tell.
Following mythology, the "mother of all galaxies" could be Andromeda (the goddess).
Now the galaxy Andromeda itself is of course unreachable, but not the constellation.
It has some very interesting stars to explore, most notably Alpheratz (Alpha Andromedae) and Mirach (Beta Andromedae).
Alpheratz marks Andromeda head. I thought that a neighbour star could be.. the brow. It is also a very bright star, located 97LY from Earth. We might want to take a look at the skybox from close to Earth, and see if a pattern around Alpheratz can look like a eye, a brow, or something similar.
And this star could well be.. Mirach. Another very bright red star giant (which seems to be depicted on the picture of The Dark Wheel codex entry), it lies 197LY from Earth only.
It is of course not clear if that could lead us to the ancient Dark Wheel operation base, if that base leads to Raxxla, or if it could be a trail to Raxxla itself.
What we look for could very well be hidden in an asteroid belt, so I would take a close look at them if any, and fly by each planet.
Lastly, Almach (Gamma Andromedae) is the third brightest star. No other reason to mention it.

Anyway, the Andromeda constellation seems the best bet to me.

I would have gone myself now but I'm currently 15 000 LY from SOL, and out for a few more weeks probably.
I'll take a look once I get back, of course feel free to take a look also that's why I publish this.. Happy Hunting!

EDIT : probably wrong for the Andromeda as mother of galaxies part, but can the daughter lead to the mother in some multi-stage riddle?
Tinfoil hat on!
