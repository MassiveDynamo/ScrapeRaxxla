Ive just checked. There are three comets in Tau Ceti, but no stations orbit one. Ive read somewhere that Avogadro Enterprise does, but as far as I can see that's incorrect - the galmap & orbital marker clearly show it orbiting planet 4. Tau Ceti 4, 5 & 6 due have highly inclined orbits compared to the ecliptic & are elliptical. Seem to remember circular orbit has ellipticity=0, eliptical orbits are between ) & 1, hyperbolic orbit has ellipticity =1; the latter would be a rogue & only a brief visitor to the system
Perhaps you're thinking of Pareco, where 6 stations orbit a comet, there is second comet in Pareco but a fair way out.
you have to actualy look at the stations distances. Look at the stations statistics. It is orbiting a point in space. -- It also crosses the other planets paths. -- If it is not orbiting a comit it may be orbting a LaGrange point.

EDIT: Its been year since I have been there. I see above someone says they poped some planets in to fix the issue.
