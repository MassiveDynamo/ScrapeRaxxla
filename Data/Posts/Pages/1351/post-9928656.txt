Well, all we know is that its in the galaxy, so 400,000,000 systems to search.
We hypothesise that its nearer to Sol, certainly within the human bubble, given the information in the codex and we assume that is (largely) truthful. So if the rumour was fairly quick to disseminate it must be within the range of Achenar (139 ly & founded only 4 years before the rumour first report), so around 10,000 systems within that range. Though some exploration trips might have forged out into the black beyond that range, say three times that range? So a lot more!
That’s ok. But we have never been told what we are looking for! We didnt even know that comets were in game until Michael Brookes told us. And we’ve only just, after 7 years, found a way to locate those!
Now we learn there is another type of object in the galaxy, the possibility of which we were unaware, in fact it seems to have been intentionally hidden from us...
I’m calling foul!

Though I agree the new object does look cool!
