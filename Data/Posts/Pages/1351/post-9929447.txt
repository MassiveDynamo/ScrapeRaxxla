That’s brilliant.

I’m just intrigued to find out if the skin of Brookes in relation to the ED narrative is literal or literary in correlation to the Thargoid story or totally unrelated?

We can certainly confirm Adamastor at a galactic point; we can also place Yggdrasil (or Donars Oak) at a galactic point/s; if we can definitely identify any other points, can they likewise be positioned?

It’s unfortunate, but the current glowy, spiralling thingy, does look like a spiralling star…could this sadly be another step in the Raxxla story, I hope not.

I’m always reminded of Ethel Moonshot, and Channel 4’s quip about it being ‘around the corner’

If we can identify any other narrative points, they’re positions relative to each other, could they reveal anything?

Is this simply an ego manifestation, an Easter egg?

I do hope this is not another narrative story tied to Thargoids, as it means all we have to do is wait for FD to turn that page, and reveal Raxxla, and I don’t want my suspicions about FD confirmed.

Give us hope.

I’m hoping this is something more; if not Raxxla then maybe something else left by the hand of Brookes…but I do suspect there is a correlation.

I genuinely hope the swirling thingy seen recently is just a Thargoid / Starship Troopers leg combat thing, or some Guardian (angel) thing! and not Raxxla. I personally believe that’s the shorter straw, and sorry to say the lowest denominator identifies this as a possibility.

I’m sure we will find out very shortly. I hope to its not Raxxka. Still it might be entertaining to watch.
