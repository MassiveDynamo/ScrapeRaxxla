What is this point?
This is, unfortunately, a red herring due to the way lore was handled in books and in-game!

Beagle Point, on the other side of the galaxy. Cmdr Salomé appeared there and made a speech- google it. It will probably be available from Canonn or Children of Raxxla websites.

Cmdr Salomé was in fact controlled by Drew Wagar and that speech was part of his in-game lore relating to his two official Elite books (Reclamation and Premonition) & he has said several times that he did not know anything about Raxxla, where it is etc. The book authors were told that Raxxla was a topic reserved for FD themselves.

Michael Brookes said FD had decided that Raxxla should have an in-game storyline (see my FDQuotes thread, link in my signature). Unfortunately we are still looking for that storyline!

The data logs mentioned are relevant because the route to get/return there can discover the sites of one of the three Dynasty Plot areas (I visited during the Distant Worlds 2 expedition a few years ago). That gave the proof of the Dynasty Plot and The Club’s existence.
