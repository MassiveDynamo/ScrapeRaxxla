luckily i did have some older Data and the search was real quick.
"BodyType":"HyperbolicOrbiter" is not new. It is at least since Nov.2021 (no older Data of that kind.) in the Game

As of now this behaves like a comet except its much "much" faster relative to the Star
My guess this Body Type is in Game for as long as Comets are.

Maybe the find has nothing to do whit the Orange Thing. Maybe just a lucky coincidence
Or FDEV used this Type for that thingy in some way.

for me it means the potential for rough Planets and other cool Stuff is or may even was in the game since the Beginning.
Also a potential hiding place for Raxxla. And something i will i will keep my eyes open for

So, what other examples do you have for "BodyType":"HyperbolicOrbiter"?
