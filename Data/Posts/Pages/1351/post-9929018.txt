Is it time we revisit the skin of Brookes, following the recent ominous sightings?

We can assume the Adamastor correlates, top left, as does potentially, Donars Oak (Delphi system) top centre or the Yggdrasil systems, but what else might be identifiable from these arcane records?

One figure at the bottom centre might depict 'Phineus' who was tormented by the Harpies and was blind. John Milton in his writings relates his own blindness to that the character Phineus.

No spiralling star/s but maybe some form of explosive spectacle bottom right?

Top right there seems to be a depiction of an angle guarding a heavenly gate, this image might appear in another Brookes commission, in regards to his Norse wooden shield; this motif closely resembles that of archangel Michael, fighting the serpent, protecting the gates of heavenâ€¦?

I wonder if in following months if the long lost arcane texts attributed to this artefact might mysteriously resurface?
