Raxxla isn't in the bubble. I'm very sure we can eliminate that theory. Soontill, within the lore at one time, was also a mysterious/mythical planet only previously known about at all, due to translations of private recording of the first, non-violent communications with Thargoids. It was able to avoid being discovered for so long while being so close to the bubble, because:1). It was a dark/uninteresting (except for the planet itself) system just outside the bubbles old world's frontier. And 2.) Once it was found by the CIEP, they further kept it secret (with advanced Thargoid tech) as newer hyperspace technology became available to common explorers. Even despite this, its discovery and reveling to the public was inevitable due to its close proximity.
Raxxla must be much further away from the bubble (and possibly similarly guarded) to have remained undiscovered, by Lore and Player CMDRs alike, for this long. THAT, or there is a flip-side/upside down version of the Galaxy within Hyperspace, and one of the Bubble's many "discovered" worlds is actually Raxxla within there.
