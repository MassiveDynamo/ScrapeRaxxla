I really hope FD have made finding Raxxla a homage to Robert Holdstock, without whom we wouldn't have Raxxla at all. As such I'm off to visit all the systems with stations which include Holdstock in the name.

This is my hope as well. While I haven't taken to visiting stations named for Holdstock I have been reading some of his old books and stories in hopes of finding something interesting that might a parallel somewhere in the game. Nothing as of yet to report on that front (aside from Raxxla's inclusion in The Alien World of course).
