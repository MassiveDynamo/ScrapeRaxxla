Is the general assumption that Raxxla can be found by just jumping to the correct system and searching around a bit and there it is, something with a big Raxxla sticker on it?
I feel it should be more like a multiple attainment discovery; become elite, visit x, find y, do z.... (as in a personal journey) which eventualy unlocks Raxxla. In which case it can be anywhere and visited all the time by many cmdrs, just not revealed as Raxxla.
Personally, I really hope FD have made finding Raxxla a homage to Robert Holdstock, without whom we wouldn't have Raxxla at all. As such I'm off to visit all the systems with stations which include Holdstock in the name.
