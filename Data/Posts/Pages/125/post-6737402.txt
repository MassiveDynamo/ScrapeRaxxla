I don't think anyone can eliminate that theory. There are some very good reasons why Raxxla could be in the bubble and still be a kept secret. In many ways Raxxla hiding right under our noses makes more sense then it being some random dot out among the billions of stars far from home. According to lore the new Frame Shift Drive which only became available a few years prior to 3300 ushered in an unprecedented period galactic exploration. A mission like the Zurara's into the Formidine Rift was a major undertaking whereas today's explorers jaunt all the way to Beagle Point for holiday. At the time that Raxxla entered the lexicon those kinds of trips were simply impossible. Hyperspace was strictly regulated to the domain of Faraway.

"Jump on your own through hyperspace, across more than half a light year, and you'll be lucky to make the same Universe, let alone your destination.
You might emerge from Witch-Space turned inside out (which is not a pretty sight).
You might be stretched in all the wrong angles, and although the ship keeps travelling, that jelly mass of broken bone and flesh inside the cabin is you."
-The Dark Wheel by Robert Holdstock
