Old Rifters are like unwanted relatives, we never go away!

but we always argued that FR and Raxxla were likely to be entirely separate things. It was always unlikely that DB & MB would site the FRift mystery anywhere near Raxxla since it might then be inadvertently found by someone searching for the other mystery.

I'd LOVE to be able to constructively engage with the Raxxla mystery, but the information we have is so sparse that there isn't any angle that I can get my beak into.
