...FD has confirmed that the system Raxxla is in has been honked.

I have heard this too, but haven't seen the source. Must have been some Twitch stream. Story also tells it was supposed to be a system you could do fuel scooping. When thinking about probabilities, it would have been somewhere with more traffic.. than less. Too much traffic and it would have been found 4 years ago. Less than 1k Ly from the bubble has many untagged planets, but not many unvisited systems I believe. Less than 300 Ly from Colonia has unvisited systems too I believe, since I found an ELW in that radius a few months back. Paths to Colonia, Sag A*, Formidine Rift and Beagle Point are well visited, deviate a little and they are less. Various far-away sights are well tagged, surroundings vary. 5000 Ly from the bubble somewhere? 100Ly from some far-away nebula?

Also this rumour sounds a bit silly and I don't quite believe it.
