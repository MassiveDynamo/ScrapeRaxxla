Also this rumour sounds a bit silly and I don't quite believe it.

As with almost any claim regarding solid info regarding Raxxla ... I consider it entirely apocryphal until I've had the opportunity to review the original source myself.

If Frontier has confirmed that Raxxla "has been honked" then we need to see the original source. To continue to discuss this rumour further with zero evidence is counter productive.
