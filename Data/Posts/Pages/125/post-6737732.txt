I would distinguish the Elite: Dangerous Raxxla from the Elite Raxxla, Doc. Time passed and our rigs and game capabilities evolved. Not sure all the "ancient lore" is still valid. After all, the major feature of this game is the MW. (Did I say Milky Way, Mr Brookes ?)
And imho, we should stick to what this game tells us (as long as we are not sure that FD creative "storyliners" are completely inconsistent with themselves...)
Raxxla Quest can't be brute forced (the raison d'Ãªtre of the Elite/Founders missions). It would be to much a shame, even for FD.
The thing is...MB quit E: D and the E/F missions stopped and afaik the SAP 8 Core disappeared too. I know DB is the (step-)'father' of Raxxla, but MB was the 'nanny'. He was who gets the work done.
And since 2.4 it isn't. Not even botched like the RF mYsTeRy turning out.
