No. No. I don't think the advice of sticking to what this game tells us about this particular matter is very helpful at all.

It's just almost the entire point of the FP of this thread (great work again, Macros !). And.. well...just read my sig. If you can sort out any other little bit obvious thing besides the Dark Wheel faction in E: D...
But I repeat the quest may currently be stopped as I said.

Even the old "Dark Wheel Missions" have nothing to them to suggest a connection to Raxxla

You put The Dark Wheel and Raxxla in the same sentence and then you say it doesn't suggest any connection between them, Doc ?
And what about ... a certain celestial body. The Myth. ? Soontill ? Cirag ? But not Raxxla ? (Cass A ? )

Raxxla only exists because of The Dark Wheel novella.

So, as The Dark Wheel exist in ED then Raxxla exists in ED too and they are related. Thank you.

Jaiotu said:
Without the original game's inclusion of The Dark Wheel novella there is precious little to suggest the existence of Raxxla or why it should be worth finding

Don't forget MB said '..the sequel will be played out in this game'. Which, imho, is quite precious much ....

Raxxla isn't in the bubble. I'm very sure we can eliminate that theory.

Without saying Raxxla must be there, the rim of the Bubble may have some clues. A certain pattern in the E/F missions seems to point there. But I wont enlarge my text wall anymore. If anyone is interested, PM me.
