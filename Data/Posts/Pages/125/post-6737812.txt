And imho, we should stick to what this game tells us

If we follow this advice and only stick to what this game tells us then we might as well give up now. This game tells us nothing about Raxxla. Neither did Frontier Elite 2 or Frontier First Encounters. Without the original game's inclusion of The Dark Wheel novella there is precious little to suggest the existence of Raxxla or why it should be worth finding. Even the old "Dark Wheel Missions" have nothing to them to suggest a connection to Raxxla ... unless you import the knowledge of Raxxla gained from reading The Dark Wheel and can therefore make the connection.

No. No. I don't think the advice of sticking to what this game tells us about this particular matter is very helpful at all.
