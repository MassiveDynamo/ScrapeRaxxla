On the middle of the way 2 -> 1 and at 1 had "mission objective detected" said by ship. Nothing else

That used to mean a new USS that meant a Trading ship looking for goods, and it was yellow / orange in the FSS....but I too have had 2 recently that turned into nothing at all so not sure whats happening.
