Can't stop thinking. We have exact date in codex when RAXXLA was known. At that time it was only 5-6 major systems colonized + hyper drive was expensive so could be used only by goverments/corporations. So that should be somewhere dumb close.
I even had idea toast describes tattoo on NPC's head Checked some fanatics around Sol. Nope, I was wrong - they had different pictures then I recall from 1st visit.
The trouble with that line of thinking is that it assumes it was known by being found. It is however possible to know about it from 3rd hand data - such as an alien artefact or by communication from someone/something that does know (or claim to know) about it. 2296 is also not an 'exact date when Raxxla was known' The codex implies here that it was an already established myth.

To illustrate this: Lets assume that the martian artefact found in 2280 depicted what came to be known as Raxxla (I'm not saying this is true - just for illustration). Within 16 years rumour of what the relic shewed may have percolated throughout the spacefaring community (small at that time) so that it becomes an object of curiosity - an unattainable goal to find. This might prompt our mechanic in Tau Ceti to say what he did - that finding Raxxla would be as likely as finding pirate treasure from Cora's drunk ravings.
