No. I'm just talking about the Guardians.
They were long before humans and thargoids, the Guardians' base might be Raxxla.
Yeah, they are definitely new. There were other aliens in the old games that have been retconned out (minor species that you couldn't really interact with), but nothing like the Guardians (although unexplained alien presences might now turn out to be Guardian, like the Mars artefact - I believe it was on the original timeline of one or more of the old games). I suspect they were introduced so that ED would have its own new story line that had more than just Thargoids. It is quite possible they have some sort of connection to Raxxla.
