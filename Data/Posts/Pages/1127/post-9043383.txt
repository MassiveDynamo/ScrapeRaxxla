This is quite interesting, and good luck with it. I'm not really a BGS person though. My personal hope is that anything locked behind Dark Wheel missions (if there is anything) is at the individual commander level, and not at the BGS level, for reasons outlined back upstream.
Starting from the fact that we don't know anything or have any solid clues any initiative is worth checking out. The Dark Wheel is one step away from having a presence in Sol, we'll see if that activates any trigger or not. If after all the effort nothing is achieved, at least we will have had a good time, which is what counts after all.
