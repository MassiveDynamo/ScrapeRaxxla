1. Not sure - worth checking out perhaps.
2. You mean the guards in Odyssey? So they can have a FPS game. That said it also gives them the ability to have scripted conversations, so maybe someone will be waiting on TDW station to explain everything to us. ;-)
No. I'm just talking about the Guardians.
They were long before humans and thargoids, the Guardians' base might be Raxxla.
