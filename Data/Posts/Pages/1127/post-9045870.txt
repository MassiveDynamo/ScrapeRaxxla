I didnt mean that rift - we're looking for the Omphalos Rift from the codex (or may be..) I was taking Guru's comment along the lines of - rifts are the dust lanes in the galaxy..
The rift might actually be the milkyway rift, which is the dark band/patch of black in the night sky, google it but the question is where in there? I will be taking a trip to search up there
