I wonder if anyone has compared the number and threat level of NHSS in Coalsack vs the Pleiades, and if one area is higher numbers/has more of the higher threat NHSS than the other, which might be an indication of Klaxians vs Oresrians or the like. [Shurely those orangey sciency people must have live 3D "bubble" maps by now of where all the Thargoids are? And spreadsheets of things like the above? Moar spreadsheets! Eds.]
I was surprised at the number of NHSS in Coalsack, 50 to 100+ in some systems I scanned. Didnâ€™t hang around to check their hive marks! Seemed a lot more than the last time I was in the Pleiades.
