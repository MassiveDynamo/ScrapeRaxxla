within range of the original 7.5LY FSD drives
That is number from Elite 1, which was starting at system Lave which was colonized in 2400 +/-. They started to colonize Elite1's worlds in 2400. Raxxla mentioned in 2296.
So it must be 100 years earlier prior "original drive", that was something else used.
