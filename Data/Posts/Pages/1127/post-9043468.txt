Starting from the fact that we don't know anything or have any solid clues any initiative is worth checking out. The Dark Wheel is one step away from having a presence in Sol, we'll see if that activates any trigger or not. If after all the effort nothing is achieved, at least we will have had a good time, which is what counts after all.
I think we ourselves should think of what will be RAXXLA in the game and write about it in the suggestions section.
And if it's a good idea then maybe it will be implemented in the game.
