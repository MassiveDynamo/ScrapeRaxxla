The rift might actually be the milkyway rift,
You should stop use twitter and discord for a while and read like 10-20 big books, for some like 7000 pages total.
There are rules of written text to say what you mean exact:

rift -> something general
Rift -> personal name, it is shown by 1st upper case letter.
