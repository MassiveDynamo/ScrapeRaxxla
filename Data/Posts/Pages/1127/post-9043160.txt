I believe this to be RAXXLA's symbol in the game.

I would explain why and more, but my last post about in game things was deleted by a mod despite it not being political or religious. I did quote an amulet transcription from the HAMSA wiki - but it was directly about the Guardians in the game - including the horned symbolism. How do we talk about the Guardian religion without getting muted?
