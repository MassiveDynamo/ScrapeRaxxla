Can't stop thinking. We have exact date in codex when RAXXLA was known. At that time it was only 5-6 major systems colonized + hyper drive was expensive so could be used only by goverments/corporations. So that should be somewhere dumb close.
I even had idea toast describes tattoo on NPC's head Checked some fanatics around Sol. Nope, I was wrong - they had different pictures then I recall from 1st visit.
Yeah, there has been debate over whether it needed to be within range of the original 7.5LY FSD drives, or within a certain distance of Sol based upon the original Elite galaxy map(s), etc. etc. But with the great retconning it is very unclear. Most folks seem to be leaning toward it being in the Bubble somewhere, but the only direct reference we have was the MB comment that it is somewhere in the Milky Way. Which was not particularly helpful given that is the only galaxy we have access to, and it has 4 billion stars or so. ;-)
