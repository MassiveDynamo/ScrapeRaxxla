The Goids are clearly looking for something in the Pleiades, but what? what what
I wonder if anyone has compared the number and threat level of NHSS in Coalsack vs the Pleiades, and if one area is higher numbers/has more of the higher threat NHSS than the other, which might be an indication of Klaxians vs Oresrians or the like. [Shurely those orangey sciency people must have live 3D "bubble" maps by now of where all the Thargoids are? And spreadsheets of things like the above? Moar spreadsheets! Eds.]
