Frontier have a business to run and trolling your customers is bad for profits..

I expect they feel our frustration, and theirs too - if you set a puzzle and everyone misses the 'obvious' clue, that will drive them nuts.

Art and Cora - the codex is short and thats a large paragraph. There is a journalist in Galnet call Tornquist, and a Cora runs the palin institute. Also the year is quite significant in the ED timeline, as was Tau Ceti in the ED lore. Loads of info in that section. And their's Brown Beard's pirate stash idea..

It's crossed my mind that passenger missions might be a mechanism - people mentioned in the codex, like Lyta Crane (in DW codex) - do they ever appear and want flying somewhere interesting? Maybe if you hang around the right starports etc.
