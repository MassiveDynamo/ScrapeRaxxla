Was the Codex entry about Dark wheel altered with 8th moon info at some point, or it was the same from the beta?
I am curios on urban myth about leaked tweet from the dev about 8th moon.

On the other hand, if some "people's journalist" would publish to billions of its followers true infos about my hidden station and organization, I would take steps to invalidate that info. If the infos are false, I would encourage them.
