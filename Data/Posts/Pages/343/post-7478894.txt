All this Greek mythology people are spewing... to date has there been a puzzle of ED that was solved by knowledge of Greek mythology? Thargoid Sensor, Probe, Link, Data and Maps all unraveled with math and science, stop trying to push Greek myths.

It's a bit early for science. There are no numbers to calculate or objects to investigate. We have nothing to listen to, nothing that point anywhere and no maps.

Brute force is the only alternative to the myths.
