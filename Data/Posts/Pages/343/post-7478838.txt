Hello all....
Hope this is the right kind of Tin hat colony...
i have along shot theory about an ED puzzle solution & location... just need some more info... thanks

The riddle from Tionisla Orbital Graveyard....
Given the details; "year 3302" or before, a "Cobra Mklll" & the Name "Rebecca" i am looking for a common theme....

Rebecca died or faked her death on the way to Tionisla.... Is this before 3302 or after and could this be her ship.. ?

If Rebecca had something to hide not in the Form-rift... Given the complex of the puzzle hopefully a big secret... Any ideas what that would be & sort of location...???

If by chance the message was intended for "Rebecca" for her only... Then " Tionisla Graveyard"... "Cobra mklll" and "Secret location" have many things in common.... what would interest "Rebecca"..?

Cheers Stu
