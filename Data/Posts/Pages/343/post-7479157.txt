The codex was only added a few months ago, it wasn't in beta. FDev has barely talked about Raxxla before, except to say they think the way to get to it is "a tiny bit obvious".

Thanks. There are some art concepts where 5-spoke station in asteroid field is pointing towards a star with a smaller star in-front of it (and not towards the planet), and FD delivers content based on long-term planning (they do not stray from visual design concept) I have my doubts on 8th moon hint.
