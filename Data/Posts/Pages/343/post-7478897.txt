That's a valid point. The codex entries could be 100% garbage.

However, I think it's safe to assign all knowledge/speculation about Raxxla with a confidence score based on how close to "official statement" it is.

David Braben telling Drew Wager (presumably a friend) that Raxxla is "definitely in the game and we know where it is" = 100% confidence (assuming DB & DW aren't known liars/trolls, and he was telling DW this on purpose knowing he'd tell others as a master trolling plan)

The other official statements made by FDev on the topic = 100% also.

Now the codex... we know that at one point, FDev considered clues to Raxxla to be a "tiny bit obvious", and yet nobody has found anything that seemed to point in a definite direction in like 5 years.
If FDev wanted to continue their policy of being unhelpful, they could just have not said anything. There was no reason to add Raxxla/TDW entries to the codex.

The only reason to mention any specific names, people, places or topics is either;

When we ask "what could cause FDev to create these codex entries", this is the differental diagnosis. We can assign probabilities to these possibilities.

So now I think the codex is 85% chance meant as a hint.
Assuming they don't want only English-speaking players to find Raxxla, we can see what information in the codex is conserved across translations.
For each thing, you can assign a chance based on how likely it is that you think it's a hint. If there's any other reason you can think of for including this element, try to guess what the odds are that it was chosen deliberately vs randomly.


But for me, it gets less reliable the farther out you go.
The poem "Astrophel and Stella"? Well that's based on a name similarity to a possible hint, and it's only accessible in 1 language really. I'd give it 50% tops.
Leaping from vague descriptions of someone's face in the poem to astronomical features? Well, at best like 10% of the poem is a clue, and interpreting it correctly is like another 10% chance.
So poem analysis seems risky: 10% * 10% * 50% * 99% * 80%= 0.4% chance

Etc. I mean, assuming Raxxla is out there, you can always just explore aimlessly without purpose, like a vagabond, or you can use the codex for inspiration on places to go.

Repped. Good to see some logic applied to the problem instead of fanciful mythology!
though might take issue with some of your estimates, think they’re a little on the high side
but then, I’m an old sceptic
