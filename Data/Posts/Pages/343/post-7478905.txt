I'm sure someone has made this observation but the home base of TDW is on the 8th moon of an unnamed gas giant in Shinrarta Dezhra, AB 2. Of course SD can only be reached after following your own path to Elite...

I'm working on my rep with TDW and I've made it to friendly. As I approached their moon, TDW contacted me with a mission. It's a pretty standard type mission but it is a chain mission. I can't take the second piece because I'm not friendly with the next mission giver. The second mission is piracy.

SD system has been searched extensively, especially since the Codex arrived. There is no reason to believe TDW have anything to do with any celestial body within it (other than Jameson Orbital)
