Raxxla could be a planet, it could be anything we have not gotten anything to clearly stemate it is not a planet... Or anything unfortunately, the clearest statement we have gotten is "you don't know what it is yet" so all we know is... Its an "IT" IT department? Lol

The other galaxy's where retconned and now believed by the lore as not galaxy's at all but sectors of our milky way.
Are you calling the developers horror-clowns? Do I get a jump scare next time I start the game?

Or is this like the holodeck-episode where Data gets an equal in Prof Moriarty? Or is it Riker's "shall we end that charade"?
