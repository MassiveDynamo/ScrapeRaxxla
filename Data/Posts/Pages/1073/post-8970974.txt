Raxxla could be a planet, it could be anything we have not gotten anything to clearly stemate it is not a planet... Or anything unfortunately, the clearest statement we have gotten is "you don't know what it is yet" so all we know is... Its an "IT" IT department? Lol

The other galaxy's where retconned and now believed by the lore as not galaxy's at all but sectors of our milky way.
I guess the translation is very distorted, if it were a planet the phrase - we don't know what it is - would be different.

Sectors ? Hmm. While I'm still a fan of the theory that Raxxla is some kind of black hole to go to another galaxy (sectors ?). A person with this knowledge could easily travel between sectors.
