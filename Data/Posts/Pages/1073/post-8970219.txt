On another note still after 6-7 years a reason for moving NGC 2286 from its original location (Probability of Thargoid homeworld from previous games though no confirmation although it was 500ly from Polaris like the distance point from the jump from Polaris to Miacke) to way out beyond yet they left one system behind NGC 2286 C 42...the system was scanned by myself and many others way back then and is still checked regularly
