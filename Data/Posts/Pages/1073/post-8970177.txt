It has been proven above that the first book is no longer a basis for reflection. And if many people think that Raxxla is a planet, I think they are mistaken. After all, we are clearly told that Raxxla is not a planet.

By the way, the other galaxies were in Elite 1 and Frontier, but I don't know any way to get into them.
Raxxla could be a planet, it could be anything we have not gotten anything to clearly stemate it is not a planet... Or anything unfortunately, the clearest statement we have gotten is "you don't know what it is yet" so all we know is... Its an "IT" IT department? Lol

The other galaxy's where retconned and now believed by the lore as not galaxy's at all but sectors of our milky way.
