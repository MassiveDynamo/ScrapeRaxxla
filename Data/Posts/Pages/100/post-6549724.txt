As far as I know, it's fan art. Nothing official exists.
Quite right. It is a nice bit of Fan Art that Drew kindly decided to incorporate into the story of Kahina Loren. Alas, it is only mentioned in text in any official form (either Galnet or Premonition) so the graphical representation remains non-canon.

At one point in the old Formidine threads the artist, and I forget who and didn't make notes on it, explained it's inspired by a crop circle with pi encoded in the bar spiral and they added the dragon bits and the rest. I'm much too lazy to forum search for the post as google didn't immediately spit it out.
Yep. The aliens were clever with this one.

Cant embed on mobile but pretty sure the emblem is on the page linked below.
That is the one. The Children of Raxxla's logo contains the same visual elements but combined in a slightly different form:


My own avatar ... the Ouroboros circling an unblinking eye ... is an homage to this logo. I chose to replace the Elite emblem and the Pi representation with an eye due to the following image from Steven Eisler's (a.k.a. Robert Holdstock) The Alien World:


Holdstock's description of the image: "The Eye Of The Beholder. A Raxxlan projection which appeared above the primitive world Winter D, populated by sentient, but unadvanced insectoids. The Eye became an overwhelming symbol of the evil that stared from the heavens, so disorienting the creatures that the Oisir-Raxxla were able to build their structure and depart without life being lost."

For me that eye, more than anythings else, is the best graphical representation for Raxxla ... though maybe not the Raxxla of the Elite: Dangerous universe. I hold onto due to the connection to Holdstock.
