LoL ! Out of rep. That alien construct, if it actually is an Oolite-style wormholes network, shows indeed family ties with what we know about Thargs, like their mastering of witchspace and their patterns based on number 8. (Would be cool if there was not 1 but 8 portals to the network ...)( It also would give a new dimension to what MB said about R : " Oh, it's in the Milky Way !"
meaning it's all across the MW. A place that is not a place.)
And, of course, the fact that they are vegans. OMG ! They came to steal our pepperoni !
