I like this. What we are searching for is the cornerstone, center of a maze, treasure room. The ultimate jump. Alpha and Omega.
A mystery deeply rooted in the very nature of Frameshift Drive, and other ways of getting "there".
Maybe alien races knew it exists.
Could be roots of a huge ruccola too, the ultimate salad with some figs and walnuts, and we are supposed to be searching for amazing rich and peppery flavours.
