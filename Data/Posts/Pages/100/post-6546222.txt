WHAT is it with the Cobra, I understand its the classic ship, but in much of the lore, the Cobra is front and centre. Even in The Dark Wheel Novella it states
''But there are ghosts there. The ghosts of the early ships that went in to Faraway, and didn't come out again. Ghosts . . . And shadows. The shadow of a snake. A Cobra . . . Rising over them . . . ''

It's a specific Cobra. The one that blows up their ship when they re-enter realspace, assassinating Jason Ryder.
