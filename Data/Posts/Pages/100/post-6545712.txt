I'd assume that's referring to Jammeson's lost ship. Note that it's A Cobra, singular. It was arguably the most famous lost ship, before it was found.

Peter Jameson was not the pilot of the Cobra used in the Mycoid attack. It was the ship of his son, John Jameson(presumably the character we played in Elite).

John Jameson Jr.(player character in Fe2), started his piloting adventures in an Eagle. The ship was left to him in the will of Peter.

Lori Jamesons family connection to the other characters is unknown. She obviously has close ties to the Pilots federation, as her base is in Shinrarta Dezhra.

It's also likely that she is friendly with Professor Palin. The two main characters of the Wings trailer are called Commander Ishmael(male) and Commander Jameson(female).
