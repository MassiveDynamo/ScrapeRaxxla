This tourist beacon in Shinrarta Dhezra gives the most info regarding The Founders World that I've found:
SPOILER

It doesn't provide a reason why the planet was named "The Founders World" nor who exactly the "Founders" are (again, I know who the Founders are out-of-game. I'm talking in-game narrative.)

It would be interesting if it turned out that the Founders are actually an alien race and "their" world is actually Raxxla ...

WHAT is it with the Cobra, I understand its the classic ship, but in much of the lore, the Cobra is front and centre. Even in The Dark Wheel Novella it states
''But there are ghosts there. The ghosts of the early ships that went in to Faraway, and didn't come out again. Ghosts . . . And shadows. The shadow of a snake. A Cobra . . . Rising over them . . . ''
