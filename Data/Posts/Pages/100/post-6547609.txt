Sorry for the tangent from the sh*ts and giggles above, but can anyone please tell me who created the modern emblem for TDW? Was it something Drew came up with? Was it created by CoR? Or is it a Frontier design from the writers' guide, do we know?

Thanks.

As far as I know, it's fan art. Nothing official exists.
