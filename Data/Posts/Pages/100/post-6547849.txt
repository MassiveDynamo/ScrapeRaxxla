As far as I know, it's fan art. Nothing official exists.

At one point in the old Formidine threads the artist, and I forget who and didn't make notes on it, explained it's inspired by a crop circle with pi encoded in the bar spiral and they added the dragon bits and the rest. I'm much too lazy to forum search for the post as google didn't immediately spit it out.
