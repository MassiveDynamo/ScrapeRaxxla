Oolite saga, Mutabilis, near the end. I know it's not canon but I doubt that Drew (after having access to the Frontier Alien Background book) would have spoiled the "concept" or "nature" of Raxxla.
I want to believe there isn't one "Raxxla in TDW", and one different "Raxxla in Oolite", and one different "Raxxla in ED" etc... Raxxla is Raxxla, period.

Don't forget ... the Oolite Saga was written BEFORE Drew had access to Frontier's official background lore. Anything he conjectured about Raxxla back then sould be treated exactly for what it was. Fan fiction.
