Did a few Distress Call (threat 0) refuel/repairs over the last few days, accepted the mission via the local comms panel & completed the refuel/repair and they then hyperspaced away upon which I got a success notification in the top right panel, but the Codex/Commander stats/SAR counter isn’t incrementing. Is this a bug?

My SAR count is stuck at 35, which I guess is the number of “passenger rescue from burning stations” missions I did.
