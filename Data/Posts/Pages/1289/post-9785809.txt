Anyone able to get the song that plays inside Fleet Carriers its on repeat beside the screen at the docking bay elevators, Heard very same songs in different areas since horizons and just wondering...maybe big thinfoil maybe could be related or hold clues, Its somewhat blues/country and can barely make out words like Dark days etc but not turning my game up to blast my house full of it along with ambient sounds haha

(narrowed the sound to the tablet sitting on the crates, or adleast the closest youl get to it is be crouching and facing the tablet also not on repeat few songs play including one very Thargoidish/techo style with weird trumpets lol)
