But, but, but 10^29 >> than 400 billion star systems in the simulation game!
Does that mean there are actually 10^17 Raxxlas in each system??

I knew it!!
SPOILER: SPOILER



there is more Raxxla in this Library than Particles in the Universe (each Particle can have a Universe worth of Raxxla to it and it would still not be enough not even close)
~29^3214 possible matches with random characters
~97.328.052 possible matches with random words
29^5 = 20.511.149 possible title matches

SPOILER: THE CODEX FOR RAXXLA
