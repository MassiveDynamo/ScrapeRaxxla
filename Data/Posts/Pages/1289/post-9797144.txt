Considering that there is no evidence of human discovery of alien tech prior to the mars relic in lore, i would think we have to assume we discovered hyperspace travel similar to how guardians did, and similar to how thargoids did. They did not discover this tech from eachother. And the lore doesn't posit some progenitor race that everyone is stealing from.

Despite thargoids and guardians being much older than us (with thargoids being far more longer in space than both), we all seem to be at similar levels of technology.

Unlike our desire to think of ancient aliens as so much more advanced than we are, it seems in the elite universe, the aliens we know about pretty much have stagnated at human technology more or less. So I dont think we need to prop hyperspace travel up on some pedestal of advanced tech. It seems to be well within species ability when they get to around our level of advancement. It's pretty much happened with every space faring race we know exist separately.
