I thought that was the new canon now or has that been changed again?
It was a conclusion people jumped to, not new canon, AFAIK.

I never thought it made particular sense, given that it was around 150 years or more between the reverse engineering of the Thargoid tech and the FSD entering production.

The reverse engineering of Thargoid tech fitted more timing-wise with the type 2a hyperdrive.

Then again, there are some potential reconciliations of the dates. The first reverse engineered Thargoid drives were fatal to human pilots - basically turning them inside out - so maybe it took all that time to resolve. Or maybe Sirius etc. just kept the tech to themselves for a long time.
