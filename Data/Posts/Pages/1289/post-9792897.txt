More source... inside what?
Unfortunately could not get an original copy of the book. In The Library of Babel from Jorge Luis Borges. the author describes a library, each room is a hexagon with two walls as a passageway. The other 4 walls each have five bookshelves with 32 books each. Each book has 410 pages each Page 3200 Symbols.

The posted Image does Not fit this description. The raxxla Logo room has 3 Walls as Passage.
The Text seens also Not from the original book.
I think this is fanart.
But i Love it.
