Read the wiki and then you have the same info I have.

yes it is, I was just there yesterday , Officially designated PSR B1919+21, this was the first Pulsar discovered in 1967 AD. Because regularly repeating radio sources were not known in space at the time, it was briefly named LGM-1 (standing for "Little Green Men") as it was speculated the signal might have been from an alien intelligence. -- The original designation of this pulsar was CP 1919, which stands for Cambridge Pulsar at RA 19h 19m .
