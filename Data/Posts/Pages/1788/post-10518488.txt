Search for LGM-1 or by the official name and read. --- I've been streaming the journey and answering questions. I really don't feel like writing it all down for now.
Well, do you have a link to your 'stream site' along with the questions/answers? Is it like your YouTube page or somethin'? ( Not sure why you didn't just post that channel here on these forums already? )
And i suppose you meant this? --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1919+21

btw, i happened to also stumble upon this old Raxxla related thread--> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/major-clue-s-on-raxxla-and-how-to-locate-it.579282/ which may or may not be relevant anymore i dunno. But it seems to go along with the whole "radio signal" theory.
