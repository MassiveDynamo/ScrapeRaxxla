Well, if you do the simple reading, its obvious.

Plus i mean, the 'Crab Nebula' is like 6000 Ly's away , no? Sorry but i'm not spending that much travel time just to go on some player's wild goose chase , unless i know for certain it's gonna yield actual discovery results. I'm guessing you're just having a bit of fun with the mystery or whatever , but i mean isn't that FRONTIER's job?
