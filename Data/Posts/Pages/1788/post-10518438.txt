Waypoints I'm willing to share:
LGM-1
Crab Pulsar
The Raxxla image contains the specific unique pulsar timing of the Crab Pulsar. These two waypoints and their history should be what you need to follow my path. Anything more would give it away.
ah ok, so you've made your choice to tease & trickle instead.
i'll wait for someone else to post verification screenshot(s) then.
Godspeed. o7
