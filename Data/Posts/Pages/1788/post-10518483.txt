Which "wiki" do you mean exactly? The original RAXXLA wiki?

Just curious, you're documenting this new journey of yours with screenshots/videos i presume?
I'm using official UK astronomical history on wikipedia. Search for LGM-1 or by the official name and read. I've been streaming the journey and answering questions. I really don't feel like writing it all down for now.
