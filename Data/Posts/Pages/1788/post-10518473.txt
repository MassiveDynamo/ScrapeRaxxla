Officially designated PSR B1919+21, this was the first Pulsar discovered in 1967 AD. Because regularly repeating radio sources were not known in space at the time, it was briefly named LGM-1 (standing for "Little Green Men") as it was speculated the signal might have been from an alien intelligence.

The original designation of this pulsar was CP 1919, which stands for Cambridge Pulsar at RA 19h 19m .
