Just use the "spoiler" option to hide the details for those who want to try to find for themselves, --- Even if he doesn't find anything it's good to know what was his process to discard that theory, or try something different.
Bingo ^ exactly what i was thinkin' too yep.
And as to your 1st sentence, looks like we're in agreement again lol since i also suggested that very same thing to him earlier over here--> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1788#post-10518434

btw, a few things i pondered ( which of course mostly seem rather "obvious" now post-haste ) after @mach10 started answering with a bit more detail & data:
'SOL' system has 'The Mother of Gaia' ( aka EARTH? ) which is also considered the "mother of galaxy/universe" to us humans, yeah?
If, as noted within the intel/link i posted above which mach10 confirmed, the 'RA' in 'RAXXLA' could symbolize a Right Ascension , could that be a directional starting point vector? And if so, could the 'XX' = celestial coordinates ( number, degrees ) ? And then if so, could the last 2 letters 'LA' = Left Ascension?
Therefore, could be coincidental however it also feels like the powers-that-be ( aka Frontier Devs ) want us to solve the RAXXLA mystery finally, since they not only named recent update 'Ascendency' but also have literally geared us straight into SOL system for 8th & "final" Titan invasion in conjunction with increased FSD tech jump ranges + expanded Colonisation soon
i checked ingame and cannot find any system listed within GalMap named 'LGM-1' nor 'PSR B1919+21' nor 'CP 1919'
the aforementioned 'Crab Nebula' ( Crab Pulsar ) is 7000 Ly's away and so unfortunately i don't have time ( yet ) to make such a trip
the 'RA' Takakhan' system as well as all of the other 'PSR' prefix systems on GalMap are over 20,000 LYs away , and the other 'CP' prefix systems are listed over 1000 LYs away ---So again, i just don't have time currently to make those super long trips
No mention in mach10's 'Twitch TV' stream ( or Q & A session ) about any final destination or ending location to his journey?
