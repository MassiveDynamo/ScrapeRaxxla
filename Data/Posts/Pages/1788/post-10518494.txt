cool thanks and btw if your journey does turn out to be THE solution to RAXXLA , tbqh i sorta had a feeling a few weeks ago here--> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1748#post-10435274 that it could possibly become YOU who would eventually make that grand discovery.
