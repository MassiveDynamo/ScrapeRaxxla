most are prose way of describing an astronomical body but with a double meaning. For instance the mother of galaxies is both a person and an astronomical body. Its more than I care to write here, so if you catch me live I'll explain a bunch but not all of it.

Things are really settling into place and I should be getting close to the end. My question is if/when I find it, should it be posted? Even posting the answer to the first line of the TDW toast could ruin the whole thing.

Waypoints I'm willing to share:
LGM-1
The Raxxla image contains the specific unique pulsar timing of the Crab Pulsar. These two waypoints and their history should be what you need to follow my path. Anything more would give it away.

Yes, obviously you should share it if you ever find Raxxla or any real clues to it ingame. It's basically being searched for since the beginning of the game, and many like me don't actually believe it's in game at this point. So you would do everyone a favor by sharing it to the public. Just use the "spoiler" option to hide the details for those who want to try to find for themselves, but even those will be thankful to learn their search isn't pointless.
