One suspicion then is the book is telling us to look below Achenar for some reference to Mountains, Barrows or Caves. The Codex was was written much later, seems to emphasis this location by identifying the existence of these Lost Realms, this conglomeration or ‘obfuscation’ of Edens,
Correct me here if I am wrong here, but wasn't there a zone of lakes and sunken treasures? Is one of them linked to Diana (the Empire would have used the Roman equivalent of Artemis which is Diana). Calligula built ships to Isis there that sunk. I think we are looking for something related to Diana Nemorensis.

Side note: The system Isis uses Roman numerals to designate the planets. It is a small detail but may be important given the Isis connection to both Diana Nemorensis and Rex Nemorensis.
