I have the text as a digital book. No sadly. The only use of the word Princess in that book is singular:

“I had no form of entertainment except for a book, a single book about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon. My father must have bought it on the black market. He couldn’t have got it from anywhere else”. “I still have that book.”.

But as M Brookes might have indicated, was Julia still in Freeholm? If not where’s her book? With her, or did she place it in Hammers grave?
