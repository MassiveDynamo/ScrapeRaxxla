A further rumination on Satan's female followers (aka Princess Astro Fell):
Astarte (aka Ashtaroth, Astoret, Astarit, Inanna, Ishtar, Istar, Ishara, Ashtart, Astart, Athart, Attar) & Isis (aka Aset, rusat, usa, else, esa, wusa)......Astarte is thought to have informed the development of the Greek goddess Aphrodite and has been associated with the deified morning and/or evening star (c.f. Lucifer!)..... Ishtar's symbol is a star with 6, 8, or 16 rays within a circle (6 featured in Raxxla logo?).....Isis became linked to the Greek lunar goddess Artemis (highlighted in Elite Legacy)??

Ishtar | Goddess, Worship, & Facts
Ishtar, in Mesopotamian religion, goddess of war and sexual love. Ishtarâ€™s primary legacy from the Sumerian tradition is the role of fertility figure; she evolved, however, into a more complex character, surrounded in myth by death and disaster, a goddess of contradictory connotations and forces.
