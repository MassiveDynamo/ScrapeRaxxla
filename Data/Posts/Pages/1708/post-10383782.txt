Hammer was originally the son of a trader but then moved to being a farmer from some unknown agricultural world. Hammer was not his original name, which was Commander Mark Lamon.

Lamon means various things in different countries, but it’s Old English origins links it to the Norman ‘Logmadr’ or Scottish/Irish ‘Lamont’ meaning ‘law man’; the French origin of Lamont means ‘up hill’.

He named his ship Hammer too. He was described as a nomad and a crusader. He spent his time baiting pirates, on the rim of the Federation, out of revenge for the death of his farther (trader), but he himself was not a bounty Hunter.

There was a love interest too - Lina Mater (tender mother).

He was described in relation to Norse mythology, as one of those old gods of the mountain. So again a Norse and Mountain reference?
