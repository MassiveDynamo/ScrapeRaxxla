Hammer was originally the son of a trader but then moved to being a farmer from some unknown agricultural world. Hammer was not his original name, which was Commander Mark Lamon.

Lamon is old Celt / Norse for ‘law man’ or French for “up hill”.

He named his ship Hammer too. He was described as a nomad and a crusader. He spent his time baiting pirates, on the rim of the Federation, out of revenge for the death of his farther (trader), but he himself was not a bounty Hunter.

There was a love interest too - Lina Mater (tender mother).

He was described in relation to Norse mythology, as one of those old gods of the mountain. So again a Norse and Mountain reference?
