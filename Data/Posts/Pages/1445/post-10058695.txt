If I am reading this correctly, fernweh is almost the opposite of homesick but not quite. Depending on context it could either mean longing for a distant location but on flip-side could mean longing for a different kind of place (similar to feeling like a stranger in a strange land) where the individual almost feels lost as everything seems different. Almost inclined to say that second interpretation may be the one FDev is shooting for given that Elite Dangerous is simultaneously part of a series but remade in a single game.
