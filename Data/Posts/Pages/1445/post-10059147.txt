Q: The author of the Elite Dangerous lore is a big fan of Paradise lost can you see any links between it and the Dark Wheel toast?

A: Paradise Lost is an epic poem written by John Milton in the 17th century that tells the story of Satan's rebellion against God and the subsequent fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. It is considered one of the greatest works of literature in the English language and is known for its complex and nuanced exploration of themes such as free will, sin, and redemption.

There are some similarities between Paradise Lost and the Dark Wheel toast in Elite Dangerous that the author might have been inspired by. The "Parent's grief" in the toast could be interpreted as a reference to God's grief over the fall of mankind in Paradise Lost. The "Lover's woe" could be interpreted as a reference to Eve's sorrow over her actions in the poem, and the "yearning of our vagabond hearts" could be interpreted as a reference to Satan's longing for revenge and power.

The Dark Wheel toast also mentions "Raxxla" as a place of mystical secrets, in Paradise Lost, it can be interpreted as the secret and forbidden knowledge that Satan and Eve seek in the poem.

It's worth noting that the author of the Elite Dangerous lore is known for using literary references in the game's backstory, and Paradise Lost is a well-known and influential work of literature, so it's possible that the author drew inspiration from it when creating the Dark Wheel toast. However, it's important to keep in mind that these are just possible interpretations and the true meaning of the toast remains a mystery.

Q: What is the secret and forbidden knowledge that Satan and Eve seek in the poem?

A: In Paradise Lost, Satan and Eve both seek the knowledge of good and evil, which is forbidden to them by God. Satan, who was once an angel, becomes convinced that he should be equal to God and decides to rebel against Him. He leads other angels in a war against God, but they are defeated and cast out of heaven. Satan then decides to take his revenge on God by corrupting mankind and causing their fall from grace.

Eve, on the other hand, is tempted by Satan in the form of a serpent and is convinced to eat the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. She then encourages Adam to do the same, and as a result, they both gain knowledge of good and evil, and they become aware of their own nakedness and shame. They are then banished from the Garden of Eden as a punishment for their disobedience.

In this sense, the secret and forbidden knowledge that Satan and Eve seek in the poem is the knowledge of good and evil, which they gain through disobedience to God's command. This knowledge ultimately leads to their fall from grace and the loss of their innocence.

Just an AI thought....
