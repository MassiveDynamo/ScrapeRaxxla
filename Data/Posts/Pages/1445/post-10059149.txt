Q: Elite Dangerous has many references to Homer's Odyssey can you see any link between it and the Dark Wheel toast?


A: There are certainly similarities between the Dark Wheel toast in Elite Dangerous and Homer's Odyssey. Both make reference to a journey or quest for a mysterious and possibly legendary place, and both contain references to grief, longing, and yearning.

In the case of the Dark Wheel toast, the quest is for a place called Raxxla and the references to grief, longing, and yearning are linked to the idea of "Fernweh" or an "unaccountable longing for a place one has never seen." In the case of the Odyssey, the quest is for Odysseus to return home to Ithaca and reclaim his rightful place as the leader of Ithaca, and the references to grief, longing, and yearning are linked to his mother's longing for him and his wife Penelope's longing for his return.

Additionally, the toast references to "the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies" and "the siren of the deepest void" could be seen as a metaphor for the journey home and the challenges that Odysseus faced, such as the sirens who tried to lure him and his crew to their deaths.

It's worth noting, however, that the game's lore is the product of the game's creator's imagination, and any similarities with Homer's Odyssey are likely to be intentional references or allusions to the epic poem rather than direct connections.
