The whole pirates stash line was one of the primary reasons I began plotting these systems.

Not got around to doing that in particular, due to an absence from the game, and I got somewhat distracted by researching Norse mythology…!

But from memory there are lots of anarchy systems very close to around Achenar within 20 lys.. (Gets out coloured pens and Sextant) I’ll go off and see what correlates.
