It would also be a bit strange for FD to chiper texts that are presented to players in different languages.
That's a very good point, sometimes it's easy to forget these high level observations. Thanks! - we have multilanguage game clients, the outcome would be different in different languages.

EDIT:
On that note though, isn't "fernweh" spelled equally in all the game language versions?
Rationale would be that it could either be something important enough to keep the same spelling for all language for such a 'key'-word.

It could also be a foreign phrase which should never be translated ofc, but hey - this is the Raxxla thread after all.
