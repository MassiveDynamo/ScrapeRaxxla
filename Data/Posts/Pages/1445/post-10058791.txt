There will be no clues!
But you have to make it a bit obvious
It is in game but you don't know what it is...

I paraphrase of course....

Clearly a puzzle to solve or why do we come up with so many wonderful theories?

I believe your right about most of the puzzles or they seem to shoot themselves in the foot and someone works it out before they get the content out properly

I'm just trying to rule out this possibility as FD have used various stenography/encryption methods for their puzzles..

If the toast is some form of instruction or map reference it would make sense to me that by knowing just that piece of text alone and how to decipher it you should be able to follow the hidden instructions/message... Otherwise you'd need other bits of information too...

The different languages mentioned being a problem is interesting... I wonder if they all have something in common (no. of words, are the line breaks the same, the same !'s, any words used in all of them, etc, etc)

Just a thought....

Oh yeah totally I like your idea a lot, but I also agree that Han_Zen probably hit the nail on the head, it's less likely to be a cypher based on the text because of localisations needing to also match - unless each localisation has been re-written to also include cyphers that result in the same clues? It would be interesting to find out.
