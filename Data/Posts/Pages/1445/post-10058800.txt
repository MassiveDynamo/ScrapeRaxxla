This is just my current interpretation of what Raxxla seems to be especially given "fernweh":

Origins of humans in the Elite Universe.
Who are the CMDRs and how do we fit in the whole story?
Origins of The Dark Wheel and who they are and what are their goals (especially in light of the 8 galaxies in the original game).
Are the rumored 8 galaxies actual galaxies or sectors of known regions of the Milky Way?
Origins of Thargoids (are they natives to the Milky Way or Witchspace)?
Origins of Guardians?
Origins of human hyperspace and what the hell is Witchspace?
Who are the Oisir-Raxxlans?
Are the Oresians the Oisir-Raxxlans?
Is the rumored Oresians and Klaxxian divide a civil war between the same species? Or between two species?
How much of our past is actually true?
This becomes all the more apparent when you factor in Holdstock's (through written under pseudonym Steven Eisler) states rather unambiguously that The Dark Wheel was not of this galaxy and possibly the Naranthu. In other words, Raxxla isn't just, "What is Raxxla?" but the "Who? What? Where?" of almost the entire grand-scale tale of the Elite CMDRs. By the way, the Holdstock rabbit hole is likely quite deep given Leo Faulcon is a main character of "Where the Time Winds Blow" (see Faulcon Delacy). Further, Kamelios makes recurring appearances as does Federation, Empire, and Galactic Cooperative. We even have maps of the Galactic Cooperative in Tour of the Universe including Kamelios being near Sol. I get the vague feeling humans stumbled across some time anomaly or transportation system that seriously impacted our progression as a species. However, if you read description of rare commodities in Elite Dangerous it is very clear some of those had lasting impacts. The same is true for many salvageable commodities.
