Adding to this line of thinking: Elite Dangerous' expansions were Horizons and Odyssey. If Odyssey expansion's name was inspired by Homer's Odyssey that is the journey back home from stange lands. So, not homesick but an arduous journey through unfamiliar and dangerous lands.

From the Wikipedia entry:


Crucially Greek references seem to be rather common in-game as are references to Homer's works - see especially Alleged Toast of The Dark Wheel. I had actually written a good deal that the entirety of the Alleged Toast may be a reference to Thetis and her son Achilles or Demeter and her daughter Persephone but there are others which fit. The Thetis/Achilles version is based on from Cambridge University.
