On the excellent point @Han_Zen and @John Stoutbeard made:

If a bunch of multilingual Raxxla hunters translated the Raxxla codex from the various localisations we might be able to see what's structural and what's not a little more clearly - with the assumption that translations would need to retain the same 'clue structure' despite lingustic differences in things like sentence structure and word choice.

For example, I wonder what the DW Toast reads like in different languages?

If it retains the structure, then maybe the structure is important to the clue, if it retains certain words then maybe they're the important ones, etc.

Sadly I only speak two languages; English and bad English.

This reminds me of the post ages ago by a Russian player who provided a translation that clearly read "the legendary planet Raxxla", whereas the English version simply says "the legendary Raxxla".
