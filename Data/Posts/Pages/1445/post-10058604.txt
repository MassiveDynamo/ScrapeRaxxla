The Hunt For Theta Seven - You Could Win 750,000,000 Cr!

No, it was meant as forethought about Elite becoming a series and hiding locations between a mixture of a different coordinate scheme and name changes.

Insofar as encrypted messages, though, I don't doubt FDev's capabilities there. Truthfully, I have my suspicions that Frontier Developments is the mastermind behind Cicada 3301 (more information at Wikipedia and Uncovering Cicada 3301 (Fandom)) as themes from it mirror Elite Dangerous. It also came out as the game was being promoted. If you have the most famous mystery in gaming, an ARG seeking humanity's best and brightest makes a lot of damn sense.


Sidenote on some IRL things: Despite having a tremendously good science background, I ended up going computer science/IT and have a decent background in cryptography and Internet security. I just mask it well with the knowledge of mythology, ancient cultures, and religion/spirituality. The first Raxxla theory I did used triangulation in Elite's coordinate system to be able to precisely find Raxxla. Sadly, as expected, it merely proved that the system that was renamed Delphi was yet another means of obscuring Raxxla (besides in all likelihood humans wouldn't have gotten there until much more recently much like Soontill). Delphi relates to the Omphalos which was seen as the center of Greek world.
