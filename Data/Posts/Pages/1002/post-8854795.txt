On the start of FD’s Anchor man News report, it started off with Arthur saying “Raxxla discovery just around the corner” seeing as this news report started all this new content off, it could be associated with it.

Rewatched this and decided to checkout what the other two magazines were on the desk in front of the anchors were. First is of course Sagittarius Eye Winking Cat cover, the other two are Sagittarius Eye with a focus on Alioth’s history. Numerous mentions of New California again in that issue (the planet that doesn’t exist in Alioth yet is mentioned in its history repeatedly). Gonna poke around there once I get the permit.
