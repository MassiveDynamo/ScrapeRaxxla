Rewatched this and decided to checkout what the other two magazines were on the desk in front of the anchors were. First is of course Sagittarius Eye Winking Cat cover, the other two are Sagittarius Eye with a focus on Alioth’s history. Numerous mentions of New California again in that issue (the planet that doesn’t exist in Alioth yet is mentioned in its history repeatedly). Gonna poke around there once I get the permit.
Alioths furthest out planet is call Bifrost. Theres a station there called the Golden Gate.

Norse myth again!
