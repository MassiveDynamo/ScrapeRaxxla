we know it can't be in a system too far from other systems due to jump range at the time (plus the jump range in the game at release), and we know it's likely not far from the bubble since old jump tech still in lore was used at the time of it's name entering the lexicon.

I get a bit tired of saying this: Its not true about jump range limiting Raxxla's distance:

(1) Old ships didn't only jump to stars and so could navigate arbitrarily (See the E84 novella where they jump to Rafe's ship)
(2) We get bored of jumping after an hour or two. In the E84 Novella, Jason Ryder was gone for months.
(3) Ship jump range was ~6ly or more depending on model. That's a factor of no more than 10 less than our current best (excluding carriers)
(4) We can get to Sag A* or Beagle in a day or two, so in 10-20 days they could do the same.
