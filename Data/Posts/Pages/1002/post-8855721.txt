Unfortunately he has introduced a few errors. 2296 is the first attestation acording to the codex, not 2286. And the toast is "Whisperer in witch-space", not whispers...

There are a couple of other datapoint I'm not familiar with. He mentions 2814 as a more likely date for the first mention of raxxla. Where is this from?

Also he mentions some audio from the black box recovery E/F mission - do we have that here?

Ninja#d by the man himself ! @drew, can you please state your sources - that would be appreciated, thanks.
