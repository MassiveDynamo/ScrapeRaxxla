See, this latest article on Galnet triggers the tinfoil within me. The one about Rackham building an outpost in the highest system.

What makes me wonder is the writers again mention the Rhea Archipelago. It’s only been mentioned twice before in conjunction with the term Skyglow Havens but in articles involving the disappearances of Olav Redcourt and Consuela Knight. This time though they also mention the galactic spiral.

I’ll admit, as per usual, this could mean nothing but the writers having such a habit of using Rhea Archipelago makes me suspect something is going on, and as yet, there’s no call for community support for this endeavor so why does Rackham announcing this from his private villa there matter enough to make it into the article?

Is there a quadrant of the Galaxy named after something to do with Rhea? I know other regions have names like “Temple” etc.

Edit: Side note, Omphalos was also the name of the stone given to Cronus to devour by Rhea instead of Zeus. Perhaps a round about link to the Omphalos mentioned in the codex. I’m grasping at straws here.

The Galnet post last week about Rackham opening an outpost in HIP 98832 on 17th December seemed interesting. Roof of the galaxy- reminiscent of Tyko's recent trip. Thought I might take a look see. But just tried to plot a route up there and I want to know how the heck he's going to do it! Even planning a Neutron Route the last leg, from PSR J1239+2453 up to HIP 58832, is 2,800 ly. That's one hell of a boost! Ain't no ship can do it! So unless he's found the Raxxla Gateway or there's a long distance circuitous route I don't see how it's feasible, but I cant see any stars within feasible range of it!!
