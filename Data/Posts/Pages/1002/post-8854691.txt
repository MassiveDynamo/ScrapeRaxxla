LMC & SMC are separate galaxies from Milky Way IRL, so I would discount those. Access to Witchspace or Guardian virtual space could be intriguing. Raxxla could be a specific Guardian site which allows access, or perhaps a device/access mechanism (“Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key”?) which permits access at any of the sites allowing rapid transfer (only makes sense come Odyssey, else you’d be stuck without a ship ). Paid my pre-access, just in case!

Multiverse might explain where thargoids came from. Find Raxxla...enter alternate universe.....get killed by millions of bugs...
Mmmmm!

The other possibility is that the ED universe is a sim:galaxy run by Pranav Antal to weed out the best pilots - maybe if you find Raxxla you'll wake up back in the real milky way..

(this would give FD a chance to fix all the errors and update the astonomy in the galaxy..)
