It was stated that raxxla was in the game and discoverable from the game since gamma ...pre-release. So it predates all dlc and new versions.

Now, you could say that things said by Fdev at lavecon aren't written and recorded and so we're going on someone else's word of what was said. But Since this is coming from Drew Wager and not just a rando.... it's as good as fact.

Mmm, that reference brings up one of my posts! (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8421915)
Being pedantic, DB did indeed say Raxxla has been in-game for the outset (actually I believe the gamma), but I don’t have any reference for him ever saying it’s been discoverable since then. Although we are optimistic and hope so!
