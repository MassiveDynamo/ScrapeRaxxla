It was stated that raxxla was in the game and discoverable from the game since gamma ...pre-release. So it predates all dlc and new versions.

The Quest To Find Raxxla
Raxxla is New Era content. Till then no1 will find it

Now, you could say that things said by Fdev at lavecon aren't written and recorded and so we're going on someone else's word of what was said. But Since this is coming from Drew Wager and not just a rando.... it's as good as fact.

Discoverable isn't the same as accessable. You can discover a gas giant or a water world but thats where it ends. It's never been stated that you could interact with it in any way. Also DW has said countless times that he doesn't know any more about Raxxla than the rest of us. Until that is stated specifically by fdev(which I'm sure it won't be) it's cunjecture and specultation.
