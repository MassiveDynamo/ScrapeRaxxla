Does 'Is Player Faction - Yes' mean an original faction in-game adopted by a player group or a player group asked for a faction named XYZ and Frontier then put it in game for the group? Or both and indistinguishable from each other, both just a pmf, whether adopted or created?
Almost always the XYZ option I am pretty certain. IIRC no player groups were allowed to "take over" existing factions, although I could be wrong.
