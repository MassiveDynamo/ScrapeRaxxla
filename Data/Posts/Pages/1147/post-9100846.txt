Almost always the XYZ option I am pretty certain. IIRC no player groups were allowed to "take over" existing factions, although I could be wrong.
Can confirm squadrons can align to non-player minor factions. Whether inara cares to differentiate is another story but just check The Dark Wheel faction for confirmation as my squadron is aligned to them but our squadron isn't named for them and doesn't have an official inara so idk where this is going anymore
