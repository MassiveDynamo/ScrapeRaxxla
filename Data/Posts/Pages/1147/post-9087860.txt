Well, I know Sol’s asteroid belt is very sparse, so perhaps this really is FD attempting to portray something that is there but isn’t, if you know what I mean. As opposed to the other belts we see where there are endless asteroids very close together. Sol’s asteroid belt may or may not be a hiding place. But my Raxxla in Sol hypothesis brought together sufficient “evidence” to convince me. I think it’s there but detectable only by someone very lucky after sacrificing to Randomius Factorial, which is not enjoyable gameplay for me. I might go back sometime and try again, but it gets very boring very quickly!
I agree with all except the "lucky one", at least in context of just dropping in to random areas. We need something else to get us in the right area, and then someone will get lucky from there
