Ok - so I looked up Yembo.... it seems to be a lesser known name of Yemoja / Yemaya..... Mother Goddess, Waters.... tied to Olokun... keeper of secrets... androgynous... story about a chameleon.... (edit) oh look at Olokun Initiation. and
SPOILER: SYMBOLS

Oh also - saw something about Rockforth today.... What if Rock-forth is a descriptive name.... Is it describing something growing from a rock... maybe a Ragthorn from a keystone?
Your girl Yembo, is an Orishas. They are a bunch of sub-gods, in Yoruba mytholog. Her husband Obatala created humans, while drunk. That's why we are like we are.

Its a great pantheon, with funny stories and nice alternative names.

Orishas alternative names: Orisa, Orisas, Orisha, Orixa, Orixas
Obatala alternative names: Obàtálá, Olufon, Orisala, Orisanla, Orisha-Nla, Orisha-Popo, Orishala, Oshanla and seemingly also Orixalá in Brazil.
Yemaya alternative names: Iamanjie, Yemanja, Yemayah, Yembo, Yemoja, Yemonja, Yemowo

Orixa, Orixalá and Orisala are kind of fun.

The real god in this bunch is called Olorun / Olodumare.

Edit: Orisala is in ED: https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/2044/name/Orisala
