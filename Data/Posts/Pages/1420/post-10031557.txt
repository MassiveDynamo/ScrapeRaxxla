I have been reading around Yggdrasil and the Nine Worlds and the fact that this is Norse mythology whilst the stories of the Omphalos stone are Greek mythology make me think that they are two separate puzzles, thought I think both of the same type (a route as password).

The mythology of Yggdrasil, the World Tree at the centre of the World, and the Nine Worlds around it is connected to Donar's Oak in the Delphi system. (Both myths deal with an object at the centre of the world, so Delphi is a good place for both). There are systems in the Bubble associated with all of the Nine Worlds. In addition, I think that once the nine have been visited, it might be necessary to 'lock the chevron' as Louis Calvert puts it by visiting Bifrost (which represents the rainbow bridge connecting the realm of Earth to the realm of the gods, if it is not a waypoint in the puzzle already) before visiting Donar's Oak in Delphi (or at least the system) and visiting the Thargoid Structure and activating it. I think this path is leading to Raxxla but I would note that the idea of a World Tree might come from the North Star being stationary at the centre of the sky surrounded by other worlds - perhaps this will take us to Polaris!

The Omphalos Stone is Greek myth, though it has parallels elsewhere, but if The Dark Wheel toast is linked to Generation Ships then the systems are also going to have names from Greek mythology. This seems a better bet for finding The Dark Wheel station to me. In this case, the toast should lead us to a set of systems that must be visited before docking at The Oracle, and then perhaps also activating the Thargoid Structure.

I'm caught up in irl stuff a bit today (Sundays can be like that) but I'll try to dig out a list of in-game system names for the World Tree's Nine Worlds, if no one else does it first, later today.
