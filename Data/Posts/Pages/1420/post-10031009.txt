I looked at this some time back and i circled on my note pad 'Atlas' for one reason, an article in Issue 9 of Sagittarius Eye regarding Tom Edwards:
wandering its creaking corridors and gentlyrotating habitat rings until death finally caught up with his headlong cruise

It was the 'wandering' bit that got me.
Thinking of him roaming the decks in despair and grief.
I also spent some time looking for an ELW around the area and anything settlement wise related to him but to no avail.
Ive often thought that the DW and club here the same in which case would they have known about the departing ships?
