I looked at this some time back and i circled on my note pad 'Atlas' for one reason, an article in Issue 9 of Sagittarius Eye regarding Tom Edwards:


It was the 'wandering' bit that got me.
Thinking of him roaming the decks in despair and grief.
I also spent some time looking for an ELW around the area and anything settlement wise related to him but to no avail.
Ive often thought that the DW and club here the same in which case would they have known about the departing ships?

I dont think we can rely on anything outside the game, apart form relevant MB and DB statements.

Yes, the reference to “personal journey” got me investigating such an “Odyssey” a while ago and I visited many systems in various sequence combinations....it got boring very quickly! But there are references in-game to 2001 Space Odyssey film, and the naming of the latest game version as Odyssey also made me ponder along those lines.
