Then you want to check out the 3 systems down beneath the bubble:
McBurney's Point (meaning 2/3 rds in distance terms)
Odin's Wisdom (not the ravens, but still if you think about the ravens, is this the 'mid point'?)
Gilthaven (formely a jeweler shop)

Yes, those are interesting names!
They are in the Blanco 1 cluster, about 1 KLY or so from the Bubble. I have been there on several occasions (and have a handful of First Discovered, First Mapped and one or two First Footfall as well) but not seen anything otherwise related, though I cannot rule them out as waypoints of a puzzle.
(There is also a system called Ziggy, though I first think of a certain hybrid computer from Quantum Leap when I see the name)
