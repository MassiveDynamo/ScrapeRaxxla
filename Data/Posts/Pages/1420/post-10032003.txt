Hey just sharing a change in the Permit locked Systems.
the Systems below have been Permit locked in the past. The System Description said something (can't fully remember) due to security concerns this system has been permit locked by the (i think it was) Pilots Federation. not sure anymore.

Today i saw that 3 of them do no longer need a Permit and there is no longer a Description about the Permit (Only that a Permit is Required for this Location)
Just noticed it because i was getting the Peregrina Permit and saw that i had the HIP 22460 Permit that i don't recall obtaining, so i investigated.
PLAA AIN HA-Z D46 (still needs permit)
PRIA EURL RW-X B1-1 (permit dropped?)
PRO EUR IG-Y D132 (permit dropped?)
SCHEAU BLI NB-O D6-1409 (still needs permit)
HYPIO BLUAE RL-H C12-2163 (permit dropped?)
TEPUAE AA-A H488 (still needs permit)
maybe it's relevant for some in here i don't know. Any chance anyone knows when this changed? I have not checked on those systems in the last 12 month.
