Had time to read through your 'cold read' of the Codex and it is interesting. I particularly like the Omphalos stone being a gateway and that the Delphi system is a beginning, with the Omphalos stone being positioned beneath the Oracle. The Thargoid Site certainly bears greater inspection.
Nice More eyes = better! If you have anything you'd like more eyes on inspecting let me know, I'm happy to take a field trip

I am trying in my head to get around Tau Ceti being a starting place and Delphi being a starting place. Why do we have to travel to multiple locations? It is almost as if we have to travel a certain route, hitting key waypoints, maybe even performing key activities, before we can make a final jump from Delphi. A route as a password.
I'm not sure Tau Ceti is important in itself. I think it's establishing a timeline, and also 'Cora is "Persephone" in ancient Greek myth...

Always Greek myth innit

Nine worlds connected to the World Tree. Nine waypoints? Maybe Pleione and Atlas are two and The Dark Wheel toast is giving us clues to more. After visiting them, light up the Thargoid Structure. A rift may then open - or perhaps then making a hyperspace jump to a final destination. Activating a Thargoid Structure does give you a message, so perhaps that will contain the information?
@Rochester has done loads of really interesting work on the Yggdrasil angle (and much more). Sorry Rochester I can't find your post to link. We speculated maybe the leads from there led also to Delphi to consolidate the clues togeher, maybe, or maybe the clues led from Delphi into Rochester's area of study... inconclusive. More minds on that the better

EDIT: Here we go, Rochester's "John Milton conundrum" thread.
