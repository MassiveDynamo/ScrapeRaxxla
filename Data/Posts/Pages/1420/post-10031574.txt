I have been reading around Yggdrasil and the Nine Worlds and the fact that this is Norse mythology whilst the stories of the Omphalos stone are Greek mythology make me think that they are two separate puzzles, thought I think both of the same type (a route as password).
Then you want to check out the 3 systems down beneath the bubble:
McBurney's Point (meaning "2/3 rds" in terms of distance, medical term)
Odin's Wisdom (not the ravens, but still if you think about the ravens, is this the 'mid point'?)
Gilthaven (formely a jeweler shop - sorry, all I could find, no ED/cannon story here)
