Maybe, but I don't think anyone's actually tried it, have they? If so what 6 systems did they use as points (will save me time if someone else has done the work!).

Which systems?
Why, I would use brute force and check all known stars in a certain range around Sol if they form a certain geometric shape - usually within some tolerance, to get any results at all.
Didn't do that search for 7-systems-forming-a-3D-cross-shape, though.
