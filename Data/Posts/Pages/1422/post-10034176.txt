Raxxla is Guardian and I have proof in form that Soontill is a complete and total fabrication perpetrated by Robert Garry of CIEP/The Dark Wheel. It boils down to there is a metal present that only forms in stars related to the Guardians - Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. The element in question: Technetium. The fact there is no brown dwarf in what Universal Cartographics labels Soontill is just further proof that it is a giant hoax.

Robert Garry at the end of "..And Here the Wheel" is revealed to be grandson of Oberon Ryder. Who sells the Soontill Relics? Garry's Reclamations (as in the Robert Garry). We found The Dark Wheel/The Circle of Independent Elite Pilots. They are pushing a fraudulent story because they already possess Raxxla. This means Liz Ryder and all the Engineers are part of the cabal, too. The Dark Wheel is The Club itself. Soontill Relics have pictographs which are a characteristic of Guardian civilization. Further, the secret base is supposedly on the closest planet to the star labeled as Soontill which is far too hot for Thargoids and has atmospheric pressures no lifeform could possibly survive. By the way, The Dark Wheel stations is all the palm tree stations like Black Mausoleum (Beta Hydri), Wicca Town (Gateway), Irkutsk (Alioth), Galileo (Sol), Brooks Estate (Pi-Fang), Ortiz Moreno City (Tau Ceti), Hunziker Orbital (Aymifa), and many others. You received your invite with your ship and the second part was the permit for the Founder's World.
