Are you giving us a hint we need to read this to find the promised land?

No. Much as Paul's work is definitely worth reading, I think I was mentioning this as some of the conversations around the early development of Elite Dangerous on these forums compared my contribution to Robert Holdstock. That was a humbling experience. I just wanted to share this as part of my recent ambition has been to reunite the critical perception of Holdstock with the work he did on The Dark Wheel and show academics how it is still held in such high esteem by fans.
