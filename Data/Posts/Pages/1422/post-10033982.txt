Reading this, the 'jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of Galaxies' seems to me a reference to the Galactic north pole in Coma Berenices. In game there is a neutron star in R Corona Borealis, which has a small nebula surrounding it and it is marked on the Galaxy Map.

Princess Astrophel and the spiralling stars - neutron stars perhaps?
It would not be the first time neutron stars have been used for navigation - they are on the Voyager golden record.
Perhaps there are six neutron stars that form the six cardinal points around Sol and R Cor Bor is the North one - where would the others be to make a cube?
6 NS acting as a map rings a bell, loudly!
Pretty sure that's what Carl Sagan put on the Voyager golden plaque to show aliens where Sol is....
Mmm, has anyone looked closely at the Voyager plaque? DB wouldn't have put a map to Raxxla there....would he??
