6 NS acting as a map rings a bell, loudly!
Pretty sure that's what Carl Sagan put on the Voyager golden plaque to show aliens where Sol is....
Mmm, has anyone looked closely at the Voyager plaque? DB wouldn't have put a map to Raxxla there....would he??
Many of the community searching for signs of intelligent life (IRL) discuss the option of using Neutron Stars as markers - they're easily observable, relatively stable and if you're trying to make a map to show where your civilisation is, referencing the nearest configurations of Neutron Stars (Pulsar's, specifically) is absolutely a possibility.

Yes it was also on Voyager's record cover, but there were more than six. Link to NASA page here. They're specifically Pulsars, I assume that's the only kind we have in-game?

I went to Voyager a while back while investigating Sol, I didn't think to look at the record cover, but since Fdev added their own audio message to Voyager then maybe they also changed the message on the cover. It's absolutely worth a look
