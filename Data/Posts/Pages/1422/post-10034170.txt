The Miltonic Hive - Milton's Bee-Simile

Within book 1 of Paradise Lost Milton compares the clustering of the winged angels about Pandemonium with that of the swarming of bees about their hive!

The bee metaphor was utilised widely in 17th century England as a divine symbol of monarchical and ecclesiastical power.
