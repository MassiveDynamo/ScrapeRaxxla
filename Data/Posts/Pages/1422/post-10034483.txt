That is a insanely long computation we talking here.
lets say 100 Systems.
For the first line (ignoring the order/direction) you have (100 * 99)/2 = 4950 Lines
2. Line still has (98 * 97)/2 = 4753 different Lines.
3. Line has (96 * 96) / 2 = 4560 Lines
that makes (4950 * 4753 * 4560)/6 = 17 880 786 000 tests
that will take a couple minutes.
go for 1000 Systems and we talking heat dead of the universe long^^

I can have missed some symmetries that do not need to be checked twice, still the number of tests explode for every system that gets in the pool.

Hope is that since the probability for 6 random point having a 7th point in common goes to 0. So if there are such systems it's a nice we -should take a closer lock-

Ah, I get it!
The quest for Raxxla involves delving into the occult realms of efficient number crunching!
Test job on a 400 Ly cube with 96514 systems currently running at 0.08 s per outermost loop and accelerating.
