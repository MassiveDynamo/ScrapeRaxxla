I'm not experiencing any issues. However, there is an option for galaxy map quality: Options>Quality>Galaxy Map Quality. (between material and terrain quality)

Mine's set on high, but I vaguely recall there being a bug (that I thought was fixed) where medium was using more resource than high.
Ok, Iâ€™ll try messing around with that setting next time I fly, thanks!!
