Going to have a good read of this all later when I get back, it looks really interesting! This quoted section really might actually tie into something I've been looking into too. I'm really interested to read this properly later

Edit:
Is this any use to you for this idea? It's the Galnet article on Soontil Relics:
Yes, that is the part that suggested the relics are either from ancient Earth or another civilization. The pictographs mean either is possible. However, you do not fabricate a whole myth unless you are hiding something immensely powerful. There is another Galnet called "Soontill Relics to be auctioned at Ngurii" that links it to prior fraudulent alien relic auction/sales from First Encounters. Many of these auctions had Jjagged Bbanner playing at the events. This also may link to a certain cyborg with an affinity for Jjagged Bbanner, Jaques.
