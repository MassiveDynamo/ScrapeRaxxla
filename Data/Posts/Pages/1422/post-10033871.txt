Polaris is the celestial north pole. It relates to earths rotation axis.
The ecliptic north pole is in Draco and is the top of most star maps. It relates to earths orbit around the sun.
Then there is the Galactic north pole in Coma Berenices.
There are of course south poles as well. We usually focus on the north poles, because most of us live on top of the globe.

Al the other planets in sol also have their own poles, as well:
Poles of astronomical bodies - Wikipedia

In the search for Raxxla, Mars, Saturn or any planet may be as relevant as earth?

All these are 'valid' ophalos points, if we find relevant hints to back them up.

Reading this, the 'jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of Galaxies' seems to me a reference to the Galactic north pole in Coma Berenices. In game there is a neutron star in R Corona Borealis, which has a small nebula surrounding it and it is marked on the Galaxy Map.
EDIT: R CrA is the nebula I was thinking of but the Circinus Pulsar might also be a match for the description, located in R Coronae Australis

Princess Astrophel and the spiralling stars - neutron stars perhaps?
It would not be the first time neutron stars have been used for navigation - they are on the Voyager golden record.
Perhaps there are six neutron stars that form the six cardinal points around Sol and R Cor Bor is the North one - where would the others be to make a cube?
