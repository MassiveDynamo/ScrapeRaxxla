Remember the references in development of the ‘Thargoid’ bible.

A lore document in FDs possession that outlined the narrative and backstory of the Thargoids, very likely the artwork too..

It’s logical FD would have a long plan for this IP but I am increasingly filled with incredulity considering the various circumstantial evidence, that this was not followed verbatim, and that a shift in development resulted in certain content being dropped and/or repurposed.

So might there exist an equal possibility the Relic no longer exists?

If it does exist it very likely is a keystone narrative element, therefore something we cant interact with and for that reason I don’t think it’s actually Raxxla, as it’s physically SO small, I think it’s an indication of alien technology.

The presumed emphasis of Milton would advocate Raxxla is a body in a fixed place, a liminal zone that uncovers something or provides some insight?

My point being, if the Relic or Triton are involved, there’s actively nothing we can do to resolve it, other than await FD decision to turn that narrative page, where as the Codex advocates Raxxla might be a location and it might be discoverable?
