The Martian relic might be unrelated, but the timing fits - it was discovered in 2280, only 16 years before Art Tornqvist's journal.
Good spot! I never made that connection

Though I do have in my notes: N.B. Allen Stroud’s PhD thesis quotes from his ED lore bible as “In 2280, the first non-human relic was found in space. The object, no bigger than a child’s hand was collected by an orbital probe around Europa and quickly brought back to Earth. No information has ever been circulated as to the properties of this item or its origin.”)

FD may have kept to that lore but obfuscated the location to say found on Mars
