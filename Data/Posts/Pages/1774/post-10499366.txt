Thinking about Triton...
Triton wasn't always permit locked.

Whatever it's locked for wasn't present when he flew over it and landed. It could be planned for anything in the future (or something that never came to pass), but I've found nothing to suggest that anything in Sol is related to Raxxla even slightly.
