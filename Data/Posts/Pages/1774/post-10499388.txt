I guess it was just a matter of time before i brought up the Templars....

Thinking about Triton - I remember the Tattoo... MB had the Triton from the Pena Palace.... It stood over the Coral Gate. The Pena Palace is near by the Quinta da Regaleria both in the region of the Sintra Mountains. Sintra is Cynthia.... Diana ....Artemis

The Templars stayed in Portugal after their dissolution... became the Knights of Christ... The Freemasons are said to have used rituals from the Templars... Makes me wonder about the Raxxla symbol Idea.

Quinta da Regaleria is the location of a garden supposedly used for Freemason initiation rites. Levels of cosmic Ascencion etc... The bottom of the Initiation Well provides rock cut tunnels which takes you to various locations... One of which is the Portal of the Guardians...

The Pis√µes Loggia - one of the entrances to the Quinta da Regaleria, has an interesting symbol carved into its floor - i suppose it is being used as a drain?


Im starting to wonder if the vague pattern in quite a few stories ive been noticing is related to some "secret' story associated with the freemason initiation rite...

Mmm. That drain looks like a Titan to me, though I agree the hexagonal boundary is reminiscent of Raxxla symbol (&Coriolis station). Is Raxxla perhaps a lost Titan?? Who thought uo the Titan names? Is there a potential clue in the naming convention?

Yes, the Triton gate was the first symbol on MB's tattoo, marking the start of the journey. So while the incoming Titan might be heading for Triton (isnt there a system of same name?) the tattoo might suggest something more convoluted?
