Given the latest Titan development I suspect either a Guardian or Guardian AI is located on Triton (locked, narrative only). I suspect the Ark ship that brought them to Sol may be Raxxla and hidden in Neptune's ring system (or possibly as one of the moons, but Ive tried all of them without result, but I guess it could be orbiting one but hidden), it will be locatable (possibly given enough pilots searching and a lot of luck).

Edit
Could be hidden orbiting Triton, or Europa??
