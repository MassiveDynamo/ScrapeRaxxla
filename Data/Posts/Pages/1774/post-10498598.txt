Doh, I had spotted the 16 year gap from Artefact to Raxxla rumour, my memory is failing. If we are looking seriouslyz at Sol for the location then I would againg point out the in-game hints to 2001 Space Odyssey (station docking music was in first Elite and still in ED), and its sequels.

2001 Space Odyssey (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith_(Space_Odyssey)).
In the film the monolith that was a transportation gateway was orbiting Jupiter
(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)), was DB a fan of the film? I think he is of Arthur C Clarke who wrote it.

Various sources place the 2001SO third monolith (there were a couple of books and later films which I havent seen, 1982, 1987 & 1997) : 1) orbiting Io, 2) on Iapetus, 3) orbiting Jupiter 4) on Europa, 5) between Io and Jupiter

But Allen Stroud's thesis mentioning Europa is suggestive.
