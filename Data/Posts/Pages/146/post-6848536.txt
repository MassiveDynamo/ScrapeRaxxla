I'm pretty sure that the distress signal was a one-time only event that corresponded to Luko and Salome's excursion to the Thargoid infested COL 70 sector. While the sector is likely still teaming with bugs I think the distress signal would have ceased quite a while back.

Thanks for the clarification Jaiotu, I thought the were related somehow.
