Come on, guys... Didn't you hear DB ? You don't know what it is!. So what's the point to keep looking for a planet or any celestial body ??? The Myth is not Raxxla ! (I bet R. Holdstock is bouncing in his grave)....
The FR mYsTeRy turned out to be a very human conspiration. I can't then expect from FD Raxxla being something...exotic.
At most, if we are lucky, something like Jorki said, a Sirius secret facility in the middle of nowhere with a dozen of satellites pointing to it. (You have to collect twelve dozens of each alien artefact to gain access to each one !)
As i like to say, fantasy and creativity went along with MB and DW when they left ED.
