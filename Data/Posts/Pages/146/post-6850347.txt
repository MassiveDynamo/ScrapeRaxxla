Isn’t that a clue? I thought we weren’t going to get any clues?

The one who said that.(Question: "You have said that there will be no clues though?" Brookes: "That's true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious just so people know what they're doing) is no longer designing the ED stuff. I guess you noticed the difference ? No one here "knows what he is doing" since. Why ? Because ED's Raxxla is no longer "The Myth" nor "... the mythical planet Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there’s an alien construct that’s a gateway to other Universes, and all that’s in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life...

DB just said it exists, but we don't know what it is... Quite easy to understand times are a changin'.... And I am not sure to be interested in the way BigBro is making them change... (And I am also not sure it is ethical to change the original concept of "Raxxla" at his will. I don't feel like buying "his" Raxxla. It's a fake, imho)
