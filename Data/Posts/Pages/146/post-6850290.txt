Well, yes. Because it seems DB is aware of the fact that part of the player community is actively looking for Raxxla. He just gave us a clue or "no-clue" in the kind of "you are on the wrong way if you think ED Raxxla is RH's Raxxla".


Does that mean it is not a great big eye floating in the sky?
Isn’t that a clue? I thought we weren’t going to get any clues?
