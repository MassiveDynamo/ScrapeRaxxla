I think this one is still going on.. isn't it?

I'm pretty sure that the distress signal was a one-time only event that corresponded to Luko and Salome's excursion to the Thargoid infested COL 70 sector. While the sector is likely still teaming with bugs I think the distress signal would have ceased quite a while back.

Well, yes. Because it seems DB is aware of the fact that part of the player community is actively looking for Raxxla. He just gave us a clue or "no-clue" in the kind of "you are on the wrong way if you think ED Raxxla is RH's Raxxla".

I really hate when this interface tells me I need to spread some rep around. Spot on Commander.
