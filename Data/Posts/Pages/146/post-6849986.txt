I think there are two options regarding Raxxla's fate in ED:

Either Raxxla is a side-quest / side-story withing ED. Then there really will be no clues and we have to figure out with what we have. We might even never find it if DB doesn't pity us at some point and throws some at us. On the plus side, Raxxla CAN be discovered, right now.
Or Raxxla will have its part to play within the Thargoid / Guardian narrative, and clues will have to appear as the story unfolds. So now we would have in fact nothing that could direct us to Raxxla (there will be no clues), maybe it even cannot be reached anyhow as it is too early in the ED-storyline for us to discover it, and we are all searching in vain. On the plus side, if Raxxla has to be found for the story, it WILL eventually be found.

I personally hope for option one.
