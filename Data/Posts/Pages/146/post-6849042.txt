If I remember correctly, the Col 70 signal was related to a part where a certain journalist was able to witness Wreaken Construction operating in the permit locked sector, and witnessed both Imperial and Federation battlefleet being constucted there. The revelation was that they were built next to each other. The Club had plans that both sides should have as many warmachines as possible built before thargoids, enter the bubble. Another signal was nearby Col 70, just before Salome left towards the bubble. Before they left for the perilous journey towards the Old Worlds, experimental FSD had been used to enter Col 70, and they immediately met hostile thargoid ships.

Im not certain if it's lore anymore. It's supposed to be, I guess, but it feels like things have taken a different direction. I actually believe the major storyline has changed for at least two times now, still holding to idea that permit locked sectors were supposed to be tied to past story events already. Most likely there will be a human faction with somehow different, or surprising involment with thargoid operations, in any case.

Latest chapter didn't really reveal anything interesting to me. Well, except Alliance possibly becoming divided on how to act with LOR, possibly a plot twist being built there. Thargoid vessels being mentioned as "bio-ships" only confirmed my suspicion that thargoids are going to be something different, not green bug-men in green bug-men ships.

Raxxla was supposedly introduced to game long time ago. I wonder, will it be reworked, is avoiding that even possible, or will it remain as obscure as ever.
