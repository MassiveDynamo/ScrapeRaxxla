I actually found once a system Macros Black had discovered and tagged some planets. Not sure if it was Raxxla, but it was like a little bit Raxxla nevertheless. Somewhere between Col 70 and edges of Guardian space.

We may never know unless it literally says "Raxxla" on it. Honestly, its a bit daunting to look for Raxxla when you think about it. You have about a 1 and 2 billion chance of finding the right system, let alone actually finding Raxxla itself.
