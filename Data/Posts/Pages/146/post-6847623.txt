The Cobra was the player ship in the 1984 original version of Elite, and has an iconic status in lore. Given that Raxxla is related back to the old games ( and "The Dark Wheel" Novella) it make some amount of sense that the Cobra will be involved somehow. However, I think it will be that the experimental drive ( hinted at by the cargo ) will only be fittable to a Cobra. If the drive represents a reverse engineered fsd from a thargoid scout (the size of an eagle) it seems plausible that the Cobra is probably the smallest ship the human version of the drive would fit. (assuming the human copy is not a refined and compact as the thargoid version) Military/ Combat capable ships tend to be more over built than their civilian counterparts.This also favors the Cobra over something like a Hauler. The Cobra design is also time tested, and highly reliable making it the perfect testbed for an experimental design. Larger ships are likely have prohibitive energy requirements, or are too unstable at those energies. (given the experimental nature it seems reasonable to start small.) Even assuming the 500 odd relatively weak/tin-foil hat assumptions in this post the question remains of how this would be handled in game.


On an non-cobra related note. I tired flying my ship near a white dwarf to irradiate it as the item description of the ACU mentions Gamma radiation shielding, and Halfnium 178's energy release is related to Gamma radiation. The sort version is that it did not end well. Apparently if you get trapped in a White Dwarf you have to high wake, and high wake quickly to escape. Low waking does not appear to work ( no escape vector appeared). Very expensive lesson learned.
