Sorry for coming with a trivial and technical question...
Was messing around with the GalMap and I stumbled on a bookmark, one of these 'in-system', but then, when looking at the system map, the main star appears as "unexplored" . Is that possible ? Because of a auto-destruction ? But the bookmark remained, aswell as the possibility to enter the system map... Empty system, no info. Appears as not visited.
So how can I have a system body bookmark put on? And zoom into ? Buggy/inconsistent game mechanics ?
(I must precise I never earned a Hutton free Conda )
