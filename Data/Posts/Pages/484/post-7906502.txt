Maybe only some BH's act as wormholes - possibly try this in the maya system as the BH is (apparently) surrounded by thargoids who may have come through it. Possibly a wormhole straight to a permit locked area
I'm up there at the moment but won't be able to play until tomorrow, so may give it a go then.
someone else suggested because of their massive gravity it just makes it a good focal point for a super long-range jumps. I feel like that seems a lot more plausible realistically.but either way I wouldn't count anything out we've never seen a white hole in this game
