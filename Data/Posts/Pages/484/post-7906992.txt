Yes very much this - I am also liking the idea that the "creators" of Jasmina and possibly Gan could be the Siren-like Keledones - mechanical golden "sirens" made by Hephaestus (wonder what Flint Lafosse would say) for the 3rd Delphic temple... which according to Pindar.. "the gods hid within the earth, which they opened up with a thunderbolt" ( I keep hoping something is hidden in Maia). Just visualizing the Creators as Bird-Women and Thargoids as Bee-Dogs...

The Far God cult definitely saw the Thargoids as messengers/intermediaries ... preparing they way for their god to arrive.. Through a cosmic gate perhaps?

I seem to remember that it was indicated that Thargoids were possibly communicating using some "telepathic" means or something like that ... And it seems these "creators" might be as well ? To borrow a quote from our favorite tinfoiler Mr Bentonio "Thargoids have been exerting direct influence over human society. Everything that is happening is unfolding according to their plan. Soon, it will be too late!"

I hear they are swarming in the Pleiades...




On a side note here is a nice article about the Myth of the First Temples at Delphi:
Sourvinou-Inwood, Christiane. “The Myth of the First Temples at Delphi.” The Classical Quarterly, vol. 29, no. 2, 1979, pp. 231–251. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/638091.
