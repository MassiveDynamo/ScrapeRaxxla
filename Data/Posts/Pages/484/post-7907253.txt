Yeah. Must be a little bit of everything you say, guys. Simpler answer being often the best. Kind of bug... Must be..
A system I visited. Honked and bookmarked one of its bodies. Then I auto-destructed. And, for some technical reason, the bookmark remained. As well as the possibility to see the system map, even when marked as unexplored.
Weird things of ED...

Or the Gods of the Galaxy are sending me a sign to push me to go there and investigate... The thing is I am an agnostic and so I don't believe in them.
But is also a very down-to-earth cryptographic technique . This .)

How can we do that ? I am trying but no way I can do it...

Bookmarks only go if you manually delete them.

I had a load of Unexplored bookmarks for a while, but know exactly how they got there.

They were from a pre 3.3 (around 2.1 maybe) trip.

Was travelling somewhere so was jumping and honking. Bookmarked interesting systems to come back to. They were mainly undiscovered systems.

As it was honk only for those systems, they still show as Unexplored after handing in the explo data.

Surface scanning but ship being destroyed before handing in explo data would result in the same thing I would think.

If you can see the system map I would suspect that you’re in the former type of scenario not the latter. Can’t be sure without testing though.
