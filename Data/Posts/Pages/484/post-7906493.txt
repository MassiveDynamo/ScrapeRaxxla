Saw this asked a couple pages back, but jumping to another system through the eye of a BH yields nothing (Mis-jump)

Tried/tested
Maybe only some BH's act as wormholes - possibly try this in the maya system as the BH is (apparently) surrounded by thargoids who may have come through it. Possibly a wormhole straight to a permit locked area
I'm up there at the moment but won't be able to play until tomorrow, so may give it a go then.
