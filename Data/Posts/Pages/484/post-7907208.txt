Yeah. Must be a little bit of everything you say, guys. Simpler answer being often the best. Kind of bug... Must be..
A system I visited. Honked and bookmarked one of its bodies. Then I auto-destructed. And, for some technical reason, the bookmark remained. As well as the possibility to see the system map, even when marked as unexplored.
Weird things of ED...

Or the Gods of the Galaxy are sending me a sign to push me to go there and investigate... The thing is I am an agnostic and so I don't believe in them.
(Well.. Scytale is a zealot of The True Belief, though.. But Scytale is also a very down-to-earth cryptographic technique . This .)

Like, if you've never been to Sol, but you know Earth is the third planet and it has 1 moon makin the moon sol 3 a. You could set a bookmark on sol 3 a without having ever been there.
How can we do that ? I am trying but no way I can manage it...
