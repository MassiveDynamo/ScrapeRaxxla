But an 'in-system' body bookmark? ' Trying with other unknown systems and it doesn't work. And zooming into ? Nope. That system also is empty. No planets nor moons... Weird.
How can you know there’s nothing inside the system if you’ve never been there? The system map would be inaccessible. So either a bug &/or you were destroyed there before scanning anything? No, more likely you entered, scanned, placed the in-system bookmark, then were destroyed before selling the data? What is the in-system bookmark on if you have no planets or moons showing??
The other possibility is that it’s due to an FD bug &/or you’ve got a bookmark from someone else, maybe a wing member? I remember when several bookmarks mysteriously appeared for everyone about a year ago due to a bug, theN they were removed. It’s not a squadron bookmark is it?
Do you have EDD? If so you could search for that system in your travel history & see what happened, search to see when/if you were destroyed etc
