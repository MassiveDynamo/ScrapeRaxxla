Maybe only some BH's act as wormholes - possibly try this in the maya system as the BH is (apparently) surrounded by thargoids who may have come through it. I'm up there at the moment but won't be able to play until tomorrow, so may give it a go then.

Haven't tried to jump through the Maia system BH, but did play with the lensing effect on nearby Nebulas to see if anything would be unveiled.

Same result, everytime, unfortunately.

I'd give it a go, but I'm about 3-4hrs travel time from the bubble ATM.
