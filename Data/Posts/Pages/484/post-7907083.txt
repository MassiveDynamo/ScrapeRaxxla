But an 'in-system' body bookmark? ' Trying with other unknown systems and it doesn't work. And zooming into ? Nope. That system also is empty. No planets nor moons... Weird.
I apologise, I meant you could bookmark the specific in system body because it was the search subject not the system itself. Is that better explained as to my meaning? Like, if you've never been to Sol, but you know Earth is the third planet and it has 1 moon makin the moon sol 3 a. You could set a bookmark on sol 3 a without having ever been there.

I'm not implying that this is what you did or suggesting you did this and then forgot in some way. Only saying that this is a method I know one could use to bookmark a body in a system without visiting the system.
