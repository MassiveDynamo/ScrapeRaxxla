Bookmarks only go if you manually delete them.

I had a load of Unexplored bookmarks for a while, but know exactly how they got there.

They were from a pre 3.3 (around 2.1 maybe) trip.

Was travelling somewhere so was jumping and honking. Bookmarked interesting systems to come back to. They were mainly undiscovered systems.

As it was honk only for those systems, they still show as Unexplored after handing in the explo data.

Surface scanning but ship being destroyed before handing in explo data would result in the same thing I would think.

If you can see the system map I would suspect that you’re in the former type of scenario not the latter. Can’t be sure without testing though.

@Scytale Just checked in game and I've still got a few bookmarks of that nature left.

They're all ones where I bookmarked the main star from the SysMap.

Just in case you don't spot it immediately, note that the bookmark symbol is one for a star, not for a system.

Here's one for reference:
