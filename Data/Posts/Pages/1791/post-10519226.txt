Its the 3rd of the Reith lectures (Black Holes), in the book 'Theory of Everything' the part on LGM-1 starts on Page 47.
I also have a paper somewhere he did with Sir Roger Penrose on pulsars, will try and dig it out.
Looking back now i wish i could have asked Professor Hawking if he knew where Raxxla was!
