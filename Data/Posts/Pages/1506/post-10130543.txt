Looking for systems which might act as a metaphorical interpretation or personification of the John Milton character ‘Sin’ and or ‘Death’ who built Lucifers viaduct.

I’m not attempting to exhibit any level of expertise in this field, (not religious in the slightest) just looking for potential matches in game, to see where they might fall in relation to other systems which might identify Lucifers viaduct!

The obvious first choice would be: Sin -23.09; -20.91; 17.84, but this is too close in my opinion to Sol and not far enough into the lower celestial sphere to warrant inclusion.

Sin is a person: some ontological metaphors in the Bible

‘This article discusses the ontological metaphors relating to the personification of sin in the Bible. It aims to explore the metaphorical conceptualisation of sin as a person, as suggested in the sin expressions. Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) Conceptual Metaphor Theory is used in analysing the data. The findings of the study indicate that sin is conceptualised as king, master, lord, paymaster, mother, and child. The use of these conceptual metaphors indicates that the writers of the selected biblical texts intended to project a deeper meaning of sin beyond the literal meaning of sin in daily language. The ontological metaphorical use of sin in the Bible seems to give a greater effect in comprehension to the reader of the texts.’

Obviously the reference scope needs to incorporate potential biblical, Greek, Roman and possibly Norse sources. If applicable I don’t expect such a link to be directly overt, but like Achlys metaphorical, any such affirmation may only be accepted if we can then place both ‘Sin and Death’ in relation to each other in game.

Again this is testing this Milton hypothesis not necessarily to prove it, it seems initially apparent such a mechanism would be too easy.

I’m not expecting much.
