Indeed, as Yelboc says, EDSM provides some information about systems visited to date. However although EDSM has been in existence since 2015 it is an optional tool so not everyone has been using it in their gameplay. So even if MB truly said that “the system containing Raxxla had been visited & honked but Raxxla was not discovered” we have no way of knowing when that happened or if the “almost discoverer” was reporting systems to EDSM at the time.

Although only a small part of the ED galaxy has been discovered (I think it’s still less than 1%) we have no idea when that “almost discovery” occured, it could have been on day one, or during many journeys out to Beagle Point and other extremities of the galaxy....so the alleged saying gives us absolutely no idea of where Raxxla might be. That system might be noted within EDSM’s database, or it may not.
