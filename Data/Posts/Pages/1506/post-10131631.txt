How much information about systems and player interaction is there? It's really tough trying to read through all of these posts and it might have been asked before but...

I've read that the system that Raxxla is in has been visited by at least 1 person unknowingly who honked and left. Is there a way to filter systems by "x" amount of unique players who have visited it?
The ability to track which star you have visited was not a mechanism available at launch.

Also remember that not every player downloads their data to those 3rd party tools. Which themselves only came into existence sometime after launch.

So ultimately there exists a period of time where there was no data being recorded.
