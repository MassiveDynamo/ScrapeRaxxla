Razrla => Radium/Zirconium/Lanthane (elements : 88 40 57)
"xx" could be a placeholder, doesn't Frontier absolutely love placeholders?
XX could be wildcards so another option is something like Raksla. Sounds the same but different letters. Part of my current conjecture (cant even dignify it by calling it a hypothesis!) & hence need for an anagram solver. I need to test a string of letters against all known system in-game names. An online anagram resolver is of no use since they’re based on a standard English dictionary not a database of ED system names.
About a year ago I manually tested “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars” for anagrams against a Spansh search for systems within about 100ly from Sol & was overwhelmed. Need to automate that testing.
Edit
I had 90+ matches within 64ly of Sol....
