How much information about systems and player interaction is there? It's really tough trying to read through all of these posts and it might have been asked before but...

I've read that the system that Raxxla is in has been visited by at least 1 person unknowingly who honked and left. Is there a way to filter systems by "x" amount of unique players who have visited it?
This comes from a report by CMDR Ascorbius as being said by Michael Brookes in a private meeting at Elitecon. We only have his word for it ofc (no other confirmations for others and nothing from Mr Bookes himself). No way to do that filtering in game. EDSM will give some stats on player reported visits for each system.
