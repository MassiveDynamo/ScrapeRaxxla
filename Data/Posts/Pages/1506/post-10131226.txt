It's wasn't as much changing as adding. Player factions were allowed to submit a system description for their home system. FD then edited the texts (mostly shortened) and added them to the game. I don't think many of these systems had any description, before player factions.
I was part of the writing group that made the description for Varati (player faction Canonn). We made up a bit of history for the system. FD approved most of it and put it in.

Yes there were very few ingame descriptions to begin with but after player descriptions were allowed some were written over ( i remember at the time going back to some systems and seeing the text replaced… dont ask me which systems now)… some were added to or changed i think. The essence being though that any use like Jorki is asking for is gone. I was hoping for a while that they would implement a procedural descriptions for all the blank ones at one point - but ya the player factions happened and yeah…
