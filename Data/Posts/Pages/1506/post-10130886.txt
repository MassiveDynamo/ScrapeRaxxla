Is there a database of system descriptions anywhere?
I’m intrigued to see if statuettes crop anywhere other than Grandmort...
Ya i dont think there is a good db of system descriptions it doesnt look like ed discovery collects it- and with the proliferation of “player factions” and letting them change the descriptions i think many of the few system descriptions that were actually put in the game originally have been altered or destroyed.
