Re PC can’t really no… not with time permitting (free time / RL). Time is pretty limited for me. Besides I’ve had to perform a full wipe of the game, all files are gone….long story but FD have been great and they may have found a fix…

The Outer Rim, is just one of a number of rhetorical questions. It likely was poetic license, or long since binned content… who knows, but I’d like to assess it in relation to a number of other factors, as I feel there is something literally ‘written’ in the star placements… eg Brookes Yggdrasil or something else; it may not relate to Raxxla, but still such elements may only become relevant when viewed together.

I certainly believe Brookes to have placed certain stars to map out the hemisphere of the Miltons pendant universe… with Pandemonium at its base…

Eg obfuscated on the outer rim of the sphere of influence from Tau Ceti…in other words which systems fall just outside this area but are still accessible at that… could be someplace just beyond say Tau Ceti etc..


All is likely balderdash, but is it? It could identify something/ it may not. Half the fun is looking, upto this point for me it’s been an internal thought exercise, and I’ve been distracted so many times - I’d just like to put it to paper.

Technically I don’t need access to game to do this mapping, just a good free GIS tool that allows entry of simple XYZ locations. I can’t use my ‘work’ tools for various reasons, so I was going to undertake the plotting ‘freehand’ - unless anyone knows of a good / safe 3d plotting GIS system?
