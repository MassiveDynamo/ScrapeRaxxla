Jaques Station also originated in this system. It is the only Orbis type station to have drives... one possible soloution to where the Dark Wheel station is/was... may be that it is/was Jaques Station.... as Jaques re-appropriated an out of date / delapidated station...?

Well, if you find a station with a Tesla Roadster (along with any of the still missing thefts) ... that is their station. The Interplanetary Roadtrip beacon in Sol hints that it was stolen.
