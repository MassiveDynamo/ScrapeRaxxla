Just a note, Raxxla was apparently in Elite....Alpha Hydri system was always a game crash system and the only system in the game not able to enter to look at or take logs from, Now Elite Dangerous Alpha Hydri permit locked since gamma due to another crash that happened when released (Everyone flocked there as they couldn't in Elite and though hmmm)...see the pattern
There's a lot that was in the old games that is still lurking if you know where to look. That being said, there are four systems from Frontiers that I cannot find in Elite Dangerous. One or more may have been blown to bits by way of Jackson's Lighthouse (it formerly was Federal system before two stars merged to form the neutron star). I need to check when exactly Charick Drift formed. With Jackson's Lighthouse it was 2672.
