Nope no luck whit Jacksons cave. tryed to find it like whit the Comets but no luck. tryed to hunt down a strange Sound that i not hear in any other System, No luck either (It seems to be attached to the JetCone however). I have spend days in Jackson's Light House found nothing. Was convinced that finding it would tell me something on how Raxxla can be found.
But i am on fire now whit the "Sell the right Exploration Data to the right faction" thing. i have some systems in mind
