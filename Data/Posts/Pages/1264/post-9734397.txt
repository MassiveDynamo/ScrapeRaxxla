Morning.. just scooped some quirium and docked at the edge of civilization in Whadros. Hurray for escaping pirates and caching in a ton of exploration data, intel vouchers, etc. Anyways, looks like a whole lot of the older stuff is valid. Give me a few minutes and will dredge up those missing systems from Frontiers with descriptions and see if that can help out narrow down what we are looking for.


Quirium
The standard fuel used in most hyperspace engines, Made by combining anti-neutrinos with normal hydrogen, It is often referred to as simply hydrogen fuel.
