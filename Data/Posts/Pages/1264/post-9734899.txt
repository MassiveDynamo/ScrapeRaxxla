See the thing about the distance they could of travelled I thin may be hit or miss, although they may not have reached raxxla due to hyperspace limits tat doesn't take away the fact they may have found the location of it, via probes, advanced telescopes and other lucrative methods, after all they had star charts and system data for places way beyond their reach, Galmap for instance knows the location and star maps of some systems Humanity has never reached before, the Pilots fed have Permits locking out zones of space at times where they wouldn't have even be reached yet, If you look up the dates of hyperspace travel, times, resources and jump ranges versus lets say the Hyponia and other regions also near Beagle these areas where permit locked but no way could have been reached at the time they where...so why permit lock them if you didn't know what was there beforehand due to other ways

Even going on that, Galmap itself....how does it work regarding Lore, it seems to know the exact location of stars that CMDR's have never even been to yet, by first discovery tags being a basis to draw the lore from their either a lie (we weren't the real first to discover otherwise they wouldn't have been in galmap yet or there location wouldn't be exact) or whoever created galmap had some way of either being at the locations somehow to input the data or "Insert secret alien tech here"

The Mars relic could be

1. the tech used to create galmap

2. from this Raxxla location found/mentioned or something although never actually reached

Using this, the location may be known and rumor's flew out, for all anyone knows Raxxla itself could be out past Beagle someone secrectly just learned of its existance.

The Tech that created Galmap could even be part of Raxxla itself! (Hence being used by a sinister cabal creating permits and locking systems with permits) this could even be used in lore as a way to hide Raxxla as a system unless you where within distance to see it
