There's a lot that was in the old games that is still lurking if you know where to look. That being said, there are four systems from Frontiers that I cannot find in Elite Dangerous. One or more may have been blown to bits by way of Jackson's Lighthouse (it formerly was Federal system before two stars merged to form the neutron star). I need to check when exactly Charick Drift formed. With Jackson's Lighthouse it was 2672.
Jacksons cave is a mystery in itself, you can search it but no one has found it yet...its in there...somewhere, we found Haleys comet though so people are getting there
