No, you misunderstand. Like the system probably exists in Elite Dangerous but under new names. I think we'll have to rely upon descriptions to find these. Also, will be including Cemiess (also near Achenar) which supposedly lost some planets on the outskirts of the system

Sorry was updating word process and will get a PDF together in a bit.
