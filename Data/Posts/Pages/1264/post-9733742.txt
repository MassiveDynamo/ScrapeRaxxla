Jaques Station also originated in this system, whose gas giant / y-class brown dwarf does have 8 moons. It is the only Orbis type starport to have active drives...that allowed it to move after construction, as all other Orbis are stationary after completion.

One possible solution to where the Dark Wheel station is/was... may be that it is/was Jaques Station, it is never stated if it was brand new, or simply an older station from that system?
