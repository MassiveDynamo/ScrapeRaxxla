Thinking of "immortality" as a concept, there is a surefire way to achieve it:
Become a Myth or Legend, it will be spread and become immortal, like the "RAXXLA" Legend did.
Also the "8" is when tilted by 90Â° a symbol for infinity, as is the "Ankh" a cross with a loop at the top section,
a symbol from egypt...

Edit:
If you zoom in on this pic, you see a dark graphical artifact, which was omnipresent in that asteroid belt
"following" me, is it just a bug, or maybe a lead?
