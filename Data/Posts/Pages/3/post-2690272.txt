Hee hee, was just about to ask the same question.

I'm just thinking off the top of my head here, but there may be similarities to the problem of finding Raxxla, and the purpose of the UA. Not saying they are connected in any way, but one of the theories around the UA is that it might be some sort of scanner that could find a "dark system" or "dark planet", i.e. one that does not appear on the Galaxy Map or System Map respectively. If Raxxla is a "dark system", or a "dark world" in a known system, there might be a need for a similar type of scanner (perhaps envisaged with future content, i.e planetary landings and the like) to be able to locate it.

Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, it may simply be on the map under a completely different name.

Just a random thought, FWIW.
