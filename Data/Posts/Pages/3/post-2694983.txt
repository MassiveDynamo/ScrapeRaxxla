Climb Jacob's Ladder and there is a gateway to another world.
When you enter you are greated by Many Eyes where you can give them a gift.
This place doesn't really exist but it's there.
It's a myth.

"place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth."

So, yeah, Jaques station could quite easily be the key to the gateway.
Whichever planet it settles at, thats Raxxla and the path it's travelling is the ladder.

I bet it even has a rare plant for trading on the other side of the gateway, lol.
