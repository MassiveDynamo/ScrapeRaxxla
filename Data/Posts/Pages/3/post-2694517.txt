Heya, those books/stories you are reading are made up by the author/s.
Drew is known for using latin and ancient references in his stories.
How much of that FD used is unknown cos its not canon.

The Oolite Saga by Drew and any of the Oolite fan fiction is definitely not canon. (Edit: But some good reading nonetheless. Same with the Alioth wiki, some of it is canon and some is fan written/edited so difficult to tell the difference).

The new books, like Elite Reclamation (Drew) and Out of the Darkness (John Harper), are. They were commissioned by FD to be the basis of the new lore for Elite Dangerous.

This is from the book The Dark Wheel.

" Rafe chuckled and shook his head. 'You see, that's the big question. Your father was chasing the mythical plant Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life "

And that is definitely canon.
