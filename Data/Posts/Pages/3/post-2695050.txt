Found something on the Alioth Wiki.

Raxxla

The planet Raxxla. It is fabled to be a gateway to other universes, or at the very least a portal to somewhere else in the galaxy. Many parties actively search for Raxxla, but no-one has ever found it.
(related legends: 'shan ri la', 'the 7 planets of gold' and 'the whitehole, the wellspring of eternal life')

Maybe it's unrelated but "the 7 planets of gold" sounds suspicious.
