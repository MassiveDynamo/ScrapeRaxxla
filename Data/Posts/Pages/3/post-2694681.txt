I and I Redeye said:
Maybe that station is Raxxla?

Hmm, Raxxla is supposedly a planet;however entering Jacques with an UA could be a good test, if Jacques really turns out to be a gateway leading to Raxxla for ships holding an UA...

There's no mention of Jacques station in the UA wiki, so this would be a new test.

Allright, ramping up Timocani UA efforts to search level 2.
