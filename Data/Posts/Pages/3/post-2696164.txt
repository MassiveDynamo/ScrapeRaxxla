Just found the obfuscated mission about the place that isn't a place and decided to look it up as I had never seen a mission with writing like that...and I found this thread. This type of stuff is the coolest **** I have ever seen in a game. That being said, does anyone else wonder that maybe the Thargoids know where Raxxla is and perhaps used it to escape human reach ala Frontier: First Encounters?

Yes, there's a lot of wondering going on atm
