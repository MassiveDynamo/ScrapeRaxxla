Great pictures, Julio!
If I may come with a suggestion: Take the pictures from the Debug view, that way you'll don't see the cockpit.

Open the GalMap, and simply scroll to the coordinates, sadly the ones I suggested is a grid containing no stars.

SPOILER

Ahoy lad!
I'll use the external view more often from now on

How did you get the coords shown?
I'll try to add up the coordinates and see what comes out like this:

RA = X
XX= Y
LA = Z

Edit:
OK i activated the grid,
absolutely nothing at:

X = +/- 181
Y = +/- 2424 (too high/low)
Z = +/- 121

Edit:
By just adding i come up with:
X = +/- 19
Y = +/- 48
Z = +/- 13

Too much in the area, two times a system with the "GD" designation.
Hmm... not sure this will lead somewhere,
funny thing is when i use my method of RA/dec i only have a target on one axis,
the other one is not mapped yet, thus not in E: D with a clean designation.

I checked the "Herculis-constellation" lead system,
but the other one is in the constellation "Sagittarius"....

Here is a fitting song:

Edit2:
The second possible grid might be close to the "Lagoon Nebula",
i'll have a look.
