Hmm, Raxxla is supposedly a planet;however entering Jacques with an UA could be a good test, if Jacques really turns out to be a gateway leading to Raxxla for ships holding an UA...

Allright, ramping up Timocani UA efforts to search level 2.

Dark wheel novel always mentions a station and a planet but never says which.
This new gateway is being moved into position next to the celestial body. The 2 work together.

Plant could be a clue about the planet obv.
Maybe we should check the rares for clues?

Yeah I'm going looking for UA too, lol


Edit:


" .... on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes,"


Missions talk about a celestial body.

Would mean we can get to Raxxla but can't use the gateway till atmospheric landings are ready if FD went with this version.
