I and I Redeye said:
Maybe that station is Raxxla?

I rather think of the station being a gateway to "Raxxla",
there is very strong imagery used in this galatic riddle:
The "Sun" and the "Moon".

The "Sun" is present in most systems, some kind of generator?
It also is a symbol for light, our "bright wheel" galaxy?

The "Moon" is a "hunter" in german mythology, never stopping, allways moving,
dancing with the "Sun" hunting and teasing it.
The "Moon" also is most apparent, when it is nightfall,
but both objects may be seen from earth during early day or late eve.
It could be a symbol for the "Dark Wheel".

I bet Jaque's station is the "Moon", also "Jaque" again is another variant of "Jacob"....
