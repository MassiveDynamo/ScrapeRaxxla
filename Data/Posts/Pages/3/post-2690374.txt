Hee hee, was just about to ask the same question.

I'm just thinking off the top of my head here, but there may be similarities to the problem of finding Raxxla, and the purpose of the UA. Not saying they are connected in any way, but one of the theories around the UA is that it might be some sort of scanner that could find a "dark system" or "dark planet", i.e. one that does not appear on the Galaxy Map. If Raxxla is a "dark system", or a "dark world" in a known system, there might be a need for a similar type of scanner (perhaps envisaged with future content, i.e planetary landings and the like) to be able to locate it.

Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, it may simply be on the map under a completely different name.

Just a random thought, FWIW.

To be frank,
"Dark" might also mean or referr to "has no sun".
And a system without a sun is dark, but might harbor a black hole or neutron star....
Biggest reactor in the game, enjoying some riddling and a good conversation here

Overthinking mode activated:
I found an excerpt from the "Dark Wheel" mentioning that there where 8 connections with/from/to "RAXXLA"
but one got destroyed and "RAXXLA" vanished/ travelled.
They also mentioned "but the moon is still there." in that excerpt.
Sleipnir, the mythological steed of Odin is an 8-legged horse and travels through "8 dimensions".
This gives me the shivers.

I love a good riddle

Edit again:
The word is "RAXXLA", how did it originate?
Is it simply a birth of necessity?
"Gimme a good name for a sci-fi story based planet or contraption, from an alien perspective!"
"How about "raxxla"?"

Maybe.
I wonder why it is called "RAXXLA", are we missing letters because of information decay, being
passed on over the ages?

RAXXLA
RALAXX
GALAXY
