I didn't know at the time of novell: Dark Wheel and game: Elite 1 that anything other than Coriolis existed.
I think that may be the case. Which makes this little naming quirk all the maddening - the term " Ring" is used with Coriolis. Outposts may have existed as I believe even in-game Coriolis had been converted to outposts.

ANY orbital stations type containing " Ring":
EDSM - Elite Dangerous Star Map
The Galactic Positioning System of Elite: Dangerous at your service.
www.edsm.net

1,468 results with all types represented INCLUDING outposts and Coriolis.

{sigh}

Why the hell would you do that? Fortunately, adding in asteroid bases does not increase results.
