If it does, then on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life . . ."

Now we know what were looking for.... LOL
My translation of that piece of text from the novel is somewhat different.
Did you miss anything?
Sorry, my translator malfunctioned. But it clearly says that there is a gate at Raxxla.
I think there's just a typo in the text:
Plant ... Planet
