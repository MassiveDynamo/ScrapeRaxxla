In regards to the older games and lore, it’s commonly accepted and at least ascribed to by Allen Stroud who assisted FD to tie it together, that if it is not ‘in game’ currently, eg referenced in game, it’s not canon.

From the DW Codex: ‘The station was toroid, hence 'wheel', and operated with a minimal power output so as to avoid detection, hence 'dark'.

Toroid - a doughnut-shaped object.

There are 3 types or stations which utilises a ring (doughnut) or hab ring, these are:

Orbis: the oldest station design, originating during the early years of the Federation. The Orbis was first introduced in Elite 2.

Ocellus: dated 3260 by Imperial ship manufacturer Gutamaya.

O'Neill Cylinders: unsure if these exist in game (? confirm please ?) no data is available to confirm, other than a YouTube video?

Based upon the temporal reference it’s more likely to be an Orbis. By the impression that said station is ‘dark’ it likely does not appear on scanners so one would likely have to eyeball it, or trip over it, there are plenty of gas giants in game with eight moons, a brown dwarf is also categorised as a gas giant.

Good luck hunting O7.
