Those screen savers are still there for everyone, running in the background. I’m now on PS4 Legacy, and time and again I see all 3 versions

On your PC account one can find the loading screen vids in the game folders.

The screen savers have been investigated previously, but nothing concrete, it’s subjective but it’s possible these might be relevant, or they are just composited, who knows!
