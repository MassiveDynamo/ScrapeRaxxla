I think that may be the case. Which makes this little naming quirk all the maddening - the term " Ring" is used with Coriolis. Outposts may have existed as I believe even in-game Coriolis had been converted to outposts.

ANY orbital stations type containing " Ring":

1,468 results with all types represented INCLUDING outposts and Coriolis.

{sigh}

Why the hell would you do that? Fortunately, adding in asteroid bases does not increase results.

The Codex clearly says The Dark Wheel organisation existed from the earliest days of space travel, and that they operated from a disused wheel station since their earliest days.

This pre-dates Galcop, and the Coriolis by hundreds of years.

If the Codex is accurate, then the original wheel station still exists. But given that it's wise to assume it ws likely quite small by our standards then it could literally be inside another structure by now, even a megaship,. Since The Dark Wheel is very far from a rag tag band that needs to hide in an old starport now, the original station could be within one of our modern stations and we'd never know, or a megaship built around it and DW jump it around...

Unfortunately like all parts of this hunt, the answer is always: by now it could be anything or anywhere, if what little we do have can even be believed.
