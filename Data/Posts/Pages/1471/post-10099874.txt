I didn't know at the time of novell: Dark Wheel and game: Elite 1 that anything other than Coriolis existed.
In some (most) versions of Elite, there were also a few dodecahedron stations. The original BBC version probably didn't have them, due to memory restrictions.

With regards to the lore we have to remember that the TDW novel and the Elite game are confined to Galcop space. We know very little of the equipment used in the Federation and Empire, at this time.
