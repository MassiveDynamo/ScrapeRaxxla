This link is interesting, can’t get on Elite now but shall be investigating further when time permits. https://plus.maths.org/content/spiralling-stars

Several people have brought up WR 104. It was a well-known star system when the game came out (it had even been in the news a couple times).
However, neither "WR 104" nor any of its other names seem to be in the game.

It should be about 7500ly from earth, surrounded by a nebula.
The "coordinates" for it are "18h 02m 04.07s, −23° 37′ 41.2″", in the constellation Sagittarius as seen from earth.
I don't know how you'd look for such a thing in Elite.
