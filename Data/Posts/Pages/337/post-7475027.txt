This Elite status requisite thing is absolutely not canon. Not E nor 3E. The thing was that you need it to unlock SD in order to gain access to TDW faction (until recently) and the (also obsolete) E/F missions. That's all.
Oh, and of course, a well known YT "influencer" said,years ago, that he was pretty sure where Raxxla is and would set up an expedition as soon as he worked his 3E. Which was needed.
As far as I know... he is still 2E, streaming other games play most part of the time and very evasive when I ask him when we are setting the sails to Raxxla. [haha]
So, nothing says we need E. Afaik.

I don’t know what’s canon or not anymore with all the retcons, but this started with Holdstock’s The Dark Wheel: “‘One thing's for sure,' Rafe went on drily. 'Unless you get there, unless you become élite, you'll never get to Raxxla. ”
