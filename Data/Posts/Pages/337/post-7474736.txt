If anyone is tripple elite it might be worth a look about (I am only double Elite and so the Dark Wheel may not contact me.... do you just need to be elite or 3 or 4 times over??).

This Elite status requisite thing is absolutely not canon. Not E nor 3E. The thing was that you need it to unlock SD in order to gain access to TDW faction (until recently) and the (also obsolete) E/F missions. That's all.
Oh, and of course, a well known YT "influencer" said,years ago, that he was pretty sure where Raxxla is and would set up an expedition as soon as he worked his 3E. Which was needed.
As far as I know... he is still 2E, streaming other games play most part of the time and very evasive when I ask him when we are setting the sails to Raxxla. [haha]
So, nothing says we need E. Afaik.
