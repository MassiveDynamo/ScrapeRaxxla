Unfortunately some PS4-specific bugs are making this "less fun" for me than I was hoping for, so I'm going to have to put this operation on hold. That and we'll cover more ground in the grand scheme if I continue on doing what I have been doing for the last few months, which may turn up clues to Raxxla through dumb luck / brute force. This operation is currently classified, but if I do find anything of interest, I will share it.

Speaking of, besides the 8th moon orbiting a gas giant close to a red star, along with obvious signs like planets labeled "Raxxla", what else would be considered "anything of interest" in a system map and / or FSS scan?

Well, listening posts of course. Perhaps new generation ships (from what FDev said about them I think there may be more. One was found pretty recently so could be there are some we still haven’t found), tip off missions that raise your spidey senses.
Looking at the picture of TDW (personally I’m not convinced it’s a picture of the actual station as opposed to an engine created image. Seems there’s more detail in the star than we see in game, unless they’ve darkened an actual image to make it look more menacing) the closest ones to that star would seem to be really cold m class or supergiant carbon stars. Which are pretty rare but they’re big, really red, and have a lot of ejections.
