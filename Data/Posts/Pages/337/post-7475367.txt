Oh for sure yeah, if I come across anything of note I’ll be sure to chime in. Or if you’re mentioning of going somewhere I’ve checked allready I’ll let ya know. What I’m doing is setting my route to hop only Stars I’ve not visited, and plot economy courses (that way 100ly takes like 15 jumps) from sol to 100ly out. Then turn around and repeat.

Unfortunately some PS4-specific bugs are making this "less fun" for me than I was hoping for, so I'm going to have to put this operation on hold. That and we'll cover more ground in the grand scheme if I continue on doing what I have been doing for the last few months, which may turn up clues to Raxxla through dumb luck / brute force. This operation is currently classified, but if I do find anything of interest, I will share it.

Speaking of, besides the 8th moon orbiting a gas giant close to a red star, along with obvious signs like planets labeled "Raxxla", what else would be considered "anything of interest" in a system map and / or FSS scan?
