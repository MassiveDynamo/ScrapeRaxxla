Just jumping in here: what about the Guardians? Do you think they were added in the game for no reason? And a race that large that occupied a region of space as large as our bubble just up and disappeared because some AI killed them? I hardly think so. I think they found Raxxla/made Raxxla and used it to escape to another galaxy. That would explain their complete disappearance and make complete sense as they wanted to escape the Thargoids. Many and most did get wiped out but the last remaining used Raxxla to escape. That would give a good reason for their inclusion, disappearance as well as the "riches" on the other side of Raxxla: on that side is a friendly advanced race with powerful technology, on the other side of Raxxla is guardian ships, guardian modules and guardian . It makes perfect sense to me. The dark wheel then is collaborating with the guardians, in fact some guardians are part of the dark wheel and protect Raxxla because of course just bringing to humanities and now the Thargoids attention would ruin the whole respite of Raxxla now wouldn't it?
