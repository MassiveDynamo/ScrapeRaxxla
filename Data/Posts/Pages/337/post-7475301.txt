In this desperate times I have consulted I Ching and asked it: "Where is Raxxla?"

It said:

Fu / Return

Thunder regenerates deep within Earth's womb:
Sage rulers recognized that the end of Earth's seasonal cycle was also the starting point of a new year and a time for dormancy.
They closed the passes at the Solstice to enforce a rest from commerce and activity.
The ruler himself did not travel.

You have passed this way before but you are not regressing.
This is progress, for the cycle now repeats itself, and this time you are aware that it truly is a cycle.
The return of old familiars is welcome.
You can be as sure of this cycle as you are that seven days bring the start of a new week.
Use this dormancy phase to plan which direction you will grow.

Translation:

Sol system will be attacked.
Thargoids are back again, and they are using wormholes.
Hive ships are not in the game yet.
Run while you can, because something worse is following them.
