Can anyone confirm that this is in-game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_Pegasi

EDDB doesn't find LL Pegasi (but several Pegasi systems), nor 2MASS J23191260+1711331.

According to the article it should be ~4200 ly from Sol.

Did you try the IRAS 23166+1655.

I have seen many of those.

Edit: Got in game for a moment and couldn't find it but maybe it has an NGC equivalent.

There are even more names for it. A think I've seen a lot of those designation types in game.

I'm going to visit this right now but I can only find one instance in the game of a system type called NAME. it's 2883 away from my current location in the bubble. If my game will stop crashing. I just had to install over with the steam varient. Not a good idea when using wine.
