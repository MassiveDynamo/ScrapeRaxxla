Seems we had the same idea, or pretty close.

Great minds think alike! Very similar, but I don’t think it’s Sag A*. I’ve spent a couple of weeks in a 60ly Krait getting here on DW2; it’s too far from the bubble to be Raxxla. I think Raxxla is either very close to the bubble, say within 200ly from Sol, or further out but not too far & somewhere a little bit obvious- say NGC 7822. Don’t think it’s Maia, seem to remember I accidentally went exploring inside that BH when I first visited about 3 years ago & didn’t get transported anywhere. Though don’t think I suffered any damage , whereas apparently Sag A* will damage (or so I’ve heard).

edit: though I might try to confirm that about Sag A* while I’m docked at a station with repair facilities!

edit2: and if I end up in the Andromeda galaxy being pursued by the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, or in the harem of one of the lizard women, I’ll blame Scytale!

edit3: changed my mind, not worth the bother, browsing over breakfast I find it’s already been done several times, here’s one https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RwVdCzuc2u4
