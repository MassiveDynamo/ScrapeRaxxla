Several people have brought up WR 104. It was a well-known star system when the game came out (it had even been in the news a couple times).
However, neither "WR 104" nor any of its other names seem to be in the game.

It should be about 7500ly from earth, surrounded by a nebula.
The "coordinates" for it are "18h 02m 04.07s, −23° 37′ 41.2″", in the constellation Sagittarius as seen from earth.
I don't know how you'd look for such a thing in Elite.

Wolf-Rayet class stars is mostly the idea I was point out considering WR-104 was shown as a Spiraling Star and other link that mentions not all WR star do spiral. But I had found out there are not many WR stars close to the bubble the 3 that had any significance that I had personally check myself

WR 136 4000ly's away from sol - I was hoping to find of line of systems close by that would resemble this systems name. And checked the system itself.

Phi Persei - which is 700+ ly's away from sol that is by or apart of the Perseus constellation.

And Lawd 26, Gliese 293 B star which is just 22 ly's away from Sol - which I'm currently doing missions at Stone's Legacy to see if I can pop off some important tip off missions. The station from what I been told is a Ocellus Starport that uses low power output to power the station. I figure imo is the best spot to start.

Basically I am going by the idea on codex Spiralling Star is refering to Wolf-Rayet class stars.
