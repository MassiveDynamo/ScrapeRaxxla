Ughkoff: No you can't supercruise into another system - this has been demonstrated ad nauseam.

There is a list of permit locked systems on these fora:

google is your friend.

Edelgard: Misjumps - these are in game - specifically Jacques's jump to colonia and Halsley's starship one mis-jump. However these weren't player mis-jumps and so in that regard you are correct - at least never heard it reported - you can't mis-jump your ship like you could in the original game. But from a lore point of view it seems that its possible for ships to end up far from where they were programmed to be.
