google is your friend.

I'm a little sorry, but your data is not correct, or not supplemented.
The picture shows a spreadsheets from your source, the second picture shows Inara. According to Inara, there was a live person in the system with the ED connector included. Your source does not reflect the information about how live person got there.
As you can see, Google is not a friend, just a tool.. Riddles in the Elite require not a standard thinking.
