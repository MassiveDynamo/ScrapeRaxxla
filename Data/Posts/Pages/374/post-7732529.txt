Do not confuse exploration with jump range, which is just a tool for explorers. Exploration is not dependent on engineering upgrades. Exploration is about getting out in the black to previously unvisited locations, then investigating and mapping them.

I think that Noobilite's point was that the increased jump range could open up new opportunities to explore previously unreachable parts of the galaxy. Think about the Distant Stars expedition that would have been impossible without the introduction extending jump range via neutron stars it would have been impossible to reach AH Cancri since the jump was around 220 light-years. These new jump ranges mean that even more areas, previously beyond reach, will be open for exploration.

Personally I'm just fine in my explorawinder so I can pick up on some of those systems that the guys in the exploracondas pass over but sometimes you just need the extra reach.
