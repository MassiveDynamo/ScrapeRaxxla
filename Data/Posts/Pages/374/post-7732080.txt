I'm a little sorry, but your data is not correct, or not supplemented.
The picture shows a spreadsheets from your source, the second picture shows Inara. According to Inara, there was a live person in the system with the ED connector included. Your source does not reflect the information about how live person got there.
As you can see, Google is not a friend, just a tool.. Riddles in the Elite require not a standard thinking.
This is "probably" a case of the controlling faction for HIP 54530 originally being present in other systems as well as their own, from which cmdrs will have been able to gain rep with them and obtain the permit. The BGS then forces HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group to retreat. Now they are only present in their own permit locked system and no new cmdrs can gain rep to get the permit. If you have the permit from the past you can happily enter the system otherwise you can't.
