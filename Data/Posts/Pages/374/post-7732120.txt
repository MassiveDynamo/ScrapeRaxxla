This is "probably" a case of the controlling faction for HIP 54530 originally being present in other systems as well as their own, from which cmdrs will have been able to gain rep with them and obtain the permit. The BGS then forces HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group to retreat. Now they are only present in their own permit locked system and no new cmdrs can gain rep to get the permit. If you have the permit from the past you can happily enter the system otherwise you can't.
perhaps you `re right. Unfortunately, I joined after the game's release, and did not find the moment on kickstart ... but I came across information, where it was said that on kickstart people immediately got access to Shinrarta Dezhra and there was another group of people who might have made large amoun into the project, and maybe they got this system (HIP 54530 ). And system is blocked by account level. Therefore, it would not be bad if the player had an understanding of where the system (or region) is closed for further development, and where systems are locked for a key, etc. This information would save us time.

The Witch's Reach system was from the very beginning; I did not meet it earlier in previous versions of the game or novels. It is close to the Sun, which for humanity was initially far away, Gas giant and two stars have specific names and if the utilities show reliable information, this is the only system in the habitable bubble where no one has ever been. Hence, my keen interest in this issue.
