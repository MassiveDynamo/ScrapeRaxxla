Did anyone see that Etienne Dorn now does life support lightweight. Some things say tier 5 and some tier 4. This means lori jameson is no longer the only means to max exploration. That means combat rank is now not required to explore at max. I thought this meant the idea that having no combat rank couldn't stop you from finding Raxxla. In fact it made me think it was required. This changes that potentially. Combat rank is now optional for max exploration again potentially.

BTW, when did this happen and does he have tier 5 lightweight or only tier 4? He's in colonia.

Coriolos has him listed as tier 5. The wiki has him listed as tier 4.

I'm hoping tier 5 is open now.
