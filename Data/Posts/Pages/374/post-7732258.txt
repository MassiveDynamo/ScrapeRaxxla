How the hell have we been doing exploration this whole time without tier 5 ligthweight on something? You would think it would have been scouted out already and found at all cost.

Either way, this means anaconda now has over 83.99ly jump range. Maybe this opens up new places to explore.

New max conda: https://s.orbis.zone/2rxh <-New max range is now 84.11ly, 126.165ly/336.44ly White/Neutron Star boost, 105.1375ly/126.165ly/168.22ly with 25%/50%/100% fsd boosters. Does this open up any new areas?

If we only had lighter sensors. We could get rid of drive distributor and get more range. Maybe one day we will be able to pick more sensor types.

BTW, if we could install 1D sensors this is what we would get: https://s.orbis.zone/2rxq <- 86.14ly max jump range.

Again, this opens up the potential of no combat rating for raxxla hunting and max exploration builds. Although it goes against what happened in the Dark Wheel book. If that matters.
