Did anyone see that Etienne Dorn now does life support lightweight.

Seems Inara.cz is confirming that as well.

Something to keep in mind when I finally get to Colonia, cheers! Meanwhile, back in the bubble, there's another nine engineers that haven't appeared in the game at all, yet.

Click here, click Government, select Engineer and then Find Minor Factions...

Edit: And this is where one pinned recipe from each engineer comes in very handy of course, since lightweight Life Support has no experimental options I can use Lori Jameson's blueprint to G4 any ship, anywhere in the galaxy. All I need to do now is get allied with Etienne, pin his blueprint, and go home.

Hmm, I wonder what else Lori can do that I can pin instead?

Something else I found quite handy with that engineering change was getting G3 Dirty Drive experimental mods fitted by Felicity, then flying to the nearest station to finish them to G5 with Palin's pinned blueprint.

No more transferring expensive thrusters down to Maia and back, yay!
