You do know you can't supercruise from one system to another, nothing shows when you arrive. You have to make the jump so need the permit.
Doesn't super cruise work on open systems? I do not know that. I see it in the video with systems, an example if there is a closed territory for future content, they are empty, this is understandable (Polaris, Horsehead regions, several regions in Formidine Rift, etc.). One day, the developer will create there planets, structures, ... but here

Witch's reach is closed on itself, which is unusual and typical for with key systems. And unlike the closed systems, where just a star is indicated, there is a gas giant here and this is the only place in the habitable bubble where no human foot has ever stepped on during the whole game. This is certainly not Raxxla, but it may turn out to be similar to the Dark Wheel Encyclopedia photo.

by the way, where is there any tool or official list of objects that are closed for further development, and which are locked with keys, what systems were given to the kickstarters?. - it would be useful if people had an understanding of whether it makes sense to look for a key, or the system is not ready to accept a player (closed by the federation of pilots - this is a bit strange, since we have the majority of pilots already Elite, twice, thrice and four times .. "archangels"!!. And being at the peak of a career in this organization, they are barred from entering the system.)
