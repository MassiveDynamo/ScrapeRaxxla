Dark Wheel.. hmmm... Has anyone got to the Witch's Reach system? This is a closed system by the Pilots Federation. But unlike the closed regions with empty space, it has two stars and a gas giant (Ð¡auldron), very close to the star. The approximate travel time is about 3-4 hours, theoretically if take a tanker, we can get to this system. If there are any clues there, then we will understand that we need to find an admission to the system. Some example
