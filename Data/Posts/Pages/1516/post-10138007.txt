Be careful, secret societies used esoteric symbolism as emblems of power, which were openly communicated to establish status, control or attribute worth to their philosophy.

Some secret societies appropriate other philosophies and twist meaning to suit, others are imaginings of a secular ruling class, to hide activities from the hoi polloi.

Secret communication has always existed, but was primarily utilised by agents as it is today, as intelligence, either to spread discontent, or data; it is usually mundane and within plain sight.

Any open esoteric communication could be seen as a tool. If you want to keep a secret you don’t advertise it.

Information is power so when you see such esoteric language it’s usually actually misdirection, propaganda; a conspiracy of secret societies is itself a tool for control and confusion, how best hide a secret through misinformation.
