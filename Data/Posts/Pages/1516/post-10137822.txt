And just when I thought I might be able to help in this quest I realize I know nothing about this quest.... lol
Everyone starts out that way. Don't feel discouraged. There's a fair amount that got mentioned almost in passing in GalNet or tourist beacon that ties to other stuff. Explore, trade, whatever it takes to see the human bubble. There's all kinds of angles this can be approached from. Also, surprising as it may sound I'm not one of the folks who played the older games. I just read lots and payed attention during my travels. Everyone can help. Besides, 2296 was 1,013 years ago in the Elite Universe. If something seems off, it may well be important.

We all share this in common: we all want Raxxla found but still don't know exactly what we are searching for exactly.
