Can these be linked in order to form a cube or does it twist? The story seems to indicate the Maelstroms are coordinating efforts to search for something or a series of things. Given the aliens are generally presumed intelligent, it may not be unreasonable they are searching for Raxxla. If formed into a singular block, is there a specific zone at the center? This doesn't have the hallmarks of an invasion. If they wanted us dead, all 8 would go to one place and then destroy anything in their path as they headed to the core of the Bubble.
Redrawing them ‘in order’ is a great idea, and will present a different alignment, although I am unsure of the said correct sequence? @Macros Black is the list you provided previously in sequence order?

FD have stated the Thargoids were looking for something, and I don’t believe either it’s an invasion, they could have wiped us out easily. This is a search and retrieval operation, is it Raxxla?

If those triangles are correct, if one were to insert such an arrangement in game, and you were inferring it correlated to something, it might either be something at a shared centre in the middle of these diamonds, or where there weren’t situated?

It’s possible they won’t find whatever’s they are looking for, it’s possible FD are utilising them as narrative clues, if we don’t find it / them, the most logical solution would not allow them to find it/them but to simply add another clue and goad us towards it?

Are the voids an indication of where to look? Just updated the maps include Gen Ships!
