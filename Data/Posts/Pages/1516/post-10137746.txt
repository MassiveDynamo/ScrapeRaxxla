Just remember....Marlin Duval dies in 2296.....leader of the mass traversal to Achenar through unexplored space from Sol

What if Marlin is Princess Astrophel and the route is the spiraling stars, she or the course taken from the lore ingame may be the story with the clues we need
Throwing this out there precisely because of that fact: Capella has the following named bodies and stations which should serve as that something very important happened there:


Bodies:
Duval's Grave
Gold
Nobleworld
Molotov's Claim*
Lawrence's Grave
Stations:
Charles Orbiter**
Darkesport***
Matthews Base
Schmidt Orbiter
I am mostly convinced this is where Marlin Duval and her husband is killed. Did I mention it is a FEDERAL system? Numerous names here show up elsewhere in human space.

* - Molotovworld is in Soholia (yes the Sohalian Fever system).
** - Charles is I believe associated with numerous planets and stations (exceptions for Charles deGaul).
*** - Darkes is also connected to Epsilon Eridani via Darkes Orbiter. I believe Facece or somewhere has planet or moons which mentioned it, too.

Something BIG happens in Capella very damn early. Events there may connect to a lot of other events elsewhere. Also, it appears it wasn't just the brother of Marlin Duval that wanted his sister dead. Apparently, the Feds were involved, too.
