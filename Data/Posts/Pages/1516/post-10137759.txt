Just remember....Marlin Duval dies in 2296.....leader of the mass traversal to Achenar through unexplored space from Sol

What if Marlin is Princess Astrophel and the route is the spiraling stars, she or the course taken from the lore ingame may be the story with the clues we need
If anything goes down in 2296, it’s gotta be connected. I hadn’t ever thought of this connection to Marlin Duval. Solid advice here. If it has Duval name on it, I’d imagine it should hold at least some piece of the puzzle, if not a major one.
