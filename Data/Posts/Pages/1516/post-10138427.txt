Here is the Maelstrom in 3D, lines have been added to define the shape. I’m sure someone has done this previously but I can’t locate an example. Might not be relevant.

Can these be linked in order to form a cube or does it twist? The story seems to indicate the Maelstroms are coordinating efforts to search for something or a series of things. Given the aliens are generally presumed intelligent, it may not be unreasonable they are searching for Raxxla. If formed into a singular block, is there a specific zone at the center? This doesn't have the hallmarks of an invasion. If they wanted us dead, all 8 would go to one place and then destroy anything in their path as they headed to the core of the Bubble.
