I'll report back on further connections. Yes, I've been there but didn't see anything glaringly obvious. I don't know if we need to trigger something via missions or what. Though, it is equally possible this was to showcase the events in 2296 were much worse. The really weird thing: Capella is not on the line from Tau Ceti to Achenar. I suspect Marlin Duval is the funder of Mayflower 97. If this is the case, the Mayflower 97 leaves Sol for Tau Ceti. They drop colonists that ultimately settle Tau Ceti (this was in the First Encounters journals) and presumably went to Achenar. I had discovered this probably in 2017. I forget if I went there by curiosity or was brought there via missions. It struck me as odd then and I still cannot make sense of it fully even factoring in the old lore.
