Rogue planet systems would be so cool. You could see them in nav panel, but never in galaxy map. Some would have stations, "hideout" type of places. Some would be necessary to reach some other places. I believe they had something like this planned in 2014. Add lore & tinfoil and you would have entire seasons worth of content.

I thought exotic stars, comets, permit systems, rogue planets, "mystery" or whatever, were placeholders, like they were supposed to be updated into the game at some point. I don't think I'll be around waiting for them after the next update.

The meta-gaming aspect about this is pretty addicting though, you know, reading wikipedia articles, drinking coffee, and then sporadically travelling tens of thousands of lightyears while listening to loud techno.
