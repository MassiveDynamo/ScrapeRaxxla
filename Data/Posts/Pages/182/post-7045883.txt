The whole point of a rogue planet is that it escaped the system it belonged to and is in interstellar space somewhere, so of course it would be the jumpable body. How does one go about finding and travelling to those? Doesn't show up in galaxy map filters... (unless non-sequence or dwarf stuff includes it somehow). Or perhaps one has to manually select it from the galaxy map if he/she finds it?
