ok we dont know much, it is a quest without clues
however, we know that one or two cmdrs have visited the system (past post somewhere) and they didnt notice much and moved on.
Well if only 1 or 2 cmdrs have visited then it is an out of the way or obscure system.
So if out of the way then could be any random system a long way from the bubble (outer rim of the galaxy?), in which case it would be a proc gen name as any hand woven system would stand out on the galmap.
If it is in the bubble (near shinatra dezhra for example), then it would need to be pretty hidden or loads of cmdrs would have visited by now.
In the original elite sometimes it ws difficult to get to a system that was really close to another on the galmap as the cursor would jump back to the unchosen one (maybe 0.1ly away).
What if our magic system is similarly hidden and only the 1 or cmdrs found it by somehow zooming or selecting stars in the galmap that allowed the system to be targeted.
Or they accidentally selected the system whilst jumping somewhere else.

Alternatively they got a mysterious permit as a result of doing some long deleted dark wheel missions or some other unlocking, but I dont think so because that would the planet that cannot be named unavailable at present time and this thread would need to be closed down.
In the para\phrased words of strictly....
Keep searching!
