Sorry, this is far too 'one that got away'. "I know someone who went to Raxxla but she doesn't go to this school."

I'm calling bee-ess in the politest way I can

Edit: I'm not calling you a liar, btw, but "I saw a thread where a guy said they knew someone who went to Raxxla" is not the same as "we know people have been". The burden of proof is significantly higher than that.

Edit2: In fact I would say that we can't know people have been without a repeatable way of verifying it. We can know that people have said they've been but that is a very different kettle of fish.
