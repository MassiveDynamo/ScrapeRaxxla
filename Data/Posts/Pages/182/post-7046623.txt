I saw a reddit thread that referenced an interview with someone at FDev who confirmed the system in which it exists had been honked by a player, but the planet was not detail scanned.

I didn't see the source material, so it's just hearsay from me, but I like to believe that it's true. If nothing else for the, "missed it by that much" aspect. Was it you? Me? We may never know.

There you go solid proof!
