Well IFF this is related to Raxxla then clearly Raxxla is located within Sol, but since we haven't found it (I spent a couple of months looking and others have also looked) it is very well hidden. Probably within the rings of Saturn or Neptune. OR possibly Raxxla is the (probably Guardian) alien artefact that was found when Mars was terraformed? ..MB said early on in a livestream that we would start to find out more about that but we never have (to our knowledge)....though that doesnt seem to me to fit the hints that Raxxla is a definite place (grammar- an artefact is an object not a place, though it would be in a definite place, probably a locked safety deposit box in the Bank of Zaonce stuck in a disused lavatory in a stairless cellar with no lightbulb with a sign on the door saying â€˜Beware of the Leopard' ).

However I rather suspect this is FD building further tension to the Thargoid War storyline by the last remaining Titan attacking the ancestral home of humanity as a final act. They dont want us to be able to interfere with its trajectory, just wait in horrified anticipation for its arrival. I suspect that's why the comet location mechanism was banned and nerfed a while ago, apparently some were using it to drop out at the Titans during their incoming at the start if the War (though I keep wondering where they came from since IIRC it seemed to be beyond the Col70etc locked zone).

I expect to see INRA reveal that it has been secretly continuing mycoid research....but I shall continue to search for Raxxla elsewhere, after I've got to grips with this darn Odyssey on-foot settlement reactivation where I keep dying, and being fined for losing the power regulator through dying, and awakening in prison, with my ship elsewhere and impounded so I cant enter it
