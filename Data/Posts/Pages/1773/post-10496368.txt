It's visible from Scorpii Sector RO-R b4-9 - but a moving Titan puts out hyperspatial emissions detectable from thousands of LY away. You'll see them from any other system you jump to, as well.

Their real current position is travelling between Qinganu and Col 285 Sector OS-T d3-146 (probably about at the half-way point between the two) at roughly 4000c: people have tried to intercept but even with SCO it doesn't appear possible to match speeds closely enough to do so.
Ahh. did not know. Good info. Yes I see it's concentrated signal source is in every system I go to right now - lol.
