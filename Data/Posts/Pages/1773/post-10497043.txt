Well, Ive always thought Ram Tah's decode about Guardians developing prey species etc was a hint that they visited Earth in pre-history and humanity is the result of that genetic manipulation, and the fact that Pilots Federation can lock off large areas of the galaxy (how do they know there's stuff/things there that we aren't ready for) means its run by a Guardian AI.
So wouldnt be overly surprised if Raxxla turned out to be in Sol.
Yes. Had forgotted Neptune's rings....it is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion, and morning coffee has just been interrupted by a visitor.

Edit
Cmdr Buur has some interesting suggestions in his latest vid. So perhaps the Titan is looking for Raxxla?
