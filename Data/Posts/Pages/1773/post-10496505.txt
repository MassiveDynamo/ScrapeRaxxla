No its not. Try to chase it in Col 285 Sector OS-T D3-146 u have 10 min till Today(29.Nov.2024) 19:49:42 GMT+0. Then it will be in Hyades Sector GH-K B9-2 for i do not jet know how fast it will be there so need to wait. From there i might be able (FDEV took it away that one can lock on so to speak, i am still mad ) to get an interception at mid point. ATM i think its 10days till SOL but Monday does not fit whit server Maintanace so... Raxxla relevance = ? This behaves like i think Raxxla could behave but its a Body and not like i belive Raxxla to be a system. What Tags do as a boby i think raxxla is doing but as a system.

Edit it tock to long to write it so 5 min left^^ 10h NS jumping just to witness this happening again i sure hope if we find Raxxla we can go wherever we want whenever we want.
