As for Triton, it may be a tiny bit obvious that Titan names have different length and can be arranged as a guardian glyph.

You can imagine to see "TritoN" and "GodraY" or "GodraN".
Godran may point to Rana or the Aegir<->Rana axis.
Godrays in hyperspace around target stars may act as a compass. Neutron stars sometimes show 6 rays.
