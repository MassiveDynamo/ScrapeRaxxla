Well, if the Thargoids are after the Martian artefact or Triton it will provide more info and maybe allow us to eliminate a few more things, or confirm a few more things.

I'm fairly sure Thargoids are linked to Raxxla in the very deep lore (though it's really just a gut feeling) so again there may be some resolution there too.

Alternatively, consider that the Thargoids are socially organised around a hive queen. Maybe they're simply going to visit our new Federal President? Having read Seo Jin-ae's mind and gathered the info that Winters is a Hive Queen sitting at the centre of the oldest part of humanity maybe they want to talk queen-to-queen.

I would be very surprised if anything developing now reveals Raxxla, but I'd be less surprised if what's developing now paves the way towards revealing Raxxla in the future.
