And why is the asteroid belts in the sun?
A belt is a circle, defined by its in-game centre point and radius. The centre point is, unsurprisingly, at the Sun. That you can select that point is a bit of a programming bug that has been raised frequently for the last 10 years.

I reported it to FD as an issue back in 2016 when I got the permit & first saw it.
