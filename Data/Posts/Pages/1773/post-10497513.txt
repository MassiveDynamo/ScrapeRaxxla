Yep. Persephone is very suspicious-how come it's so light? Last time I was there (years ago) I could see perfectly well...its the farthest planet darnit, it should be pitch black (without Vin Diesel)!!

But Triton is a good contender. Permit locked, no way to get the permit. When I first got the Sol permit I watched a steady stream of Fed Navy ships going there & coming from it (though that traffic had died down when I last looked). However I suspect if FD are playing at all straight with us and Raxxla is locatable then methinks hidden in the rings of Neptune would be a very good bet, assuming Triton is related to the Raxxla puzzle! Speculating here but wouldn't be surprised if Raxxla is the ship that brought the Guardian/AI to Sol system & that Guardian (suspended animation- the Dream Sleep or whatever it was named in Galnet?)/AI is housed at Triton.

Edit
And I thought it very interesting that in the Cmdr Buur vid I referenced above he makes the point that current hyperdictions are back to the original non-hostile "stop & scan" rather than the later "stop & destroy" version, and FD phrasing about this incursion seems a little ambiguous. So just maybe there's a chance for negotiation this time? Whatever happened to that classified research into alien communications that was started out in Colonia? Maybe they finally got the Universal Translator to speak Thargoid to respond properly to the scan?

I did finally succeed in an Odyssey settlement reactivation mission this afternoon. It was an agriculture settlement...I did look for a Xmas tinsel-wrapped bag of compost to welcome the goids, but alas...
