Well Hebrew doesn't have noun cases and I can relate to his troubles with Roman cases, since my first language doesn't have articles.

Back to Latin: technically it is dead, since it isn't the native language of any community, but it is still actively used. In my home country it was one of the official languages until the middle of the 19th century.
Very well played with respect to that reference!

But yes, the Latin use is really the point - although nominally a dead language (I should have probably have said ‘dead’ rather than dead. ), it is still in use to varying degrees. It’s very concievable that as similar principle will apply in the future, whether for Latin or other languages.
