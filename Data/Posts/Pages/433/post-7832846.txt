My suspicion of the choice of the word 'fernweh' is that it's a word that in 36+years I've never heard before nor read in any books. Yet in definition it's an older language word( unless it's regularly used in germany, which I suspect it isn't).

Why would a game set so far in the future use such an uncommon word that isn't even necessarily relevant today?
Fernweh is regularly used in German, its first usage was in 1835. Some consider it a synonym for wanderlust, and some say that wanderlust is lust to wander on foot in nature and that Fernweh is lust for travel to distant lands.
