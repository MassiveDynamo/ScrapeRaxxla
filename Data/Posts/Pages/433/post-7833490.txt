It may not be. As DB said “you don’t know WHAT Raxxla is!”
I saw this what it is statement myself and have wondered if it's real or not. In the version I saw, it was stated that when DB was asked if Raxxla was in the game, he said something like "That's a silly question, of course it is.........you just don't know what it is".

The author stated however, it was unclear if the WHAT Sentance was a continuation of Raxxla, or in relation to the following question.

If it was in relation to Raxxla, then that would strongly imply its not a moon/planet. So what else could it be?

A star
A black hole
A white hole
A generation ship
A different kind of ship
An astroid

Am I missing anything?
