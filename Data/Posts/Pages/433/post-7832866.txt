Some Romanes. But in my view, the appropriate response to those people is Romanes Eunt Domus.
Well Hebrew doesn't have noun cases and I can relate to his troubles with Roman cases, since my first language doesn't have articles.

Back to Latin: technically it is dead, since it isn't the native language of any community, but it is still actively used. In my home country it was one of the official languages until the middle of the 19th century.
