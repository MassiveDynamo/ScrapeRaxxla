Has anyone considered the lore implications for The Pilots Federation and/or Universal Cartographics including clues in codex articles about the means to find Raxxla? I see a few different scenarios for this:

1. It was done willfully, which means that one or both organizations (or the Club behind one or both of them) already know how to find it, and for some reason want independent pilots to also find it.
2. A member or small group of one of these organizations found a way to slip some clues into the wording of some articles without rousing suspicion? Again, not sure what the motivation would be.
3. There are no intentional clues, but simply including the collection of rumors surrounding Raxxla may still point us in the right direction.

I'm personally not expecting anything to be decoded or otherwise directly hidden within the articles themselves. But, some of the word choices and references (i.e. Prester John) do make me think that there's something there.

Trying to figure that one out is probably harder than finding Raxxla
My rule of thumb is if it's a quote or a reference (eg the stuff about Asphodel) then it's potentially a clue. Otherwise it's just wrapper. For me, 'fernweh' falls into this category.

Either way, I don't think the Codex entry is the first in a trail of breadcrumbs leading to an abandoned megaship. Oh, wrong mystery again
