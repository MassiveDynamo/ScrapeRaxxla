Trying to figure that one out is probably harder than finding Raxxla
My rule of thumb is if it's a quote or a reference (eg the stuff about Asphodel) then it's potentially a clue. Otherwise it's just wrapper. For me, 'fernweh' falls into this category.

Either way, I don't think the Codex entry is the first in a trail of breadcrumbs leading to an abandoned megaship. Oh, wrong mystery again
It may not be. As DB said “you don’t know WHAT Raxxla is!”
