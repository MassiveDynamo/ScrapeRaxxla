I don't think the 'no fluff' policy has been implemented yet. According to this post, it's still being considered: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/galnet-changes.519008/page-13#post-7947876

ah, reread the OP on that thread...
Steve benedetti:
"...weâ€™re going to be reducing the number of GalNet stories that we produce and instead focus on covering in-game content.

In the foreseeable future, GalNet articles will concentrate on in-game activity "

So you are (as usual) absolutely correct & Edelgard may be wasting his time- Galnet is, for the immediately forseeable future, still fluffy!!!

edit: co-pawlot chewing ankle and growling. Definitely going for a walk!!!
