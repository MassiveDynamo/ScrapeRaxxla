Death a journey we all must make - so we have to turn off 'auto-respawn' somehow? I think there's a star system that you have to get to CQC 50 and then reset to 0 to unlock the permit for, don't quote me but do correct me if I'm wrong pls. If so then this M.O. is already in game so not impossible....
CD-43 11917 might be the permit you're thinking of. (No, I haven't unlocked it)

Attilius Orbital apparently has 20% off ships, 30% off weaps, 50% off defenses.

[Edit: In the Galmap it says "(Requires CQC Home World Permit)"]
