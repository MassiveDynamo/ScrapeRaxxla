ah, reread the OP on that thread...
Steve benedetti:
"...weâ€™re going to be reducing the number of GalNet stories that we produce and instead focus on covering in-game content.

In the foreseeable future, GalNet articles will concentrate on in-game activity "

So you are (as usual) absolutely correct & Edelgard may be wasting his time- Galnet is, for the immediately forseeable future, still fluffy!!!

Personally I think that the coming Galnet change is totally irrelevant to Raxxla. I don't think there ever has been or ever will be an article that's main purpose is to hint to Raxxla's location or nature.

I there are any hits at all, they will be in articles that really are about something else. In that regard, it does not matter if the article is fluff or not.
