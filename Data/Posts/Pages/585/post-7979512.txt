I do not think the TDW criterion is strictly related to rank as even the worst pilot can eventually grind out a high rank. It seems from the books etc that they are looking instead for 'skill' and in particular being able to win engagements when the pilot is at a major disadvantage. (Like killing a dangerous conda in a sidewinder while harmless etc would get their attention more so than rank.) In the dark wheel novella in the cobra v cobra fight at the end Alex was at a disadvantage in that his ship was not fully upgraded, but he was clever enough to find a way to win. A similar story it true for salome in DW books (despite not having a high rank see seems to have been made a member of sorts of the Dark wheel via Luko). I also suspect that get your ship destroyed resets any such metric related to impressing TDW back to zero.

If there is a starting point i would bet on it being in the old worlds.

For those who are VO mining for FC credits the old worlds are not a terrible place to do so. (recently there has been a good station to sell at within 2-3 jumps, and many icy rings to choose from albeit not pristine.) Tionisla has been my location of choice due to luko mentioning it in relation to TDW location back in the day. Doing so i had a few pop-up missions occur, but all were hopelessly bugged.
