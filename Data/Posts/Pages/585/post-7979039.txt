Personally I think that the coming Galnet change is totally irrelevant to Raxxla. I don't think there ever has been or ever will be an article that's main purpose is to hint to Raxxla's location or nature.

I there are any hits at all, they will be in articles that really are about something else. In that regard, it does not matter if the article is fluff or not.

Agreed, which is why the WInking Cat series of posts is interesting, it doesn't seem to tie in with anything in particular; don't think even then it would be Raxxla-related, possibly TDW or perhaps The CLub?.
Whereas the Gan Romero fluff was clearly implying a Halsey/Guardian AI linkage.
