Finding the station which avoids detection is a test of skill and courage which gets you automatically an invite to be one of ours ? I don't think so.
Besides, if one finds that station, the entire community will find it too in the following hours. Invites for everybody , yeah !
Imho, it is not findable.
But, as always, with FD you never can tell...
