Anybody ever got 3xelite with 0 insurance claims? I keep thinking how you could impress TDW and "learn more"?
I've only had 27 claims in just under 55 weeks, does that count? [Edit: Yes, 3x Elite]

[Edit, edit: And I'm about to haul 608 tons of LTDs to a market just over 100 Ly away]

[Edit, edit, edit: One minor coronary later, and I gotz another 730 MCR for my FC, lol]
