So, finished off Tionisla by travelling slowly 5kls above & below the star. Picked up a Mission USS- trading beacon near to Ing RIng; did the mission, collected reward, then nothing so I guess just another uss.

Does anyone know if the uss search procedure has been retested since the fss was introduced? Used to be you had to travel at less than 10c to stand a chance of detecting a uss, then you'd home in on it to drop in. I'm asking because I clearly remember MB saying something like "there are interesting things hidden off the ecliptic". Was anything interesting ever found well off the ecliptic? Either historically or since fss introduction?

Nowadays it seems all the uss I detect are close to the ecliptic....

off to walk the co-pawlot!

USSs used to be detectable up to around 250c. Above that they became tricky.

I still find all mine just by flying around, but I think they spawn differently now.
