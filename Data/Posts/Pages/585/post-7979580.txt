Finding the station which avoids detection is a test of skill and courage which gets you automatically an invite to be one of ours ? I don't think so.
Besides, if one finds that station, the entire community will find it too in the following hours. Invites for everybody , yeah !
Imho, it is not findable.
But, as always, with FD you never can tell...
Invite is a strong word. If you are Elite, you get docking permission.
Then you can read a few secret stories in the local news and perhaps do a few cool missions. You can probably rank up there, like with all other factions.
I donâ€™t expect much more.
