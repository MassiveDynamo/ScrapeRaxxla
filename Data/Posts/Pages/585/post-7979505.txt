FSS/USS - with the FSS you can see all and any USS at any distance and resolve them, all resolved will show on nav panel regardless of distance, unresolved will still pop up when near. I cant always find them though, the USS with the scanner so not sure its 100% reliable. eg middle of nowhere, 2 signals, 1 sun and 1, one what? No blue blobs anywhere, even behind the sun, I could just be missing them as usually give up but i do look properly first. Normally they are just degraded signal sources in my experience, havent had Encoded or High Grade yet in the black.

Mis-jump and DW story - either its a mistake missed in proof-reading, its a setup by the DW and he arrived after, he had a time machine (ruled out of ED by DB) or the 'mis-jump' was somehow planned or forseen or maybe even caused....2 of them are logical, 1 is out of bounds and 1 is ridiculous.....this is the Raxxla threadm guess which one I'm going for...now how do I cause a mis-jump? something to do with stroking a one eyed feline while jumping,

Winking Cat , the Penguin, all these riddles set by a Riddler? I see where this is going...Raxxla is in the Bat Cave!
