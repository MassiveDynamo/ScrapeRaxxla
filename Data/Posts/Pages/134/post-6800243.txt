No.. Lately been patrolling near Pencil sector, got a bit excited of wake scan data from a beacon in deep space, something about classified information and "titan-level clearance", but I've come to think it's just usual stuff these things say, background. Maybe Feds have a security installation on Titan, who knows.

Then I found some new braintrees, got bored, currently parked at some war torn anarchy system, been stealing water purifiers, shooting at spaceships, pew pew pew.

Just curious: Where near Pencil Sector did you find this beacon? What system?
