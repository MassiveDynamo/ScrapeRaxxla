Did you all find Raxxla and not tell me?

I guess there's only so many times we can keep re-using the same piece of tin-foil. I was slightly intrigues by the "Bifrost" thread that someone else linked to earlier, but tbh I am taking a vaction from our galaxy until the Explorer update comes along to (hopefully) make my 20K LY journey back to the bubble a bit more interesting.

Nearly always here lurking though...
