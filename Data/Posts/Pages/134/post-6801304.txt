I use this site: https://cim.sotl.org.uk/elite-dangerous/

To find sectors that end with 'RA' (Ctrl F - RA ). Remember the space after RA.

Then i copy that sector name (e.g. Byooe Bra) to the galaxy map search box and add 'XX-L A'.

Then I just click trough all the systems.

Oh, I was hoping there was a less tedious way to do it. Anyway, thanks!
