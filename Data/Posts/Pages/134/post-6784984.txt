Funny how much players still are looking for a link between Raxxla and the Rift. I would love if it turned out to be part of the solution. But, imho, due to 'executive' reasons, it's not. I understand that the Rift was DW's job and Raxxla was MB's. But, again, I would love to be proven wrong.

The only link there is is Salom√©.
