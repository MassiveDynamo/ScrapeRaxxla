It takes about two minutes to type 'RA' in the galaxy map search box and click through all the systems. None of them have names that are interesting.

Unless you count Rakka, which has a L-class star in the system.

I have updated my list of 'RA XX-L A' systems, if anyone needs something to visit in the black:

PHOOE BRA XX-L A76-0 (Checked by rOmiLaYu)
HYPI BRA XX-L A21-0
HYPI BRA XX-L A117-0
HYPAO BRA XX-L A7-0 (Checked by rOmiLaYu)
HYPAO BRA XX-L A76-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A36-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A7-0 (Checked by rOmiLaYu)
DRYU BRA XX-L A49-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A21-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A9-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A35-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A63-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A76-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A118-0
DRYU BRA XX-L A117-0

OOSCS BRA XX-L A63-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A76-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A117-0
OOSCS BRA XX-L A62-0

BTW how did you search galaxy map to find those Systems? Is there a way to use % or $ or * as a placeholder? Can't seem to find the trick.
