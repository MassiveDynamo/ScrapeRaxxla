I honestly believe Raxxla is a station

Me too. ”Raxxla Gateway”!
It should have been “Relax Gateway”, but the signwriter was dyslexic


Or the DW station is actually orbiting something called Raxxla, possibly a Guardian Ark ship or Thargoid planet-sized mothership.

@Han_Zen: incidentally you mentioned the book “Wanted” a few pages back & planet close by a neutron star. I’m re-reading it now and the bounty hunter jumps into a disused system -“Witch’s Reach”, one of the systems locked by PF with no known permit-is this coincidental I ask myself?! Has anyone checked to see if the other locked systems appear in any of the books?
