CHIRAM TELAT MECHASOT

One in essence, but three in aspect. In this trinity is hidden the wisdom of the whole world.

The Sun is the father and the Moon the mother.

The stone is the fire, carried in the belly of the Archambault Terminal. It is the living morning light which illuminates those still buried in the darkness of materiality.
SPOILER: THE MOST TRUE SUN IS PROCREATED BY ART, AND EXCEEDS ALL NATURAL SUN IN ALL OF ITS PROPERTIES, MEDICINAL AND OTHERWISE
