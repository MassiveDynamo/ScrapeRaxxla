Hi Everyone, I have decided to take some time to compile my thoughts on Raxxla and how the Codex and previous clues have could be interpreted. To the experienced Raxxla hunter much of this may look familiar, but I recommend reading through the whole document in order to get an idea of how this theory may play out in game. THere are certainly some findings in here that others have not mentioned yet. Enjoy.
