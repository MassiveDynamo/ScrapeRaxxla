Me too. ”Raxxla Gateway”!
It should have been “Relax Gateway”, but the signwriter was dyslexic


Or the DW station is actually orbiting something called Raxxla, possibly a Guardian Ark ship or Thargoid planet-sized mothership.

@Han_Zen: incidentally you mentioned the book “Wanted” a few pages back & planet close by a neutron star. I’m re-reading it now and the bounty hunter jumps into a disused system -“Witch’s Reach”, one of the systems locked by PF with no known permit-is this coincidental I ask myself?! Has anyone checked to see if the other locked systems appear in any of the books?

Witch's Reach is a strange one. Like Polaris, there is supposed to be a specific permit for it. It has never been obtainable.
I've done some alignment checks on it. It lines up with Polaris(Celestial pole) and Cat's Eye(Ecliptic pole) on the opposite side of Sol, when viewed flat in the Galaxtic plane. I have no idea if that means something?

The only other lore visits to unobtainable permit locked systems I remember are the two visits to COL 70 Sector, in Premonition.
