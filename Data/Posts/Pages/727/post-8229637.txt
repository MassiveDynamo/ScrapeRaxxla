Witch's Reach is a strange one. Like Polaris, there is supposed to be a specific permit for it. It has never been obtainable.
I've done some alignment checks on it. It lines up with Polaris(Celestial pole) and Cat's Eye(Ecliptic pole) on the opposite side of Sol, when viewed flat in the Galaxtic plane. I have no idea if that means something?

The only other lore visits to unobtainable permit locked systems I remember are the two visits to COL 70 Sector, in Premonition.

Mmm. I was wondering if there are clues in the books as to how to obtain the permits. Would tie the books into the game nicely. FD put a lot of effort into in-game support for Premonition/Reclamation (unfortunately leaving stuff like the terraforming and beacons out, and the difference between the system description in book and game, which would have greatly increased immersion ). Would make sense for them to have similarly supported their other writers!

Also Witchâ€™s Reach star is the same type as TDW station pic, and it has a single planet........
