Well, running out of ideas.
Come to Aquilas Halo ... Bring Trinkets!

I like it as a sun with three astroid belts and 33 planets/bodies. Still getting used to all the extra bits and bobs in the sol system... Now with 20 planets?

Ya sounds like a glich if theres no asteroid field... though i cant remember either way myself.

edit... hmmm counted out from sun 33rd body (planets and moons) is Hi'iaka... Born of an Egg... Goddess of Hulu...
