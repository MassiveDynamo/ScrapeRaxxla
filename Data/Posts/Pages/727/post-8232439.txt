Hi Everyone, I have decided to take some time to compile my thoughts on Raxxla and how the Codex and previous clues have could be interpreted. To the experienced Raxxla hunter much of this may look familiar, but I recommend reading through the whole document in order to get an idea of how this theory may play out in game. THere are certainly some findings in here that others have not mentioned yet. Enjoy.

Scolio, your presentation is fantastic!. So much cleaner and clearer than anything I've ever presented and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I for one never really gave much thought to how it all ties directly into the world of Elite from a game play perspective, as in with an aim at finding something in game as a result of understanding the heroe's journey better, or how to apply each step to an actual movement to decipher. I think your translation is really good and I sincerely hope you find what it is you're looking for as you study it further.

The fact is that there is Overwhelming Evidence to suggest that the Heroe's Journey, and a Willingness to participate in it, is in fact the foundation of the quest at minimum,
if not the full truth. It appears to be the ground on which we each must build on before we can attempt to go further, lest we are happy with no clear aim or sense of direction.
I do find it intriguing that though I may have suggested it in the past, you on your own came to the same conclusions. But I know that we Both need to work on understanding the material and its application much deeper.

Before the codex came out, the sense of Adventure, the Great Call, was absolutely missing and though it was fun, in essence it was just a mere point and click adventure.
The codex truly was that Great Call To Adventure, and I know we are not alone in having felt or heard it.

Cheers. o7
