1. When I see the words about Orion, I always think of the movie Men in Black 1 : Galaxy on Orion's Belt.
2. Snakes and Birds, hmm. I.e. could the Elite badge have a snake with wings on it ?
3. Linking it all to Homer's Odyssey might not lead to the right result, but at least it might give a clue to further developments in the game. I will have to reread the book.
