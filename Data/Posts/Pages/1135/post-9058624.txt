By the way, doing final calculations now ... unfortunately realized each axis is its own calculation. So solving the coordinates for one of the potentials for Astrophil means doing it 3 damn times. Crossing fingers this is it. If it isn't posted in next 45 minutes I will have it ready tomorrow and will let you know if this fails of what.
