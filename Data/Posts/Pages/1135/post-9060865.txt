And guess who she was specifically patron of? Only a guy who was looking for a missing planet, and found Ceres instead.... which of course is missing in the game.

"At the close of the 18th century, he organised the "Celestial Police", a group of twenty-four astronomers, to prepare for a systematic search for the "missing planet" predicted by the Titius-Bode law between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres was discovered by accident just as the search was getting underway. "
