There are literally dozens of stations named after the folks on that main list (as well as some catalog designations that will also zoom you around the map quite a bit when you go to check their names on the Galaxy map). Almost every single one, with a very few exceptions, has something on the Galaxy Map, and very often more than one.

Ya there are alot of choices - I guess its all in the selection criteria
