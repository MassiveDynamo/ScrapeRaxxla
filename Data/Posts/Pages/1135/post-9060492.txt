2. Homer ... Who was an astronomer in Homer's time? Ptolemy?
Homer is c.800 BCE, Ptolemy lived much later and dies in 170 CE. I think Homer predates any of the Greek philosophers who were dabbling in astronomy. Aristotle was 4th century BCE, and Hipparchus and the rest come after him. Not 100% sure he was the earliest Greek philospher who also did astronomy but he may have been. Pythagoras was c. 495 BCE, so 300 years after Homer also. Eratosthenes, who is on the list, is also much later, dying c. 195 BCE. https://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Astronomy/
