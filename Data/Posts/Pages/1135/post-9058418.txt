My basis for including an astronomer is based on what their primary focus was during their careers. Therefore, "star lover" is anyone who advanced research into stars or their various classes in any meaningful way, built catalogues of certain star types, etc. There is, in fact, a method to this process. I am not just saying this person is well known so run with it.

I played with the idea of an astronomer - I just feel it has to fit the full context. "the children's story Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" Still have yet to see any astronomer connections that fit that description. You might make a case for Vera Rubin because of her work on Galaxies but you would be ignoring the childrens story and princess aspect. Incidentally there is a Vera Rubin station in Garuda (eagle fun) which also had a gas giant with an 8th moon.... spent some time staring at space trying to find a hidden station there...
