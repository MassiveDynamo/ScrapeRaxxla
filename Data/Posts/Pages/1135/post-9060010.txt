Update 3 of the "Astronomer System" post here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1136#post-9055066

I'm now halfway through that darn list, and we now have our first Chinese astronomer on it, as well as three new outliers - in addition to Chandra and Saha, we now also have Araki, Bok, and Zhang all outside of the Orion observational bias region. One new in that region, plus another astronaut. 38 total that follow surname-only naming (including the one exception for Hawking's Reach), 33 of which are astronomers.

Surprisingly there appears to be a gap in classical literature in dealing with monstrous bunny rabbits... Thankfully filled by Monty Python.... however, yes - did not fit criteria
Al-Miraj is cool. Although it sounds like the Aztec drunken party rabbits have a better time overall.

Also, by its clear absence on this list, the Easter Bunny is real. QED.
