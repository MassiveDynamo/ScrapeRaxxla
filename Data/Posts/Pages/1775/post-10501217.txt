And if it's tied to hyperspace technology in any way, that might also explain the suppression of Galcop (and its independent Quirium drives) ... and also the panic Sirius currently seem to be in about Achilles having produced a completely independent hyperdrive design.
That's a good point. I think Quirium wasn't limited to Galcop though? The Adamastor/Proteus used Quirium drives, and this Galnet article doesn't seem to link Quirium with Galcop specifically. I'm a little fuzzy on the spcifics though so if there's lore about this I'd appreciate links.

"The original hyperdrives were powered by a fuel known as quirium, the formula for which was a closely guarded secret. When this formula was lost, the hyperspace industry suffered a major setback. A number of different drives strove to fill the void left by the quirium drives, but it was the Type 2b that proved most popular. Unfortunately, ships equipped with a 2b left behind a hyperspace 'cloud' at their entry and exit points, making it all too easy for malcontents to track and ambush these vessels."

If Sirirus (speculating) produced or licensed the Quirium formula, then the 2b must have represented a loss of control since it used regular Hydrogen fuel. I know Sirius produced Military fuel for advanced systems, but that's a big step down still. I wonder if the loss of Quirium was actually an act of sabotage/resistance?
