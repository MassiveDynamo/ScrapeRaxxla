And if it's tied to hyperspace technology in any way, that might also explain the suppression of Galcop (and its independent Quirium drives) ... and also the panic Sirius currently seem to be in about Achilles having produced a completely independent hyperdrive design.
I think it's more than just hyperspace technology. Hyperspace was available for probes, long before the relic was discovered on Mars. Terra-forming was also started before the discovery, but it failed. Shortly after the relic was found, Mars was successfully terra-formed and long range settling started (Achenar).

The common technology that probably was lacking in performance both cases, is the power plant. Sirius power plants have a near monopoly in both ships and in terra-forming equipment. Sirius' main focus is the manufacture of fusion reactors, hyperdrives and hyperdrive fuels.

I don't know if the relic it self, contained useful information or if it pointed to Raxxla. Either way i have a feeling that the relic find lead to leaps in technology in several field and that the source has been kept hidden, both from the public and the major governments.

Perhaps the key factor is the ability to produce and contain antimatter? In the older games, Sirius produced military fuel. A fuel that contained anti-matter.
"The Sirius Corporation was set up by a group of rich industrialists from Earth, in order to exploit the discovery of a way to store a stable atom of anti-matter within a complex molecule and use it as a fuel. Sirius first started production in 2350".
The military fuel seem to be outdated in ED. Perhaps the Anti-matter is injected separately in the modern fusion process and that is why we sometimes find these: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Antimatter_Containment_Unit
