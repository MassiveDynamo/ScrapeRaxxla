I have a question for the experts here. Always been curious about the Raxxla mystery and I've developed a lead I'm investigating, but I've a question maybe someone can answer. From the Wiki:

In some versions of the Raxxla story, which were later shown to have a striking resemblance to the children's story "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" (see Wikipedia: Astrophel and Stella) and consequently became discredited, Raxxla is said to hold an alien artefact called the Omphalos Rift, which acts as a gateway to parallel universes. Even after it was discredited, staunch supporters of the Omphalos Rift theory insist that the author of the children's story had knowledge of Raxxla's exact location and deliberately wove clues into his book.

Are the versions of the Raxxla "stories" they're talking about here available in any greater detail to read anywhere, other than the original Astrophil and Stella by Philip Sidney? Or is Sidney's poem the only actual available resource for delving for clues?

And where does this originate from? The reference points back to the KB article for Raxxla. But where did it originally come from?
