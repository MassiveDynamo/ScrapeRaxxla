Many people already pointed to Sirius, being one of the most powerful entities in the Galaxy - but if we think about the idea that Raxxla is deeply linked to Hyperspace/Hyperdrives right form the start, and Sirius might have been part of the 'family dynasty' of Li Qin Jao then we can reconsider what "...leveraged its power to establish covert dominance over humanity" might mean.
And if it's tied to hyperspace technology in any way, that might also explain the suppression of Galcop (and its independent Quirium drives) ... and also the panic Sirius currently seem to be in about Achilles having produced a completely independent hyperdrive design.
