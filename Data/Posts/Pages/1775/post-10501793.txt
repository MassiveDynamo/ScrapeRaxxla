One way I made sense of the codex for myself, is to look at it as a metaphorical map. The descriptions being literal locations in game. Some segments I suspect reference the official books, primarily Elite Legacy by Brookes, which may or may not hold additional locational clues?

But yes don’t dive too deeply, into classical literature nor the wider lore, I think collectively we’ve exhausted all of that and the path is very likely very straightforward, so you’re fresh perspective is useful.

Personally I think it’s a localisation map and the clues are all in the game. Astrophel might be meaningless, it might be the keystone!

The turn of phrase is interesting because in that segment it talks of a children’s story. In game lore there is only 1 reference to a child’s storybook, and that’s in Elite Legacy, so again it could be literary…

Seek and you may find!
