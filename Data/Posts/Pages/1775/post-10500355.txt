here's an entire space station in orbit of Earth named for Li Qing Jao alongside Abraham Lincoln, Galileo, etc.
An interesting thing there, too, is that the LQJ name is inherited from as far back as FE2 - but I don't recall any mention in the FE2/FFE manual or the FFE journals of who they were.

Maybe they had in mind that they were the inventor of the hyperdrive all along but I think Elite Dangerous is the first time that's actually said.
