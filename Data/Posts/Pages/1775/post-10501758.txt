First of all Wikipedia is not an official source of information for ED, it’s an independent resource populated by the general public.

Secondly the phrase relating ‘Astrophel’ is an unknown.
Yeah this is problem #1. Sifting through years of matter and trying to determine what is genuine and what came out of the mind of the community. The passage I quoted above, seems to be copied and pasted on a half dozen other resources online related to Elite/Raxxla but I an unable to determine exactly where it came from. I mean this idea here:

In some versions of the Raxxla story, which were later shown to have a striking resemblance to the children's story "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars"
Ignoring any potential interpretation, I'm just curious where this comes from - the idea there's a Raxxla legend that resembles this child's story. Was it from in game? Galnet? It did not come from The Dark Wheel or the handful of newer Elite novels that I've read. Was it from one of the older games? I didn't have opportunity to play those. It could have come from Holdstock's earlier "The Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide", in which case it may be totally be connected to Raxxla but at the same time have nothing at all to do with Elite. I want to try and determine if its valid, because there are passages in Astrophel and Stella that are compelling.
