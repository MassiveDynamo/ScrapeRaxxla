Ya I think I might have landed on it back in the day as well. I don't think it IS raxxla - I do think it is being used as a reference. I think it is a symbol that has meaning elsewhere - specifically the Cemiess/Achenar area... (something about someone swimming with the fishies) But ya. It doesn't take away from the question - why it got permit locked? It MIGHT be some interesting lore bit that points us somewhere...



Thinking about the martian relic... Ive been looking for references to the "no bigger than a childs hand" phrase.... there have been some interesting ones but something i found recently regarding the Cybele cult makes me wonder. Cybele fell from the sky... She had a baetyl... a sacred stone ... a small meteorite with her face on it. It is described by Arnobius of Sicca as a dusky black stone, not large, which could be carried in a mans hand without any pressure... Its not a childs hand... but the connection to Cybele i find fun.


Edit - We have Stargoids coming to Sol.... where is Ricardo Bentonio when you need him?
