Thanks to Han_zen and the Sirius connection, I had to get the Sirius permit and have a look around. Tried using Waypoint as a route marker away from main star. Just flown 1000000ls out from star in a line through Waypoint. Stopped at many uss on the way but only usual random stuff. A good number of the uss spawn a load of npc contacts heading back to the main star (seamed strange this far out) Also noticed that the line from the main star through Waypoint points (almost) directly at the SMC.
