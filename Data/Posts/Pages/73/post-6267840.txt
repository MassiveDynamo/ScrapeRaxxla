I want to go on a trip - is there anywhere worth checking out, say, less than 5k away? Even the faintest of whims would do - I just need a destination to aim for.

Honestly - I would look at the Galmap to find systems / planets in the bubble without name tags (who first discovered) and go and scan them with an advanced discovery scanner and a detailed surface scanner. SRV would be needed for surface exploration.

I'm currently following the FR Mystery to get me to the edge of the Galaxy to start my search there (currently camped at the Alpha site) - why - because that's what I want to do
