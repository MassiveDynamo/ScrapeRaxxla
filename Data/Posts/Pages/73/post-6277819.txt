Whilst at the Gamma Formidine Rift site - I was buzzed by 2 elite NPC's. Very Strange as this did not happen on the other sites and is the only time I have seen NPC's this far out. The comms logs from this site indicate that 'Last Jump we found a signal that was NOT human', and 'there is something out here that does NOT want to be found'. I am discounting the Zurara as its a human vessel.

I checked all systems with 35 LY (one jump for me) and found nothing. I'm going to go back with my explorerconda to explore all systems within its 55LY jump range. Once all system's are scanned I will search for USS in each system.

And BIG respect to all the rifters out there for finding these locations - and how the heck you plotted a course across the rift to the Zurara is beyond me - I got stuck even with jumponinium. The only way I can see doing this is to travel up the arm and back down the next arm! Which I will do once the next update lands.
