You may not be aware of the Turning the Wheel event, every day we do missions for The Dark Wheel.
This is quite interesting, and good luck with it. I'm not really a BGS person though. My personal hope is that anything locked behind Dark Wheel missions (if there is anything) is at the individual commander level, and not at the BGS level, for reasons outlined back upstream.
