They are actually in a surprising number of systems now according to EDDB:
SPOILER
















I wonder if anyone has tried doing missions with them in each of those systems to see if it triggered anything different?
Hmm. Two already.
I know of 2 factions today that control the entire bubble.
TDW and Sirius Corp.

P.S. Can anyone remind me the name of the corporation from the Freelancer game that was controlled by aliens?
