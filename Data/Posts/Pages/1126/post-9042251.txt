Can't stop thinking. We have exact date in codex when RAXXLA was known. At that time it was only 5-6 major systems colonized + hyper drive was expensive so could be used only by goverments/corporations. So that should be somewhere dumb close.
I even had idea toast describes tattoo on NPC's head Checked some fanatics around Sol. Nope, I was wrong - they had different pictures then I recall from 1st visit.
