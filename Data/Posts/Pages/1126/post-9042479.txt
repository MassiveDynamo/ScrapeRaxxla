In which of these systems does the faction have a wheel station ?

P.S.I do not understand why the game introduced guards? Why is it? I do not remember in Elite1, Frontier and FFE any mention of them?
Maybe in order to still explain what is RAXXLA?

1. Not sure - worth checking out perhaps.
2. You mean the guards in Odyssey? So they can have a FPS game. That said it also gives them the ability to have scripted conversations, so maybe someone will be waiting on TDW station to explain everything to us. ;-)
