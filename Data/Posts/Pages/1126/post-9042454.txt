What concerns me about much of the reasoning behind where Raxxla ought to be, is this:
It was never in game in Elite, just something dreamt up in TDW to move the story along.
So the devs had no real interest in it, did they?
With ED they have said it is in game, but with so much stuff being retconned and declared non canon, can we put any faith at all in the developers putting it where we think it ought to be?

Has TDW been canonised? The novel, I mean, because I don't recall ever running into non humans in space, like there were in the novel, so they've ignored that, and presumably, the appearance in the novel is where the prospective dating started, giving the probably hyperdrive range.

I know it's frustrating, but I really can't see the devs putting too much time into placing Raxxla in accordance with known tech at a specific date.

I'm hoping it is something that Braben and/or Brookes took a direct hand in, and it was placed with some semblance of connection to the previous lore and upcoming story content for the game. Whether that initial conception and placement survived retconning the canon, who knows. Hopefully it has been improved and built upon since then, as with the Zurara and the FR. I'm trying to stay positive. ;-)

AFAIK TDW novel is sort-of canon, along with the new official novels, but since the Great Retconning of 3304 or whenever it was, they are picking and choosing what is actually canon from them, but not telling anyone what is canon, if that makes sense. Basically anything that is not mentioned or outlined in-game in some form (Codex, Galnet, Local news, etc.) is questionable at this point. Which of course has not stopped any of us from speculating about the previous canon from earlier games, or what was in the official author lore guides for ED, and whether they are still canon or not, etc. etc.
