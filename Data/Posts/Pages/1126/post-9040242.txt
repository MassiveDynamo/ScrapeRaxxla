Where did you find this? Appears you found a Guardian wearing the horned ceremony robe and headdress, doing a ritual with a thargoid heart. I have reason to believe their horns are much like the wind instruments of didgeridoo because of the sounds in some other places - showing pyramids in the spectrogram. Which would also mean that there are many Guardian types, not just Alpha Beta and Gamma. However - Canonn mods disagree with this theory.

The shadow photo of the ruins you'll need to rotate 90 degrees clockwise to see the shadow the ruins cast - at least the Ruins type with the stick-figure over a ritual circle cast the horned head dress of the Guardians during a certain time of day.
Sir your fourth picture...
