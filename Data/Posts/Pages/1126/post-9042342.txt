I know it's frustrating, but I really can't see the devs putting too much time into placing Raxxla in accordance with known tech at a specific date.

Agree with the whole post but just to add, this bit in particular could be deliberate obfuscation, if they hope we assume the source of the Raxxla myth was a physical place and not a signal or something that had travelled through witchspace to get to Tau Ceti or wherever we could reach at the time.
