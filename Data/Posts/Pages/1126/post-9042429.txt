I might get up to allied with this one though.
I didn't know about these until you brought up Wolf 433. ;-) I knew they were in a couple of other systems but did not realize they had been spreading (or that there was an active BGS effort to get them into other systems).

I think if you get Allied with one you get allied with all - as long as they are all the same minor faction. You should be able to do missions scattered among those systems with TDW and they will all count to getting you Allied with the faction.
