Yeah, though I always assumed Raxxla was a planet.
Sort of like one of the dodgy ones in Frontier where gemstones were sold for a negative price hence the reference in TDW about making people rich.

Edited to add:
On the presumption that Raxxla has always been in ED, I am not sure what the devs could have used other than a planet. They knew how to make a planet from the start, I am not sure they've had some mechanic for something involving witchspace, so I would rule that out oocly, just from the point of view of what they could have done with it back in the day.
Planet, station or ship would seem to be the three main options. And as there were no planetary landings/settlements at the start (and not even lights on dark sides of inhabited planets until much later) how would the planet have been discoverable as Raxxla at the start? Would it have just changed names if you scanned it using the old scanners? A black hole maybe if it is truely some sort of interdimensional portal etc. etc.
