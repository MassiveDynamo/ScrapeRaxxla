Yeah, though I always assumed Raxxla was a planet.
Sort of like one of the dodgy ones in Frontier where gemstones were sold for a negative price hence the reference in TDW about making people rich.

Edited to add:
On the presumption that Raxxla has always been in ED, I am not sure what the devs could have used other than a planet. They knew how to make a planet from the start, I am not sure they've had some mechanic for something involving witchspace, so I would rule that out oocly, just from the point of view of what they could have done with it back in the day.
