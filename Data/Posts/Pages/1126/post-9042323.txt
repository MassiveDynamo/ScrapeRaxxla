What concerns me about much of the reasoning behind where Raxxla ought to be, is this:
It was never in game in Elite, just something dreamt up in TDW to move the story along.
So the devs had no real interest in it, did they?
With ED they have said it is in game, but with so much stuff being retconned and declared non canon, can we put any faith at all in the developers putting it where we think it ought to be?

Has TDW been canonised? The novel, I mean, because I don't recall ever running into non humans in space, like there were in the novel, so they've ignored that, and presumably, the appearance in the novel is where the prospective dating started, giving the probably hyperdrive range.

I know it's frustrating, but I really can't see the devs putting too much time into placing Raxxla in accordance with known tech at a specific date.
