They are actually in a surprising number of systems now according to EDDB:
SPOILER
















I wonder if anyone has tried doing missions with them in each of those systems to see if it triggered anything different?
In which of these systems does the faction have a wheel station ?

P.S.I do not understand why the game introduced guards? Why is it? I do not remember in Elite1, Frontier and FFE any mention of them?
Maybe in order to still explain what is RAXXLA?
