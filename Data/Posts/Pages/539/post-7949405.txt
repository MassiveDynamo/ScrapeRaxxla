I've said this before but it surely was lost in the flow of this juggernaut, so I'll say it again. For what it's worth, I think the language from those missions has been de facto ret-conned. New players have no knowledge of them in-game and to use them as a key would be unfair to them and flies in the face of what FDev are trying to accomplish with the Codex. Obviously, one is free to do as one chooses, but for this CMDR, the only thing that is cannon for me now is "It's out there and we know what it is" and whatever is in the Codex. Everything else is vapid speculation.

Plato for a follower of Pythagoras. The references to geometric shapes is also key. Plato is telling us that these shapes are natural and recurring in the universe, that they can be expressed as a series of mathematical relationships, and that they belong to the universe’s secret language or building blocks. But it’s foolishness to understand all of this, and the physical description of the cosmos, as a pronouncement of doctrine, of religious mysterium. More accurately, Plato says that man must undertake the mental challenge to study and attempt to explain the world around him, including the cosmos beyond his perceptive abilities.
