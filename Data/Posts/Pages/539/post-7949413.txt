The AI Pilgrim ? Could that " lost AI" be actually "The Caretakers " ?



Mmmh.. Raxxla features, as well as anything else ingame, could very well be evolving as the game mechanics evolve. I hope so !
I concur, but then FDev are also aware how pedantic some of us can be about holding them strictly to every utterance they make in public and performing live vivisection on such comments for tinfoil and salt.

There may be no going back on some of the limited statements FDev already made.
