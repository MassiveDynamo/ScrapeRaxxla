Not in the software, it was in the box as an optional end-user BIOS patch (novella)

Strictly speaking not even then. Rumour of Raxxla’s existence was mentioned in the 1984 novella, but it was not found.
I believe ED is the first game to definitely have Raxxla, though I didn’t play the intervening games so may be wrong on this.
