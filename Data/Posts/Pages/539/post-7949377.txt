Ok, my numbers may be excessively large, but my point was simply we could find it, discover it, map it and not even know....possibly. And this would allow for it to be in the bubble without us finding it for 5 years
Oops, silly me! Forgot the </s> tag again :S

That was more a rhetorical question that agreed with the basic premise and therefore, didn't require an answer because if this simulation is anything like the real world, the best place to hide something is in plain sight. It could easily be in a high traffic core system if it behaves like a persistent but unmarked POI.

If the claim it could be found at launch is true though, it can't be on any planetary surface.

[Edit: Both Triton and Lave 2 (previous post) currently permit locked, hence the mentions.]
