Looking for old rifters to keep me honest here, but I just had a thought as to why the DW missions may have disappeared. This is using my theory on how the rift mystery and Raxxla may be connected.....

Back when the rift story was happening, Eafots was regarded as the Formidine Rift. Even the log messages talk about it. However, since the galactic regions were introduced, technically Eafots sector is in the Elysian Shore, not the Formidine Rift. This means that technically, it is not in the outer rim, hence the old missions could be regarded as misleading, hence they were removed.....discuss.

By the way, since leaving the CoR tourist beacon, I am yet to find a system that is fully discovered, let alone fully mapped
