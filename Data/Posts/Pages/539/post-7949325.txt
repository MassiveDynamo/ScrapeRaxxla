Random thought for the day.....In the same way that crashed ships dont show up as POIs when you map a plant, if the Omphalos Rift behaves in the same way then Raxxla could actually be a planet in a very busy system in the bubble, that has been discovered by 1000s of CMDRs, mapped by 100s and even driven around on by dozens and we would have no idea
