Random thought for the day.....In the same way that crashed ships dont show up as POIs when you map a plant, if the Omphalos Rift behaves in the same way then Raxxla could actually be a planet in a very busy system in the bubble, that has been discovered by 1000s of CMDRs, mapped by 100s and even driven around on by dozens and we would have no idea
Some planets have no discovered by tags, eg: Lave 2, while others have no mapped by tags either, eg: Triton (Sol), so why would anyone haul all the way out there to map them (my OCD made me do it)?
