Some planets have no discovered by tags, eg: Lave 2, while others have no mapped by tags either, eg: Triton (Sol), so why would anyone haul all the way out there to map them (my OCD made me do it)?
Ok, my numbers may be excessively large, but my point was simply we could find it, discover it, map it and not even know....possibly. And this would allow for it to be in the bubble without us finding it for 5 years
