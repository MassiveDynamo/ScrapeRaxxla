I worked on that with some friends, and am now suggesting is a bug. Quite an eye to spot it though. Well done on that and the subsequent reporting of it.
I researched that on stream and was able to replicate it in other systems. And thank you, Cmdd_Legendie. o7

Ha ha, welcome to Deneb.

Did quite a bit of research on this, a couple of months back(before and after 3.3 launch). I think ti might be an effect that is only meant for VR, that spills over. In VR you get this in a lot of systems.

The strange thing is that in no VR it only happens with big stars, in Cygnus.

Probably a bug, but still mysterious.
