I have an idea folks. And it’ll require at least 1 other CMDR in a big boat. Other than Ryder, the only cannon CMDR we know of to be a member of TDW is Salomé. Seems to me contacting TDW might be helpful in finding Raxxla. According to the Codex and other Cannon sources, TDW cannot be contacted unless they contact you first, which will be in the form of a mission (a test of courage) where the mission giver from TDW will be in disguise, only revealing themselves when it’s completed. Salomé’s post mortem message includes a warning about the club, and calls for us to stop trading and selling to the major powers. But also to be disruptive. Challenge autorities, blockade ports etc to force the hand of the club and make them reveal themselves. Sooooo, I wanna run a blockade of Mars High for a couple hours. Even if you just wanted to park and go AFK that would be fine but it seems it worth a try to see what happens. I’d prolly try and get ahold of the CoR too and see if they wouldn’t be interested in blockading capital ports or other ports of importance to the major powers. I don’t think sitting near the slot will get a loitering charge, I’ll have to try and see. But if not we can just park real close and stop traffic to disrupt them financially.
I’d make a post the day prior here to let other CMDR’s know, because the idea isn’t to disrupt individuals, but the powers, and also to call some attention to it from FDEV other than that just be cordial to people coming in who might not know, not looking to get in a gun fight. What y’all think?
