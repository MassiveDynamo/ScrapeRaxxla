Hi Orthon, the strange missions - I think that's just a new missions mechanic in beyond 4. Quite a few people have had this and if your used to the old ways then it will seem strange. They weren't there in the original game so should not be the right path?

In many stations I get the 'mission objective found' message as I launch. Usually its just a trader mission with a type-9 in open space.

The NYSA mission was a black - box, though the grain cannister was interesting to me, but in the end it just fizzled out.

One of the troubles with all of this, is that all the NPCs have interesting names in order to make the game feel good and its all to easy to read too much into them and suffer from coincidence.

I suspect we are missing the first hook, and that if we can work it out then it will unravel nicely. Keep looking - its more interesting than pew-pew and I've learnt tons of old mythology and astronomy

Dont want to sound practical but has anyone thought of reporting this as a bug, if its an intended mission mechanism then so be it, if not it needs flagging. FD can't monitor all lines of tin-foil to weed out such bugs.

They logically wouldn't confirm / deny but if its not intended it can go on the list for house-keeping. Be nice to draw a line under it otherwise we'll be seeing meaning in ice patterns in our canopies soon.

Has it been reported?
