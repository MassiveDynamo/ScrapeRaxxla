Regarding polaris and the pole star - due to earths wobbling and the precession of the orbit, the pole star is not polaris in either ancient greek times or in 3305. In Ancient greece its a choice of beta-Ursa-minor, or kappa draconis. In 3305, Errai (gamma-Cephus) is the nearest bright star. Is this relevant ? - not sure !

It’s possibly relevant. Even ‘older’ pole stars could be relevant, if that’s where we need to look.

The ED sky is a copy of the 2014 sky, as far as I know. Polaris is the north star, in game.
