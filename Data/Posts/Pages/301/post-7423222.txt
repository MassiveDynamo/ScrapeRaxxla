Yeah but that was the message we got she sent after she knew she would die. It was something we were supposed to do in the event she didn’t make it. Really it’s the only message we have directly from a DW member.

IIrc Salome was a Storyevent bei DW to decide the outcome of his novel. If I were to focus on CMDR Salome I would start, where she started: 46 Eridani. Lots of landable planets. Haven‘t been there, but plan on going there after finishing a certain Tip Off.
