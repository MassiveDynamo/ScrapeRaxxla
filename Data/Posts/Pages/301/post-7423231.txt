IIrc Salome was a Storyevent bei DW to decide the outcome of his novel. If I were to focus on CMDR Salome I would start, where she started: 46 Eridani. Lots of landable planets. Havenâ€˜t been there, but plan on going there after finishing a certain Tip Off.

Both this and Garand's ideas are worth looking into imo. There is more Salome's story I think the community missed collectively
