It's well known that Raxxla, door and key, opens the way to "new universes " with all what that implies in matter of... etc.
Could be the access to a new uncharted galaxy (yum yum !) or to these locked distant sectors across the MW. (I never understood why FD need so many to work their development and tests... Wouldn't one or two suffice ? I bet they are full of (bugged) goodies waiting for us to gain access to them.)
Now, double dare you , FD ! Or just more fluff ?

Don't get me wrong, I really hope this will be worth it in the end. Worse case, this thread has been more fun and exciting to read. Even the systems that I've personally look into that have been mentioned, least I get to see/experience some other neat things in the process.
