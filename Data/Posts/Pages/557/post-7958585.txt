I cant open your file, is it microsoft word document or smething? Could you just save it as picture? Just in case, i have updated my previous post with star map for the year 3305. Also if you saw two bright objects near the right border or the map, these were Saturn and Venus.
It's originally an odg from libre office draw. I renamed it .doc.

Here are pics:

There doesn't appear to be a difference between 2019 and 3305 though. Not sure what that means.
