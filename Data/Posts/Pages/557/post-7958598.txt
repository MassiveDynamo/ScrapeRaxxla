Changing subject slightly, I'm wondering why this thread with over 500 pages hasn't managed to make it to 'Sticky' status yet. I mean, we don't really NEED it, since we never get off the first page, but it's nice to have the status

Edit:
Just checked - over 1/3 of the total posts in the Lore subforum are in this one thread.

Mods?
I for my part like this quiet little corner of the forum, it is after all just a humble ship's log. On the other hand, considering all the awesome posts, posters and enjoyment through the last 4 years, sticking this thread would not be opposed by me.
