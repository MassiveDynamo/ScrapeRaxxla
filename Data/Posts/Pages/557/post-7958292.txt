Was at Qiefoea CL-Y g6, nothing out of the ordinary found.

I was wondering about that.
I'm assuming it's got one of the blue/white glows that O-type stars have on the GalMap which are visible from zoomed out way beyond where the star dots show up - is that something that is applied to every G-level system and it's just that mostly they're O-Type stars?
