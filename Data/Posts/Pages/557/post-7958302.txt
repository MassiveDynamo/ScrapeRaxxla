I was wondering about that.
I'm assuming it's got one of the blue/white glows that O-type stars have on the GalMap which are visible from zoomed out way beyond where the star dots show up - is that something that is applied to every G-level system and it's just that mostly they're O-Type stars?
Qiefoea CL-Y g1 (O star) does not seem to glow, so I'd venture a no.
