When it's made sticky, that's when you know Raxxla definitely exists.

Hm, my best bet was on "When you see it as a rumor for a Sector in a bugfixed Codex" after a major Update.

Well, whenever that's a thing, that is. Could take a while and maybe they're working on the V1.0 placeholder (= GALnet/Codex fluff they're now slowly backpaddling on) and implement it in the 2020 update?
(I kinda trust the leak on that, to be precise its last added sentence. It'd fit FDev just perfectly , especially in the light of "Oh, you guys invested time in searching for in-game content based on fluff narration? Sorry, after 4.5 years we just recently realized that this was a bad idea, apologies for all your time wasted chasing ghosts" )

Still a thread worth watching, some serious brainwork and some nicely crazy ideas visibly at work here
