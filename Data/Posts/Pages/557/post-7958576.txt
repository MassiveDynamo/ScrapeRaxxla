Plus, if we were ever able to find it, what would we actually DO that we can't already do in-game? I've never put thought into that part, lol.
It's well known that Raxxla, door and key, opens the way to "new universes " with all what that implies in matter of... etc.
Could be the access to a new uncharted galaxy (yum yum !) or to these locked distant sectors across the MW. (I never understood why FD need so many to work their development and tests... Wouldn't one or two suffice ? I bet they are full of (bugged) goodies waiting for us to gain access to them.)
Now, double dare you , FD ! Or just more fluff ?
