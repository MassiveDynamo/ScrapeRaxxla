Love the bit about ‘Lyta Crane reference in codex: if there is no TDW station hidden in game then maybe this is another hint to Raxxla? LYTA type stars in a system in Corona Australis?’

The crown isn’t that far from the bubble nor the hypothesised 2296 sphere of influence!

I still hold out the Codex holds some obscure map with six (or less) reference point to triangulate a point in space. The northern crowns a good place as any to search for the DW station if it’s real.
HIP 68385 does have LYTA bodies in-system as well as Josie Rosa planet & “comms installation”, and is in Corona Australis/Austrinus (& it does seem to be a very unusually configured installation!). IMHO that is the most promising candidate, but I couldn’t trigger any Omphalos. MB did say “it is very hard to find”. And triple BH should make it a good GW source for Gaia to detect.

I did wonder if “Josie Rosa” is another clue. Wish there was a register of founders/backers that got naming rights. I tried it as an anagram but failed to get anything appropriate out of it.
