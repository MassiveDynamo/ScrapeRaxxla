Hehe, yes I'm just going to ask them why Mimas isn't there, point out the other Sol bodies that are smaller/less oblate than Mimas, and the EDDB Mimas entry (which has the correct size etc.).

Whatever answer they give at that point will be useful.

I just want them to confirm whether it's a technical reason or a game-lore reason, really. If it is something Raxxla (or other puzzle) related, they'll likely have some sort of prepared response. If it's a technical limitation they should easily be able to tell me that.

I have a crap-ton more stuff I've been working on regarding 'the next steps' assuming Saturn-Mimas is intended to be the "start here" marker, I'm still compiling some research and trying stuff out, will post next week on that, I defo need help on it.
