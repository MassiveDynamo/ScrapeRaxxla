@Jorki Rasalas when you're out there exploring, how's your FSD health? Always keep it near 100% right?
It is usually at 100%. Of course it degrades if NS boosting (I tend to avoid WD boosting as benefit is not worth the risk), but I carry at least one AFMS and when fsd health gets down to 90% I repair it. I did once get it low enough that it wouldn't fire up when I needed it. I have enough materials to synthesise AFMS refills if necessary but have never got that low. In my pure exploration ship fits I go light but carry two AFMS so they can cross-repair.
