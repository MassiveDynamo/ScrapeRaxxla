That's fascinating So you're primarily looking for a black hole with an alien object around/near it? I would hope if you find such a place it will respond to a D-Scanner!

A black hole does seem really likely. I always thought it's weird Fdev put one in Maia, afaik there's no hint of one there IRL. Not sure if that was ever explained?
We have had very few things explained by FD! Not really since MBâ€™s departure IMHO!

A gravitational wave source (Dark Siren, GW Whisperer) is likely to be a close binary (BH-BH or BH-NS), or a pulsar with an asymmetrical mass distribution so the mass wobbles as it rotates. That source would have been detected by the Gaia satellite.

How the Omphalos is then implemented in-game is moot. Could be the BH itself (hence why I dive them to see if it leads anywhere), or an alien device that needs to be triggered to create the wormhole to Raxxla....

Edit: but since we dont know much then we dont know how reliable the Omphalos actually is....there could be an element of random number generator in actuating the Omphalos....
