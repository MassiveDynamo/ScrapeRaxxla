If utilising Support, could go via simple route (I’m taking a break myself as I’m sure I’m on their watch list)…

State EDDB has Mimas listed, as a body in Sol. You go to Sol and it’s not there, explain contact with EDDB who cannot confirm the error, ask Support why it’s not there!

The less they know of your true intent the better, but again utilise a linguist snare that requires their admission - better still, a contradiction that can be thrown back at them, there is a clear omission, if we cannot trust the data presented to us how can we interact with the game correctly, if it’s a bug / oversight then identify it.

Of course FD will know the questions coming as undoubtedly they read our ramblings for fun I’m sure.

Remember Support are front line, they won’t have the answers, they have the same data we do, best utilise that against them so as to put them into a state where they have to ask a Dev for feedback. Talking directly to a Dev is showing your hand, they are less likely to talk back.

Again keep such communications brief, sensible and respectful and above all relevant.

As a data gathering tool it’s viable, but we must not over abuse it, nor read too much into it, not unless you can ask the same question from two different perspectives over separate time periods and get the same results.

And remember it might not relate to Raxxla, it could be tied to the Mars relic (which is known to be narratively locked) or it might be a narrative dead end.

One way or another - is it intentionally omitted or just… complacency? If it’s intentional then you’ve uncovered a new path, where that leads is the basis of your next investigation.
