OK, I said Iâ€™d disclose my latest hypothesis which IMHO makes sense of most of what we know.

I have whittled my suspicions down to three likely candidate systems -browse through to understand! What I don't understand is how to activate the omphalos to reach Raxxla...
Wow that's really cool! I confess a lot of that went right over my head

Question: What are you hoping to find at your candidate stars? Or rather, how will you know you've found it? Apologies if you answered that and I missed it

I defo agree that Raxxla was detected early-on due to FTL - remotely via probes or via test-FTL pilots - but what do you think they 'detected/saw' that hasn't been subsequently seen, or that might have become lost so that they need to 'seek' it in early references?
