Love the bit about ‘Lyta Crane reference in codex: if there is no TDW station hidden in game then maybe this is another hint to Raxxla? LYTA type stars in a system in Corona Australis?’

The crown isn’t that far from the bubble nor the hypothesised 2296 sphere of influence!

I still hold out the Codex holds some obscure map with six (or less) reference point to triangulate a point in space. The northern crowns a good place as any to search for the DW station if it’s real.
