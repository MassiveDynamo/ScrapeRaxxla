Mimas was probably just destroyed sometime between 2022 and 3300, probably during development of hyperdrive.
Exactly what we're thinking! A vanishing moon should surely have been in a tourist beacon though, right?! Easy enough to explain away... unless it's a clue... a "little bit obvious".

@Rochester excellent points in your post about Fdev knowing the importance of the discoverer. Yes, that forum post is a good example, people say "Mimas is missing?" then basically just shrug and explain it away (usually by lecturing on the other missing moons (which are all asteroidal wibbly shapes)). - despite the fact that we know it would have been possible to add in even back in 2014, given that it's the first moon of Saturn and spherical (mostly) and there's plenty of Sol-objects like the moons that have been 'interpreted' to fit within engine limitations. And even then we know they could have added it in 2.2 with the irregular, non-spherical, smaller Kuiper objects they added.
