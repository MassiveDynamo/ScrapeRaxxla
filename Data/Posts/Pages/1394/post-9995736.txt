When i submitted my ticket for Mimas and Hyperion i did mention Raxxla, i think they are fine if you make the request humorous and don't try to be a smart git pointing it out as an error on their part, at least that's the impression i got from the reply's.

They always seem very helpful

Yes that true, but Support are not Devs, they have (from experience) a certain level of insight. If you do mention Raxxla you are effectively showing a hand and giving them an easy way out, because Raxxla falls into that ‘no comment’ box.

You will get more insight if you talk about the wider context and how it’s detrimental to the game, they have to address that issue, if they can’t… ask why, it forces them to ask a Dev and give you a logical answer.

Of course such a method of data gathering is ultimately flawed because FD will be keeping a tally of who asks questions so ultimately it agitates them to the point they will counteract your enquiry with a rebuke (from experience)…

Best to take it easy, slow and ask questions over a protracted time,
