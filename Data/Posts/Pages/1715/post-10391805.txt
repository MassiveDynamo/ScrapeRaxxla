So I checked out HIP 11812 on a whim (the beat or timing of Astrophel and Stella..) nice little place not much I can do there without any useable tools so I put a pin in it.

Them I searched HIP 21811... now that confused me eternally. Not only dpes it give a result, but the result doesn't make sense. Perhaps its a console issue, havn't had time to set up my laptop for playing at this time, so busy (really lazy just started vaca. Have some appts to sort out.. etc..)

I wouldn't waste time going there but that makes me want to go there even more.. will be an expedition for sure.

When someone gets a chance, search it (hip 21811) and post what you get as the location. Heres screen grab of what I got.
