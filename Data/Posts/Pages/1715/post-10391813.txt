This ^^
Over the past month ive reset my Raxxla hunt, started a new XL sheet and I'm now only looking at it from the perspective of a new player.
What in game leads me to Raxxla? and only things that are in game.
Im literally leaving all my external books on the shelf, all my knowledge of everyone involved in the game (Holdstock, Drew etc) and trying to look at it with fresh eyes.

I think we are over complicating things - after all its a little bit obvious isn't it

Its too late for me.... everything I see has a deeper connection to raxxla.... its even worse when I see the number thirty-three somewhere...

I've hurt my back last night (bending down to check the state of a pizza in the oven) so I will not be doing any DIY today. Hence more flying after the essential morning dogwalk! More systems to visit, more hotspots to count....

Sorry to hear - did something like that a few months ago and its only now i can bend without feeling a twinge.... atleast it was for a good cause .... mmmmm pizza.
