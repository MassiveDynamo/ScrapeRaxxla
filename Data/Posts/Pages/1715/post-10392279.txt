I was dabbling a bit with the name again. Raxxla that is.

I try to read hints as general and find whats common about them. When it comes to the cosmology this myth operates in, it seem to be geocentric. Milton, silent song of the spheres and the omphalos idea are all geocentric in their view of the sky.

I was thinking the name might say something in this context. I came up with this:

First i splitt the name in three parts. Ra, xx and la. Then I let AI analyse it in the context of astronomy. There were several suggestions but I was after a location, so I landed on this:

Ra = Right ascension (of course)
xx = 20 (simple roman numerals)
la = latitude or more specifically celestial latitude

This gives longitude in one coordinate system and latitude in another an just the number 20.

I tried putting 20 in both coordinates and recalculating the latitude to normal equatorial declination. This gives:

Ra 20h Dec -0.57°

The closest named star is Tseen Foo at
Right ascension: 20h11m18.30s
Declination: -00Â°49'17.0"

θ Aql (Tseen Foo) - Star - SKY-MAP

This is about as close you can get with Roman numerals

The system is a binary with no planets an has the interesting alternative name of: Thanih Ras al Akab

In the sky, the system is close to Altair. Crossing the magpie bridge from Vega will get you close.
The system also have a listening post.

This is just a simple analyses, following the path of least resistance. There are endless other way to interpret the name.
