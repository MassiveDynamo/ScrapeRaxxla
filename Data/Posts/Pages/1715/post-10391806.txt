True but a little bit obvious could well be an historical clue. Personally I suspect Brookes was just alluding to the removed missions. They were pretty obvious… a place that is not a place… those were in my opinion the ‘original’ path, but it got canned. I honestly believe the Codex is a redux map of that old storyline and does point the way, but that reference; it’s old and can’t be trusted anymore I think.

So nope I don’t believe it’s obvious anymore. It may have been.
No, I think it's still "a little bit obvious", I don't think that will have changed at all, I'm seeing the clues in-game, and I'm not at all convinced the old E/F missions were anything to do with the Raxxla puzzle. That is pure speculation based on the phrase "what was lost will soon be found" from one of those missions-we assumed it meant Raxxla, but it might have meant something totally different....I think that was a separate (but weakly associated) storyline involving TDW, Pilots Federation, Mars Alien Artefact, and Guardians. It might be that storyline was just removed as OBE, superfluous and too convoluted since people were exploring regions of space that were clearly intended to be Guardian much earlier than FD expected. To explore and not find Guardian bases which magically appeared at a later date would be rather catastrophic for the game. That instigated the big sector lockdowns. FD clearly expected us to concentrate on missions and they were apparently designed to move us around the universe in a far more controlled manner than the player base aspired to.
