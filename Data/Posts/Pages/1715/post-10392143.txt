Its too late for me.... everything I see has a deeper connection to raxxla.... its even worse when I see the number thirty-three somewhere...



Sorry to hear - did something like that a few months ago and its only now i can bend without feeling a twinge.... atleast it was for a good cause .... mmmmm pizza.
What if we totally misunderstood the "tiny bit obvious" thing, and the bit represents the "binary digit"? What if 33 means something in bits? didnt all proc gen systems had a 64 bit names?
