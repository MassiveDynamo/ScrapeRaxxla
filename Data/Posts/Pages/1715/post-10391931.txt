Its too late for me.... everything I see has a deeper connection to raxxla.... its even worse when I see the number thirty-three somewhere...



Sorry to hear - did something like that a few months ago and its only now i can bend without feeling a twinge.... atleast it was for a good cause .... mmmmm pizza.
Well, it wasn't a great pizza. A friend gave me a pack of chilled pizza dough she'd spotted in a supermarket. So I rolled it out, topped with a dash of tomato ketchup (couldn't see any tinned pizza sauce in the shop and wasn't going to boil up my own for one pizza), smeared it with nduja pasta, crumbled a mozzarella ball over and tipped on a couple of bits of artichoke hearts (from greek salad lunch) plus pepperoni slices.

Then I tried to get it off the wooden peel onto metal peel for launching in the oven...a nightmare, it stuck like glue despite a dusting of polenta (no flour). In my efforts to transfer it all the toppings came off. Managed to get it on the metal peel and rearrange the toppings....stuck to the metal peel! Thankfully I remembered I'd got some baking parchment stashed in a cupboard so in it eventually went, somewhat mishapen and unevenly topped, on a piece of that at 200C.

It was 10 minutes later whilst checking the progress that I bent down and opened the oven door...and swore loudly as my lower back twinged. Spent most of yesterday with a heat pad pressed against it & it's feeling a bit better today.

Verdict- won't get that dough again!

(But you're doing it wrong...everyone knows the answer is 42!)
