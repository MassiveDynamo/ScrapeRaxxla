No way. Cirag is Cirag.

Exactly! But Cirag managed to stay "off the grid" and hidden. It is intertwined in the Alex Ryder story ... and thus with Raxxla (though only peripherally). Could be a key or maybe even a door

Incidentally I just reread the pertinent portion of The Dark Wheel and realized I've been making a goof. I keep attributing the "Cirag is Cirag" line to Race Zetter. It was Elyssia Fields who said it.
