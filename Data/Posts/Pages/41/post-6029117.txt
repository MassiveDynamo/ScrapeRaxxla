Well I did kind of go on a wormhole/black hole comparison there. As also it has been posited in some sci-fi flicks that it would be possible tontravel through a black hole, provided the immense gravity doesn't crush you or rip you into space dust.

It's been tried in ED previous versions. Seem to remember I tried it the first time I went to Maia.
Would be a bit naff if it's just one special black hole!
