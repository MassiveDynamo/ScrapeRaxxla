Well I did kind of go on a wormhole/black hole comparison there. As also it has been posited in some sci-fi flicks that it would be possible tontravel through a black hole, provided the immense gravity doesn't crush you or rip you into space dust.

Ever since they added the new HUD graphic for black holes I've been keeping my eyes out for non-rotating ones. I haven't heard of anyone finding a Schwarzshild black hole in-game though. Schwarzschild geometry consists of:

1. A blackhole
2. A whitehole
3. 2 universes connected at the horizons of the blackhole & whitehole.

It is unlikely that they actually exist in the real world and equally unlikely that they exist in Elite: Dangerous ... though maybe we'll get some interesting things in "Beyond" regarding exploration.

I don't personally suspect Raxxla to be related to wormholes ... though its definitely worth keeping an open mind (and an open eye out).
