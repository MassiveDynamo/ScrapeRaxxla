A door that is also a key could be an archway with a keystone holding the arch up perhaps?

And of course googling keystones just now led me to this, which seems quite interesting...

Edit: A place that is not a place could refer to something that is constantly moving and never in the same location - a rogue planet, a comet, or even a ship or a FSD-capable station like Jacques.

Here is a list of known rogue planets - may be worth checking to see if any of these are on the Galmap under these names or other designations listed in Simbad. Not in-game at the moment but next time I am will look into these and might start heading out Hercules way: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_planet

It would also be interesting to determine if any of these are near the Hercules keystone asterism...
