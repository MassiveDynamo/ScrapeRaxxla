Ciraq is also a place that isn't a place. There's a lot of the Old Worlds from the 1984 Elite that didn't make it into Elite: Dangerous but, as far as I know, only two worlds from The Dark Wheel didn't even make it into the original game. Raxxla and Ciraq. Alex Ryder even openly speculated that Ciraq could be Raxxla, though this speculation was quickly slapped down by Rafe Zetter.

Maybe, just maybe, we shouldn't even be looking for Raxxla at this point. Maybe we should be looking for Ciraq.
