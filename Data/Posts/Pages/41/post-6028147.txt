A Place that isn't a Place would be nicely answered by a Black Hole, but the Door that is also a Key part doesn't seem to me to fit.

Well I did kind of go on a wormhole/black hole comparison there. As also it has been posited in some sci-fi flicks that it would be possible tontravel through a black hole, provided the immense gravity doesn't crush you or rip you into space dust.
