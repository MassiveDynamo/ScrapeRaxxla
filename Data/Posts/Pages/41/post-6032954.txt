Exactly! But Cirag managed to stay "off the grid" and hidden. It is intertwined in the Alex Ryder story ... and thus with Raxxla (though only peripherally). Could be a key or maybe even a door

Incidentally I just reread the pertinent portion of The Dark Wheel and realized I've been making a goof. I keep attributing the "Cirag is Cirag" line to Race Zetter. It was Elyssia Fields who said it.

Can we narrow down an area of space for where Cirag should be?

Update (see edits below for working).

As a first rough estimate, Cirag should be within say 25-30 ly of Crucis Sector DL-Y d163.

I doubt there's anything to actually find though.



Edit - 19 ly from Xezoar. Which also isn't in game...
Edit 2 - No systems within a 4 ly radius of Cirag

Edit 3 - Location of Xezoar in Elite:

Xezaor (146,112), {36,62,110,145,150,200,230,237} within 7.0 LY. Radius 3474 km.
Multi-Government, Rich Ind. Pop. 4.3 B, Prod. 20640 MCr. HC: 8, TL: 11, Human Colonials.
The world Xezaor is most well known for its hoopy casinos.

Lave (20,173), {39,46,55,129,147,255} within 7.0 LY. Radius 4116 km.
Dictatorship, Rich Agri. Pop. 2.5 B, Prod. 7000 MCr. HC: 6, TL: 5, Human Colonials.
Lave is most famous for its vast rain forests and the Laveian tree grub.

Reorte (19,151), {7,27,72,147,155,165,192,193} within 7.0 LY. Radius 6419 km.
Dictatorship, Poor Agri. Pop. 3.1 B, Prod. 5208 MCr. HC: 8, TL: 6, Black Fat Felines.
This planet is mildly fabled for its inhabitants' eccentric love for tourists but plagued by deadly earthquakes.

Riedquat (3,181), {7,55,147,155,255} within 7.0 LY. Radius 6403 km.
Anarchy, Poor Agri. Pop. 2.0 B, Prod. 1920 MCr. HC: 5, TL: 4, Harmless Rodents.
This planet is most notable for its fabulous cuisine but beset by occasional civil war.


Calculating....

Edit 4 - none of the systems within 7y of Xezoar are in EDSM.

Interpolating co-ordinates...


Edit 5 - Ok, interpolating co-ordinates isn't going to work completely as there's changes in relative position between Elite and ED.

However, first try gives:


Xezoar co-ordinates: 101.51, 48.75, 81.81

Nearest known system is: Crucis Sector DL-Y d163


This is calculated from the positions of Lave and Reorte, but it's definitely not going to be completely right as I've used Riedquat as a test:

Predicted Riedquat co-ordinates: 72.28, 48.75, 69.30
Actual Riedquat co-ordinates: 68.84, 48.75 69.75
