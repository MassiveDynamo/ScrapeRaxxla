Ever since they added the new HUD graphic for black holes I've been keeping my eyes out for non-rotating ones. I haven't heard of anyone finding a Schwarzshild black hole in-game though. Schwarzschild geometry consists of:

1. A blackhole
2. A whitehole
3. 2 universes connected at the horizons of the blackhole & whitehole.

It is unlikely that they actually exist in the real world and equally unlikely that they exist in Elite: Dangerous ... though maybe we'll get some interesting things in "Beyond" regarding exploration.

I don't personally suspect Raxxla to be related to wormholes ... though its definitely worth keeping an open mind (and an open eye out).

Well put.
I've been hanging around the Bub too long for my liking anyways, so I'm heading out to Sag A* in my Viper mk4 to see if I cant dig anything up.
