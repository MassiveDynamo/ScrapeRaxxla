A Place that isn't a Place would be nicely answered by a Black Hole, but the Door that is also a Key part doesn't seem to me to fit.

Witchspace is some kind of place which isn´t a place and introducing the coordinates and then jumping is kind of opening a door and crossing it...
I wonder if Raxxla can be reached through a ..special.. jump.
But I`ll stick to MB˙s tiny little bit obvious clue.

(Seriously, fellows. Try one time to post using a Slovenian keyboard [where is it])
