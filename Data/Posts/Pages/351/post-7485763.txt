Nice, have you tried to do the same with the DW logo from the codex?

Don't you think the central hexagons should be aligned?

I was thinking the same thing. The issue I have is the same as when I was trying to recreate the INRA logo in that I don't have the original - it's extremely skewed in the Codex entry. I'll see if can straighten it out as much as possible but, as you can see from my INRA vector trace, the results are good but not perfect.

Kinda feels like if there's anything to gain from this it needs to be spot on.
