CMDR Dragon Tein from Canonn Discord was able to enhance the pattern in TDW's logo a bit more.

It doesn't quite go out to the edge, and it does overlap the dark lines of the logo.
What are the odds that FDev's paint software would bug out and leave a weird artifact on just one edge of an image that's ostensibly a puzzle clue?



Although in defense of the "bug" theory, we're still talking about the company that slapped a spoiler on a space vehicle and called it a new ship, and had a bunch of clipping issues with the newer Alliance ships too.

I don't know what leads I could draw from the pattern, but I've chased leads that were based on shakier ground than this, lol
