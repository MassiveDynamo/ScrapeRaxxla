Hmm, the comment about Pi being in the Dark Wheel logo got me to look at the logo.
The Pi thing turned out to be about the fan made logo, not the one in the codex...

HOWEVER...

There's some strange discolored green & purple dashes along the side of the Dark Wheel logo. It's there in other languages as well.
Do you guys see it too? The other top-level codex entries don't have any similar colored bands.
(All the codex pictures have some vertical lines running through them though).

Here's the codex heading in high def, look at the edge of TDW's logo (it's hard to see in the actual codex unless you highlight TDWs entry)




I took a high res screenshot (Alt-F10), and had a look at the edge...



And then decreased the brightness to make the discolored parts stand out more




Clue?
Just an image artifact?

If this was a clue, then not a nice one for a videogame because people with far lesser sight will never find it,
