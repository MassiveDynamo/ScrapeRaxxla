Yes, we also keep returning to the "Raxxla is close to Sol because early hyperdrives couldn't go very far" argument.

Pro:
Makes sense from a logic, lore and story point of view

Con:

So that leaves us with few options:

If FDev had said one way or another whether "some commander has honked the system" that would be a massively helpful clue.
Yes = Raxxla is 99% likely to be in the bubble or near something interesting
No = Raxxla is 99% likely to be permit-locked or in some random system you can't find without getting a hint

If this was old-school Star Wars, where they had some guy who's whole job was to keep the lore consistent and he was consulted on the placement of Raxxla, then for sure, it's within like 600ly of Sol, tops.
But all indications are that David has like 100% creative control over the game and if he says 'stick this object in Gru Hypu F-U 92-69' then nobody's going to argue with him about how well that fits into the lore.
If someone stumbles on it and is like ' why is it 30k ly from sol, nobody could ever get that far with the old hyperdrives' they'll be like 'Alex Ryder's dad was a raxxlan wizard and he used magic to get there'.

Ideally, people should ask more good questions on a livestream or official forum about this.
Not "Does Raxxla exist?" or "Where is Raxxla" since they obviously can't tell us, but any metagame question like this:

Hate to say this, but the con to your pro is that it requires disregarding a whole load of stuff, whether possibilities, rumours or semi-lore.
