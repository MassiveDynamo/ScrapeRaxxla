Ah, jam on the display. This is why I have breakfast browsing the forum threads on my ipad and keep gaming to the PC, where the only danger is biscuit crumbs and coffee splashes.
There is always dust. I have parallaxed many a TDW station, only to find a grain of dust on the monitor.

At least I don't have that problem in VR, on the main computer.
