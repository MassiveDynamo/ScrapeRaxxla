Taking into account the "Deepest void" part there is a sector of space called "The Void" on the galaxy map.

Also I don't think it's in the old world's as the log article states that one of the characters of the story was at Tau Ceri which never existed in Elite 1.

Yes of course, which is Galactic Region 42 (again seen in many cultural references & fiction). The symbology of numbers & names in ED are important.
