Taking into account the "Deepest void" part there is a sector of space called "The Void" on the galaxy map.

Also I don't think it's in the old world's as the log article states that one of the characters of the story was at Tau Ceri which never existed in Elite 1.

Deepest Void sector has always held some interest, its likely a bug or a smudge on my plasma but way out in the Deepest void....waaay out from any stars is a small red smudge. If you try and zoom in, its dispersed.

Just odd as I cant find any stars out there and its right out there in the direction of the Magellanic clouds.

Probably just jam.
