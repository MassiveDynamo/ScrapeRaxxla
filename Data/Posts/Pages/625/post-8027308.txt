42 the answer to life the universe and everything!

Taking into account it's quite spaced out over there with big distances between stars Raxxla could be over there and we may never find it. Some cmdrs have been over there however as there are some codex information in the region backing up the "the system has been visited" arguement.

Nah personally I don't think its in 42 due to various "reasons" plus I'm pretty sure it was never to be taken literally.
You might want to do more research though on the rumor. It was never true, apparently just a bad "joke" given too much life. A lie can run round the world before the truth has got its boots on.
