If you read Terry Pratchett's Discworld series (one of my fav), you'd see The Lady (Luck) vs Fate. The idea of Probability vs Predestination. Free will vs Determinism. The Lady has green eyes & Fate has black eyes. A common motif and I'd expect as good writers, they'd have all done a deep dive. Everything that good writers write about is deliberate. Same with Douglas Adams & THGTTG with the Heart of Gold.

I have seen some of the shows but much to my detriment ... I have not read his Discworld series.. yet.
Ya the free will vs determinism debate... Just my take on it, and as I guess I am propounding the Neoplatonist theory (I think they would come down in the middle). Fortuna, Anake, and the Fates are all aspects of some hypercosmic god that in itself would eventually derive (imagine nesting dolls) from the One. The One (Monad) is the seed of everything- it is Truth, God, Intellect, Chaos, Matrix.... So as we get closer to the One our actions become Truer and more deterministic as we would be more apt to make the 'right' choice... however we also get closer to whirling obscurity and the darkness that is Chaos (hmmm the black hole of determinism). How that will help us find Raxxla .... hahahahahah no idea

I was just happy to make a connection between 'mother of stars' and 'lady fate'
