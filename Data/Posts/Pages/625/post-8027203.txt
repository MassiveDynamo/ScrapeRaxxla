Yes of course, which is Galactic Region 42 (again seen in many cultural references & fiction). The symbology of numbers & names in ED are important.
42 the answer to life the universe and everything!

Taking into account it's quite spaced out over there with big distances between stars Raxxla could be over there and we may never find it. Some cmdrs have been over there however as there are some codex information in the region backing up the "the system has been visited" arguement.
