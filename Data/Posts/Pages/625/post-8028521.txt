And if we're including all versions of this Omphalous Rift a la Improbability Drive I'd like to introduce the Holly Hop Drive as potentially significant as I know 'Lister Of Smeg' is a player and a good likelihood to be a fdev account.

I do like the idea of the Necessity Drive using the Omphalos like a spindle whirl around the driveshaft of necessity. Wouldnt take you where u want to go... Only where you need to... Would be terribly dull.
Oohhh a special engineer for the right upgrades....
