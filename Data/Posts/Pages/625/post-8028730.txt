At risk of turning this into a HHG2G fan thread:

The scrabble episode at the end of the series was meant to demonstrate that the arrival of the Golga-Frincham's on earth had messed up the computer program, and that what Marvin had seen in Arthurs brain waves was the wrong question. Prak came after that.. and don't mention the frogs!

[ I should mention that this is the radio series, which is the only canon version and has nothing to do with the abomination which is the movie...]
The books are more official, officially.

Vetinari, PeteACarter and simulacrae
