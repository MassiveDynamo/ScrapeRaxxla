Deepest Void sector has always held some interest, it may be a bug or a smudge on my plasma but way out in the Deepest void....waaay out from any stars is a small red smudge. If you try and zoom in its dispersed.

Just odd as I cant find any stars out there and it right out there in the direction of the Magellanic clouds.

Probably just jam.

Ah, jam on the display. This is why I have breakfast browsing the forum threads on my ipad and keep gaming to the PC, where the only danger is biscuit crumbs and coffee splashes.
