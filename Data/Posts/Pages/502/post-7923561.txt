Alternatively, if you go down the road of the greek myths, The Odyssey fits with this sentence quite well:
Parents Grief: Odysseus' mother, Anticlea, dies of grief
Lovers Woe: Penelope and the suitors
Yearning of our vagabond hearts: Odysseus disguised as a beggar on his return to Ithaca
In additin the odyssey also fits:
Whisperer in witch-space: The witch Circe?
Sirens of the deepest void: Sirens, and trip to hades.
No fit for the 'mother of galaxies' sentence..

Rochester, Count dEstard, Tigorath and 2 others
