I took it at face value - to mean that Raxxla hunters of TDW have Fernweh - also vagabonds are not wealthy by and large - scruffy explorers in DBX's that smell like they've had all the smoke let out of them, and who never wash their socks.. Imagine Bear Grylls in a Spaceship

Oh and that they havent found it yet...
