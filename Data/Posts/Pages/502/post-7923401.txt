Here is an high-res image of the anomaly in Star of India:
SPOILER

I noticed that you have to move the marker up, to avoid the star covering it. This image can be some quite a bit for details.

Notice that the dot does not look like this all the time. It changes shape and brightness and will vanish from time to time.

It's probably NGC 7822

I vaguely recall reading somewhere that the background of the System Map is related to the skybox. I'll try a bit of Googling...
