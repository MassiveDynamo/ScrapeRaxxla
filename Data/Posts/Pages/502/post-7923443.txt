I came across a game-mechanic I was not aware of in the Colonia region the other day. I was cruising around a system, looking for signal sources, when I had a mission objective detected. Given that I had no active missions, I found this a bit strange. When I got there, there was a Type-9 Heavy sat in real space, offering me a large payout, if I went and sourced some Animal Meat. In the message, the identity of the ship was "Hidden". I did the mission and nothing came of it, but I wonder if TDW could use the same mechanic to initiate contact? Have many of you come across this mechanism?
