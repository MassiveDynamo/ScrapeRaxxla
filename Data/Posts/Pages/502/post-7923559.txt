Sucks in air through teeth.....I know I'm in the minority, but I'm the other way around. Conda a nice general purpose ship, but for serious exploration, I like my ASP. My Conda flies like a brick and is almost impossible to park near anything interesting. Only thing lacking with ASP is jump range, and I have mine up to almost 70ly now
Having said that, when I find Raxxla and need to kill some evil men, my 2E Lightweight Beam Laser is unlikely to be terribly helpful! I would probably fare better finishing them off with the dual repeater on my SRV!
