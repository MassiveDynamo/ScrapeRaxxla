Face value maybe, or it could be a clue (I like clues)

"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts."

Among other, borderline psychotic theories that I have come up with, lets try breaking this down...

Sentence 1 has 1 clue - To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
Sentence 2 has 2 clues - To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!
Sentence 3 has 3 clues - The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts

Could be the beginning of a Fibonacci Sequence.....

1 - My best guess is Sag A - Sag A is sometimes referred to as the "Mother of the Galaxy"
2 - My current thinking is somewhere in the Formidine Rift - Not meaning to mix my mysteries, but the comms at one of the club sites talks about this exact phrase.
3 - My best guess is Aganippe - This is based on Greek mythology, specifically Thebes. New Thebes is in Aganippe

Next in the sequence would be 5, which I have so far been unable to hazard a guess at, based on 1,2 & 3
