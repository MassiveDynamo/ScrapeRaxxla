Hey Vetinari,

Actually I can clarify your point 1!

Since I've been cataloging all known old videos and snooping for content I've come across lots of little comments like this.
Twitch
Twitch is the world's leading video platform and community for gamers.

Oh My Randomonius!

Now that is enlightening and answers a ton of questions all over the place and hopefully means a lot of fun to come, although it does imply a DLC type trigger which is booooo but if it has to be it has to be.

Any more like that please post, anything where he refers to fdev communication or working or game mechanics or set up is insightful and could be helpful. I thought for a long time he didn't realise how much he knew or thought we wouldn't be interested, now I suspect its the NDA he's working around.

One question, now MB has left ED who is the lore-keeper at fdev?
