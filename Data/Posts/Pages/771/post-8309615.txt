1. can you answer if there are pirate fractions in the sol or the like? if not, how do pirates get into a closed system? Is this a flaw in the developers, or do pirates have a loophole?

2. Targoid base is a planetarium? it seems to me that this is too ridiculous ... But what if the dark wheel in the book spoke precisely of this? - You know, this is a difficult question. Your father was looking for traces of the mythical Raxxla. He wanted to know if it really exists? If the legends don’t lie, then there should be an installation created by an alien mind, with the help of which passages to other Universes, to all their treasures are opened. he may have a couple of weeks. Tell me, but there’s not one base, I’ll answer, then they found only one base and probably took it as a basis, what do you think?

3. The dark wheel. If the organization was founded in the 22nd century, then there are not many options where the station can be, at that time all a couple of systems were known. correct if it’s wrong, but it seems that the dark wheel has lost the coordinates of the raxla, if so, then the toast of the dark wheel is not the way to raxla, but something else?
