Always on the lookout for potential suspicious activity:
In this 5 year anniversary live-stream they're jumping from SOL to ALPHA CENTAURI at 48:35 and for fun, look at Pluto and Saturn (no particular reason) just before the jump. I know they are espousing the jump sound and graphics etc, but struck me as odd. It's most likely nothing, but you never know!
