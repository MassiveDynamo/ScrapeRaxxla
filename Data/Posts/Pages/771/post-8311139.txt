Always on the lookout for potential suspicious activity:
In this 5 year anniversary live-stream they're jumping from SOL to ALPHA CENTAURI at 48:35 and for fun, look at Pluto and Saturn (no particular reason) just before the jump. I know they are espousing the jump sound and graphics etc, but struck me as odd. It's most likely nothing, but you never know!

Pluto is always interesting, in the context of the Michael Brookes tattoo.

The top left of the image probably display(top down), Triton, Charon(ferryman of Hades and moon of Pluto) and the river Styx(another moon of Pluto. Not in game) .

Pluto is of course the same god/place as Hades, located at the other side of the river Styx.

SPOILER: MB TATTOO

It may seem strange both mythologically and astronomically to put a sea god like Triton, with that bunch of underworld characters. There may be at least an astronomical explanation inn the fact that Triton is believed to ba a captured moon(it's to big and orbits in the opposite direction). Many astronomers thinks that Triton was originally a Kuiper belt object, like Pluto and it's moons.
In Greek mythology the sea gods were also gods of the rivers.

In the tattoo there seem to be two rivers merging into one. The other one(not Styx) is most likely Archeron, the river of woe.
Archeron is Galactic region 23.
