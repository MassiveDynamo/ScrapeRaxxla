Oh My Randomonius!

Now that is enlightening and answers a ton of questions all over the place and hopefully means a lot of fun to come, although it does imply a DLC type trigger which is booooo but if it has to be it has to be.

Any more like that please post, anything where he refers to fdev communication or working or game mechanics or set up is insightful and could be helpful. I thought for a long time he didn't realise how much he knew or thought we wouldn't be interested, now I suspect its the NDA he's working around.

One question, now MB has left ED who is the lore-keeper at fdev?

Yes, it wasn't until I saw that video that a few things clicked into place. He's skirting NDA with other comments, and if DW is involved in a DLC/Lore in Elite I say all good!

Also, there is so much content covered in the videos, it'd be hard to just post stuff. More often than not it's comments like yours that triggers relevance in my brain, fortunately I can recall most of the video content, but if I stumble across anything that seems pertinent I'll post it up.

I can't comment on MB's replacement, but given the live-stream activity it isn't Paige Harvey seeming to take on that lore / enthusiasm role keeper is it?
