You are right, the Raxxla logo is a symbolism, not a map. But any symbol is built on the principle of logic, the shape and location, the number of elements-correspond to reality. We just need to understand the symbol correctly and link it to the available materials and guesses.

I'm still pretty sure the green glow isn't a bug:
It is only available in the Sol system.
It occurs at a certain distance from the center.
It interacts with the position of the asteroid belt.
So far, no reliable assumptions have been provided about what might cause it.

I think it's worth looking at Sol from the ceiling of the system. Perhaps this will give some hints.

The green spec/glow in frameshift is not only in the Sol system, it is everywhere, Iv gotten it on my way to Sag A, in the Rift, out way beyond Beagle and many other places for years, it is simply there randomly no matter what system you jump to, whether it is something is another question however cant be narrowed to just Sol unfortunately.
