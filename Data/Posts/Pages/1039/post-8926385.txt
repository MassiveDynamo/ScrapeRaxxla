However IRH discord- reshape has been tried, as has another shader pack. Green glow happens regardless.

I just looked up ReShade and it's a post-processing shader/plugin. So all it does is making the visual bug look better.

There are several possible sources of the green glow if it's indeed a bug: It could be the shader code (I suspect it could be the self-shadowing code). But it could also be the incoming data to the shader (position/direction of light source, shadowing information for planets/moons occluding the sun, model data of the ships).
