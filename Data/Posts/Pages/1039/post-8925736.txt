The green spec/glow in frameshift is not only in the Sol system, it is everywhere, Iv gotten it on my way to Sag A, in the Rift, out way beyond Beagle and many other places for years, it is simply there randomly no matter what system you jump to, whether it is something is another question however cant be narrowed to just Sol unfortunately.

Have you got any video evidence for that claim? Because Iâ€™ve never seen it in 5 years.
