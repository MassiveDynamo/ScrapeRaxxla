You are right, the Raxxla logo is a symbolism, not a map. But any symbol is built on the principle of logic, the shape and location, the number of elements-correspond to reality. We just need to understand the symbol correctly and link it to the available materials and guesses.

I'm still pretty sure the green glow isn't a bug:
It is only available in the Sol system.
It occurs at a certain distance from the center.
It interacts with the position of the asteroid belt.
So far, no reliable assumptions have been provided about what might cause it.

I think it's worth looking at Sol from the ceiling of the system. Perhaps this will give some hints.
