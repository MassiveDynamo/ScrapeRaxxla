There is tonss forums posts, replys etc dating back to 5 years, the first was noticed during the rift mystery if i remember correctly and out near heart and soul nebula, just go to any system, enter your system map when your spooling up your frameshift drive and you can actually get it to happen every single jump to wherever and whenever you want
I'm getting the impression that you are talking about a different "Green glow". The one we are discussing now is not during a jump. Is just in system during supercruise
