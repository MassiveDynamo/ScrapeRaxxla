Another Fairytale

In the early history of Cemiess there was a statue - of the 5 furies, although some say it was of Cerberus... It is rumored that this statue stood at the entrance to a well known establishment located at 666 Saltimbanque, the Maison du Chien. The proceeds of this establishment went towards the proprietors scientific pursuits into cloning and "self-knowledge". It has been suggested by certain detractors of the family that they had some hand in the mysterious plague that ended O'Brien's War. It is known that the early settlers of Lave were from the Empire... Research applications have been sent to both Lave and Cemiess in the hopes of identifying any potential family links to the Waldens...

On Achenar 6d there was alien life found... the Mudlarks. They were described as a sentient species but no evidence of them exists other than tales... This is suspect - either they didn't exist or possibly Veils Hypothesis is right, and the aboriginal species had the ability to change their shapes... blend in...
This has potential to shed a different light on the Lords of Restoration conspiracy and the subsequent abduction of the Emperor during that period. Genetic testing is suggested...

It bares mentioning that the Far God cult indicated that Thargoids are "among us" and thus we could also be facing a White Fountain Event if the "Far God" is more than just a god - but a stellar phenomenon... Possibly a White Hole?

SPOILER: TESTAMENT
