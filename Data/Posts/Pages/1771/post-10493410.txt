Nastrond as “corpse shore” and home of the serpent that gnaws on the world tree… very sus
i spent a few hours of my life today grinding 'Defence Party of Nastrond' missions for reputation and finally made it to ALLY status, in order to unlock the PERMIT mission ...but for some reason it's not appearing on any mission-board within any Nastrond-adjacent system.

Anyone can please shed some light? Thanks.
