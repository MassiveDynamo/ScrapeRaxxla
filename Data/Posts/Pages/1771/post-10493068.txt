Not sure where you're going with this, but it's interesting. However it was Art Tornquist's girl Cora who came home soused every night, not Lyta Crane.

Edit
"cant " also has some other meanings:
the expression or repetition of conventional or trite opinions or sentiments; especially the insincere use of pious words;
language repeated so often it is devoid of meaning; (reinforcing she be making things up?)
a slope or tilt (@Rochester 's mountain?)
There I go again mixing up names I was too soused in my own thoughts.
Lyta's apparent fame would certainly spur her on to perpetuate the stories. However, given the other codex account by Felicity of an organisation that would likely silence anyone who is too conspicuous, it might be in TDW's favour that Lyta is acting like the boy crying wolf - repeating her claims so often that their existence becomes an irrelevant myth.
