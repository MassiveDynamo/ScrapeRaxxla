Seeing the word CANT did remind me of the poetry term Canto/Cantos. Perhaps it's relating to a division of smaller segments? Maybe LYRAE is a key word?

Similarly, the anagram CANT LYRAE could be referring to its meaning as a language group. The word cant essentially means a jargon or secret language - so maybe the Cant of Lyrae is referring to the 'language' of Lyre. This could be interpreted as maybe the structured musical notation, the sound or melody, or even the sung lyrics from a 'minstrel' - such as a metaphor for the work of a poet.
In the context of Lyta Crane, she came home "soused". The word Soused itself is a form of cant - a slang word. So assuming it means from the local bar / pub, this would be a common venue for musicians and entertainers.

Cant can also mean a visual pun used in heraldry.

Not sure where you're going with this, but it's interesting. However it was Art Tornquist's girl Cora who came home soused every night, not Lyta Crane.

Edit
"cant " also has some other meanings:
the expression or repetition of conventional or trite opinions or sentiments; especially the insincere use of pious words;
language repeated so often it is devoid of meaning; (reinforcing she be making things up?)
a slope or tilt (@Rochester 's mountain?)
