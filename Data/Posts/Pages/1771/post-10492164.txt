No, we haven't found Raxxla yet (more precisely, since we don't know what it is or where to find it or how to recognise it if found, then we don't think we've found it! )

The thread has lots of ideas, chit chat, musings etc etc about the Quest. It may be long but there were some interestings things brought to light and investigated. Have a read of the first page where Macros provides a (very abbreviated) summary/status.
