In your second image (the blue with white lines) the system looks like Sol to me. Coincidentally the circle planet with the line through it would be the same as Venus if it is Sol? (Where did you source that image btw?)

Also the --| -|- and -|| isn't a ized version of Morse code is it? Dot, dot, dash?

Also one of the symbols looks very much like a Thargoid Sensor in line format. I'll see if I can dredge up my screenshot of one I took when back on my PC.

No, not Morse Code. See the Canonn UA & UP pages on decoding the pictogram message. It was all in the Canonn threads, about two years ago or more..
And this explains the process for decoding the sound signals
