My brain now officially hurts!

But for the RAXXLA quest I pushed on and lo I've been reviewing the Astrophil & Stella sonnets and noted a chiasmus (based on Greek chi = X) in the 3rd Sonnet's last two lines.

"What love and beauty be; then all my deed
But copying is, what in her Nature writes."

Tinfoil time, which may indicate we need to reverse the actual word (which I know was previously investigated somewhere in this thread) or perhaps we're looking for 4 co-ordinate values for each of the X's points so RA<ABBA><ABBA>LA? It's a reach, but hey... who knows!



I also investigated Sonnet 102 (CII in roman numerals or something for those with 'eyes to see'?) and the only notable reference there was for 'Venus'.

Where be those roses gone, which sweetened so our eyes?
Where those red cheeks, which oft with fair increase did frame
The height of honour in the kindly badge of shame?
Who hath the crimson weeds stol’n from my morning skies?
How doth the colour vade of those vermilion dyes,
Which nature’s self did make, and self engrained the same?
I would know by what right this paleness overcame
That hue, whose force my heart still unto thraldom ties.
Galen’s adoptive sons, who by a beaten way
Their judgments hackney on, the fault on sickness lay,
But feeling proof makes me say they mistake it far:
It is but love, which makes his paper perfect white
To write therein more fresh the story of delight,
While beauty’s reddest ink Venus for him doth stir.

I'll slowly work through some others as time permits.

Fly Dangerously!

p.s. There is no known correlation between my alias and RaXxla that I could find either, unless you're following Egyptian mythology.
