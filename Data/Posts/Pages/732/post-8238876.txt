"Whats a Hollower?
I don't know. Something that watches holloways, I suppose. Something that guards the tracks between different worlds." - (Lavondyss 55)

The gates to Lavondyss...

"Tir-na-nOc, dear Steven, Avalon, Heaven. Call it what you like. It's the unknown land, the beginning of the labyrinth. The place of mystery. The realm guarded not against Man but against Man's curiosity. The inaccessible place. The unknowable, forgotten past" (Mythago Wood 265)
