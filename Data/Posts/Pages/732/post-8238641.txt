Did someone verify if the pattern of the 33 boxes at the exits of the stations changes or is it always the same?

As far as I know it's always the same. Those lighted ones also make the pattern of the 3 bars around the dot on the Raxxla Symbol. That is something we brought up at some point. Don't know when. There are quite a few interesting coincidences from station designs to the raxxla symbol.

Coincidentally I just had a USS in Diaguandri that has what looks like station debri. Is it random or could it mean something.
