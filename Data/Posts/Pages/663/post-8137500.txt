Well, this has cropped up before; what we normally see are images from Hubble etc. I think in-game it’s an amateur astropic, possibly DB’s own?

Yes thats right - apparenty its pink because its taken with hydrogen alpha filter - but I'm still not entirely comfortable with the explanation.

This is a H alpha image - no big blob in the centre:

maybe if its an amateur image then there is overload in the ccd as Andromeda is quite bright?
