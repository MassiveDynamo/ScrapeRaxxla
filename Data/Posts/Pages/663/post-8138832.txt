I have a question about Raaxla. Drew Wagar said that Raaxla was in Elite Dangerous since 2014, I've heard that it was even in beta. But landable planets arrived with Horizons update. So why do we think it's a landable planet? Moreover, I think Raaxla is accessible for all (Elite) players, not only those who bought Horizons.

Maybe it's hanging in space, resembling wake signal or something like this. You fly into this and jump out near something "alien".

Drew Wagar said categorically he knows nothing about Raxxla, and Frontier reserved that topic for themselves. Frontier (David Braben and Michael Brookes) have made various statements about Raxxla, those statements are provided on the first page of this thread. Who says Raxxla is a landable planet? Not this thread!

Edit: To clarify- DW reported in 2014 something that DB had said in conversation-itâ€™s on the first page summary.
