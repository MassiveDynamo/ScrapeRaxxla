@yelboc: just a couple of points-
Grief is an emotion associated with death, but actually related to a significant loss, which may or may not be a death.
Gemma is not in-game, but Alpheka is, cos I’ve been there investigating one of my earlier hypotheses, not sure about the spelling though.
Edit: Simbad is useful for checking alternative names
Edit2: just checked ipad notes- it’s “Alphekka”!!
