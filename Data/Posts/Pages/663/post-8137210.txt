Its always bothered me that the Andromeda galaxy is pinkish and that the central buldge is the wrong shape - it looks nothing like the RL galaxy, which given its one of the largest deep sky objects is odd. The LMC looks much more realistic, for instance.

Well, this has cropped up before; what we normally see are images from Hubble etc. I think in-game it’s an amateur astropic, possibly DB’s own?
