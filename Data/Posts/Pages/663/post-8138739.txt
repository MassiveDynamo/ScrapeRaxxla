I have a question about Raaxla. Drew Wagar said that Raaxla was in Elite Dangerous since 2014, I've heard that it was even in beta. But landable planets arrived with Horizons update. So why do we think it's a landable planet? Moreover, I think Raaxla is accessible for all (Elite) players, not only those who bought Horizons.

Maybe it's hanging in space, resembling wake signal or something like this. You fly into this and jump out near something "alien".
