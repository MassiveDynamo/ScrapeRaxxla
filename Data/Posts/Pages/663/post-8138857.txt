Hello
I am from cold Russia)) and I am looking for Raxxla.

I am writing through Google translator.
And even closer than we think. Ask why? Open the timeline, 2120. Then there was no FSD, but in 2296. Therefore, it is somewhere in the bubble, and you can get there.
Initially, some communities led us to a false trail into a crack. The toast was decrypted incorrectly!

2120s - Discovery of life on Tau Ceti 3; the first armed conflict in space in the area of the asteroid belt.
what was this conflict?

1. For the pearl (pearl) in the crown of the galactic mother!
2. For a whisper from the witching depths, for the siren of the abyss!
3. For the grief of the fathers, for the grief of loved ones, for longing.


1. Northern Crown - Read the wiki. HIP 76952 is the first point. many people think that it is a polar star and it is closed. Targoids.
2. Nefertem ship generation system, read ship logs.
3. This is about the Ryder family. Most likely, this is the Lave system. It is also mentioned that there is a Ben Ryder gate in the system, is this a coincidence?







Dark wheel.
The CEC has focused on this fraction, but no one thinks it is an organization. By themselves, an organization that positions itself as a top-secret organization that itself needs the right people and contrasts itself with the club. An interesting thing for a top-secret organization. Were they written in a pizza box?

Please identify your sources - who is Ben Ryder and where is he mentioned? Thanks.
