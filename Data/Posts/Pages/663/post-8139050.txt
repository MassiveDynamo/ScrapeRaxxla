so it is ! Curious that its not in EDSM by HIP number. This is the correct star, but what a boring place.. just the A star and nothing else - in RL its an eclipsing binary, so really there should be a secondary star.

Now just because there is nothing there, doesn't mean its not of interest - it maybe that its part of a trail map or location line etc.

thanks for the corrections !

Coma Berenices Corona Borealis is related to the tale of Ariadne and Dionysus. Ariadne the Minoan, the half sister of the Minotaur. Dionysus (also known as Bacchus) brings us back to the
Eleusinian mysteries
