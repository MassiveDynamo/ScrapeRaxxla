Yes forgive my failing memory Ben was Jason's Father:

The Ryders had been a trading family for three generations. It had begun with Ben Ryder, who had traded almost exclusively using shot-up pirate ships. Ben had lived life on the edge, and one day, one night, one star year, he had not returned. Out in the void between the stars his grave was as remote as it was private, and would probably never be found. His son, and his grandson who was Jason Ryder had followed the family business. Alex would soon have to make the final decision: whether to sacrifice his life to shuttling cargo between the worlds of the Galactic Co-operative, or to train for a different profession.

but that doesnt quite match what you said..

It was Jason Ryder who claimed to have discovered something and came back to gather a task force. Its only conjecture that it was Raxxla he found, mind you.
