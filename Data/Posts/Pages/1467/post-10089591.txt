I don't think so. The Thargoids have been known for a long time, ever since Elite 1.
I repeat, I think the guards were introduced in ED just to bring Raxxla closer.
For example, if Raxxla is the gateway to the galaxy, the Guardians had a key to it.
There is a description in out of darkness the novel- which came out around the time the game started. Before guardians were introduced. The description is in my earlier post- it seems similar to the raxxla logo to me.
