I absolutely agree that the breadcrumbs will be something played out in-game, & probably right under our noses (hence DB’s chortling when he said we dont know what it is). But what?..and where?

But I get really angry when “clues” are given out via Twitter and livestreams. I dont tweet and I hate livestreams. In 2015/6 they were interesting, but they degenerated into watching time wasting & boring gameplay, which is when I stopped watching them. Clues should be in-game, or maybe in Galnet, but nowhere else.

And someone in the thread https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/curious-statement-on-the-frameshift-live-today.614594/
said Arthur says something like this on every stream.....
And he’s said he knows nothing about Raxxla, hence this must be a hint to the current storyline.

I agree. Clue should be in-game. Ether very well hidden, if the mystery is significate and not needed solved to move a certain story thing along. OR it should be in the local Harolds.
