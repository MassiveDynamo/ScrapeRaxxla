It might work if they chose specific locations which trigger these USS, the most logical would be Tau Ceti????

Now as I’ve discussed I don’t actually engage with USS’s anymore; however when I’m exploring I do scan them; my original thinking was - maybe Raxxla appears as a unique situation and we would know it when we saw it…
So, you've got two problems working against you here:
Overthinking
Your sensors betrayed you
Eye Mk1 cannot be fooled
Any approach to a station, outpost, port or settlement shows a WHITE outline of the target (this is template based model and only tells you rough type of facility). You are in supercruise when this scan is done which means you are traveling in Witchspace. When you drop out of interdimensional travel the Holographic target updates to correct shape. I am afraid that judging things in real-space from a higher dimension works poorly. To test, dock at any Orbis, Ocellus, or orbital outpost as the sensor trap becomes apparent (but you have to watch target hologram before you leave supercruise). The second you are out of supercruise and request docking permission the holographic will update to the true shape of whatever you are approaching. Sensors lie unless you are in real-space. Only trust your eyes. This is also why finding the palm tree stations is tedious. You have to visit them personally (e.g. Ortiz Moreno City in Tau Ceti). This is just one of the stations built by the competition to Brewer Corporation. They are notable for the lack of "FH 32 SPEC" indicating it was built with steel designed for space and oceans. Ortiz Moreno City is the station that failed and was apparently rebuilt.
