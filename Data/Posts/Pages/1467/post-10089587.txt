Moira as in the fates… im still stuck in plato land

But i do think it rather key that the raxxla symbol was essentially described long before the codex and described as a thargoid symbol…

More importantly - i think we need to channel our inner Bob Ross and all draw some happy little thargoids. Give FD some proper ideas
I don't think so. The Thargoids have been known for a long time, ever since Elite 1.
I repeat, I think the guards were introduced in ED just to bring Raxxla closer.
For example, if Raxxla is the gateway to the galaxy, the Guardians had a key to it.
