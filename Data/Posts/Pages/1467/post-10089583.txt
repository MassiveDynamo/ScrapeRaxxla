You’ve spotted some interesting points there compadre!
Moira as in Moiré?

So could there be some hints in the books that we are not aware of? Not to Raxxla of course, as the authors were banned from that storyline, though didnt Michael Brookes write one? My memory is failing....need more breakfast caffeine!

But I am disappointed. When I saw you’d read OOTD and a spoiler I thought you were going to give us your artistic impression of a Thargoid foot soldier...I saw the “leaked” model online a while ago and wasn't impressed, didn’t match up to the description in OOTD. But I suspect that’s what the recent post about the FD mother of NPC AI is working on (where did I see that post).

Moira as in the fates… im still stuck in plato land

But i do think it rather key that the raxxla symbol was essentially described long before the codex and described as a thargoid symbol…

More importantly - i think we need to channel our inner Bob Ross and all draw some happy little thargoids. Give FD some proper ideas
