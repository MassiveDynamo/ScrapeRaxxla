Ok folks i know this is a bit off topic but ive been looking into how we travel around the galaxy and the distances the first explorers traveled with the limited tech we had.
Since then obviously we have had the Guardian FSDs and maybe there is another module out there that can jump dimensions? Nope ive not been at the Cider.
maybe you folks can help me here but this was before my time, how the hell did Jaques manage a jump of nearly 22K? What tech was he using?
Struggling to find any info, was this Guardian related?

I'll be honest, there's probably more to this than the BIG JUMP. Jaques had a number of smaller station jumps leading up to the big event. I need to timeline the events prior to departure because there were at least 5-10 systems beforehand. We're gonna need to know distances between each, if there is anything of note in the system, and chronicle what Jaques was actually up to at that point. It is usually the stuff that you have to piece together that tells the full story. I have growing concerns that Jaques was very intentionally putting distance between himself and human authorities. Whatever modifications were done to Jaques Station, they were highly unorthodox modifications given Orbis stations cannot usually warp (unlike the more modern Ocellus) which is designed for mobility. Also, Ocellus stations went live in 3260. If you have enough money to buy a station outright, why not go for a top of line model?

This was the work of an individual desperate to get away from anything approaching law enforcement. Did I mention that besides being a space monk I work for Alliance Interpol and Council of Admirals of the Alliance? While the Imperials definitely have an attitude, you cannot say they don't design some of the finest stations and ships in human space.
