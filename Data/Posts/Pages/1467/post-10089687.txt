Ok folks i know this is a bit off topic but ive been looking into how we travel around the galaxy and the distances the first explorers traveled with the limited tech we had.
Since then obviously we have had the Guardian FSDs and maybe there is another module out there that can jump dimensions? Nope ive not been at the Cider.
maybe you folks can help me here but this was before my time, how the hell did Jaques manage a jump of nearly 22K? What tech was he using?
Struggling to find any info, was this Guardian related?
