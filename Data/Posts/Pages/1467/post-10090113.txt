What about Isinor which is right near Old Worlds region (it is nearly straight vertical from Lave by a short distance)? If memory serves me correctly, in The Dark Wheel novella it is mentioned as being responsible for traffic coming in towards the Ryder's home system. I believe it has a fairly unique convoy beacon signals. Alex Ryder's father mentioned Raxxla right before they were shot down.

Also, those were Oresians in TDW. I am actually trying to get FDev to comment on what we are fighting presently as it appears we may possibly be fighting the Oresrians (who humans have also called the Guardians).
