This is just my thoughts on what we are looking for based on my knowledge of Holdstock and his contribution to the Elite Universe's lore:

The first mention of the Oisir-Raxxlans is in the book "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide". This was written under the pseudonym "Steven Eisler". The book also mentioned The Dark Wheel (not just a ultra secretive group) but a galaxy and the Talmor Lens.
Talmor Lens was a network of structures meant to control time itself. The parts were as follows: a million lenses, a million stabilizers, a million power harnesses, structure to twist the flow of space so that time would cease in a globular cluster which is called the Saramandara Pearls. I have suspicions the focal point is the Omega Centauri globular cluster (largest in the Milky Way Galaxy - aka NGC 5139).
The book "Tour of the Universe" extends this idea further (written under Robert Holdstock and Malcolm Edwards). In the old Galactic Cooperative, there are three stargates: Magellan, Trax, and Cirax. The description states:

By the way, in the game black holes look strange. I always thought they were very massive.
