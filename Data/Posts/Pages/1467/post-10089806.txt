It’s currently a nice distraction, in Legacy with my fresh noob PS4 account, burnt out on exploration for now; I think I’ve established a good hypothetis of where ‘things’ might occur - if anything is out there.

Been years since I interacted with USS, nothing to report so far. Again which USS are we supposed to engage with?

I recall in the early days, prior to exploring Raxxla, I was hesitant; given the absence at that time of any direction, I focused on the early USS stories written by Backer authors, one in particular was the ‘Silver Comet’. My thinking back then was - given an absence of direction if that story could be found, Raxxla could be viable.

I recall it took me an age to track down because the original clues gave 2 system names, so I spent so much time grinding permits to the wrong system… so I know there was at least ‘player’ written content out there… but again you had to listen for it, read the station news, and even then cross reference it with out of game references.

If there is game content in USS it is generally being ignored not through player ignorance, but through poor implementation. As Braben said ‘they got it wrong’ I do suspect FD implemented various things into the game based upon a presumption the player base would ‘play their game the FD way’ and just find it all, there ought not be any reason to issue cryptic clues…the solutions and directions ought to be in game; if they are not or they are not properly communicated that is FD failure; again does this go back to the ‘follow the missions’ mentality?
