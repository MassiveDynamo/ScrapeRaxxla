Ah
You needed to throw a party!
2/4 carbonated asteroid water, 1/4 Leestian Evil Juice, 1/4 Centauri Mega Gin, pour into a chilled Hutton Mug. Garnish with a cocktail umbrella and Neritus Berries.

(For cocktails it is considered good taste to only use berries from Neritus plants that have been fed Imperial citizens. Naturally occurring carbonated asteroid water is preferred, but may explode upon warming. Leestian Evil Juice is corrosive and generally considered a dangerous substance to handle, so it should be added last. )
