Big picture question.
Are we all aware that a type of White Dwarfs are referred to as Diamond-stars?
V886 Centauri is just one such example.
BPM 37093 (V886 Centauri) is a variable white dwarf star of the DAV
it was predicted that as a white dwarf cools, its material should crystallize
Since a diamond also consists of crystallized carbon, the star BPM 37093 has been nicknamed Lucy after The Beatles' hit Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
It appears to be a nickname for these kind of stars since the '60.
If V886 is to be a candidate for the verse then we cannot use Sol as our start, so I think V886 one in particular doesn't make much sense.

But perhaps there are other DA/DAV white dwarfs that fit better with the verse regarding Cassiopeiae and Andromeda
