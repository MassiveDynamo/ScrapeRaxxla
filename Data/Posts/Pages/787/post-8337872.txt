It CAN be tracked ... you will see just a lot of overlapping signals and may miss it easy. With heavy war around it will be not readable till full zoom even.
So my point is, extra signals distract you a lot so you miss what you need.

My example what I did - I arrived to system where generation ship must be. It was over 30 planets there and over 100 signals that time. Took me 20 mins to find ship amoung.
Thank you, this information will be useful to me for my investigation.
