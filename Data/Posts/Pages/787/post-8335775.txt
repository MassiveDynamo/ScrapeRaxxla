The Canonn list of Guardian sites is at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet...7I1VCMwIST1I6XuSOHBAS1a8rLFxmnSbO4Br/pubhtml#

However an EDDB search on Guardian systems says nearest to Sol is https://eddb.io/system/6288087 at 500ly.

You don’t say what type of Guardian system you’re after: ruins, structure, beacon, so you’ll have to cross check the eddb list with the Canonn site.

Edit: you can always set your galmap to show allegiance Guardian and Feds then eyeball and copy/paste the guardian system name into google to check what type of site(s) are available. If you’re thinking of getting Guardian blueprints then I’d suggest first watching Cmdr Exigeous’ videos.

thanks! It’s just interesting, there was information that Jameson already had Aix weapons before they gave us. if so, I admit such a theory, in the description it is written that Raxla is a planet with an alien installation, which fits the description. interesting in those days, how many would have to fly to reach a point and go back?

and just brilliantly dumb thought just visited. we all know what will happen if we start the installation of the Targoids, they will show us another galaxy. we all mistakenly believe that this is a planetarium. but it is not! But what if a portal opens somewhere?
Google can’t translate normally ... put the photo, we insert three objects into the device and it gives us the end point in the form of another galaxy. But what if the toast is the items to be inserted? a little far-fetched)))
