Big picture question.
Are we all aware that a type of White Dwarfs are referred to as Diamond-stars?
V886 Centauri is just one such example.

It appears to be a nickname for these kind of stars since the '60.
If V886 is to be a candidate for the verse then we cannot use Sol as our start, so I think V886 one in particular doesn't make much sense.

But perhaps there are other DA/DAV white dwarfs that fit better with the verse regarding Cassiopeiae and Andromeda

So the "Jewel that burns" may in fact be a White Dwarf, which would be... where, exactly?
I suppose the most obvious spot would be above the galactic plane, in the Galactic Centre.
