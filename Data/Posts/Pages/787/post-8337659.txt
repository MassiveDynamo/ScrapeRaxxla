In one of Drew's livestreams he implied that while he doesnt directly share information he doesnt have he may have indirectly shared information to be found if you read between the lines. I know he doesnt know where Raxxla is but maybe his fdev secret lore bible had info that may have been hidden 'for those with eyes to see'

In order to chase down any clues in literary form i bought Drew's 2 books finally and another which came out around the same time as Reclamation, 'Out of the Darkness'. Im only on chapter 3 of Reclamation cuz i keep spending all my free time working TDW inf in LFT 926

Edit: I completely forgot to mention this earlier but V8886 Centauri has a planetary port named Holdstock Silo.
