The Prism system has multiple stars named for jewels, one of which is actually named Diamond. Its also the system in which Lady Kahina Loren/ Salomé's story begins.

Perhaps Sol isnt supposed to be the starting point. In The Dark Wheel novella it starts off above Planet Lave.

V8886 just happens to be one jump away from LFT 926, no conveniently the only system where The Dark Wheel minor faction is capable of expanding from. Im not suggesting they know where Raxxla may be, but they could be willing to share some information some of their Elite explorers may have accumulatedsome of which my have clues to chase down for even better information. I understand The Dark Wheel mf has never been expanded since the launch of the game.

In general we know that Salomé's is not linked with Raxxla as we learned by the statements from Drew who wrote it. However we cannot exclude the possibility that FD changed their minds and have had the stories merged.

If we're to following the trail regarding mother of galaxies there's a strong possibility this refers to the Cas constallation, while Andromeda and others are not entirely out of the question.
As of such Prism doesn't lie within the direction of these constellations. It's quite far down beneath both Sol, Sirius, SD and Lave depending on where we're suppose to start resolving the riddle(s). And there's plenty of Jewel candidates in all directions as we know (from this thread). I'm just working on figuring out which is most likely and see if we can get some hard evidence which support the hints we have in the codex.

But again, I never exclude any theories. Keep chuggin' out more theories.
I've also been looking at the v886 to see if it lines up with the hints. Not that far with it yet though.
Good stuff, keep it coming.
