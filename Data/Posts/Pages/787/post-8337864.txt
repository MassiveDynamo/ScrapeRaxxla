Did I understand you correctly that a spaceport cannot be tracked at the places of extraction of resources? it is very important for me
It CAN be tracked ... you will see just a lot of overlapping signals and may miss it easy. With heavy war around it will be not readable till full zoom even.
So my point is, extra signals distract you a lot so you miss what you need.

My example what I did - I arrived to system where generation ship must be. It was over 30 planets there and over 100 signals that time. Took me 20 mins to find ship amoung.
