Well ... too much of possibilities. There is only 1 NS in bubble and a lot of DAs ...
I think we need some unique interpretations. If any suggestion has more then 3 options - it is wrong.
Because ...for example "hidden DW" case ... there are couple generation ships in populated systems. If you know EXACT it is here, but came when system has some activity like war ...u will spend 20 mins before you will catch it by FSS.

Something like this station is inside ring
