Btw ...as I figured on beta, once FC arrives to orbit anything - u see there all signals even not scanned.
Just maybe, if u put FC on orbit where DW should be, u will see that dw?
Frontier "fixed" FC being able to orbit asteroid belts, stations and other things that are "non-bodies".
Edit: I misunderstood your point... so, I can speak for myself only, but... I don't have a slightest clue about where the Dark Wheel station would be. One can just hope Frontier let it slip through and we end up finding it this way...
