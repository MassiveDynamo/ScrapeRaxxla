For space anomalies you could try the Canonn site & exploration/Mapping project threads, but that stuff is listed in the Codex.
Seem to remember one space anomaly about 4 jumps from Shin Dez, as I went to check it out early last year before I went on DW2.
technically suddenly anomalies appear after the appearance of raxla in the system? what do you think?
