There are other threads for it primarily but i dont think any here would be against it. I personally think raxxla and tdw mysteries may be somewhat interconnected. Go for it.

I believe the RAXXLA and TDW mysteries are interconnected as well. My apologies if this has been discussed already, I've only been able to go through about 600 of the 850+(!!) posts in this thread. I hope you all don't laugh too hard. The attachment is just a PDF of my theory write up. My theory follows:

Subject: THE DARK WHEEL’S hidden star port – Where is it?
From: CMDR TITUS MCCLOUD
Date: June 01, 3306 (June 01, 2020)

Purpose: Propose a theory for review and discussion as to the location of THE DARK WHEEL’s hidden, low power star port.

Given that:
The SOL system includes the gas giants JUPITER, SATURN, URANUS, and NEPTUNE.
Salome (aka KAHINA TIJANI LOREN) made a seemingly special effort to visit the outer gas giants of the system SOL prior to her disappearance.
Salome made a seemingly special effort to not be late when visiting the outer gas giants of the SOL system. She wanted to be on time as if there was perhaps a prepared appointment.
NEPTUNE has fourteen (14) moons. All but one, are not massive enough to have their surfaces collapse in a sphere due to gravity.
TRITON is the 8th moon of the gas giant NEPTUNE in the system SOL. The moons of NEPTUNE are this (the only spherical moon of NEPTUNE is TRITON):
NAIAD
THALASSA
DESPINA
GALATEA
LARISSA
HIPPOCAMP
PROTEUS
TRITON (8th moon orbiting NEPTUNE)
NEREID
HALIMEDE
SAO
LAOMEDEIA
PSAMATHE
NESO
TRITON is permit locked by the minor faction MOTHER GAIA.
Being permit locked, TRITON cannot be investigated until said permit is obtained.
Hypothesis:
The hidden DARK WHEEL star port orbits NEPTUNE’s moon TRITON in the SOL system in “low power mode”, making in undetectable by a ship’s FSS. This cannot be verified because the system is permit locked. It has not been found for also that very reason.
The system is permit locked because FRONTIER DEVELOPMENT has it “earmarked” for future content…OR
The system is permit locked because no one with the correct credentials (possibly triple or quadruple ELITE) have attempted to rank up with the minor faction – MOTHER GAIA in an attempt to pass some sort of test and garner an invitation.
Assumption:
The CODEX screen shot (the one showing an ORBIS type star port very near to what looks like a red colored giant or super giant star) for THE DARK WHEEL is simply “eye candy” and does not represent the DARK WHEEL station location.
Discussion:
Fairly odd that Salome wanted to visit the outer gas giants of SOL, don’t you think? There are much more interesting gas giants within the bubble. Why the SOL gas giants? Perhaps she had an agenda? Perhaps she had a meeting? Perhaps she had a meeting with THE DARK WHEEL? Perhaps during that meeting in the outer gas giants of the system SOL, she saw enough to believe that THE DARK WHEEL was who they represented themselves to be. It is said that the hidden star port contains enough information, that who ever sees it, is convinced that this particular star port IS the DARK WHEEL star port. Perhaps Salome saw enough information to believe during her meeting that she was in fact dealing with the actual DARK WHEEL.
One of the clues given as to the location of the hidden DARK WHEEL star port is that it orbits the 8th moon of an un-named gas giant. How could TRITON be the station since it orbits the named moon TRITON? What if the clue doesn’t refer to a gas giant without a name, what if whoever provided the clue, simply chose not to give the name of the gas giant, i.e. an un-named gas giant as in, I choose to not provide the name)?
Why would TRITON; the 8th moon of what is presumably an unremarkable gas giant in the system SOL be permit locked? Maybe earmarked by FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS for future, special content and game play?
Other Interesting Coincidences:
ALEX RYDER had two (2) sons – NEPTUNE RYDER and OBERON RYDER, both names related either directly to an outer gas giant in SOL or a moon that orbits an outer gas giant of the SOL system – NEPTUNE the 8th planet of the SOL system and OBERON the 18th moon of URANUS, orbiting the 7th planet of the SOL system. NEPTUNE RYDER went on to lead THE DARK WHEEL – whose said mission is to find RAXXLA. OBERON RYDER went on to lead the CIRCLE OF INDEPENDENT ELITE PILOTS (CEIP), who are said to have favored discovering and advancing knowledge of SOONTIL.
Possible Next Actions:
Attain triple ELITE (or perhaps quadruple ELITE) to remove that from consideration and attempt to rank with the minor faction MOTHER GAIA to garner some sort of mission that might lead being invited to the hidden, low power star port. This invitation could lead to missing clues regarding discovering RAXXLA.
It is said that ALEX RYDER ranked DEADLY at the time of his father’s death (when it is said his father (JASON RYDER) had solid evidence of RAXXLA’s existence) and that he resolved in getting to ELITE in COMBAT so that he could discover RAXXLA for himself. So perhaps only ELITE in COMBAT is required?

Prism Senator Continues to Woo Federation Presidents
17 MAR 3301
Lady Kahina Tijani Loren's unofficial entourage has begun a tour of the outer gas giants in the Sol system. Hundreds of privately owned Federation-registered vessels have turned out to greet the Senator, in lieu of an official welcome, as she continues her passage through the Sol system despite continued apathy from officials.
