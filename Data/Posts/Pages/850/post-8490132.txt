I believe the RAXXLA and TDW mysteries are interconnected as well. My apologies if this has been discussed already, I've only been able to go through about 600 of the 850+(!!) posts in this thread. I hope you all don't laugh too hard. The attachment is just a PDF of my theory write up. My theory follows:

Subject: THE DARK WHEEL’S hidden star port – Where is it?
From: CMDR TITUS MCCLOUD

Purpose: Propose a theory for review and discussion as to the location of THE DARK WHEEL’s hidden, low power star port.

Great work and a compelling read, CMDR. However, a I think it has a few holes in it. One, it assumes disinformation on the part of Pilots' Federation (FDev). The Codex says "unnamed gas giant." So either the journalist is wrong or FDev as being disingenuous. As to the station actually orbited Neptune, you are correct in that it wouldn't be detectable by the FSS but it would be by parallax. And so many CMDR's have been in and around that area, someone should have spotted it, I would think. Also, Triton hasn't always been permit locked. Prior to a few years ago it was a landable planet. The reason for the permit lock was, however, never explained.
