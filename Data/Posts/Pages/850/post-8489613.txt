Hello Commanders. I'm new here...been reading the conversation for a few weeks now. I have about 800 in game hours over the last 7 months.
Is this the proper place to propose a theory as to the location of the DARK WHEEL's hidden star port?

I think we are all willing to listen to any theories on TDW .... I know im waiting to hear your idea/opinion with antisipation...

Edit: I know that might sound sarcastic, but i really do mean what i say, i'm honestly excited to hear a new theory
