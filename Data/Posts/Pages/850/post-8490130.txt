Space anomalies exist all over the Milky Way galaxy (see codex for reported locations). I’m not personally of the opinion that it wanders around, so I can’t see the linkage. First documented report of the Raxxla myth was (if I remember correctly) 2296 in Tau Ceti. I think this was when long range hyperspace travel was not possible and such hyperspace as they had was not widely available, and it may be before the Empire was founded (never very good on history!). Someone with a better memory should comment. My internet connection seems to be playing up.

Edit: (have reset my VPN!). From the Wiki: “In 2292 a suitable home was found orbiting Achenar 6, a Class III gas giant, and Achenar 6d was colonised. Now named Capitol, this moon formed the core world of what would later become the Empire.” So Empire proper was after the Raxxla myth report (since 4 years is not enough time to create an empire)
anomalies throughout the galaxy, true. raxla then moves across the galaxy. and apparently in 2296 she flew not so far from the Sol and Tau. the easiest way to determine if there are anomalies near sol / tau
