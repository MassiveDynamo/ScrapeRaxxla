For those looking into the Norse angle of mythology, I thought this representation was a bit interesting.


It's the nine homes (heim) and their relative location on Yggdrasil. This representation at least looks a bit like the Raxxla symbol.

The locations aren't as absolute as this drawing. It's often described a bit different, in different stories. The Vikings weren't as good as the Greeks, when it came to naming things in the sky. There are however some modern historians that consider Yggdrasil to be the Milky Way. The tree was often described as white like the skin inside an egg.
It's easy to see the association.


Several of the 'heims' are represented in the game.
