Storm / wheel of fate god?…ya he is an intriguing character… The fact that they are all storm gods has made me wonder - has the story been reversed? Are we the snakes / jotun/ asuras ? But im still plodding along under the premise that the thargoids are the snakes protecting something (lets call it the chalice) associated with the tree….
We're the only ones with snake ships: Asp, Diamondback, Sidewinder, Adder, Viper, Fer-de-lance, Cobra, Keelback, Krait, Mamba, Python, and Anaconda.
