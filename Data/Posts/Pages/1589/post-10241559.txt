Michel appears to French-variant spelling for Archangel Michael as he has a major shrine at Mont-Saint-Michel, France.

Interesting how evocative this is of Midgard surrounded by ocean. Sure it's tidal and not the only place surrounded by sea, but given the star's proximity it could be a valid line of thought.
Edit: also, Heimdall could be compared to St Michael as a guardian figure.
In relation to my notes, wiki also says he helped "the recovery of Freyja's treasured possession Brísingamen while doing battle in the shape of a seal with Loki."
Heimdallr is also known as Rig, Hallinskiði, Gullintanni, and Vindlér or Vindhlér.
