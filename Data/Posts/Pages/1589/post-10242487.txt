Taranis is something you might want to check out.

Read up on the god itself.

Storm / wheel of fate god?…ya he is an intriguing character… The fact that they are all storm gods has made me wonder - has the story been reversed? Are we the snakes / jotun/ asuras ? But im still plodding along under the premise that the thargoids are the snakes protecting something (lets call it the chalice) associated with the tree….
