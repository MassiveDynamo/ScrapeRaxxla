If I were to interpret Ragnarok in the context of ED, I would say it describes the end-time of the Guardians.
Ragnarok is basically a war between Æser (gods) and Jotner (giants). Loke is half each and fights on the side of the Jonter. He had tree children with his wife Angerboda. The Fenris wolf, Midgardsormen and Hel. They are all central to the end of the world. Ragnarok is almost total destruction. Yggdrasil and almost all living things fall. Only a few survive.
After Ragnarok an new and better world start, with the humans Liv and Livtrase (Life and Life-stubborn). They are basically Adam and Eve.

It's easy to draw parallels to the Guardian end war. Loke could be half Gauardian / half AI and his creations helps end the world. The Midgard serpent could be the monolith network and the Fenris wolf could be the war machine of the AI.

The few survivors end up with starting a new sentient species on Earth.

The vikings did of course consider Ragnarok to be a future event, but they weren't all that bright.

Good point ! I like it - but i would also argue that it is Cyclic - and the vikings were just as dim as we At the end of the Volsupa i seem to remember a dragon coming again to burn everything…
