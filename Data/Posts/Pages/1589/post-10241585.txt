Found some further interesting named systems whilst digging down through the triad goddesses region.

Found an Egyptian god, the Guardian of the East - Sopedu, that was interesting of itself as I was able to locate the equivalent gods of West and South (no north), Nekhbet and Imentet. They don’t correlate, but again they do sit neatly with all other ‘gods’.

But close to Sopedu, and not far off below the triad region, was something more interesting ‘Michel’?

On its own I wouldn’t be particularly surprised by this one, but its relative position just raises my eyebrow, as St. Michael was a repeating motif in Brookes artwork, the protector of the gates, and he who kicked Satans derrière.

So extended the path upwards today and again another coincidence?

This extrapolation of the supposed path of Shibboleth / Sampo does pass interestingly close to the Morrigans!



In Robert Holdstocks book - Lost Realms he does touch upon a potential link between the Morrigan and Epona via Arthurian legend, of course there are various links via Irish/Celt/Welsh myth.

I am generally unsure if this is intentional or just arbitrary, given the proliferation of various ‘mythical’ naming associations. At most I suspect that both triad goddesses are intentional, but unsure if they are intentionally linked via the ‘path’?
