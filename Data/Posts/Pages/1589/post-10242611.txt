There is a region just above Sol, where there is a layer of certain types of stars (all red cant recall the type but it’s a huge sandwich of certain star types which is galaxy wide) digressing, but it’s not far up and around a certain area there are a whole bunch of ‘storm’ and ‘thunder’ gods.

I’d seen these previously when investigating the central focal point of the Thargoid Mealstroms, almost above it I began seeing these more often.

I may have another look at them. Storm/thunder gods were a big European deity element around pre-Saxon area. I imagined it might be linked to the Thargoid narrative as a backstory/flavour?
