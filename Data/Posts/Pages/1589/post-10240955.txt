The First Sorrow being the death of Baldr (exists as a system in-game) and the Second Sorrow being the death of Odin (also a system) and Odin himself having wandered as a vagabond, really clicks with me as being a good description of the third line of The Dark Wheel toast.

Jormungand is a system on the edge of Hyades Sector.

Ragnarok may well have befallen the Guardians but life is cycles and perhaps it is threatening us now? Which of the Thargoids and Guardians are the gods or the giants? Given the naming conventions of their vessels, I think the Thargoids are the giants.

Also interesting to note that Loki was half of each and fought with the giants. We have Seo Jin-ae who is as close to half-Thargoid as anyone (though who knows what the people rescued from the Titans are like) and Salvation who may be half-Guardians-AI. I trust Seo more than Salvation, though... .

This jigsaw puzzle is coming together!
but then you realise you've got 6 corner pieces!
