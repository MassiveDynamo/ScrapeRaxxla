I don't think they have anything to do with the Magellanic clouds. The angle and distance between them are to different in the two systems, to make any sense.

They look designed. I have seen them close in VR and they have a deliberate shape and animation. In the map they are located in a plane between the planets / stars and the background stars. When you pan the map, they move about half distance of the regular bodies.

The animation is a fade in / fade out sequence. They show up after about a minute, grow for a few minutes and then fade out again. In the middle of the animation, a brighter central dot shows.

From Deneb(small dots are background stars):


Their position is fixed in the system map. Once the system is scanned, you don't have to be in the system to see the effect.

If this is a bug, I would guess it's something that spilled over from the VR system map. That one has some similar (not exactly the same) effects and no background stars.

Hi Han_Zen. I've travelled to Alpha Centauri & spent half an hour or more looking in the system map. Cant see anything of these anomalies you mention, but all three stars are throwing off Coronal Mass Ejections that look similar (& same colour as the star), but are clearly CME & in same plane as the star.

Looking in Galmap at Star of India & Alpha Cygni there are a few nebulae in the near background & they have similar structure to what you report: SADR Region, Pelican, North America in particular, but also possibly Veil East & West. It's possible these anomalies are artefacts of those nebulae in the middle background. Do you have any videos of them (I think you said they were animated)?
