I totally agree @Filthymick420 but.... on the flip side, if I found it, I would want to tell you guys, so you know 100% it's in game, because we have all been on the journey together (and because I would be a tiny bit excited) but at same time would not want to spoil the mystery for everyone else, so might actually do something similar (and take the flack/doubters)
Same. Id tell you all ive found it, maybe. Then id offer if you wanted to know where or be given clues, or something. It being a 'personal journey' i imagine a process may be involved. Id try to explain how that process is at the very least idk
