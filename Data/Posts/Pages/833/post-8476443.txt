But they’re definitely animated? Nebulae wouldn’t (edit: shouldn't be-I’m no graphics expert) be of course. Just want to avoid a 60+ Jump round trip if it’s not worth the hassle.
I can't say anything 100% on how thy are made. I VR I can get quite close. The cloud there is made of several filament objects. Each of them will slowly change over time, creating the fade in / fade out effect. The central light source is a separate object.

A few more examples. That's all I have in my Dropbox. I have more screenshots on the gaming computer, at home.
