I wonder which nebula on the first screenshot?
And someone tried to deblur first screenshot?

Unfortunately, I think its Brenards Loop in the first shot, which is visable from almost any system, so that sucks....

And yes, I accutally tried to deblurr the img, but its not possible, blurring can only be undone if the exact method is known, and even then, its rare, jpg and png img dont keep the data from before the img was blurred, so its nearly impossible....

I tried to track the stars visible in the first img, and it does appear to line up with appox. the location of Polairs, from his second img.... If you go tothe system beside polaris,you can get lined up and have an ALMOST idential view as his frist screen shot, but nothing in the system matches that.... and its clear when you do that, that its not quite right, the color of barnards loop when your inthat system, is not quite the same as his photo, its lighter, I think the system is closer too the loop, somewhere NEAR polaris, based on his hint and the alignment of the stars in his first pic, but I checked all the systems in his second img that are visable, and they have nothing of note....

its possible the alignment is with other stars and the system is closer to the loop, but there are millions of systems between polaris and the loop, so still at a loss... though if its real, it might help narrow our view to somewhere between polaris and the loop...
