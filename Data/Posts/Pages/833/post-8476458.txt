A few months ago I went out to Star of India and confirmed seeing this on the system map. They appear at first as a speck of light and slowly grow into the weird Smokey things pictured. I searched a bit and flew around but never saw anything out of the ordinary.

Confirmed and corroborated I've been to both locations multiple times and its a definitive recurring anomalous artifact.

I first stumbled across it whilst exploring Cygnus. Tooled around and nothing pinged and couldn't detect anything with the primary eyeball scanner.

Has this been bugged reported. I think if its a real game element we need to let FD know we've found it, for if it is bugged then its a big bug. If its a known flaw in the game then it should also be reported.

However considering their locations and the confirmation off multiple Cmdrs its likely to be intentionally placed... but you sometimes can't rely on that as considering FDs history its equally also a bug!

Log it.
