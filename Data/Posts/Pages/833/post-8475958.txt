I don’t have a video and I don’t think it would do much good. Go to Alpha Cygni and check the system map. Once you have been there, you can check it at any time.

The one in aCen is not stabile. I’ve checked that map a bunch of times, without finding it.

The other two shows up every time.

But they’re definitely animated? Nebulae wouldn’t (edit: shouldn't be-I’m no graphics expert) be of course. Just want to avoid a 60+ Jump round trip if it’s not worth the hassle.
