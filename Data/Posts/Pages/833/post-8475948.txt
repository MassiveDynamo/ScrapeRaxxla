How exactly do you get that conclusion? I mean, im sceptical for sure, but I cant see anything in the img itself that gives away being a fake... the R in raxxla does not need to match any font in the picture, or anyother for that matter, as ED usually doesnt list the planet name in the cross-hairs like that, it could be somthing special for Raxxla that it dislays like that.... Normally, you just get the orange semi-circle, it never shows the name of the planet in Orange like that....

Edit: Or does it?? now im lost lmao... Does the name if the object normally show? lmfao i play daily and cant remember hahaha, find out in a few hours when i get online
My stance on it is this, any claims of it being found, without evidence that can be checked and observed by other cmdrs (peer review and repeatable results is a cornerstone of scientific discovery after all) is most likely a fake and will be disregarded by myself and i think a lot of others share this opinion
