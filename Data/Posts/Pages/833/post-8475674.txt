Its been posted before in this thread. IMO its fake due to the wrong R font in the same pic.

How exactly do you get that conclusion? I mean, im sceptical for sure, but I cant see anything in the img itself that gives away being a fake... the R in raxxla does not need to match any font in the picture, or anyother for that matter, as ED usually doesnt list the planet name in the cross-hairs like that, it could be somthing special for Raxxla that it dislays like that.... Normally, you just get the orange semi-circle, it never shows the name of the planet in Orange like that....

Edit: Or does it?? now im lost lmao... Does the name if the object normally show? lmfao i play daily and cant remember hahaha, find out in a few hours when i get online
