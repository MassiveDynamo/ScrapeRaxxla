I can't say anything 100% on how thy are made. I VR I can get quite close. The cloud there is made of several filament objects. Each of them will slowly change over time, creating the fade in / fade out effect. The central light source is a separate object.

A few more examples. That's all I have in my Dropbox. I have more screenshots on the gaming computer, at home.
SPOILER
A few months ago I went out to Star of India and confirmed seeing this on the system map. They appear at first as a speck of light and slowly grow into the weird Smokey things pictured. I searched a bit and flew around but never saw anything out of the ordinary.
