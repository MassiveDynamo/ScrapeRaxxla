My stance on it is this, any claims of it being found, without evidence that can be checked and observed by other cmdrs (peer review and repeatable results is a cornerstone of scientific discovery after all) is most likely a fake and will be disregarded by myself and i think a lot of others share this opinion
I totally agree @Filthymick420 but.... on the flip side, if I found it, I would want to tell you guys, so you know 100% it's in game, because we have all been on the journey together (and because I would be a tiny bit excited) but at same time would not want to spoil the mystery for everyone else, so might actually do something similar (and take the flack/doubters)
