Hi Han_Zen. I've travelled to Alpha Centauri & spent half an hour or more looking in the system map. Cant see anything of these anomalies you mention, but all three stars are throwing off Coronal Mass Ejections that look similar (& same colour as the star), but are clearly CME & in same plane as the star.

Looking in Galmap at Star of India & Alpha Cygni there are a few nebulae in the near background & they have similar structure to what you report: SADR Region, Pelican, North America in particular, but also possibly Veil East & West. It's possible these anomalies are artefacts of those nebulae in the middle background. Do you have any videos of them (I think you said they were animated)?
I don’t have a video and I don’t think it would do much good. Go to Alpha Cygni and check the system map. Once you have been there, you can check it at any time.

The one in aCen is not stabile. I’ve checked that map a bunch of times, without finding it.

The other two shows up every time.
