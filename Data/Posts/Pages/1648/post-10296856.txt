One amusing thing about the aforementioned Ghost (called LBN 623 ingame) is that it's highlighted by neighbouring 27 Gamma Cassiopeiae, AKA Navi. This informal name was given by Apollo 1 astronaut Gus Grissom, and means one of his names - Ivan - backwards.
He did the same to his mission colleagues for two other stars: one of them being Regor for Gamma Velorum (which, y'know, names the suspiciously permit-locked Guardian core region) after Roger Chaffee, and the other Dnoces for Talitha (AKA Iota Ursae Majoris) after Ed White - perhaps "Second" because his name has a II?

...also, wouldn't a nebula right by the central star on Cassiopeia's asterism be a fairly good candidate for "jewel in the brow of the mother of galaxies"?

And regarding the Beehive Cluster: its brightest member Epsilon Cancri appears ingame as Praesepe - which is an alternative name for the cluster itself.
