Nice hypothesis. But there's also the Ghost of Cassiopeia https://esahubble.org/news/heic1818/
and planetary nebulae can also be viewed as the ghosts of dying stars.
smushes tinfoil hat in head even further

One amusing thing about the aforementioned Ghost (called LBN 623 ingame) is that it's highlighted by neighbouring 27 Gamma Cassiopeiae, AKA Navi. This informal name was given by Apollo 1 astronaut Gus Grissom, and means one of his names - Ivan - backwards.
He did the same to his mission colleagues for two other stars: one of them being Regor for Gamma Velorum (which, y'know, names the suspiciously permit-locked Guardian core region) after Roger Chaffee, and the other Dnoces for Talitha (AKA Iota Ursae Majoris) after Ed White - perhaps "Second" because his name has a II?

...also, wouldn't a nebula right by the central star on Cassiopeia's asterism be a fairly good candidate for "jewel in the brow of the mother of galaxies"?

And regarding the Beehive Cluster: its brightest member Epsilon Cancri appears ingame as Praesepe - which is an alternative name for the cluster itself.
