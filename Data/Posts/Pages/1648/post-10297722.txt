I suspect almost every part of the Codex has relevance and meaning. To inject red-herring is counterproductive, especially if the text is so allegorical. The potential for such double standards only raises suspicion, and stops us focusing upon the correct path.

Much of the ‘mystery’ I suspect was altered, during the dropping of the DW missions, I suspect the Codex was brought in to tie it all together neatly.

I think the absence of whatever context the missions held, or ultimately lead to being injected, have made this puzzle ultimately muddy.

So I do suspect, that given our evidence identification so far that it likely is in the bubble, for it to be ‘lost’ for so long, there has to be some element of disguise involved.

The comment made by Drew a few posts ago - quoted by a Cmdr, may have some weight if it can be identified as true and directly linked to Raxxla or just indirect knowledge of another mystery. For to ‘hide’ something in game, the only applicable mechanism would be via Factions… but which factions, and how many are involved, and how much interaction is needed…

If it’s not factions, then it’s either just floating around…. Or on a moon… or in a belt… or really far out of the orbital line… or just dark and not registering on the scanners… we simply don’t know.

But if we can identify the ‘area’ of influence; we ought to then take into consideration ‘everything’ in that finite zone. Eg what is the lore in that area, who are the core factions etc.

So yes I feel every aspect of the Codex has direct relevance.
