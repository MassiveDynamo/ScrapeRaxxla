i dont think ive ever encountered this issue. i think i saw systems nav beacon go to compromised when its security got lowered and it got hit with pirate attack, then reverted to regular when security went back up. all the time visible on map regularly... just like any other compromised beacon system. poi (like installations, czs or res zones) visibility normal just like any other system.

however if this happens to theocracies thats another thing.
you want to tell me that the mapping monopoly in elite is intentionally systematically hiding religious cults in power? that certainly doesnt sounds suspicious, right?
Years ago I pointed out a suspicious Galnet post...IIRC two theocracies were bidding for an explorer's survey data...WHY?
Search my name in this thread, twas a good while ago!
