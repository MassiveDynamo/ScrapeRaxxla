Nice hypothesis. But there's also the Ghost of Cassiopeia https://esahubble.org/news/heic1818/
and planetary nebulae can also be viewed as the ghosts of dying stars.
Mmm, The Ghost of Cassiopeia (IC 63 & IC 59) might also fit the toast?
Cassiopeia-mother of Andromeda- the mother of galaxies?
Ghost- whisperer in witch's space?
Parents grief- Andromeda was to be sacrificed? lover's woe- Perseus?

A bit far-fetched perhaps, but no more so than many hypotheses in this thread (including many of my own! )
