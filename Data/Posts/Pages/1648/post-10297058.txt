Mmm, The Ghost of Cassiopeia (IC 63 & IC 59) might also fit the toast?
Cassiopeia-mother of Andromeda- the mother of galaxies?
Ghost- whisperer in witch's space?
Parents grief- Andromeda was to be sacrificed? lover's woe- Perseus?

A bit far-fetched perhaps, but no more so than many hypotheses in this thread (including many of my own! )
Everything here is far-fetched.
Most likely Rafe means ghost world in the same way as ghost town. An empty abandoned planet.
Since it is supposed to have an alien construct, it was probably abandoned by aliens.
The main problem here is that we have already found hundreds of ghost worlds with alien constructs. What sets Raxxla apart from those we have found?
Perhaps they are all Raxxlas and we just don't know how to activate the construct to open the omphalos rift?
