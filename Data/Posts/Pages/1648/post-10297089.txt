Norn and Fates alignment

Previously I made various visual observations about a hypothetical alignment with the Norse Norns and Greek Fates systems, since then I’ve been able to map a new set of systems named after Norse names for trees, which have made me reassess this assumption and apply a much more robust mathematical calculation of the alignment.

By identifying the various exact XYZ centroids, mid and end point calculations, I can now confirm that the midpoint between two tree systems; (which I’m identifying as the ‘Thorn’ system) Purisaz and Ansuz aligns with the centroid points of the Norse Norns and the Greek Fates.

It must be acknowledged, that in the absence of any other data there exists an equal likelihood this is simply a coincidence or apophenia. But, if it is not then it identifies that the Fates and the Norns may have some unknown alignment.

The systems of Purisaz and Ansuz if applicable, enable some greater confidence that they do form part of a constellation of systems named after Norse tree names / deities, which I feel is another nod towards Robert Holdstock and a theory where trees (or thorns specifically) form a protective marker for a mystical secret.

This alignment if entertained as intended, and thus then projected outwards utilising the same robust math, can be seen to align directly with the calculated centroid of the Morrigan goddesses systems.

Again this is all possibly coincidence or apophenia but the alignment warrants interest in my opinion.



*edited new picture as realised one ‘thorn’ system was wrongly identified, this does not alter the hypothesis. It may actually strengthen it?
