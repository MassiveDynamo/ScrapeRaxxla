Ah. Didnt understand it! but currently installing to sdd C:/ whereas FD original is on hdd D:/
Looks like its downloading at 100MB/s from the progress counter...set display download rate in bps in Steam settings but cant see anywhere showing that...
Edit
Looking in the wrong window... it's showing on the library list at 500-600Mbps!
Definitely better than FD Launcher download speed!!
When you're happy it's working in steam you can uninstall the other FD copy and free up some space!

Edit: you can also move your steam installations folder and move elite to D: from within steam if you need to put it back on your other drive and free up space on C: - there will be loads of YouTube videos on how to do it if you need to...
