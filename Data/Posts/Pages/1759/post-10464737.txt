I was thinking about the Toast this afternoon. It could be a toast made on the Dark Wheel station relating to local visible landmarks. If the start vid is showing that station and it's not far from Barnard's Loop then the first line of the toast could relate to the Orion Nebula/Flame Neb etc, while the second could be the Witchhead neb...
Just a thought!
And nebulae might be a reason for heading out that way with Guardian ruins and brain trees.... which were obviously planned from the start of the game....
