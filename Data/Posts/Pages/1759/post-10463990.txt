Just getting Steam keys..
Logged in via Steam and got :
Claim a key forelite dangerous (steam)
Claim a key forelite dangerous: horizons season pass (steam)
Claim a key forelite dangerous:arena (steam)

Dont need Arena, never interested...
Do I need both the basic dangerous AND horizons season pass keys, or does selecting the horizons incorporate the basic game?
And does the horizons season pass also transfer my Odyssey??

Edit
Ah, found further instructions...loaded key for basic game, then horizons, then arena. Gone into steam library to see if it's included Odyssey & its now asking me to install 52.96Gb; thought it used the existing game files loaded from FD?
