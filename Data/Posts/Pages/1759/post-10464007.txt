Ah. Didnt understand it! but currently installing to sdd C:/ whereas FD original is on hdd D:/
Looks like its downloading at 100MB/s from the progress counter...set display download rate in bps in Steam settings but cant see anywhere showing that...
Edit
Looking in the wrong window... it's showing on the library list at 500-600Mbps!
Definitely better than FD Launcher download speed!!
