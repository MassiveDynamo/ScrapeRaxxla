I think think it's a Halloween treasure hunt.
yep i know what it is , since i went ahead and finished it lol ( not sure if you read the thread and saw my other post within page 4 ) . But the reason why i still mentioned it here is....well... i don't wanna spoiler things , so i'll just say this: Some of the ingame mails/messages from the main "Treasure Hunter" , plus some of the mechanics & objects during journey, all reminded me of what a RAXXLA-hunt could possibly involve.

Was just a speculation ( thought ) of course.
