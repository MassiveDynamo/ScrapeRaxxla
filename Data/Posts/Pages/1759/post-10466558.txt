Just starting up via Steam. I hadnt noticed before but the start sequence showing a station (TDW stealth station??) in orbit now shows a red ring at the bottom just to the right of the planet - reminiscent of Barnard's Loop. Might be a sensible location given they're intrepid explorers and an interest in Thargoid/Guardians (TDW must historically have had detailed knowledge of both!!)
Got a screen cap of it?
