Just starting up via Steam. I hadnt noticed before but the start sequence showing a station (TDW stealth station??) in orbit now shows a red ring at the bottom just to the right of the planet - reminiscent of Barnard's Loop. Might be a sensible location given they're intrepid explorers and an interest in Thargoid/Guardians (TDW must historically have had detailed knowledge of both!!)
Always been one of my thoughts of being in there as it's mostly locked off, but there are some trails round the back of it... Golden chain of named systems pointing back to the pendent world (earth)?
