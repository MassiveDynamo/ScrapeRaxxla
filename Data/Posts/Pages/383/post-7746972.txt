In the network I found an old short novel that came with the first Elite (СMDR Drew Wagar spoke about it in his stream). Translated into Russian for the Russian speaking community. There is a phrase:
"– Ракксла – это не что-то инопланетное, это призрачный мир, планета-легенда." - what is translated into english as: "Raxxsla is not something alien, this is a ghostly world, a planet legend.
This gives an understanding that we are still looking for a PLANET. What narrows down the search.

Six months ago, i saw the topic on the official forum here, where people were looking for tourist beacon. There they offered a list of already open beacons and points of interest. But there were many not open. I thought, if we take their data and periodically check, then we may find the place that interests us, if it is marked by a beacon or point of interest. To do this, look at the proposed job in the ports for the transport of passengers. In contrast to us, the NPC mechanic knows where beacon (or point of interest) is located and offers to visit it. You just need to compare whether the system (beacon or POI) is open or not. If not, then it makes sense to visit this place. Perhaps by natural selection we will find our place.
