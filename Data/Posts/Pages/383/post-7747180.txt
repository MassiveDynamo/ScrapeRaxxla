That was DISO 5 C
It was definitely lave2 - i thought I was going to get the permit!
It happened shortly after horizons was released so around 2016. 2017. It's not the current bug from here.
Edit: it's this one involving navigator base. On the thread is a pic of the bases on lave2. I don't think it is relevant to Raxxla.
