yeah but is that the only fact we know what with the rumor that its orbition the 8th moon of a Gas Giant and so on?
It's the Dark Wheel station that's rumoured to be orbiting the 8th moon - not Raxxla. As far as I know everything officially mentioned by FD regarding Raxxla is on the front page, but I stand to be corrected.
