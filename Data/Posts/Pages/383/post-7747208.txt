In the network I found an old short novel that came with the first Elite (СMDR Drew Wagar spoke about it in his stream). Translated into Russian for the Russian speaking community. There is a phrase:
"– Ракксла – это не что-то инопланетное, это призрачный мир, планета-легенда." - what is translated into english as: "Raxxsla is not something alien, this is a ghostly world, a planet legend.
This gives an understanding that we are still looking for a PLANET. What narrows down the search.
Rafe smiled, shaking his head. Suddenly there was a brilliant sparkle in his eyes: 'Raxxla's no alien, Alex. It's a ghost world. A planet. A legend . . .' He hesitated, staring quizzically at the younger man through the distant link between them, 'Jason really said that to you?'
Alex nodded. 'Moments before . . . It was the last thing he said.'

This is the original English version.
