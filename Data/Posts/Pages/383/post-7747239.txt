I've been think a lot lately about what exactly we've been told and some how I don't get why he said that "FDev has to make some of it a tiny bit obvious so that players know what their doing" I don't see what is obvious about Raxxla...

The whole 'tiny bit obvious' possibly related to the older DW missions which were binned.

They were bit obvious because they discussed Raxxla ergo 'tiny bit obvious'.

Think we ought not to rely too much on old clues nor lore as its likely FD has scrapped that narrative in favour of what we have now.

I'm going off the assumption all current lore is in the codex and anything prior to that may no longer be relevant.

If ever there is another Q & A we ought to get this clarified.
