Exoplanets: Conditions, Appearances, and Names
I remember back in the old days when there were just 300 exoplanets, people were literally worshiping Gliese 581 c, and so many of those planets were bland and scorched! Thankfully that phase is over. The downside? We've got over 2,000 exoplanets, and that can cause some...issues. Lots of planets...

It's time to use the Elite naming method: to combine short fixed elements in pseudo-random order: Tionisla, Zaonce, Exesle, Xeesle, Zarvaar.
And KIC 8462852 is Raxxla.
