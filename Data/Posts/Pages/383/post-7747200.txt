I've been think a lot lately about what exactly we've been told and some how I don't get why he said that "FDev has to make some of it a tiny bit obvious so that players know what their doing" I don't see what is obvious about Raxxla...
The obvious part is not about what or where Raxxla is.

What FD has made obvious is that Raxxla is in the game, in the Milky Way and that they know how to get there.

The rest is up to us to figure out.

I think Braben is perfectly happy with Raxxla remaining a mystery. I doubt that he will give much more direction than we already have.
