Oh i spent many a fruitless night doing that... But im sure there is more territory to be searched there. I spent most of my time heading out to the area between reorte an ridequat for some reason..

edit.. Here are some old galnet articles relating to strange things around the Old Worlds/ Lave ... Possibly Dark Wheel related ... but to be honest I think these were for a Walden Clone storyline that didnt take off....

SPOILER: GALNET ARTICLES



















oops forgot ... this might explain missing moon/asteroid...

I'm not sure if its relevant, but several years ago there was a bug in the mission system where you could get missions to systems and planetary bases that were locked behind permits.
I got a mission to deliver something to a planetary base on lave 2 I accepted it but couldn't approach the planet (obviously). It's the first mission that I failed so I might have a picture somewhere which lists the mission giver and received. I'm a kickstarter founder and it was a time when I was taking the dark wheel missions from shinrata.
