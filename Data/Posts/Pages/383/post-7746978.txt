The Quest To Find Raxxla
So where is everybody actually looking these days. I'm talking systems or even galactic sectors / regions, not stanzas in poetry. That information is classified! ðŸ˜Ž
forums.frontier.co.uk

Here is my post with a file with much of the info if it helps. More if there are no planets in galaxy 5-8. There are lots of extra finds with alternative results though. And I think 31 confirmed systems in galaxy 1 and 1 in galaxy 2. Atius. I did atius and up to the R's. But I haven't gone to as many as I ran out of scan data to give to get rep with the major groups.

The file has the mostly up to date info with results for galaxy 1-4 and the remaining names for galaxy 5-8.

I should probably go finish those up.
