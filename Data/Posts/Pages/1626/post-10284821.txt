This is just a suspicion but believe layouts in tourism stations may actually be important. Image captured from California Freeport (which weirdly is a Refinery but looks suspiciously like a tourist station). I will get more when I have some time. Also, note the tops of giant containers on the left.

Agreed they might just be a planet-themed landscape, or they could be pointing to a location
I'm interpreting it as a star (centre) occulted by a planetary system?

The other aspects are the trees, as well as the plinth / park bench objects highlighted. There are also 10 lights around the 'star' - stellar mass?
