From Wikipedia:

Common species chosen for topiary include cultivars of European box (Buxus sempervirens), arborvitae (Thuja species), bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), holly (Ilex species), myrtle (Eugenia or Myrtus species), yew (Taxus species), and privet (Ligustrum species).

I looked at topiary because they are uniform and perfect... But these are low-poly objects probably not designed to be ever looked at closely!
I think the presence of trees is more important than trying to infer the type, if they are even relevant, or illustrative of anything in the end.
