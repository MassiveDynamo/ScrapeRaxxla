Have you looked at Dawn/Aurora?
I'm off on a deep tangent - Phillip K. Di.ck wasn't referred to by Brookes as far as I know, but interesting things crop up often.

PKD mentions Dawn equating to Aurora, and infers the aurora Borealis. But in game we have the systems Aurora and Aurora Astrum (there is also Boreas). AA seems to have been a spot Jacques jumped to once upon a time, or at least I gather that by his faction in the history on EDSM.
More on Boreas:
"In some versions of Hyacinthus's story, Boreas supplants his brother Zephyrus as the wind-god that bore a one-sided love for the beautiful Spartan prince, who preferred Apollo over him."

Regardless of any relation to PKD, if aurora= dawn, then that gives a direction of east. Aurora Astrum signifies...?

And more...

For those with eyes to see

The third eye (also called the mind's eye or inner eye) is an invisible eye, usually depicted as located on the forehead, which provides perception beyond ordinary sight.[1] In Hinduism, the third eye refers to the ajna (or brow) chakra. In both Hinduism and Buddhism, the third eye is said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows, representing the enlightenment one achieves through meditation.

Meditation is a journey, not a destination. A journey all must take by themselves.

Just thoughts, anyway.
