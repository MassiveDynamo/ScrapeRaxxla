It could be one system, the furthest circle to the right is the target eg planet and or moon; the central circle is the system, the circle to the left area that system is in, galactic speaking.

The trees might act as reference points. Eg they are 4 trees inside the first circle, these are then around the second. 6 trees are inside the second circle, then they surround the third.

Now this is pattern bias because I’m reading Milton; but that first circle turned on its side could represent a Miltonian model, eg Hell, Chaos and the Empyrean at the top, paradise just below it!

Maybe that big tree is Yggdrasil… not sure about those bushes though… (Thorn bushes)!

Any horticulturalists out there who could identify these?

I see what you mean, it matches the interpretations very specifically - so likely a reference to Milton. Which makes me wonder why the circles in a line are extending out from the Empyrean
Could these circles be a version of the Spheres of the known universe?
The large circle with the lights could be the Sphere of the Sun
So then the others are Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn?


perhaps the straight line linking the circles together represents the path of Satan? or maybe it represents the passage to earth from heaven's gate???

ALSO - look closely at the doors at either end of the park - very similar to the elder futhark rune Haglaz ᚺ meaning Hail
