Does "in bigness as a star Of smallest magnitude" mean a very faint star or a very bright star (conventional meaning of smallest magnitude in astronomy!) or a very small star ??

Discuss!

And fast by, hanging in a golden chain,
This pendant world, in bigness as a star
Of smallest magnitude, close by the moon.

in context means :

"(the world) looked like one of the faint stars that you see in the sky near the moon" - in an era where there was much less light pollution Edit: presumably this distinction is to include the light-pollution 'halo' from the moon's reflected light, thus making the stars nearby fainter?? That's a guess, but it makes sense.

FYI "bigness" means literally size or scale.
