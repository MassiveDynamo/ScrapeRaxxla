Ok thanks to this post I now know what Raxxla is and where to find it:


Arx are a virtual currency earned by sitting in frobt of your screen just as Aurline bonus miles are earnt.

LAX is an airport in western America.

So Raxxla (or ARX LAX) are a frequent flyer lounge at LAX. Obviously, it is the Star Alliance lounge there.

I heard it is a nice atmosphere there and they serve free cookies.

Anybody able to confirm?

If services at LAX are the same as SFO in the Star Alliance lounge, I can confirm the cookies. If not, I'm lost here. Never been to LAX.
