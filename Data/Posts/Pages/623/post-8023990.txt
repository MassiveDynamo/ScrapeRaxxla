The story of Captain Jupiter is official Fe:2 lore. Same as the story of Jaques.

All the old lore, including the FFE journals and the Gazetteer, can be found on: http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/

If you read all of the 'Stories Of Life On The Frontier' you see that som of the characters appear in several stories. Captain Jupiter is one of them.
Very cool - I totally missed the 'Stories' !
I will return and endeavor to not pollute any Free Spirit with my non-industrious ambitions
