I'm not big on ED Lore. Is there anything behind the "Guardians of the Free Spirit" who live in Van Maanen's star system?
Only found one story - The Commander Jupiter story- that Han_Zen mentioned recently, which I think is fan-fiction rather than official ED Lore.
The lore story in galmap is that it was granted to them by the Federation in 2480. Is this date significant??
