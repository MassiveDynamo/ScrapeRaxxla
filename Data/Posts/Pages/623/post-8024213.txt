Ok because I cant let the Jewel on the brow of the Mother of Galaxies go....

Reverting to the Holy book of the Dark Wheel Page 23:
Elyssia sniggered. 'What god or goddess do you believe in?' 'Randomius Factoria .. .' Alex muttered. 'Me too .. .'
Later on page 39 Elyssia exclaims:
'Holy Mother of the Stars!'

So assuming she is invoking the goddess she believes in: Randomius Factoria is Holy Mother of the Stars...

Next step - who is Randomius Factoria? The lady fate .. Greek goddess Tyche / Roman Fortuna and also associated with the Wheel of Fortune... (not the game show)

An aspect of Tyche is that she is often adorned with a Mural Crown which symbolized a walled city... maybe an atlantis or eldorado ?

A utopia on the brow of the mother of galaxies ? Who rules in the first recorded idea of a utopia - the utopia of Plato's Republic?... the Guardians.
