Speaking of those with eyes to see...just pondering "To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies"
one answer could be Beta Cas (Tycho's nova SN 1572) which, as Jaiotu discovered, strangely isn't in-game!
MB did answer that question after the mapping project of the Cas A / Cas G hunt stating that FD simply didn't utilise that star catalogue.

I do concur it would be a good candidate; that nova appeared in the sky during the time of Philip Sidney and was very prominent, the constellation matches 'to an extent' to Astrophel and Stella (link). But if MB says its not in game...its not in the game.

The Quest To Find Raxxla
OMG! When you said One-Way you meant One-way! I didn't realize it was that bad! Thanks for checking Commander! Your sacrifice has eliminated an interesting system. So the only way we have any exploration data on it at all is because you used to be able to double-neutron jump out? EDSM...

Then again the nebula wouldn't be visible if it was as it would have dispersed by then but Cas G is a rouge star, flung out by the nova....would be a cool candidate....but if MB says it's not in game...
