I'm not big on ED Lore. Is there anything behind the "Guardians of the Free Spirit" who live in Van Maanen's star system?
Only found one story - The Commander Jupiter story- that Han_Zen mentioned recently, which I think is fan-fiction rather than official ED Lore.
The lore story in galmap is that it was granted to them by the Federation in 2480. Is this date significant??
I think its part of Elites background ascetic hermit/cults who populate various systems... Im still waiting to see actual Rock Hermits... But groups like the Far God etc or the Church of KumByar from FFE have been around. I havent seen anything specific about the Guardians of the Free Spirit though.
