All we need now is LAX and we can push this thing through...

Arx are a virtual currency earned by sitting in frobt of your screen just as Aurline bonus miles are earnt.

LAX is an airport in western America.

So Raxxla (or ARX LAX) are a frequent flyer lounge at LAX. Obviously, it is the Star Alliance lounge there.

I heard it is a nice atmosphere there and they serve free cookies.

Anybody able to confirm?
