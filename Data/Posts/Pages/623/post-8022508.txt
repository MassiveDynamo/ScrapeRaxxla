I'm not big on ED Lore. Is there anything behind the "Guardians of the Free Spirit" who live in Van Maanen's star system?
Only found one story - The Commander Jupiter story- that Han_Zen mentioned recently, which I think is fan-fiction rather than official ED Lore.
The lore story in galmap is that it was granted to them by the Federation in 2480. Is this date significant??
The story of Captain Jupiter is official Fe:2 lore. Same as the story of Jaques.

All the old lore, including the FFE journals and the Gazetteer, can be found on: http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/

If you read all of the 'Stories Of Life On The Frontier' you see that som of the characters appear in several stories. Captain Jupiter is one of them.
