I’d say any statements by a 3rd party are an unknown / un-corroborated.

I trust both sources yet but also don’t, a healthy dose of salt, goes some way to balance the flavour; as posting something on line is not entirely proof alone or a certainty.

At best both inform, when considered against the other evidence.

Drew statements may be said to more reliable (to a degree) because David and Brookes also confirmed it as in game on other occasions. But that’s all, all he stated was it’s in game, and they know why players haven’t found it.

The other source which states it ‘was’ accessible, may hold veracity if only other separate sources could corroborate it.

But again they all cannot be held up as 100% reliable. Even the statements of DB and MB or even AT could be unreliable, as they are all historical, it’s a game which undergoes development and change.

AT statement are the most recent, but likewise, under scrutiny don’t confirm it as in game only that’s its ’out there’.

Yes to all of that

I just wanted to make sure it was clear that Drew got his information basically from the source, not assumptions or hearsay, and that we have no reason to doubt his information based on the corroborating statements from DB and MB, and his general involvement with ED and its storylines. Especially if you believe any other outside of game sources of information at all on Raxxla, even youtubers, this forum, the books, ect.

Sure I admit there is always possibility they lied/mislead/are wrong... but that's been discussed 100000 times over and we'll agreed could be a possibility, but is not the generally acepted assumption made by most here, even if we admit its still a possibility, that's all

No text wall, I promise XD there was one, I deleted it XD just leave it at yes I agree.
