I’d say any statements by a 3rd party are an unknown / un-corroborated.

I’d like to say I trust both sources but I can’t. I can say I like both ideas, but I shouldn’t accept them as reliable; as posting something on line is not proof alone or a certainty.

At best both inform, when considered against the other evidence.

Drew statements may be said to more reliable (to a degree) because David and Brookes also confirmed it as in game on other occasions. But that’s all, all he stated was he was told it’s in game, and they know why players haven’t found it.

The other source which states it ‘was’ accessible, may hold veracity if only other separate sources could corroborate it.

But again they all cannot be held up as 100% reliable. Even the statements of DB and MB or even AT could be unreliable, as they are all historical, it’s a game which undergoes development and change.

AT statements (as he said it on 2 separate occasions) are the most recent, but likewise, under scrutiny don’t confirm it as in game only that’s its ’out there’ and he was at that time discussing in the same breath, narrative structure.
