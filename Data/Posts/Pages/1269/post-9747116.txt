Ok, I have work to go to, so last thing for a few hours....

First off, Drew was writing for ED long before Reclamation, that's just one story.

Next, Are you that diluted that you think an Offical ED Book, licensed by fdev/Elite, is not part of the game or its lore??

All Official Books are considered cannon and factually correct to the ED Game, also, anything Elite takes/uses from a player, including in-game factions, become property of Fdev/ED and are considered official and part of lore and game and they (fdev) can use them as they see fit.

Which brings me back to Salome. She was Drews, even as an NPC and owned by Fdev, he controlled most of her.
Do you know ANY other, non fdev developer, writer who had control of a NPC? No, so again, goes to the trustworthiness of him and his statements. Fdev trusted him more than just about anyone outside of the dev team themselves.

And yes he is confirming it, lol, do you not listen to his words, Yes Raxxla is IN GAME, those are his words, how is that not confirming? And he HEARD IT, from FDEV (MB/DB to be exact), not some random player or online forum, direct from the tippy top of fdev ED dev team, therefore it's like the USA President telling CNN news somthing and CNN telling the world.
President = fdev/MB/DB
CNN = Drew
World = US

Anyways, gtg, work -_-"
