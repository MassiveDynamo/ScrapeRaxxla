New topic of Raxxla hunt;

One of my dozens of theories;

We won't find Raxxla until we find the Guaridan Constructs, which could be the 'sinister cabal' using/controlling/hiding Raxxla....

The Constructs are currently still listed as 'unknown' if they still exist, but are included as Sentient Species on most of the ED wikis/sites...

Thoughts? Theories? Opinions? Ideas?

I have been trying to decide on an area of space that could start the "Construct Hunt" or what ever, and start looking over a 50-100ly or somthing bubble in some areas....
But can't even begin to guess/find a clue, to where some areas that should be checked would be....

I also realize that there's a chance they are in some permit locked regions due to non-implementation, but hopeful otherwise with Guardian Beacons, sites, ect all in game, hoping they would be too, if they're meant to be....

Imagine....

They could be angry AF about us using their tech for weapons and drives, lol.... then have two 'Aliens Species ' trying to kill humanity, lol...
Or they could be useful and helpful.. .

Thoughts? Lmaoo
