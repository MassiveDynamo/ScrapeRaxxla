Ok so hi guys first of all. I was going through quite a lot of threads regarding the literaly only thing that can be considered official in connection to Raxxla which is this logo.

Are you sure this is official? I always thought this was made by a CMDR from the Codex.
I think the only official Images related to Raxxla are those two:



The circle and the dot for Sol do not match in there proportions.
The dot needs to be at least dopple as bold.

Sry for been late at this one. My E-Mail bounced so i was no longer able to reply anywhere in the Forum for almost a week now.

Latest experiment:
Scanned Sols neighbors (same Layer/Masscode Systems whit SystemID 0 but in the 6 neighbors Boxels from Sol) and sold my Data to TDW faction.
Result: nothing

here the Systems: (no particular Raxxla Candidate among them?)
Akhenaten (-1 z)
HR 5779 (+1 z)
Munfayl (-1 y)
HIP 60551 (+1 y)
Moortic (-1 x)
