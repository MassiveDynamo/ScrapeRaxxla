That's as good a location/area and reason to start from, as any other.

Though, the same/opposite argument could be made that Jaques was "pushed" away from Begal Point area for the same Thargoid reasons, but from an area of space "to the right" or what.e. of Begal Point.... some system more opposite Colonia on the system map...
Basically the Thargoid tech wanted to be as far away as possible from the Constructs.

So both Hyponia/Colonia and points opposite them in the galaxy, could be very good points to start from I guess
I think personally with the Guardians being towards the centre and east of the galaxy, and the thargoids to the south (and southwest rift area via lore and the Zarura) placing the constructs out from colonia to the west northwest expands the galaxy further story wise, The NGC locked zone to the north of ETA Carine I beleieve to be where the Guardians originated from or fled to (Maybe still alive? who knows) this leaves the North section (bleie, Prei areas) Expandable for a possible excursion zone for Humanity or maybe even a 4th race we may meet face to face as a potential ally since we already have war, extinction etc.

As for Raxxla, DB never once stated it was in game, he only said it exists, "Of course it does" Thargoids existed in Elite before the first crashed scout was ever placed via lore from the old games, however this doesn't say it is in the game accessible now unfortunately, could be..might not be he never really seems overly keen on Raxxla to be honest...especially since that's the bread and butter of Elite for most of the players which is a bit concerning but may also be his way of hiding clues, he hasnt been online in Elite in 23 days either (I have him in my friends list as I met him ingame before and disabled his drives making him talk to me ingame Tried luring info out but he didn't budge for the guts of 40+ minutes...pun intended so I trew a repair limpet and let him fly away before anymore less eager CMDR's showed up)

As for the point in one direction and fly, iv always been against this from day one, I never take the fastest route, I always set my route to ensure it goes through systems not visited yet even while in the bubble, at this point in my game time of over 4k hours on steam alone though I haven't hit a single non visited system in the bubble in over a year while also I have always ensured iv ad least scanned every planet however come across one or two now and again, maybe these where added additions or missed them with the older system scanning tech
