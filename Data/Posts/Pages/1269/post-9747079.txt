You wrote a text wall about something you didn't understand. If DW said that he heard MB/DB said Raxxla is in the game, yes, I'd believe him.

He can confirm hearing certain things from people, but he cannot confirm the existence of Raxxla in the game by himself.
He wasn't the main story writer, he was one of the writers of the books. And Salome was an isolated event.
Lool wow you know very little and think you know everything.

Did you listen to the whole Drew video? He was told directly from one of them (BD/MB) while at a bar having a drink with them, so saying he wasn't told directly, is just a lie. And again claiming he cannot say he was told this when he was, is again a lie.

Your right, he wasn't the MAIN story writer, but I didnt say he was. I said he was A main, not THE main. And yes, yes he was, from the beginning, that's indisputable and has never been questioned by anyone but you apparently.

And Google it yourself, im not linking 20 pages of proof to someone who hasnt even looked for 10secs themselves, but YES, Drew controlled/dictated actions of, the NPC Salome, it's well documented on several sites, including the wiki on Drew I believe, but can't remember off the top of my head, been a while since I read that particular page. But yes he did, that's why he was able to write anything he wanted in Reclamation about her time while she 'disappeared'. But here are 2 quick screenshots, which you can use to find the articles yourself.
Salome was Controlled, right until her death, by Drew and his actions/writings as well as ingame events, even though she was NPC.
