I have a feeling the constructs are in Hyponia and the reason why Jacques station was pulled towards that direction with the Thargoid sensors on board, Since they react so badly to guardian tech, so much Thargoid sensors may have tried to bring the station towards (As opposed to pointing to) the region of what the thargoids are fearful of and trying to avoid

That's as good a location/area and reason to start from, as any other.

Though, the same/opposite argument could be made that Jaques was "pushed" away from Begal Point area for the same Thargoid reasons, but from an area of space "to the right" or what.e. of Begal Point.... some system more opposite Colonia on the system map...
Basically the Thargoid tech wanted to be as far away as possible from the Constructs.

So both Hyponia/Colonia and points opposite them in the galaxy, could be very good points to start from I guess
