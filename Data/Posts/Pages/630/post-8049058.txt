What is the Symbol of Elite Pilots? The Iynges of Raxxla

The Iynx Wheel (plural Iynges) was used in Theurgy. It was whirled/spun as part of the ceremonies. Iynges have been described as a spinning top,also bullroars or whirlygigs - and quite possibly all were used. The Iynx emitted a sound when spun and is equated with both the Sirens as well as the Wrynek bird. Neoplatonists and Pythagoreans seemed to associate the spinning and humming noise with a harmonizing of the music of the spheres. They were seen as a tool to call Hekate, also Iynges were described as daimons and ferrymen. A way to get from one sphere to another...

In effect ... it is a spinning device that emits a sound and opens a gate/passage... Also as elite symbols go.. there are three paths to take...

Looking at the Thargoid starmap device ... I think we are seeing a Thargoid version of the Spindle of Necessity. The stars are spinning aroud a celestial axis, initiated through three devices at the bottom - a crossroads of sorts. At the very least it provides a template and well ... makes Merope more interesting.

Oh and : a traditional spindle - was fun to watch.
