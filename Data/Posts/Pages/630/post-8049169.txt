Apparently Luko has a kid (who is part of the COR)? I have not finished watching all of it but is seems related to TDW. (probably not much of anything new of substance, but may be worth the watch.)

Alyssia Verdi is supposed to be Luko’s daughter. She’s a member of both TDW and CoR, presumably an infiltration of CoR by TDW (also getting them to accept Salomé as their leader) to push them to explore and find the evidence to expose the Club’s Dynasty/Exodus plot.
