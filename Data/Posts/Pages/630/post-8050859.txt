How did that happen?
Many of the thread mods aren't as sweet as our Boss !
Once, I had a great space game that I had been playing and enjoying for years (15 kH Steam says), until the FDevs completely spoiled it, for me. I was not happy. At all.
Those not-so-sweet mods didn't appreciate my... how did they call it... oh yeah, "badgering" !
You'll know how when it comes. Alert and PM.
SPOILER: VERY BAAAD !

Warnings?!
So do they call it. But I spent weeks banned. Had to... VPN/Alt account/etc.. to keep "badgering" some more until they strengthened the blockade.
Remember Bijaz and Masheikh Scytale... Even more evil than Scytale.
SPOILER: R.I.P.
