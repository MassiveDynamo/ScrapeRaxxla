The Cygnus posts, part 3. Astrophel.

Sir Philip Sidney, author of Astrophel and Stella and his sister Mary, used the swan as their symbol. Philip received it from King Charles IX and Mary continued to use it after his death.
SPOILER: MARY WITH SWANS

In Edmund Spenser's 'Ruins of Time', the last poem depicts him as a swan, places the swan in the sky and describes the stellar surroundings.

The poem starts with "Upon that famous River's further Shore": http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?action=GET&textsid=112

Interesting lines:
There stood a snowy Swan of heavenly Hue (Philip Sidney / Astrophel)
And out of sight to highest Heaven mounted:
Where now he is become an heavenly Sign;
- And 'twixt their blessed Arms it carried quight
Above the reach of any living sight:
So now it is transform'd into that Star,
In which all heavenly Treasures locked are.
- Immortal Spirit of Phillisides,
Which now art made the Heaven's ornament.

There is a star called P Cygni (34 P Cygni in ED), that was a nova in about 1600. This was a few years after Philip Sidney died. If could be interesting, if someone is close. I have never visited.

Edit: P.S. Also wrote the "The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia". Arcadia is a similar Utopia concept to El Dorado and Atlantis.
