Ok guys well I enjoyed your antics but I think I'm done with these forums, friends. I'll miss some of you but I keep getting warnings and locked out of threads and I haven't done anything wrong. I can't even carry on a conversation with the forum mods about why they think whatever I said is wrong. But I can be libelously slandered repetitively throughout a thread reporting it the whole time. PeteACarter, cmdrguru951, midian cabal, thatchino, factabulous and some others whom I've forgotten you guys are cool asf take it easy
