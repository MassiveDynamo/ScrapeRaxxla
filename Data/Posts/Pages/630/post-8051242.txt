FSS.
Oh right yeah... I bought an 18kg kettlebell when I realized this new overall game design approach is not going to work, really works wonders for your braincells too, got so much tinfoil done this year. I've been also planning on writing a very long post to the suggestions section why Archambault Terminal should be removed from the game, but I've been a bit lazy lately. Also quite occupied with shooting spaceships in Colonia region sometimes.
