Reading this topic reminds me so much of Alice chasing the rabbit down the rabbit hole. The difference here is that this field has hundreds of rabbit holes, much more interesting.

It did occur to me that rabbit and raxxla both have 6 letters with the same double letters in the middle but the a's dont match in any way.

I'll get my coat now.
