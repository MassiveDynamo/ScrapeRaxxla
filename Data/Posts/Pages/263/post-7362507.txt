Anyone else have the 12" white rabbit by damned with the excellent 'curtain call'? That should be the Raxxla theme...but airplane...oh I dont know! dammit!

Personally I would push for the theme tune from the film Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines....

but since we couldn’t agree on a squadron name I don’t hold out much hope for an agreement on a Questors theme.
