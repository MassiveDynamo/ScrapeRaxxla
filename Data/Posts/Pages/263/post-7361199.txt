does it work anything like simon. BTW, what other names have the simon game had over the years/decade/more... Does it have an older deeper origin to something?!

How old is simon says as a game? Pre electronic form.



I would bet there is something to the pattern raxxla or not. Figuring that our regardless would whittle down the raxxla hunt as it whittles down unknowns in the game.
