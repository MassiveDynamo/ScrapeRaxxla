Agreed. My original post was more about a second galaxy (Raxxla) and with cloud tech, how that galaxy could exist, unused, and still be financially viable for FD. @Xenia_K was just adding that the populated galaxy wouldn't even need to be hosted, just the model.
How would you host the real galaxy - not the model???
