Given FDEv's love of procedural generation, is there perhaps a procedural mapping between the positions of the 1984 elite versions of the old worlds, and their ED counterparts? Such a mapping may be complex as its goes from 2d-3d.

There is a spreadsheet linked from here with the original coordinates:

Some posibilites:
Only a small cluster of planets of the old worlds lie together, many fewer than the galaxy 1 map
RA is quite distant from the others, and so is Aona, so it maybe that the mapping spreads worlds widely
Its possible then that some worlds may be away from the bubble and thus not discovered.
In the original game intergalactic jump points were fixed. In Galaxy 1, the arrival system is Usle, which is not in EDSM, or on my previous list of places in ED
This is my previous list of Galaxy 1 systems in game from this thread:
