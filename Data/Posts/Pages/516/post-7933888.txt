Of course it would be viable. You'd have everybody and their neighbours dog hopping on spaceships and travelling, say to Magellanic Clouds, if there was discovered a path. They'd be there in a few days. Just add new kind of regional galactic variation, a few differently coloured alien pods there, a few hundred unique systems and nebulae using same assets, and some Listening Posts directing to a few dozen mysterious surface sites. A few months would pass in a new exploration frenzy, and there would be one or two gaming magazine articles how crazy these people are. It would be more or less the same though, to do something ambitious and passionate they would need to revisit hyperspace mechanics, and add new levels of depth to galaxy generation.
