Nothing with Thelx, just Thelingi and Thelmasci

Nothing with Aglao

No Molpe, but a Moli

No Parthenope, but a Partha, Parthians and Parthini

Nothing with Ligeia

Nothing with Peisinoe (but Peis takes you to Minerva!?)

Nothing with Pisinoe, but a Pisage, Pisagi, Pisagii, Pisakas, Pisaly, Pisamazin and Pisat, before it goes wonky

Nothing for Himerope, and just too many Him-xxx to list, but none look or sound remotely close
Reactions:
Jaiotu, Count dEstard and Scytale
