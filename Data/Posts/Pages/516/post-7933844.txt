The system is actually created locally on your computer, every time you enter the system. As we all have the same seed for the generation, it will look the same for all of us. Even down to individual rocks on a planet surface.
In a proc. gen. system without anything special, you only download first discovery information and probably some hand shake info.
Agreed. My original post was more about a second galaxy (Raxxla) and with cloud tech, how that galaxy could exist, unused, and still be financially viable for FD. @Xenia_K was just adding that the populated galaxy wouldn't even need to be hosted, just the model.
