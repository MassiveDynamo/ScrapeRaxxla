- whether this was all only initiated after Octavia went rogue or if the placement with the Loren’s had already been done as an effective ‘sleeper’ which could be activated if something went wrong with the previous clone.
Octavia wanted Kahina's body, because she was getting old. That suggests that Kahina only got activated after Octavia had gone rogue.

One question that I've never seen answered is why when the bad guys were looking for a place to hide their dark-haired clone they chose a family famous for ensuring that all their offspring were blonde. It could only have made less sense if the Loren's were Chinese.
