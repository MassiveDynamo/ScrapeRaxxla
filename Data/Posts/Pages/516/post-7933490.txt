Candidate to be the Siren in deepest void...
So you keep thinking that every sentence of the TDW toast might refer to a distinct star/system. ?
A Whisperer, a Siren, a Parent and a Lover ?
You know ... maybe we should be looking closer for that siren. In Greek myth Hera convinced the Sirens to enter a singing contest against the Muses. They lost. Bad. The muses plucked the feathers from their wings to make crowns for themselves. Distraught, the Sirens plunged into the sea near Aptera (featherless) and became the islands of Leukai (white ones).

Perhaps there is a system named after one of these Sirens?

Siren is also the name of a former constellation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_constellations). It might be worth trying to find the names of the stars that were part of it.
