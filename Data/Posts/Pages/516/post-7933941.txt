Ah thanks, after your earlier post, i started frantically searching the Premonition ebook for anything. I tried just about every synonym of "clone", "newborn" and "pregnant" but didnt find results. Silly me, of course "oo" was the word i was looking for!

Edit: hahaha best use of the profanity filter i've ever seen. Can't spell "c.u.c.k.o.o". Thanks, alt-right, this is why we cant have nice things.
Thought you’d just gone a bit camp!

I guess I saw it as different in that Waldens were done in a "traditional" way presumably the clones were brought to term in an incubator and then "born" and grew up normally. I assumed that the cloning of Kahina/Salome was done after the Prisim incident... (so the clone would have been some sort of quick grown to the right age thing) - why would the Lorens have made clones of her as a kid ? But putting a pin in that for the moment. If Kahina was a clone as well as Salome ... It makes more sense now why Octavia Quinton wanted her body specifically. Octavia had to have been an older version of the same clone... It also begs the question ... Was Kahina/Salome/Octavia made by Walden?
Not sure if I’m just misreading/misinterpreting you here, but slightly puzzled by a bit of that. So to try and clear up. (Probably ninja’d by now, but just in case.)

Kahina and Salome are just one person.

Based on the info from Luko, essentially what happens is:

- Phantom preganancy is induced in Lady Loren.

- Clone is produced

- ‘Birth’ of phantom pregnancy

- Clone is presented to the Lorens as their newborn baby

- They name the baby Kahina Tijani

- Baby grows up as a senators daughter

- Events happen

- Kahina adopts (or is possibly given) the pseudonym ‘Salome’

- All the rest of the stuff we’re aware of happens.

(With apologies if I’ve just misunderstood you and have just basically restated what you already knew.)

Things that aren’t clear from the info:

- whether this was all only initiated after Octavia went rogue or if the placement with the Loren’s had already been done as an effective ‘sleeper’ which could be activated if something went wrong with the previous clone.

- whether any of the Lorens were in on it or whether it was all without their knowledge. (I would suspect the latter, but didn’t see anything definitive that wasn’t open to interpretation.)

I’ve not seen anything to suggest Walden’s involvement, but I’m not that up on the Walden stuff.

With Elyssia being of Teorgian origins, I would suspect the cloning is done using Teorgian tech and following Teorgian tradition. Could be wrong though.
