Octavia wanted Kahina's body, because she was getting old. That suggests that Kahina only got activated after Octavia had gone rogue.

One question that I've never seen answered is why when the bad guys were looking for a place to hide their dark-haired clone they chose a family famous for ensuring that all their offspring were blonde. It could only have made less sense if the Loren's were Chinese.
Must have been playing the ‘so blatant that no one would actually believe they’d be so blatant’ card.
