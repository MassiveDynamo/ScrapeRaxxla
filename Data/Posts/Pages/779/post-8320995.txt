I like this thought. It has occurred to me that the guardians, Pilot’s Federation (the symbol appears in our ships etc), and now these tattoos all have a triangle theme. So perhaps our “ personal journey” should be getting allied with any/all factions that display a triangular motif; this can be seen in the flags that appear in the background of some of the mission givers.
I concur.

Which is pretty much what I've started to do now. The engineer spotting was an accident more than anything.

I'm still not sure about the Anarchy (clover tattoo), I think I'll be looking around for the triangles associated with those two named engineers and in and around SD / SOL to start with and see where it takes me. What I'd like to know if people have spotted these way out in the black anywhere or not. More curious if they are RNG or Targeted.
