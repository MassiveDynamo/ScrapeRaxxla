It’s very possible the beacon you’ve found might not be known to Canonn. They’ve all been added at various different times, so even if a systems been checked in the past the beacon might not have been found before. (And by found, I really mean found and reported on the forums/to Canonn.)

@Jorki Rasalas also maintains a list of UCBs, etc. Think the link is in his sig. Not sure if there’s anything there which isn’t on the Canonn site or not though.

Out of interest, is it a UCB, LP, Transmitter, or something else? (I’m presuming it’s not a Guardian Beacon )

Anyway, good luck with it! Whack the info on here or the Alien Archaeology thread if you want anyone to give a hand with it at any point. (Particularly the latter if you want assistance with the code breaking part.)

Jorki seems to remember it so will give a hint, can PM me for system but don't want to spoil the fun for anyone.

its in a system beginning with V near the Canonn Institute. Its a plain text 'Mayday, Mayday' message. Think its a closed story.

Side note, 1st mapped a GG and 6 moons less than 40LY from Canonn Instiute towards Sol this week so theyre still out there.
