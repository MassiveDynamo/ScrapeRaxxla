I don't recognise any of those but havent done them all by any means. If they are codes from the Beacons then I have bad news for you, they are written down wrong, they need spaces to define letters and words or it wont work.

Some have keywords hidden at the beginning or nearby that you will need.

Try here first:


Replace RAGAZZA with text in INPUT. Add keyword if known or can 'crack' to brute force. Can add or remove layers of encryption.

If still totally stuck try here, find the beacon system, it will give you the answer so if you don't want to know read slowly to get the solution but not the answer. I warn you though, all the beacons in this category are here in one list so you may see something you didn't mean to.


Ive also found one Beacon not registered on Canonn, but 100% assume that just nobody updated it rather than its not been found yet, kinda following that trail now while doing other stuff at the same time.

I have a summary sheet of the UCBeacons and Listening Posts (link in my signature) and am interested in keeping it up to date so if you’ve found an unknown then I could add it to my sheet if you pm me the details (assuming you dont mind it being available to others). The only one I’ve found that wasn’t listed on the Canonn page is the one in Upaniklis pointing to Golconda generation ship in same system.
