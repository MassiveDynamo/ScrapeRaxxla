Ok...

Are they codes that you have obtained in the game from playing the game?

Because mining info from the games files themselves (and other things of that nature) is a form of cheating and I’m also pretty sure is a violation of the Terms Of Service.

Edit - Just to be clear, I’m not accusing you of anything here @SkyRock . I’m just explaining the situation on data mining as a precaution given the “you better not know where I got them” part of the post. The phrase implies that the codes might not have been obtained legitimately. However I also realise that might just be an artefact of the google translation, and not something that was part of the meaning in the original language.
