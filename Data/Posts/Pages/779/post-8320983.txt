Has anyone else noticed that two of the engineers, both with noteworthy surnames have the same neck tattoo?

I'm sure I saw the same one recently when I unlocked the permit for van Maanen's Star, and it was on the Sublime Order of van Maanen's Star contact. Although they also had the weird four leaf clover tattoo that criminal masterminds seem to have as well.

Not sure how this relates to anything as yet, but might be a tiny bit obvious too.









I haven't yet unlocked Lori, so I don't know if she's also has allegiance to the Empire?

I like this thought. It has occurred to me that the guardians, Pilot’s Federation (the symbol appears in our ships etc), and now these tattoos all have a triangle theme. So perhaps our “ personal journey” should be getting allied with any/all factions that display a triangular motif; this can be seen in the flags that appear in the background of some of the mission givers.

Edit: Since we know that TDW is a conglomerate of organisations; from the “wheels within wheels” speech from Premonition.
