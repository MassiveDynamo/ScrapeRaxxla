Ok...

Are they codes that you have obtained in the game from playing the game?

Because mining info from the games files themselves (and other things of that nature) is a form of cheating and I’m also pretty sure is a violation of the Terms Of Service.

Edit - Just to be clear, I’m not accusing you of anything here @SkyRock . I’m just explaining the situation on data mining as a precaution given the “you better not know where I got them” part of the post. The phrase implies that the codes might not have been obtained legitimately. However I also realise that might just be an artefact of the google translation, and not something that was part of the meaning in the original language.

the data was obtained in a completely legal way without extracting from the game. I’ll tell everyone to understand everything.
I ran some Targoid code through different ric systems, I thought maybe something is there ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯. I calculated that they would give a decoder and I myself would sit with a foil hat. sorry

upd
I don’t know how to explain, when meeting with the targoids, there were numbers in the window on the left, in a certain order, through different number systems, they issued these codes
again sorry
