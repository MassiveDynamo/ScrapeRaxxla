Doesn't look like code. It looks like base21 numbers.

With out knowing the bit length, it not easy to make anything from it.
Yeah, true. It was the “you better not know where I got them” part of the post that had me concerned, so I covered the data mining situation as a precaution. It’s all going through Google Translate though, so that particular phrasing might well just be something that’s an artefact of the translation, not the original meaning. Have already edited the post to try to make clear it’s an explanation and not an accusation.

Hopefully it’ll actually be from a valid source and there’s an interesting puzzle to be looked into!
