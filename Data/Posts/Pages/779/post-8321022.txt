the data was obtained in a completely legal way without extracting from the game. I’ll tell everyone to understand everything.
I ran some Targoid code through different ric systems, I thought maybe something is there ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯. I calculated that they would give a decoder and I myself would sit with a foil hat. sorry

upd
I don’t know how to explain, when meeting with the targoids, there were numbers in the window on the left, in a certain order, through different number systems, they issued these codes
again sorry
Thanks for the clarification!

And apologies from me for only making it clear in the edit of my previous post that it wasn’t an accusation. I hope the original version didn’t sound like I was making accusation.

Anyway, yes, the numbers in question do decode.

I wouldn’t want to jump straight to the answer if that’s not what you’re asking for though.

Is there any information you would like other than that the numbers can be decided to something?

Edit - the above is based on the assumption that I’ve correctly understood what you mean. I’m reasonably sure I have though.
