can you tell me, where and how are the transcripts allowed, for example, from transmitters and so on? there’s just a big list of about 30 entries that theoretically can mean something
Not sure what you’re meaning here. Could take a guess but might get it wrong!

So questions:

what transcripts?
what do you mean when you say ‘allowed’?
which transmitters?
what’s the list that you’re referring to?
