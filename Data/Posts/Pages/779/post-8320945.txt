Ok...

Are they codes that you have obtained in the game from playing the game?

Because mining info from the games files themselves (and other things of that nature) is a form of cheating and Iâ€™m also pretty sure is a violation of the Terms Of Service.
Doesn't look like code. It looks like base21 numbers.

With out knowing the bit length, it not easy to make anything from it.
