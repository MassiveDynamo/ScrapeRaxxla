"To the Jewel that burns on the brow of the Mother of Galaxies"
The Star In Cassiopeia's (Mother of Princess Andromeda) Brow is Zeta Cassiopeia and that is the believed starting point. This would be fitting given the meaning of Zeta Cass has been defined as a by-path or auxillary road.

Guru, would you (or anyone else) be willing to clarify how you arrived at Zeta Cassiopeia being the "Jewel that burns on the brow"? I understand "Mother of Galaxies" = "Cassiopeia" but I'm not 100% on why "Jewel" = Zeta Cassiopeia. From what I've seen of classical depictions of the constellation (e.g. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Sidney_Hall_-_Urania%27s_Mirror_-_Cassiopeia_%28image_right_side_up%29.jpg), ζ Cass would be no more fitting than, say, v Cass, in terms of distance from the "actual brow". Was it just a matter of "close enough"? Not trying to be disparaging, I'm genuinely curious. I also remember you mentioning a road map of checkpoints and having some sort of confirmation that ζ Cass was absolutely the correct first step, but I'm not seeing as concrete of a connection as you are. Would you mind clarifying? I'd like to help out with this but I think I need more confidence in the correct place to start.
