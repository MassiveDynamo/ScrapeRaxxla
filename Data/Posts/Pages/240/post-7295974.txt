Hi all, have been reading the thread with interest for a while now, anyway just something In noticed in the Codex today and thought I'd see what you lot make of it.
So in the Codex regarding the Dark Wheel, Felicity Farseer says,

"Now think about how easy it would be for some two-bit band of hucksters to pass themselves off as the Dark Wheel and start trading on their reputation. Doesn't happen, does it? Not for long, anyway. Whenever someone tries to usurp the Dark Wheel name, sooner or later they quietly get shut down, And thats how I know."

So does this mean that the Dark Wheel in Shinrarta Dezhra are in fact the genuine Dark Wheel? and if not then why have they not yet been "shut down"?
