Has it been noted, that the Codex entry regarding Universal Cartographics contains a strange ,,mistake''? The written text says, that Universal Cartographics arose from a merger of Omphalos Infotech and Devaine-Bright Interstellar. The speaker reads instead ,,Unified Infotech'' - in every occasion, where the word ,,Omphalos'' is written. It seems, the ,,mistake'' is quiet systematic. Alas, I have no idea, what this should mean :-/

[Update] typo ;-)
