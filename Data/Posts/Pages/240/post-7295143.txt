Has it been noted, that the Codex entry regarding Universal Cartographics contains a strange ,,mistake''? The written text says, that Universal Cartographics arose from a merger of Omphalos Infotech and Devaine-Bright Interstellar. The speaker reads instead ,,Unified Infotech'' - in every occasion, where the word ,,Omphalos'' is written. It seems, the ,,mistake'' is quiet systematic. Alas, I have no idea, what this should mean :-/

[Update] typo ;-)

Now, that's a thing to take a note of.
In that case the system, containing Raxxla or/and DarkWheel might be there, but not in the Galaxy Map, because of UC being connected with Dark Wheel.
If tha't s the case - there's no point in goind through all 8th moons of gas giants - it won't be there anyway.

Now, need to read through all other CODEX articles, there might as well be some connections.


As a side note, are those articles accessible without Eite running?
