Good ideas, CyberTribe.

Cat's Eye has no star - therefore it is impossible to reach. However, this doesn't make any sense - for there to be a planetary nebula there, there must have been some stellar event to create that nebula, which must result in either a neutron star, black hole, or white dwarf - none of which is exists there. NOTHING exists there. Perhaps, referencing A&S Sonnet 20 again,

"As that sweet black which veils the heav'nly eye:"

Something veils, or hides, the star from us, and the eye is literally the Cat's Eye.
