Quick write up - don't know how/where to post editable text files without my IRL name being connected to it, so, posting it here. Missing anything?

"To the jewel that burns on the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!
The parent's grief, the lover's wore, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!" -Dark Wheel Toast

Mother of galaxies = Cassiopeiae
Jewel = Zeta Cassiopeia
Whisperer in Witchspace - ?
Siren of the deepest void - ?
The Parent's grief - Fluk the Dog (check the inhabited heart system)
Lover's Woe - Reference to sonnet 19, Astrophel and Stella

Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars = Astrophel and Stella

Cass Zeta wouldn't be a bad choice given how the constellation is classically depicted, but 14 lambda Cassiopeia wouldn't be a bad choice either.

Regarding "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars = Astrophel and Stella", "spiralling stars" might be a literal reference to the jagged shape of the Cassiopeia constellation?

Alternatively, Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars could be a reference to the Pleaides seven stars? Given "the Omphalos Rift", the renaming of Pleaides Sector IR-W D1-55 to Delphi, and the "Omphalos" reference in the Universal Cartographics, this seems likely too.

Need more tinfoil.
