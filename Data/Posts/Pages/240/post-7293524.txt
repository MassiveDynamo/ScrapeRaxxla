Whisperer in Witchspace = Siren of the deepest void
Still they must be something, the sound of witchspace, i guess, was already spectrum-analyzed, but may be we should do it once again, there could be subtle changes in it (or they could appear depending on your jump, another theory to check).
How do you do that? Need to grab the sound (finding it in resources might not work), and then use some tool?

As for Fluk the dog - don't really think that's the one, that pledge is older (in ingame terms) then Fluk's memorial, so must be smth else.
Lover's Woe = why exactly number 19? That one doesn't really look like a wov.

I think it's mostly like that:

To the jewel that burns on the mother of galaxies! = To Zeta Cassiopea
To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void = ?Where? (Spectrum analysis of withspace sound during jump from Cass-Z?)
To The parent's grief, the lover's wore, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. = ?Where? (Here comes the link to Astrophel, either to the Philip Sidney's one, or to Edmund Spenser's one)

Can someone screenshot exactly how that pledge is spelled in Codex in english?

It could've just been me, but witchspace seems very different near Heart and Soul - more moving green spots and odd noises.

Don't know what a wov is. Sonnet 19 describes the frustration Sidney feels when he attempts to make clear his love for Stella in words, which is a form of woe, I think.

wore = woe, I misspelled, sorry. I wrote the toast from memory, but I believe I wrote it just about perfectly. I'll be playing Elite later, if you want a screenshot.
