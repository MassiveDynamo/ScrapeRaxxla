Strange as it may seem, "To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void" sounds like Thargoids to me.

"the whisperer in witch-space" - Thargoids are the only thing we know of that can navigate witch-space (able to pull players out of hyperspace)
"the siren of the deepest void" - Far more of a stretch, but the sounds they make could pretty adequately be described as a siren of a deep void.
