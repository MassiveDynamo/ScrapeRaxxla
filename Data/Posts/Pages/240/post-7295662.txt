Has it been noted, that the Codex entry regarding Universal Cartographics contains a strange ,,mistake''? The written text says, that Universal Cartographics arose from a merger of Omphalos Infotech and Devaine-Bright Interstellar. The speaker reads instead ,,Unified Infotech'' - in every occasion, where the word ,,Omphalos'' is written. It seems, the ,,mistake'' is quiet systematic. Alas, I have no idea, what this should mean :-/

[Update] typo ;-)

Omphalos - a religious artifact - in ancient Greek meaning navel. In Greek lore Zeus sent two eagles across the world... (sound familiar)...

Agreed simply a typo....

There is of course a real children's story: Stella Princess of the Sky; Marie Louise Grey. There are so many interpretations.

As time goes on I'm more inclined to hope the intro to the Codex is just that, I'd hate to think Raxxla could be found just by figuring out a series of pen and paper puzzles.

I may never tire of this tinfoilery but if I do the DW wheel missions activation is next on my priority, as with the older missions, I hope their the primary and more fulfilling journey.
