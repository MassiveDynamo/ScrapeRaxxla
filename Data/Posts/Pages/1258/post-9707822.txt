Remember that time in the real world when Scientist discovered a system that could support life in the universe and Frontier Moved their system 5ly over that had nearly the same suitable planets in it, so it would match up to the real world?

Not every thing is going to be in a Codex or on the Fandom Wiki.

oi......

If that were the case in this case, the wiki would then be updated to match the changes, and at very least EDSM would update as soon as the new information was downloaded from a user's logs.....

So yea.... stop trying to take real world specifics, and force them into the game where they arnt. There's enough CMDRs watching constantly, that if they changed the system, we'd know within days, and information on sites would be updated
