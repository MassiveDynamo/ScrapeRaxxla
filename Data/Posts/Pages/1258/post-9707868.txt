Sure, I'll sort of agree to that. The colony changed its name, separated from earth, ect.

The planets, tbh, I don't know know if their names were changed in the lore during that time, off the top of my head.

But that information should be on the ED Fandom wiki link I posted. It has most of those Tau Ceti details.

But that information on the link I sent, is 1000x more accurate to "in game" lore than the wiki links you sent, is the point.
Just because you can find differences between RL and ingame names of planets, is nothing new, there's lots of stars and planets that don't use their RL names because the game needs them to match with other lore information or because the names were already uses in previous Elite games

And we already know that the old systems from the first game have been placed in a similar location to each other in Elite Dangerous.

All i9m saying, is that I don't think we can discredit RL information as Frontier, DB are very specific on the accuracy of their simulation.

It seems to be an avenue that hasn't been explored, im that's what im going to do.
