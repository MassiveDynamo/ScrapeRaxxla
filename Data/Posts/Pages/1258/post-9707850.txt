Are we agreed that the game is accurate to star systems around us? So therefore real world data has been used and can be considered canon to the development of the universe in the game?
No.

I'll agree in SOME CASES, yes that MAY be true, but absolutely not for 100% of the stars we've actually discovered and have information on exoplanets on IRL.

Fdev absolutely does not change or add EVERY star that we discover more information on, constantly, since day one of developing. Only in cases they want too and that they have a valid reason too
