You just made my point.

If they changed Tau Ceti since beta, they'd tell us or we'd see evidence of it.
Not too mention, IF they changed it isn't the point you were making, the point you were making was that they DID change it, and you used info from a random wiki source to imply they chose to change it from that, when that's not the case. That wiki you used has nothing to do with the game at all, is what matters.

Use EDSM, EDDB, INARA, or the ED Fandom wiki, anything outside of those, isn't "in game" information as you suggested.
