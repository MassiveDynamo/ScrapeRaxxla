found my definitive answer for you; my last word on the topic;

"Within the virtual galaxy, the player can explore some 400 billion star systems complete with planets and moons that rotate and orbit in real time, reflecting dynamic day-night cycles.[30][31] Around 150,000 of the game's star systems are taken from real astronomical data,[32] while a few partially fictional planetary systems, which were created in Frontier and First Encounters before a significant number of exoplanets were discovered, are carried over. For example, none of the gas giants of the Fomalhaut system correspond with the detected properties of Fomalhaut b."

while some additional systems may have been changed/updated ect since launch, they do not change every star system that is discovered over time, to be different from what the game generates procedurally, as we have many more than 150 000 stars and their locations and types in out intrnl' databases IRL.
what maybe should also be noted is though, is a quote i found from David Braben himself in a NY Times interview, â€œIn the game, every single star in the real night sky is present, some hundred and fifty thousand of them, and you can visit each one. "
so it could maybe, possibly, be taken that the stars we can physically see in the night sky from earth, aprox 150000, are the ones they update/change if more/new information is discovered, as it would contribute to the base system of the SOL sky being 100% accurate then.... but even then they would still have to very careful of moving/changing any system that effects existing lore, galnet articles, storyline, ect...

anyways...
yea, i think names in game vs RL need to be very specific for a reason to tie them into the game, just a passing thought of, oh these dont match RL, isnt a real reason to be like, oh theres a reason for this to not match, its likely just not a system thats monitored to match perfectly or has some ingame content somewhere that caused the naming to be different from RL...
