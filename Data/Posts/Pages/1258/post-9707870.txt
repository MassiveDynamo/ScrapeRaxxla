The only name change I can find in the actual lore was the name change from

Tau Ceti 3, to Taylor Colony

But again, that would be lore related changes.
The Stellar forge and the naming scheme used in game by humanity, would have originally called the place Tau Ceti 3, and then yea...


I think the fact that IRL Tau Ceti names the place "Tau Ceti C" or "Zeus", is similar.
C or 3, same thing.
In game the used Taylor Colony instead of Zeus because of in game lore reasons
