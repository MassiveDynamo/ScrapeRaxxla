Pretty sure they're saying what I'm saying, that you're using planets/information from a place that isn't ingame information and can't be trusted.

You can surely assume it if you choose, but its only conjecture and not in game fact if it doesn't match what is actually in game, lol, it's that easy
Are we agreed that the game is accurate to star systems around us? So therefore real world data has been used and can be considered canon to the development of the universe in the game?
