I'm not saying that FD have people sitting at a computer making changes every time a new bit of information comes out to suit the FD galaxy. I do however find it interesting that systems from the previous games were compressed into a similar area in the spatial region. Not saying anything other than just that. However, they are keen on keeping the simulation updated as much as humanly possible, if only for the reasons of making them looking good in the gaming press and scientific journals for the simulation they have going.

I haven't come in to this blind either. I have been playing Elite for a long time. Still have a copy of Elite on the Spectrum, and Fronter on the ST.

Im the kind of person that thinks outside the box. If that's a problem, then so be it.
