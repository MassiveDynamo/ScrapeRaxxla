You also have to remember the Raxxla lore, was written by only a select few ppl, and was a forbidden topic to even writers like Drew W.

So, whom ever wrote the lore for Tau Ceti's contents of its system, may have had no knowledge of anything to do with Raxxla.
Most likely 99.5% of all the names and lore in game have nothing to do with Raxxla in any way, and the ones that do, may not even know that they do if MB and DB did a good job of taking their writer's work and using that to make Raxxla without their knowledge
