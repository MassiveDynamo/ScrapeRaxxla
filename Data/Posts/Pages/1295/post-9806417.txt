I don't think Raxxla is a big deal. It's more likely to be an Easter egg. Sort of like a tombstone for Robert Holdstock. As far as I know, RH doesn't have a memorial stone in ED. But that's not really the point with Raxxla. It is far more important to me how Raxxla should be found. The way we have to find it should be something big, difficult, interesting or just beautiful. a challenge to our brains. (Just thinking about it the mother of the galaxies in ED is actually the human brain)
