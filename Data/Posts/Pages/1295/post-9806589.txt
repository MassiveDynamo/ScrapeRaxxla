Yep, Ive been pushing that it’s an Easter Egg for a long time.

Preferably about a foot in diameter, dark chocolate, 75%+ cocoa solids

With a tiny lizard person inside!


Not so sure it’s a tribute to Holdstock though, perhaps only loosely. Otherwise it would have to be a planet (from TDW novella), and FD have taken pains to say we don't know what it is, which implies it is not a planet.
