Need a small favor from the explorers around here... wanna do some tests myself on my alt account...

Please, if someone knows a regular system, any reachable system, really close to a locked region... preferrable less than 2ly apart, post here the system name... wanna fly there to see if I can force jump to the locked region.

Thanks in advance!
Nothing happens, you’re still just in an instance of the system you jumped into.

(Well you do get to experience some extreme Supercruise acceleration and deceleration when speeding up and slowing down so far from a gravity well, which is kinda fun!)

Edit - nothing wrong with giving it a shot yourself though. Don’t forget to switch off all non-essentials to conserve fuel while on the journey.
