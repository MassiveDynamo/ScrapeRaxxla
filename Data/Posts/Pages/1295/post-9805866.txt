If my alt account gets banned, so be it... I'm not trying to hack anything, just use different methosd to perform the jump in question, also carrying several "special items" in the cargo hold.

Again, anyone that knows any reachable system, really close to a locked region... preferrable less than 2ly apart, post here the system name... wanna fly there to see if I can force jump to the locked region.

Thanks in advance!
Synuefe LX-F a24-1 is 2-3 ly from Col 70 Sector SX-G a74-0
maybe even closer
Synuefe CV-A a27-1 to Col 121 Sector EG-W a50-0 maybe <2ly
even better imo
Synuefe ZK-H a37-0 to Col 121 Sector AW-C a61-1 is 1.83 ly
