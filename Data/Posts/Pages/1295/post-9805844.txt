Mmm, that rings a bell...
Now what was that CBeebies programme for kids where the guy & gal were randomly chosen to dress up and act out a part? Used to watch it with my granddaughter...
Mmm, perhaps I should investigate a Lizard Person suit for the 4-year old grandson!

CBeebies ‘Let’s Play’ - favourite of my kids too… Rebecca Keatley.. oh dear…
