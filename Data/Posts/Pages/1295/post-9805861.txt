Don't try that. Even if you successful get in one of those Systems you most likely get banned.
I tried in the past, to jump through a blackhole that was in a locked System but the start and end of the jump are not. so the BH was right in between them. Since nothing interesting happend after like 50 tries i forgot the systems involved. the Start had a Neutron but is was like 20k ls away from main Star. and i had a 10 Jumpo way back to try again because the locked Region was in the way. somewhere near the COL70 where several regions are locked. some have like holes in them so you can jump Neutron jump from a non permit system to another but the jump itself goes straight through that permit locked region.
If my alt account gets banned, so be it... I'm not trying to hack anything, just use different methosd to perform the jump in question, also carrying several "special items" in the cargo hold.

Again, anyone that knows any reachable system, really close to a locked region... preferrable less than 2ly apart, post here the system name... wanna fly there to see if I can force jump to the locked region.

Thanks in advance!
