IMHO the thing that is most likely to be relevant to Raxxla is the fact that there are 3 or four cliques within the PF with slightly different spellings (see my previous post) which only became apparent on attaining Elite and reading the Tourist Beacons within Shinrarta Dezhra, which is controlled by PF! Getting there is very definitely a “personal journey”. These minor spelling differences could fit MB’s “you have to make things a tiny bit obvious so people know what they are doing”. We know from the lore (SD TB #250 clearly states this) there are several cliques within PF and one of them is TDW). We know these cliques exist in-game: you get Allied with “Pilots’ Federation Local Branch” by running missions for them in SD, and quite separately with “PilotsFederation” by killing goids/rescuing passengers from damaged stations). What is worrying is that FD have corrected those various TB spellings in SD, after we discussed them in this thread.

We are being watched, facts are being obfuscated, The Club is real!!!

Jorki... any idea why the Pilots' Federation Local Branch is in control but no influence and not a minor faction in the system as far as I can see.... have I missed something?
