Well, it is only logical. They need founding raxxla to make a big splash. They will have someone who will make it a headlines after finding Raxxla. Maybe even they will have someone find it live during a stream. Defiantly they don't want a person who will find raxxla to be just some regular joe who may not even taken a pic of it or post it as a news or wont make a story out of it how he/she did it. Like I said, they will have someone finding raxxla who will make a headline out of it like they expect this event to create. Then we regular joes will be allowed to go see it.

p.s. sorry for being party pooper.
