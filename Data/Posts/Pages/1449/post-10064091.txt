As David Braben clearly said “but you don’t know what it is”, clearly emphasising the “what”. So it may well not be a planet or moon.

Another point that adds to Raxxla not actually existing in the game. Over the years, I've heard so many conflicting statements from writers, devs, other employees, that it becomes hard to believe anyone of them actually knows what they're talking about. You know when this happens? When people lie about something without agreeing on a shared narrative beforehand.

So don’t expect finding Raxxla to be as easy as just dropping into a system and scanning it.

No one expects it to be easy. People have combed nearly the entirety of the populated bubble, including asteroid belts, looking for anything anomalous. The most probable solution is, again, it simply doesn't exist is nothing more than an elaborate strategy of binding customers to the product. Neatly written and well executed, but that's about it.
I expect it to either not exist or be so underwhelming that they manipulate the difficulty of finding it as they go, to not lose face or face a poopoostorm.
