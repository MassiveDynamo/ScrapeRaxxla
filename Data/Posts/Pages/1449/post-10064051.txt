The percentage of discovered systems in the milky way doesn't mean anything in the context of Raxxla, as they wouldn't place it around a proc generated Y dwarf named xyz sector xy-z b12-1.
“Wouldn’t place it around a proc generated Y dwarf”

Why not? That is a pure assumption...I agree it ought to be in the close bubble (from the early first rumour report date), but it could be anywhere.

Why “around”? That assumes it’s an orbiting astronomical body. That is also pure assumption. As David Braben clearly said “but you don’t know what it is”, clearly emphasising the “what”. So it may well not be a planet or moon. It could be any bodytype within the game, see the players journal spec for the range of possible values (& that’s assuming FD have told us all the valid bodytypes in that spec release. edit: might also be an NPC,
perhaps the one friendly Thargoid??). The old “planet with an alien gateway to other universes” phrase by Robert Holdstock in the 1982 “The Dark Wheel” novella cannot apply, because we have been told by DB and MB that FD only implemented one universe. And it would be a bit of a cliche which I doubt. Moreover we are told in the Codex that TDW is rumoured to have a hidden space station; that may or may not be true regarding TDW (whoever they are) but it is highly suggestive that FD consider that to be a valid way of obfuscating an object in-game. We have seen a megaship that wasn’t detectable by scanner or FSS until you drop into the asteroid cluster where it is located. So don’t expect finding Raxxla to be as easy as just dropping into a system and scanning it.
