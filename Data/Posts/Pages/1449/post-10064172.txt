there is the nuenets system (near shindez) supposedly harboring dark secret. maybe we need a dark organization to uncover the dark secret? perhaps a certain dark wheel, that is in neihgboring systems? so perhaps the first step would be to expand dw?
relatively simple. with an igname hint. requires grinding. could this be how fdev is doing things?
I believe it was tried at least once. Expanding DW into Nuenet and other systems, as well as the opposite. It's a good idea, certainly, because some permit and mission giving systems work that way, but iirc it didn't result in anything.
