How much of the galaxy has been discovered? In 8 years, only one twentieth of one percent.

I think you're premature to claim we would have found Raxxla yet by chance.

It has also been confirmed as definitely in game by at least two of the original developers.

I take your point.

If we take it from the point of view of the sheer size of the galaxy and its percentage of undiscoveredness (is that a word? ) then I concur.

However, if we view it from a game perspective, 8 years is an awfully long time. Would they tuck Raxxla away in some obscure part of the galaxy and give extremely tenuous clues as to its whereabouts? Perhaps the idea is that we'll never find it so the game doesn't have it.

But maybe it's time to doff the tin foil hat and start getting involved in the search...
