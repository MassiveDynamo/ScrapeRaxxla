“Wouldn’t place it around a proc generated Y dwarf”

Why not? That is a pure assumption...

They wouldn't place it around a proc generated Y dwarf to be found by pure chance. As the probability to be found would be less than Earth being hit by an asteroid in the years since the game released.

early first rumour report date

The rumors about Raxxla are as old as spacefaring itself, canonically speaking. Means that it's either just a myth and doesn't exist, or it's really close to Earth/Sol.

could be anywhere

"Could be anywhere" equals "Isn't anywhere". You don't put company time in something random that will never be found, unless it's so easy to implement and so underwhelming that the prospect of finding it becomes uninviting.
