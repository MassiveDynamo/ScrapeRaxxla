This has always been my thinking, the clues or even access to it may be in game but not the place/thing itself, for me this is something Fdev would want to control.

I don't think I've posted on this thread before and I certainly haven't read it all, so I can't comment on what everyone has found out so far - the research done here is quite astounding so kudos to all for that!

However, it seems to me that Raxxla is just a rumour without substance. It's been eight years since this thread started and it still hasn't been found. I know space is big etc. but... I just have this nagging feeling it's a wild goose chase despite being told Raxxla is real.

I would be over the moon to be wrong though.
