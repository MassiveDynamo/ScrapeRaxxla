If you're going to accuse them of lying, you should just leave this thread really. You won't convince others of Braben's dishonesty, and hose who want to actually discuss the possible solutions to the mystery have more productive things to do.

Jokes aside, with all due respect, the last 1000 pages of this thread didn't produce any new ideas or insights into the matter.
