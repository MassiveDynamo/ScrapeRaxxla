However, it seems to me that Raxxla is just a rumour without substance. It's been eight years since this thread started and it still hasn't been found. I know space is big etc. but... I just have this nagging feeling it's a wild goose chase despite being told Raxxla is real.
How much of the galaxy has been discovered? In 8 years, only one twentieth of one percent.

I think you're premature to claim we would have found Raxxla yet by chance.

It has also been confirmed as definitely in game by at least two of the original developers.
