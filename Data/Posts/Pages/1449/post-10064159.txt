Scepticism is a reliable and necessary tool in testing bias. Many have fallen down their own rabbit hole, but many presume wrongly, that this is out of naivety or ignorance, that might be true to a certain extent but in many instances, it’s actually intentional the best we can do is give each other a friendly nudge and raise questions, this is called critical thinking…but we all need to accept our own biases exist and try and communicate doubts exist.
