Another point that adds to Raxxla not actually existing in the game. Over the years, I've heard so many conflicting statements from writers, devs, other employees, that it becomes hard to believe anyone of them actually knows what they're talking about. You know when this happens? When people lie about something without agreeing on a shared narrative beforehand.
If you're going to accuse them of lying, you should just leave this thread really. You won't convince others of Braben's dishonesty, and hose who want to actually discuss the possible solutions to the mystery have more productive things to do.
