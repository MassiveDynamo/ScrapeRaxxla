I have a idea but I need to know if Raxxla was introduced in to the game before or in Elite Dangerous. I played Elite II and Frontier:First Encounter and I don't remember Raxxla being in the game back then. I know Davis said, he had Raxxla idea in his head from the beginning but when was Raxxla actually introduced to the game ?
It was mentioned in the 'the dark wheel' novel that was included in the og elite. Not official in game until ED.
