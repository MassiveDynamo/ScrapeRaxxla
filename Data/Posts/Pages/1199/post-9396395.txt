First see several posts in this thread. Literally more than several tens of (probably >100) theories exist, none of which got confirmed.(many aren't even rejected, either.)
But all suggestions are good. What makes a suggestion better is 1)giving it (though incomplete) a reasoning, 2) suggest a way to test the hypothesis, 3) give it flavour.
Happy hunting!
