First see several posts in this thread. Literally more than several tens of (probably >100) theories exist, none of which got confirmed.(many aren't even rejected, either.)
But all suggestions are good. What makes a suggestion better is 1)giving it (though incomplete) a reasoning, 2) suggest a way to test the hypothesis, 3) give it flavour.
Happy hunting!
well...my reason to believe Raxxla can't just be found by exploration or scanning is Omphalos Rift. You can read in Codex that Dark Wheel already looked for it and from my understanding they may have general idea where it could be but you can't get there without Omphalos Rift. My theory, find Omphalos Rift go to Dark Wheel and only then, they will point you to where to look for that Gate way that will take you to Raxxla. This makes any sense ?
I know it is not mentioned in Raxxla Codex but any of you think Soontill maybe have something to do with all of this ?
