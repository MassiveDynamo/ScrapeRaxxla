well...my reason to believe Raxxla can't just be found by exploration or scanning is Omphalos Rift. You can read in Codex that Dark Wheel already looked for it and from my understanding they may have general idea where it could be but you can't get there without Omphalos Rift. My theory, find Omphalos Rift go to Dark Wheel and only then, they will point you to where to look for that Gate way that will take you to Raxxla. This makes any sense ?
I know it is not mentioned in Raxxla Codex but any of you think Soontill maybe have something to do with all of this ?
I think the Omphalos rift is on Raxxla. The active component of Raxxla, so to speak.
Itâ€™s likely that the Omphalos rift is the alien construct, that Rafe Zetter mentioned. At least they have a similar function.

There is a fair chance that we need another alien artefact to find Raxxla. Most likely, one like the Mars relic. Raxxla is described as a ghost planet and obfuscated. Finding it without the right tool could require us fly to the exact spot, without any visual or sensory indicators.
