According to EDSM Sag A* is located at: 25.21875 / -20.90625 / 25899.96875.
Cant you just move 25.2/20 in the galmap & see whats there/close then go hunt directly?
Is there a way of showing galactic coordinates when flying??
Or am I being stupid due to slow breakfast coffee?

Because if u look at the galactic center map Sag A is on it and most definitely not at the center.

The codex map and the galactic sectors are drawn around a circle centered roughly where i pointed out. We have been told to look for an omphalos… and given maps that point to a center other than Sag A…. Seems like it could be a clue to look there…

Ya im out there now - you can get a pretty good idea of coordinates just looking at the grid in the galaxy map

Still working on my coffee too… im trying to get a distribution of the stars in the y axis and then get a center that way… instead of hoping that the y value of Sag A is the answer… seems like there are more stars in the negative in the center … so expecting it to be lower
