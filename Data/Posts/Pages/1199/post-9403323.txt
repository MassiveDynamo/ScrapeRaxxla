Glad you lot are still at it. I pop in from time to time to check in on the "progress."

Here's a thought. Is Salvation the story arc that unlocks the Col70 permit? And then we get answers to the original unknown artifact and then does that give us a "clue?"

Or do we think Col70 is solely thargy and unrelated to Raxxla?
