Hasn't occured to anyone before that in order to reach the asteroid belt in Sol we need to "set the controls for the heart of the sun"? And the weirdest thing, I boosted for about 10 mins past the yellow fsd-failure barrier and didn't reach the exclusion zone. At SagA* I reached in around 2 mins. Wonder if that's a bug or a feature.

Also I can't shake the feeling that despite all the awesome Raxxla theories brainstormed here we're still waaaaay off the right path. Which in my opinion should at least have a few hints that we're getting warmer.

Anyway, it feels we have to tackle more than a saucerful of secrets here.

Have you worked on the odyssey code in the loading screen? I havent played with it muchâ€¦ almost looks like midi music though
