Will check it out. Thanks!
According to EDSM Sag A* is located at: 25.21875 / -20.90625 / 25899.96875.
Cant you just move 25.2/20 in the galmap & see whats there/close then go hunt directly?
Is there a way of showing galactic coordinates when flying??
Or am I being stupid due to slow breakfast coffee?
