Reading about the Eleusinian Mysteries, this seems more and more relevant. A trial that takes place over 9 days, with themes of 'descent', 'search' and 'ascent', with induction into the mysteries upon completion. A complex task, starting from Aganippe, perhaps, collecting certain rare commodities and also performing some other deeds: dromena ('things done'); deiknumena ('things shown') and legomena ('things said'). With a requirement for participants to be Triple Elite, those who complete the tasks could then be contacted directly by The Dark Wheel, as in given a permit or the location of their base to visit it for confirmation as described in the Codex. So which commodities need to be collected, what deeds should be done and where should they be sold?
Some possibly related rares, aside from those mentioned above: The Waters of Shintara, Eleu Thermals, Diso Ma Corn, HR 7221 Wheat, Wheemete Wheat Cakes?
