I've updated my earlier post with the full details from searching for the systems from the first 4 original Elite galaxies (I'm burned out for the moment, so won't be doing the other 4, especially when EDSM searches have turned up a blank) https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=7463488&viewfull=1#post7463488
I've included the names of all megaships and installations and, where I remembered to record them, the body each orbits.
How meaningful this is also depends upon whether these systems were included in FE2 and FEE. I think they did a straight port of the FFE database but had to change a few locations as the ED galaxy is wider than in FFE.
