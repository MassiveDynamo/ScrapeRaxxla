The Rares associated with them and the host of associations within the Aganippe, for me, are what captivate me the most.
Surely most actual named systems in game are randomly generated, but some in this story required a deeper investigation then just a name.
Demeter appears to not have much at first, til you look for her other names, likewise with Persephone and Nysa. Also the permit locks on the way are compelling.
This may be the "Investigator" aspect they speak of. Just my two cents.

I hope its like this (challenging and requireing investigation and effort) vs. it just being something FDev hands to us one day on a silver platter. A real mystery.
