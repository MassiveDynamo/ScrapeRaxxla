The 7 light year hyperspace limit was based purely on the amount of quirium fuel that the Cobra Mk III was capable of carrying. From the Space Trader's Flight Training Manual: "The ship is highly maneuverable, has a good C-holding factor during hyperspace transit, can hold sufficient Quirium H-fuel for a 7-light-year single jump". The ship was also capable of performing a Galactic Hyperspace jump.

I would presume that for other ships the jump range would be constrained by how much fuel they could carry. Basically, we don't have sufficient information to know exactly what that generation of thruspace drives were fully capable of.
Yeah, but my point was that those aren't the early hyperspace jumps, and I don't think Drew was saying anything about the actual early hyperspace jumps, i.e. those that took place in the 22nd century. (Though I'm sure Drew will correct me if I'm getting that wrong! )


We don't really know anything about the early days in terms of actual information about the drives and jumps, just what was achieved using them. (I'm not saying that to you particularly btw Jaitou, as I'm sure you're well aware of it, just more of a lead in to a further discussion.)

One thing I think we can safely say though is that they weren't Quirium based. The Quirium formula being lost with the collapse of Galcop means that it can't have been known to anyone outside of a select few in Galcop, which isn't really compatible with it being what was developed on Earth and used for early hyperspace travel.

I would also hazard a guess that the type 2b wasn't so much a new development as a reversion to earlier tech. With the loss of Quirium there would have been a desperate rush for alternatives and one would think that using old tech would be the most pragmatic option available.
