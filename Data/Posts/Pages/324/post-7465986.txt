Pretty sure Drew didnâ€™t actually say that 7 ly was the limit of very early hyperspace jumps.

When you read the original Dark Wheel novella you read when Alex Ryder did travel from Xezaor to Ciraq the jumps he did make was between 6-8Ly afcorse he was loaded with cargo
"At nineteen light years from Xezaor, the Nemesis had made two refuelling stops, and as they came into System Space they had energy enough for a two-light-year jump only. The nearest world, Alex knew, was more than twice that distance away"
