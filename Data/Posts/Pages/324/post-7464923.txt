Pretty sure Drew didn’t actually say that 7 ly was the limit of very early hyperspace jumps.

Not sure if he did or not as I didn’t watch all the video, but either 7 or 8 was what the limit was in the original game. (At 35 years into the past at this point, my memory is slightly hazy on whether it wa 7 or 8 )
