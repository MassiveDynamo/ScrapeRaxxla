This happened in 7 days exactly. After receiving the 20 courier missions from the bubble to Colonia.
Mind you several of those were not tip-offs. I'm at the point in the story (as I see it) that Alexander goes to the Oracle in the desert to confirm his true identity.
He followed birds to it. I went to Centralis and started at Phoenix Harbor. Saw nothing there. Centralis means center,
but also is a medical term for a portion of the lens of the eye that is defined as a deep depression where focus is the greatest.
The Siwa Oasis (Home of the Oracle in Egypt) is defined as a deep depression in the sand.
Found nothing at Phoenix Harbor. Went to the Phoenix system and found my first crashed ship, then a tip-off.
Went to all the bird named systems, and found 7 ships, +2 Unknown Wreckages. Only 4 of these were tip-off related, most were found in the bird systems.
The rest by going to systems affiliated with Alex and Greece. Finally finished scanning all Colonia inhabited systems and have got no jobs in the last 24 hrs.
I did missions (not much criminal besides smuggling and trespassing) and paid donations for everyone when asked at all times. These would lead to tip-offs at times.
The Bohmshohm reference in the Elite book Nemorensis references paying cash to a secret group to watch their criminal activities.
I don't know what to make of it yet. But I have been on this journey since the codex was introduced and have never had an experience like this the entire time.
Nor have any of my friends, or anyone else that I am aware of.
