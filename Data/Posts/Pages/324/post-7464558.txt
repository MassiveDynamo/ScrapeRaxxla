My question would be- are these names in game hand placed by FDev or are they result of an algorithm that compounds names and groups them together based on their connections to one another? For example the redudancy of a planet named Kore in the system Persephone.

The Rares associated with them and the host of associations within the Aganippe, for me, are what captivate me the most.
Surely most actual named systems in game are randomly generated, but some in this story required a deeper investigation then just a name.
Demeter appears to not have much at first, til you look for her other names, likewise with Persephone and Nysa. Also the permit locks on the way are compelling.
This may be a small part in the "Investigator" aspect they speak of. Just my two cents.
