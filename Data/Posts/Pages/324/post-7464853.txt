Far? probably not far enough for the advancement of at the time. Drew mention on his youtube if they followed the rules of 7 lys of the earliest ship that is proximity 51 jumps to Delphi from Sol which is 357lys away. Still possible there were a lot of dedicated explorers even before the existence of Engineers look at the Megaship The Zurara in Formidine Rift the last log is the best example which was also mention in Elite Dangerous Premonition.

You can't rule out the clues of Delphi as it has a lot of the clues interconnected with Omphalos. Even the patch itself which change that system into Delphi to the addition of the codex was made to set an example that everything is connected.

It was already mention that by someone that once there is no progress made to look for something FD kick tiny clues to push the story.

Exploration is and has always been a huge thing in humanity they would go far out into space looking for things clues that would lead them into something they could take credit for. it's human to exceed our abilities to do things.

At this point I been reading along the Astrophel and Stella sonnets with someone translating the meaning and describing what the sonnet may be about.

Pretty sure Drew didnâ€™t actually say that 7 ly was the limit of very early hyperspace jumps.
