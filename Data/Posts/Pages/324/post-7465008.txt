Firstly a big thanks to Cmdr Poet Starwind who initially brought this amusing alignment to light: an odd formation of 5 stars near Sol which spell out RAX-LA.

My initial interest was peaked due to a likelyhood of a Raxxla clue being relatively close to Sol, based on early exploration distances, a tenuous one at best.

Although I personally dont think its in the bubble and more likely its on the other side of nowhere this was as good a place to start than any other, and I had nothing better to do.

I also noticed that these stars all aligned in a spiral which unlikely as it may be, could be the fabled 'spiralling stars'. So I overlayed an actual archimedean spiral and there was alignment, there was also triangulation.

After a prolonged but entertaining distraction off Tau Ceti I decided I'd resolve this little mystery for science and for my own amusement.

Initially this meant scanning every system between those targeted areas, leaving nothing unturned, got a bit obessed with a void I thought I found, then I triangulated two areas from those stars and drilled upwards and downwards.

All of which heralded absolutely nothing. Albeit one tip-off mission, which was interesting as I hadnt had one of those in many moons but still nothing of note, nor along the archimedean line or withn two areas I triangulated. The entire sector has also been well and truely mapped by others.

Now there could in theory be something there which I missed due to sleep deprivation or which sat off the shores of where I was searching or even a crashed ship perchance, but generally even with the new scanners nothing really stood out as out of the ordinary.

Its been a hoot, one of many personal objectives I'm checking off...so there you go; another place where it probably isn't.
