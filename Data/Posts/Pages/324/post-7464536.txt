+1 to your investigative work.

My question would be- are these names in game hand placed by FDev or are they result of an algorithm that compounds names and groups them together based on their connections to one another? For example the redudancy of a planet named Kore in the system Persephone.

Another thing Ive been thinking about is what if The Dark Wheel station can only be found by dropping out of supercruise? We already know there is code in the game so when you drop out of SC for example to a Nav Beacon, a bunch of ships appear. As a result in addition to flying around the 8th moon of every gas giant I find, I also drop out of SC and hang out for a few minutes and check radar/contacts just in case. If the station is truly low power and hand placed by FDev there is no reason to assume it will glow like other stations, or even show up in SC.
