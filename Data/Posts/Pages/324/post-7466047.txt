When you read the original Dark Wheel novella you read when Alex Ryder did travel from Xezaor to Ciraq the jumps he did make was between 6-8Ly afcorse he was loaded with cargo
"At nineteen light years from Xezaor, the Nemesis had made two refuelling stops, and as they came into System Space they had energy enough for a two-light-year jump only. The nearest world, Alex knew, was more than twice that distance away"
Yeah, I know, and way back in the thread is my attempt to work out where Cirag should be in ED using the info from TDW. However, TDW is set nearly 1,000 years after the discovery of hyperspace and the start of hyperspace travel.
