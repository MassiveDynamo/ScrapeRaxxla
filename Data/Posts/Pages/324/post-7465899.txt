If anyone wants to get allied with the Low Profile Workshops faction in Bohmshohm, now is a very good time: they are in a state of both Boom and Outbreak and even though they don't own any assets in the system, they are generating many donation and data delivery missions and there are also missions in nearby systems to deliver basic medicines to them. Once your rep is friendly+, then you may also find well-paying missions to deliver cargo in-system to one of the bases on the moon Kaliash.
