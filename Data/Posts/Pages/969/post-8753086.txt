I’m currently looking for TDW station again. Looking at pertinent dates & making some assumptions:
Pertinent timeline (https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dangerous_Timeline)

2325 Federation lost Achenar war of independence due to extended supply line; therefore likely to have constructed a FOB station nearby which then became disused, spurned by the Empire and forgotten by most-then taken over by TDW?
2696 Galcop founded.
3125 Thargoid War starts
3151 Thargoid War ends with mycoid delivery. Galcop funds Project Equinox, an initiative that establishes multiple deep space monitoring outposts such as GCS Sarasvati to watch in case the Thargoids returned
3155 first Sarasvati monitoring log.
3172 Galcop declining. Project Equinox is shut down, despite Dr. Cassandra Lockhart's warnings that the Thargoids are sowing the seeds for their future return.

So I’m looking near Achenar!


@Rochester: nice summary and set of hypotheses there! My knowledge of Norse myth is limited to seeing Thor in the Avengers films...
So is Mimir the siren of the deepest void? In-game??
Odin= vagabond; haggard wanderer who relentlessly seeks knowledge
Frigg (possibly Freyja) = Queen of the Æsir (tribe of Norse gods, home Asgard) and the goddess of the sky (but no jewel?)
