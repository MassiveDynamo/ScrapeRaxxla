It would certainly make for a sensible reason for DW being in Shinrarta, and also the original requirement to be elite before you could become a DW member.

@Han_Zen/Simulacrae: When did pirate npc come into the game? Have they always been in, or was it more recently?
Pirate NPCs? They have been pretty much from the beginning i think... I still remember the gold trap that came out in the wings update?.... was all excited about scooping up some canisters of gold and the a wing of npcs jumped me.... was awesome... died so quicly.
