I've made some sense and progress on the toast, I have a start and end point and I think a time window. It fits nicely with all parts of the toast, its rather obvious and requires NO mythology or out of game content and requires you to travel for yourself for it to see it for the toast to make sense and reveal itself. Prepping ship for the journey, haven't flown this far into the black before. As the TDW is represented as legendary explorers and treasure seekers, both locations derived are uniquely note worthy and their descriptions in the toast are a match. Not sure what it will point to, Raxxla or TDW station, but excited to find out.

I don't feel like spilling the beans before I can post the results, but if you're near Sag A, bring your eyes!!
