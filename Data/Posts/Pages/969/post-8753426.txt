Pretty sure you’re on a hiding to nothing regarding “The Vain Queen...”
This was a clue by Drew Wagar relevant to his Formidine Rift mystery, intended to point people towards the Zurara. He has said several times he knows nothing about Raxxla, nor did any of the other authors (except MB) as FD instructed them to stay off the subject and kept it for themselves.

MB wrote the book Elite Legacy about the mining colony Freeholm in the Artemis system; didn’t spot any clues in there that might relate to Raxxla, or TDW.

Im going to have to respectfully disagree with you on this one friend. Drew stated back then on Twitter and Reddit that the series of clues resolve to “two separate locations“. One of the locations was The Zurara, yes. What was the other grand reveal?

Drew did say he knew nothing about Raxxla...that doesn’t mean he knew nothing about Soontill. He’s clever with his wording.

I keep saying I believe what we’re looking for is shielded and perhaps disguised out there and it’s probably Thargoid right? Try to follow along with me in one scene from Premonition that has a very curious moment. I’ll keep it vague and put it in spoilers.

SPOILER: SALOMÉ GOES TO CAMBRIDGE

Drew knows more than he lets on in my opinion.The author of “And here the wheel” even quoted Rebecca in a kickstarter comment. I don’t think they weren’t allowed to collaborate. Drew even said at one time that FDEV showed him something that would make your eyes bleed. Is the Zurara that crazy looking? I don’t think so, it’s nice yea but not eye hemorrhage worthy.

To each their own, I guess. I’ll continue to try from my angle and if others don’t agree then that’s fine. If we all share ideas maybe we’ll get sonewhere. I’m just glad Galnet is back, dissecting it has become quite the hobby.
