Several of us (come back Scytale!) postulated that MB’s Ygdrasil t-shirt and his tattoo might be clues related to Raxxla, although his website says its related to the storyline of his unpublished book, and is based on a mix of Cthulu (he’s a Lovecraft fan) and Milton lore. Yes, it seems strange that he went to all the expense of commissioning the design and pain of getting the tattoo & then didn’t publish it. My Paradise Lost-based hypothesis (search this thread) came out of that speculation. Fitted nicely, but didn’t produce any results. Might revisit it at some stage, maybe I misinterpreted something...
