KS Backers got an SD permit without any requirement for Elite....

When was DW in LFT 926 at the ground base, was it always there or did it jump out of SD? (and for some BGS reason I dont understand expanding from SD was made more difficult for the DW). Before TTW Mick and others, me included, tried to expand it from 926.

But was it there as an 'accessible' DW contact for non Elite from the start?
