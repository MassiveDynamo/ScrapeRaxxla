Sorry I know nothing about the city in real life. I could be reading too far between the lines I’ll admit. I still find the whole scene suspect. Admittedly the Cambridge thing was a stretch but the ammonia reference is still there and was my main emphasis.
Another thing that causes me difficulties is that I cant seem to find clearly explained solutions to all of those riddles. If I could find the explanations I’d let it rest. Is the Children of Raxxla site gone now? Any links I find don’t seem to work.
