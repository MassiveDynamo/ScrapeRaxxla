Im going to have to respectfully disagree with you on this one friend. Drew stated back then on Twitter and Reddit that the series of clues resolve to “two separate locations“. One of the locations was The Zurara, yes. What was the other grand reveal?

The INRA Bases in the Rift.

Salome goes to Cambridge. She thinks about why Cambridge is named Cambridge and deduces half of the name is due to it being by a river. She doesn’t solve the “Cam” part of Cambridge

Cam is the river, The River Cam. Bridge is self-explanatory. Im not following your logic?
