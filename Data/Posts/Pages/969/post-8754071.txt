It would certainly make for a sensible reason for DW being in Shinrarta, and also the original requirement to be elite before you could become a DW member.

@Han_Zen/Simulacrae: When did pirate npc come into the game? Have they always been in, or was it more recently?
Always been pirates in the game. At least in USS, rings and belt instances. It took some time before they started interdicting. Not much though. Even that was in the game early. Perhaps from version 1.1?
