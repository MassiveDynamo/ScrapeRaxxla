Looked at Canonn Discord, he posted a second picture of the Orion constellation that the named stars are part. The only trouble is for been the good star mapping, the planet need to be around sol to be see like that otherwise you can't recognise them. Since they fade (hope isn't because of the sun), is mean that the system is "behind" sol when watching the constellation.

This being Orion is just a wild guess. However, unlike most other constellations, Orion would be visible and somewhat recognizable from much further away from Sol, since most of it's brightest stars are bright and far away.

EDIT: However, colors for some of these stars don't match the spectral type, so it's unlikely to be Orion in the end.
