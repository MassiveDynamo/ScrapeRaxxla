My bad. Thought you were asking about the other 99% of my post ... forget it.
Happy to see you keep a good memory, despite all what you are used to say about ! You got me worried, Pa !

Ah, as always that MB “unclue” was highly ambiguous. Clearly we don’t know what we are doing! TDW is a feasible interpretation,and I would have agreed with it if the SD missions hadn’t disappeared. They still don’t seem to have reappeared so my interpretation is that they were deliberately pulled for a reason, & that reason is not generally understood within FD, hence some confused FD responses about their disappearance. This suggests to me they were not the route to Raxxla though something else related to TDW may be.

But at present I prefer my video hypothesis
