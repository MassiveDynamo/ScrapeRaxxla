This being Orion is just a wild guess. However, unlike most other constellations, Orion would be visible and somewhat recognizable from much further away from Sol, since most of it's brightest stars are bright and far away.


(from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)#Stars)

EDIT: However, colors for some of these stars don't match the spectral type, so it's unlikely to be Orion in the end.

Mmm, haven’t been involved with Canonn much since they moved to Discord.

I think the three galaxies in that pic are more likely to be usable for triangulation, so not worried about the star colours being incorrect. But on Scytale’s pic the names of the upper two galaxies are cropped out, hence my interest in the source. I gather this is your hypothesis with no evidence, but would be interested in what you think are the galaxies.
