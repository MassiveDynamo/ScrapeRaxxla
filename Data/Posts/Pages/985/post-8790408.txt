I go to bed, take off my tinfoil hat and think: What if the toast of the wheel does not carry any clue, but is a reference?
Reading a book about Salome, I come across many similar expressions with the toast wheel, which suggests that the toast is just a reference to her. The developer clearly said that there will be no tips, maybe we are trying to see what is not there.

the first line is about Salome itself, because it is like a jewel, the crown personifies the empire, the galaxy is the capitol.

the second line is that she loved to travel.

the third line is possibly a reference to Salome's entourage (I haven't finished reading the book yet).

What do you think?

I don*t think Salome and TDW toast are related, but we could see what @drew 's take is on this.
