Ah, irrational emotions triggered by random events; clearly a bad case of space madness setting in.

Look at the Celestial Bodies tab for that system in EDSM-it tells you the value of each one in the system.
That system value comes largely from 2 water worlds and 2 high metal content worlds that I suspect are within the habitable zone ( this is one of the reasons I like EDDiscovery -it shows the anticipated value for each body immediately on my secondary display).

However that system does have an eighth ice moon orbiitng a GG orbiting an MVa; have you checked it out?
