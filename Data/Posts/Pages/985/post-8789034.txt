Ah, irrational emotions triggered by random events; clearly a bad case of space madness setting in.

Look at the Celestial Bodies tab for that system in EDSM-it tells you the value of each one in the system.
That system value comes largely from 2 water worlds and 2 high metal content worlds that I suspect are within the habitable zone ( this is one of the reasons I like EDDiscovery -it shows the anticipated value for each body immediately on my secondary display).

However that system does have an eighth ice moon orbiitng a GG orbiting an MVa; have you checked it out?

thats why i posted the system name an eighth ice moon orbiitng a GG orbiting an MVa and no i haven't checked it out. like i said i am quite new i dont even know how to use neutron highways its impossible for me to reach yet and that fuels my space madness
Stuemeae JM-W c1-3318 is the system name for anyone interested
