by the way, someone tried to put themselves in the place of the discoverer of the raxxla? why exactly such a name, maybe there is still some hidden meaning? I had a theory that raxxla is a set of three elements of the periodic table, but radium (ra) is not in the game, but there is lanthanum (la).

there is also a theory with which help would be useful to me - but what if the installation of the thargoids is the raxxla, but at that time they found only one installation and by inserting three elements there, you can open the portal. and help is needed in identifying objects, what three objects can be inserted?
