B CARINAE

These days I keep my eyes open for "weird things" that might be a clue to Raaxla or TDW. B Carinae is weird. First thing I noticed about it as I was passing through is that it has no discovery tags, which is unusual except for "core" worlds like Sol. Then I noticed that it has a Federation allegiance, yet it has a population of zero. Finally, it consists of just two stars - no planets, yet it is a constant source of HGEs, which seems odd to me.

Speaking of, each HGE had a wrecked but intact fighter. Near the cockpit was the previously mentioned Planck constant. But since this fighter was in space, I was able to see other markings as well. These are: 1LAR1A-X and 3-R1K-A 4821. Probably means nothing, but then again, this is a company that hides clues in sound waves!

* same disclaimer as always: I'm late to the party, so forgive any rehash of old information found before my time here.
