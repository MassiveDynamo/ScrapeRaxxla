Was just wondering if Raxxla is indeed a place, or merely a map to the place? Could it be that the name itself refers to separate star systems, with the target point equidistant from all six? Would tie in with the Codex image, and have been in the galaxy from inception.
That doesn't tie in with the codex text which is as catagoric as it gets that:

"The earliest documented stories tend to agree on several points however. That Raxxla is a definite place, and that it holds a mystical secret. "
