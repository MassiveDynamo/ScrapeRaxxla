Someone on the discord noted that in the games manual it says, regarding our start in the game, that we have a note left to us from a “mysterious benefactor” who left us our starting sidewinder and credits on the stipulation that we made the cut for the Pilots Federation (everyone has). And that we shouldn’t ask too many questions about who it was who left us these things, but only that if we made something of ourselves (being “movers and shakers, something special”) that they may contact us at a future date where we would learn more about them. They suggested, and i tend to think the same, is this the challenge to be brave and whatnot mentioned in the Dark Wheel codex that would be issued by a hidden person, that once passed they would expose themselves as being from the dark wheel? If so, what could the challenge issued in the manual be? Seems there are a lot of pilots who have accomplished quite a lot, yet to our knowlage, no one has been contacted since entering the pilots federation by them.
