I was docking at Galelio at Sol and I noticed that I was picking up 2 signals, Human (1), Other (1). Nothing out of the ordinary I could see around the station but I also donâ€™t recall seeing that before... anyone know what the other signal might be? Maybe just an ancient probe showing up?
What else shows in the Nav Panel (or FSS) around the station?
