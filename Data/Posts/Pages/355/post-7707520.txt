Dear Raxxla Seekers,

this idea is surely not new. But when I searched for "main menu" or "screen" in this thread I found nothing, so please forgive me for sharing it again.

Ever since I have seen the two icons for Raxxla and The Dark Wheel (TDW) in the codex, I have to think about the two main menu background images for Elite Dangerous and Elite Dangerous Horizons.

The thought that Fdev could have placed those two iconic and ultimate goals right in front of our noses fascinates me. It certainly has changed the way I now look at the login screen.

One shows a golden Coriolis station above what appears to be an earth like planet (Raxxla?) and the other shows a dark (minimally powered) Orbis station in orbit around an icy moon or planet (TDW station?). There is also the SRV on a planet in the foreground. It is clearly far too close to the station, which would only be about 20km away. But of course this is not an ingame image but maybe a creation to give us some clues.

The star type in the Horizons main menu is a white one: O, B, A or maybe F. TDW Orbis station could orbit a moon which has another moon close by (binary or simply very close orbits). Has anyone taken a close look at Shinrarta Dezhra AB 2 h and Shinrarta Dezhra AB 3 h? Where else exists this combination in a star system reasonably close to the bubble (<1000ly)?

And another thought: Considering that Raxxla is probably not too far from the bubble, there is very little chance that its system is still unexplored.
