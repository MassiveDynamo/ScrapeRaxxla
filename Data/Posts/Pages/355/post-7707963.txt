It's happening again!! That is not dead which can eternal lie...

Lots of people have said that it happened. No one's ever been able to provide an actual verifiable source for it. It's a 'man down the pub told me' story. (Though I'm not sure if that translates linguistically or culturally for the non-Brits!)

The translation is “Fake News” or possibly “Unfounded Rumour”!

Now how the heck do I add a good emoticon in this new-fangled forum. Those provided are not as good as the old forum provided.
