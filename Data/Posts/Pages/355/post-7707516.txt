Welcome to the thread, cmdr.

My advice at this point is just to enjoy yourself and proceed with your investigations as you personally see fit.

Some stuff you might find will be new to some, and may well be old news to others. If it’s new to you then it’s new to you and you should have the fun of finding stuff yourself (where that’s practical).

Just be aware that there’s a great many mysteries, and not all roads necessarily lead to Raxxla.

Best of luck, cmdr. o7

Tks commander!

U are absolutely right!
Having fun is the main thing.

One thing im trying to see is if i find any guardian ruins in 2 close places to the bubble but well separated between them, if i do find anything of the sort at this 2 locations, then there is a couple more places i wanna go to, to confirm or dismiss the theory... if i do find them i want to draw on the galaxy map lines connecting this sights to see if a pattern appears, since my gutt tells me that Draxxla and the guardian story are connected, i wouldnt be surprised that what ppl are looking for is a guardian site, but not anything that we´ve seen so far.

I will keep my eyes open and if i see anything that even hints that what im seing may relate to this quest ill be sure to report it here so that the information can be processed.
