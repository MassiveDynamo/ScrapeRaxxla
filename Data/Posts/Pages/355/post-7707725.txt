That doesn't tie in with the codex text which is as catagoric as it gets that:

"The earliest documented stories tend to agree on several points however. That Raxxla is a definite place, and that it holds a mystical secret. "

I see what you're saying, but I am not suggesting it isn't a place. I was contemplating if the name of the place also suggests its neighborhood. Maybe the names of the star systems with Raxxla-place in the middle. The toast could give the chirality of the spinning stars.

Just one of many hypotheses yet to be tested. Perhaps we have taken the toast and inferred too literal a meaning.
