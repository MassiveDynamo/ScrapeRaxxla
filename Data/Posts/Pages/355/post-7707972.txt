That doesn't tie in with the codex text which is as catagoric as it gets that:

"The earliest documented stories tend to agree on several points however. That Raxxla is a definite place, and that it holds a mystical secret. "

The Codex may be lies
The “earliest documented stories” may be lies, or unfounded rumour (“fake news”)

Trust nothing! Nothing!
