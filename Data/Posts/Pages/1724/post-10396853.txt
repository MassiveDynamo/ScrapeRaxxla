This is the hole in the theory. I donâ€™t think any of the other garden designs are relevant. Simply because they are interchangeable, as in each station they seem to move about, this may be part of a procedural see?

I was stationed in one such tourist port and although the various gardens were consistent for that port, as I tested them by logging in - out over 24hrs, they were in a different combination in other ports.
I don't see any hole in the theory...I was just musing whether the content of the other gardens might throw extra information on the table, but if they're random then that suggests they may not be relevant, not that the theory is wrong.

The doorway at the end of the PL garden is, I think, common-pointing us perhaps to the body after the the ringed body with 6 hotspots, so OT Serpentis C & its asteroid belt, or Dahan 2 moon Wanderer or Dahan 3?

Edit
no, I think the solution is probably hidden in a planetary belt-we've discussed hiding mechanisms and that is an exceedingly good mechanism for FD to have used, so Will's comment may be valid (e.g. Dahan 3)
