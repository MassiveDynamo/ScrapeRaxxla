Yes, that might be the case. Just been looking again at the gardens in detail...so perhaps the purpose is to draw us toward the gate(way) we need to go through & that might be at/past the orbiting body after the ringed body with 6 hotspots? Perhaps I'm being over influenced by Will Flanagan's comment in the Educating Will-EXO livestream?
Honestly I think that comment was influenced by sarcasm.

In that video the player essentially says ( not a quote) “ha got you, we tricked you now weres Raxxla” to which FD I suspect replied (not a quote) “oh what a &£&@“.
