Oh, the use of the usual picture of Milton's cosmology for the left part of the PL garden is a huge clue...MB would have seen that and recognised it immediately, as did we once we got our head around the possibility of Milton being relevant to the Raxxla puzzle- that's effectively what the Codex is telling us with the mention of the various mythologies, lost worlds etc that you identified and mapped. If it wasn't relevant I think MB would have deleted that left part of the garden, therefore that's an essential part of the Raxxla storyline...it's the end part that's the killer!

Edit
re Prince Hermann Ludwig Heinrich von PÃ¼ckler-Muskau's (of "fernweh" fame) burial tumulus - I wonder if this is a clue to look in a mountain for a cave which is the gateway? I thought FD's game engine couldn't do caves, but it does the "Thargoid surface site" (mother ship!) mechanism room quite well...the problem with this is that it wasn't feasible on game release, but FD could have redesigned the puzzle on Horizons release, or maybe it was always intended to be that way?
