Well, here you go. Some uncertainty of Tionisla 9 C ring-think it's 6 hotspots but the surface scanner didn't distinguish between B & C rings so it's a judgement call.
Allowing for 20ly diam mini-bubble around Lave, with 4 bodies minimum and name a subanagram of "princessastrophelâ€¦":

Realised there's one system from my previous table where I hadn't imaged the 6 hotspots- will pop over & do that now


Edit:
also realised there are a couple of systems where the ring hotspots total 6 (Haritis, Carnsan & Heheng) - have piccied the latter above, will get Haritis & Carnsan after I've fed the copawlot, he's eyeing my left leg a little too keenly for comfort!
