Application of logic applies to a certain degree, but this is a game with limitations, and is prone to having it’s narrative edited. There is I believe evidence information was altered, which introduces the probability some aspects found in game could be archeological and their context incomplete.

This I believe establishes that we might not really be able to follow a logical approach to some areas.

This suspicion probably is why some Cmdrs may consider the Raxxla quest a folly.

But here, we are open to such abstract ideas, because I suspect many accept the above possibility. When presented with such intelligence gaps, critical analysis can be utilised, because even in such a limited environment, patterns and behaviour leave traces and to some degree understood, but one must always be self aware of bias. Such concepts may equally be totally wrong.

I am open to any ideas.

This hypothesis is based from my earlier exploration and interrogations, that the original path may have been paused. If that were true then it’s a possibility that a more complex narrative existed, and may have either been discarded or repurposed. If that were the case the context may be an unknown, and may not necessarily make logical sense, until the remaining elements are brought together.

If it is not true, then various aspects identified are obviously imaginary, but we might never truly know this, because FD do change things.
