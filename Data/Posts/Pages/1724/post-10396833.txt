ok, lunchtime coffee worked- gave me a thought:

the garden picture shows the "trees" (which we're hypothesising indicate planetary belt hotspots) equally spaced, however none of the candidate belts I've investigated have the hotspots equilaterally spaced, so could the offsets from that equilateral spacing be a clue to the precise location within the belt? I'm thinking of OT Serpentis and Dahan here!
