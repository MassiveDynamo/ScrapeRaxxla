Didn’t mean the theory was wrong just that the concept that ever design was relevant. But who knows they might be?

Still think the design is far too similar to be a coincidence. It’s been around for 10 years and none of us spotted it, it’s been under our noses all this time… I’m pretty certain it’s intentional.

For me it either identifies the body or something in its rings…

I agree it’s an odd way to employ a clue - but so is utilising morse code for aliens .

Still think there’s a tenuous link regards the design and the codex…
