What if the 6 points dont correlate to anything directly? Whatâ€™s the possibility they are just being utilised in the map to emphasise which body in that system is Raxxla is or is on or is around?
Yes, that might be the case. Just been looking again at the gardens in detail...so perhaps the purpose is to draw us toward the gate(way) we need to go through & that might be at/past the orbiting body after the ringed body with 6 hotspots? Perhaps I'm being over influenced by Will Flanagan's comment in the Educating Will-EXO livestream?
