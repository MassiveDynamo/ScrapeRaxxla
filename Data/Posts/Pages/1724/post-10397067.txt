Obviously the absence of such a mechanism must advocate that any references to mountains aren’t ‘literal’ but some esoteric naming of systems.

I think that it links back to Legacy and Hammers talk of Beaumont.

I suspect there to be some system/s or bodies under Achenar which has some correlation to a particular mountain/s. And it is this which is a being used to denote a passage to the Otherworld


Well I took a look

If you go down from Achenar till the bubble almost peters out.. There is a system called Jamalalam. Jamal means Beautiful. Alam has a few meanings which might be interesting. One is Straight as in a Pole, another is World or Universe... It is an Industrial system with an asteroid field .... And a Prison Colony called Tarter Asylum
