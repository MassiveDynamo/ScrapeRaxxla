just looking again at Ly Qing Jao's other gardens:
"Adam & Eve" statue is surrounded by 12 trees, they are reaching up with cupped hand (to pick the forbidden fruit?) so I think they're still in Paradise/Garden of Eden before their Fall.

station homing lights & end wall has 12 "petal" shapes & other details that I've not noticed before

In the right hand part of the Paradise Lost garden the rightmost circle stands before a gate..gateway to somewhere else? The next garden along accessed through that gateway shows a rectangular pool surrounded by 12 tall trees, and leads to steps up to a tall edifice- could this be symbology for the gateway (that we're looking for?) leading to the Empyrean/Paradise and God's throne on a mountain?

Must confess I don't recognise any symbology in the rest of the gardens, but I'm no expert in PL
