This is the hole in the theory. I donâ€™t think any of the other garden designs are relevant. Simply because they are interchangeable, as in each station they do seem to move about, this may be part of a procedural seed?

I was stationed in one such tourist port and although the various gardens were consistent for that port, as I tested them by logging in - out over 24hrs, they were in a different combination in other ports.
