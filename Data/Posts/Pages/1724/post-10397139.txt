Interesting. I think it’s one of my flagged areas of interest. I’m in that area right now. I had identified several systems of interest, but could not identify any naming histories, I had not thought of separating names into their components, good find.

There is a system in this area with an odd station name of Archangel Port, which although is not an uncommon name, makes me suspicious due to the relative proximity of the system Michel.

Collectively these systems are all clumpt together… feels artificial and hand placed. But nothing but a feeling at present.

There was alot of thought that went into the naming of some of the systems (speaking to the named systems in the bubble as a whole). I do like the idea of the Beaumont system as some sort of hint - and lets face it… of all the Authors, MB had the ability to make all the systems in his book accurate. But ya - no idea, i think Jamalalam is a bust. Made some recordings near the antennae - will check later.
