Interesting. I think it’s one of my flagged areas of interest. I’m in that area right now. I had identified several systems of interest, but could not identify any naming histories, I had not thought of separating names into their components, good find.

There is a system in this area with an odd station name of Archangel Port, which although is not an uncommon name, makes me suspicious due to the relative proximity of the system Michel.

Collectively these systems are all clumpt together… feels artificial and hand placed. But nothing but a feeling at present.
