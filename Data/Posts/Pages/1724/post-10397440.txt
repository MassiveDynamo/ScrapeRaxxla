Still think there’s a tenuous link regards the design and the codex…

Codex mentions Fernweh. Fernweh meaning: wanderlust, a desire to travel, a longing for far-off places. The word is thought to have first been used by Prince Hermann Ludwig Heinrich von Pückler-Muskau, a keen traveller (Wanderer). He returned to England in 1828 where he became something of a celebrity in London society spending nearly two years in search of a wealthy second wife capable of funding his ambitious gardening schemes.
Codex Toast: ends in vagabond
Vagabonds are Wanderers, who have a desire to travel...

In Paradise Lost Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden to wander the Earth

Dahan 2e is named Wanderer...


I'm leaning towards Dahan 2e or Dahan 3!!

Spent all afternoon fruitlessly hunting for TOHF; found two ships carrying them, their cargo hatches were far stronger than their shields and hulls!! Gave up at dinner time to go back for my Phantom with the Hatch breakers.

Really must get on constructing kitchen cabinets
