It's not. It's not even there. It's exactly where FD said it is. But it never existed and still not exist in the game as an actual content. For now it's just a myth.
The thing is.. for us Raxxla have only exploration value and nothing else. It's pointless for us to even keep looking for it. It will change nothing for us. Raxxla is not a miracle or some magic place. It's a best of sci fi genre. And if 3.3 really have what i think it should have to start this very long hunt, i will go for it just for exploration value.

You forgot to add the "IMHO"
