I think i know what Raxxla really is. Why it's a "place that is not a place", and real reason why everyone so interested in it's recovery. Everything about this "mistery" starts to make sense for me now. Even why it will never be found on galaxy map. And will never be possible to jump into this system. And it's not because it's permit locked. It's not. It's different.

And no, it's not in game. Never was. And not in 3.3 (yet). It's a start of a very long story about something that we are already a bit familiar with by now..
