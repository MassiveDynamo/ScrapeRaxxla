The symbol could mean anything. Or nothing until we find it. Importantly, we will not know until something drops. Either beta or live. I think it's also important to remember that "there will be no clues."

My best guess is that the codex entry will be a collection of the rumors we already know about. Actually discovering Raxxla (and knowing it, though that's probably easier with the new surface scanning tools) may still come down to sheer luck.

Yeah, I also think it'll be in-gaming the out-of-game info. Same with The Dark Wheel.

They're things that pretty much anyone who had the original Elite will know about, but no one who's new to things with ED would know about, unless they stumble across it on the forums/youtube/etc.
