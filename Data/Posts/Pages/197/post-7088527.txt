The symbol could mean anything. Or nothing until we find it. Importantly, we will not know until something drops. Either beta or live. I think it's also important to remember that "there will be no clues."

My best guess is that the codex entry will be a collection of the rumors we already know about. Actually discovering Raxxla (and knowing it, though that's probably easier with the new surface scanning tools) may still come down to sheer luck.
