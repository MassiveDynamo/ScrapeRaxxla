I think i know what Raxxla really is. Why it's a "place that is not a place", and real reason why everyone so interested in it's recovery. Everything about this "mistery" starts to make sense for me now. Even why it will never be found on galaxy map. And will never be possible to jump into this system. And it's not because it's permit locked. It's not. It's different.

And no, it's not in game. Never was. And not in 3.3 (yet). It's a start of a very long story about something that we are already a bit familiar with by now..

Wouldn't it be funny if in Witchspace everything, Planets, Stars, etc were different versions of themselves in 'normal' space. Some lifeless planets are actually habitable. Earth is a barren hellscape, and ammonia worlds are even rarer there then in "Our" space (thus to explain why Thargoids are so desperately looking for more worlds to colonize.

We may have already found Raxxla (Soontill?) but its a different planet in "Normal" space.
