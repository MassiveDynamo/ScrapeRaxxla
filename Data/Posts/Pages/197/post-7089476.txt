TDW seems also to be confirmed being that tiny little bit obvious thing. And now it has an official emblem. It is NOT a mere minor faction, in ED !!



Is that the Elite rank symbol ? Seems to confirm the relation: Elite Rank/TDW/Raxxla ?

"You should not consider the Dark Wheel a single organisation, gentlemen. How could it survive for so long if it were? The Wheel has many levels, many hubs, cogs, gears and spokes. It is more akin to an affiliation of organisations that share certain common goals. Interlocking in purpose. Consider yourselves now spinning on the outermost rim.' - Page 213. Premonition.

the Dark Wheel was never a singular faction, nor THE faction advertising in Shinrarta.

"Shinrarta Dezhar?" The Women laughed, her scorn plain to hear. "You think the Dark Wheel advertises on a station board in plain sight? That we need rookie pilots to drag a couple of tonnes of thrumpberry flavoring across to Hutton Orbital? A trivial ploy to keep the Founders off our backs."
