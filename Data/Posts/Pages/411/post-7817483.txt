There is news concerning the disappearance of Gan Romero on Galnet drawing a link to president Halseys accident.

I have been reading several Galnet articles from that time and noticed that at one point Daurtu Jet Comms a shadowy organization tried to get hold of Starship one debris. Were they ever investigated DW wise?
