Woohoo, we did it. We stole the data from right under their noses. Hah, take that you Empire scum!!

My tricked up SRV nailed those pesky skimmers, defence turrets you thought were invincible, and managed to dodge the heavy Goliaths fire whilst securing the data. Then I bolted, under fire, shields almost gone, and hull depleted to 15%, but I made it out of HIP 1742 and Ruthfoss Depot alive!

Now, lets use that encryption key provided by that mysterous stranger to see what we've actually got. I bet it's worth millions and likely a dangeous secret that'll change the course of the universe as we know it. Probably the latest Guardian tech, or some future ship plans.

{KEY ENTERED; DECRYPTING}

Yes, here is comes.

Wait, WHAT THE ....?!@?# I fought for this crap, is this some kind of sick joke? Mother ...... !@ They'll pay, they'll absolutely pay when I find out who this mysterous stranger is.

{SCANNED MESSAGE; Corporate Data Log: That's them - the Greenventure Group. I know they have a reputation for being environmentally friendly but they ain't. Three of the systems they terraformed last year had rare flora and fauna that they just wiped out to make way for colonisation. I have all the evidence I need. This is the big one - this is gonna make me rich...}

(the sound of smashing lavian brandy glass is recorded)

Well not unexpected, it's the same as previous scanned message results. I did learn a lot about ground installation infiltration and scanning though and had a great time doing it!

So back to data mining TDW and rank Founder/Elite missions I go to see if they're ever duplicated!

Fly Dangerously.
