SPOILER: THE EYE OF RAXXLA

Rays, or even crossroads of a sort? Since Hecate was associated with three-way crossroads in particular?

From Wikipedia: "Cult images and altars of Hecate in her triplicate or trimorphic form were placed at three-way crossroads"

I'm hesitant to associate Hecate with Raxxla directly, assuming Raxxla is some sort of ancient alien construct that should have no relation whatsoever to Earth mythology. However, lore-wise, since the Raxxla representation image was likely created by humans (or the Dark Wheel), then there could definitely be a connection.
