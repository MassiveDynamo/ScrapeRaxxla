Hang on a minute! How old is this quote? Who made the quote? I can't believe that Frontier would tout this mystery, and then turn around and say something like 'well, if Raxxla is found, all well and good - but the content for Raxxla isn't going to be there for a few more years...'! How stupid would that be?

Hi Spaceace,

I'm a bit confused If you're referring to the comment at the top of the page where you linked my post from, or my actual post? The post was from Starbrow about the timeframe, and I don't think it was a quote more a lament.

My comment was directed at a quote which was from Drew's book as per below:

"Jorki Rasalas said:


Don’t know where you got “19....” from. The correct quote is:

“The truth is far more subtle than they will ever suspect. Shinrarta is merely a front.’
‘So …?’
‘You should not consider the Dark Wheel a single organisation, gentlemen. How could it survive for so long if it were? The Wheel has many levels, many hubs, cogs, gears and spokes.”
“It is more akin to an affiliation of organisations that share certain common goals. Interlocking in purpose. Consider yourselves now spinning on the outermost rim.”

Excerpt From
Elite Dangerous: Premonition

I subsequently discovered the 19 from an earlier thread post was a copy from the PDF which the page number aligned co-incidentally between the text across pages and it transferred when pasted, causing some confusion.
