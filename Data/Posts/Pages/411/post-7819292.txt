Did you take any pics? Maybe it looks like one of the videos with the station in it from the movies in the game file.

Also, how do you do coordinates in 4d? Maybe raxxla is a clue to a 4d coordiante instead of a 3d?

Also, notice that the raxxla symbol is the obvious hexagon. And how close is the Rhombic dodecahedron to the coriolis station. I'm assuming the are not the same because of the triangles. Or can you make a tetrahedron into one? If not what 4d shape can turn into a coriolis station. Maybe we have to look at the game geometrically and analyze it all. If it can be a coriolis station from what angle does it work?! And how does that potentially relate to the raxxla symbol mathematically?



Or is the coriolis a pentatope?

Or is this the coriolis station:


I'm assuming the original and subsequent games were based on this type of geometry. So, it might explain what everything is.

Re geometries, I think SAP-8 refers to the structure of the data crystal. Square Antiprism (SAP) the eight refers to the number of points.
