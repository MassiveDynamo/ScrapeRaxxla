There is news concerning the disappearance of Gan Romero on Galnet drawing a link to president Halseys accident.

I have been reading several Galnet articles from that time and noticed that at one point Daurtu Jet Comms a shadowy organization tried to get hold of Starship one debris. Were they ever investigated DW wise?

I think the implication was that corporation was attempting to gather any evidence in order to cover up sabotage. Seem to remember some player tried to dig into them but cant remember any outcome. It would be on archived threads if you can find them.
