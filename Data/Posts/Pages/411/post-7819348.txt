I did a bit of hypothesising and searching last year based on the old mission phrasings. Check out https://forums-new.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-7137584

The only thing I can come up with for "Place that isn't a place" is :
".....The ship drifted in 'Witch Light', in the non-place in space and time......"

This is from the original Dark Wheel novella released with the original Elite...
In the BBC version of elite (i don't know about other system versions) you could actually force an exit into witch space whilst hyperspacing.

i'd also like to add (and may be completely useless info, but..) there is a lot of assumption that R and the DW are in the bubble, and again, going back to the original elite, why do they have to be? we had Galactic Hyperdrives then, why couldn't they have been in one of those 7 other 'galaxies'. Granted, there was no indication of how many Ly you'd travel by doing it, but... thoughts....
