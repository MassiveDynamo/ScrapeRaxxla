I suspect Comms Array Delta 69 is just fluff hinting at Rogue AI (human), but the gravitational anomaly is intriguing. Hadnâ€™t associated it with Raxxla, but thought Thargoid ship-anti-gravity drive would presumably produce a gravitational anomaly. Perhaps they have produced human-looking AI fifth column infiltrators ready for the coming war and wanted to see if it would pass inspection??

Same here, long time ago I became disheartened by how much fluff is/was in game, as soon as you start second guessing intelligence because the source constantly spouts stuff which is unreliable you end up not trusting that source.

As I've alluded to in the past the general issue is the inconsistency FD has employed over the years, there are more than likely numberous clues already in game to all of the mysteries... but its time consuming to go chasing red herrings, especially if their fictional.

But dont get me wrong, I love a good wild goose chase, they've been fun, educational and above all kept me playing.

We swim in a sea of clues.
