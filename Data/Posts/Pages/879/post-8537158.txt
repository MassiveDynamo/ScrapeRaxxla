I suspect Comms Array Delta 69 is just fluff hinting at Rogue AI (human), but the gravitational anomaly is intriguing. Hadnâ€™t associated it with Raxxla, but thought Thargoid ship-anti-gravity drive would presumably produce a gravitational anomaly. Perhaps they have produced human-looking AI fifth column infiltrators ready for the coming war and wanted to see if it would pass inspection??
