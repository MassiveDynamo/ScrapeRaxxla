Thargoids don't need to produce human looking AI. They have collected live humans in the thousands. Slaves of all kinds, escape pods, prisoners, even Master chefs are scooped by our ammonia filled friends. They may of course only use them for food, but knowing the Thargoids, they are probably trying to modify them into something useful.
They even kidnapped by uncle from a remote farm in Wiltshire and left a crop circle while they were there
