I suspect Comms Array Delta 69 is just fluff hinting at Rogue AI (human), but the gravitational anomaly is intriguing. Hadnâ€™t associated it with Raxxla, but thought Thargoid ship-anti-gravity drive would presumably produce a gravitational anomaly. Perhaps they have produced human-looking AI fifth column infiltrators ready for the coming war and wanted to see if it would pass inspection??

I would argue that Guardian AI has been around longer is more advanced and has probably subsumed any rouge human AI out there. They dont need artificial shells... they just take over human ones. Like they did Halsey... And any one who believes there is such a thing as "fluff" is probably a good candidate for AI takeover... Are they in the Forum?... Frontier???
