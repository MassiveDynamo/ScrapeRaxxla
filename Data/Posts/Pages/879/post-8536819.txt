Even though I've given up on the hunt for Raxxla I still follow the tinfoil here daily. Thanks to everyone who keeps that going.

A legitimate wondering: A year ago a certain user posted leaked material of a 5 year Frontier roadmap that I learned about on Reddit. I followed up on that post not long ago and the leak is, short of covid-19 delays and such, pretty much spot on. The author of the post signs off by saying there is no Raxxla in Elite, and given the accuracy of the post itself I was curious if this has made anyone feel differently about searching?

Without having any in-game clues I've been forced to hunt for real life ones instead.
It's incredible how totally incapable most people are of doing any amount of research on their own, they'd rather continually misquote or intentionally deceive people by spreading false information.

The leak NEVER said Raxxla wasn't in the game. The leak was originally posted on 4chan on April 14th 2019, with no mention of Raxxla whatsoever. Five days later, on April 19th, it was copy pasted onto Reddit with two lines added at the end that were not in the original post. One about how FDEV is so bad and how they outsource everything, and the line about Raxxla. The person who REPOSTED it to Reddit with the two extra lines has no credibility whatsoever.
