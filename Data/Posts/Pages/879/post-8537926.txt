Thargoids don't need to produce human looking AI. They have collected live humans in the thousands. Slaves of all kinds, escape pods, prisoners, even Master chefs are scooped by our ammonia filled friends. They may of course only use them for food, but knowing the Thargoids, they are probably trying to modify them into something useful.

Could be an interesting next series of Great British Bakeoff!!
