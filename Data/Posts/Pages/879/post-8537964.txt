Same here, long time ago I became disheartened by how much fluff is/was in game, as soon as you start second guessing intelligence because the source constantly spouts stuff which is unreliable you end up not trusting that source.

As I've alluded to in the past the general issue is the inconsistency FD has employed over the years, there are more than likely numberous clues already in game to all of the mysteries... but its time consuming to go chasing red herrings, especially if their fictional.

But dont get me wrong, I love a good wild goose chase, they've been fun, educational and above all kept me playing.

We swim in a sea of clues.

Yes, I think there are loads of clues for many things in-game “for those with eyes to see”. But FD didn’t (& still don’t) seem to understand what people expect. They think it’s a game, with great visuals and sound, therefore they emphasise the visual and aural but it all seems disconnected. Gameplay was much more satisfying when there was an author (MB) giving direction and giving it some purpose. Really hope FD have learnt and keep an author team involved throught the next release, otherwise it will involve a lot of stomping around and leaning against corners waiting for something to happen. Cue George Formby voice, strums banjo,
“I’m leaning on a lamppost on the corner of the street watching a certain little thargoid go by......”
