I suspect Comms Array Delta 69 is just fluff hinting at Rogue AI (human), but the gravitational anomaly is intriguing. Hadnâ€™t associated it with Raxxla, but thought Thargoid ship-anti-gravity drive would presumably produce a gravitational anomaly. Perhaps they have produced human-looking AI fifth column infiltrators ready for the coming war and wanted to see if it would pass inspection??
Thargoids don't need to produce human looking AI. They have collected live humans in the thousands. Slaves of all kinds, escape pods, prisoners, even Master chefs are scooped by our ammonia filled friends. They may of course only use them for food, but knowing the Thargoids, they are probably trying to modify them into something useful.
