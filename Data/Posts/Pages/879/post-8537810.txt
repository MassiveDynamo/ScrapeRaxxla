The human signal source is the Fleet Carrier in orbit.
The stuff on the planet you speak of is just random encounters that happen on any planet.
I had crashed nav beacons, smuggling ships, landed sleeping ships etc. on the other side of galaxy
I was wondering if the fleet carrier was the signal. Needs to be moved - it's messing with serious research.
I kind of figured there'd stuff to be found there but never noted quite this much crashed stuff on one planet before.

In any event, it was an interesting jaunt. I'll keep track of this thread for a bit.
