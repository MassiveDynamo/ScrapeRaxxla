Witching space! These are real! Picked one up in Altair.Took like 15 min to spawn. Not sure what a military Imp Cutter was doing in a Fed system, but the Thargoid Worshipers lead ship is a Clipper. The ship had like 5 point defense equipped which makes things interesting. Awesome find Ilo. Are these new in 3.1?
