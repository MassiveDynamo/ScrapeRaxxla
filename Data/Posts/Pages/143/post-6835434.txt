I suggested a couple of pages back that we should try inserting SAP8 containers into a Guardian Data Terminal (at new Guardian sites). If SAP8 are storing data crystals then that might be the way to decode them.

You mean by dropping them instead of the acient relic? Mmh not sure how that would fit into the game mechanic. Of course the terminal yields data, but not data in the way we can read it. Only tech Brokers can read that data apparently.

Well we don't know until we try, right? Maybe we get a Raxxla blueprint
