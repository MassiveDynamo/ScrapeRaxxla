Iv joined the search. Loaded my Krait up with enough supplies and research tools to last me god knows how long... Any clues or hints or tidbits of facts would be greatly appreciated! Im going to start my search by heading to where those missions have you most commonly go. See if there is anything in the news sections. Im not yet elite in anything yet. (Though Im pretty close to getting elite in Exploration) so I cant exactly get to the Dark Wheel myself or do the missions if they still exist. Also, Iv noted that its really hard to comb through this never ending 190 paged thread for any new and relevant data.

Lots of speculations but no science going on lately from what I can tell! Please prove me wrong though.
