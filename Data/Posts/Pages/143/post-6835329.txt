My daka daka is not strong enough to get them from an Elite Military-Grade cutter. I know my limits, I'm happy to help tho.

Only now I realise that's not your inventory on the screenshot *facepalm*

Anyway, have you tried finding them in anarchy System in civil war state? Would make the "harvest" much easier.
