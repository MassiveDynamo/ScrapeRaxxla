I guarantee you somebody has found the gateway to Raxxla, is out there and either can't figure out how to get back, or just thinks it's a normal function of the game (ha!)

It would be funny if some player that just started the game stumbled across some off-the-wall **** and was like, "this is stupid...how do I get back to where I started? I'm done..." and never played the game again. Then, the next day, starts telling his friends how he started playing this game, Elite Dangerous, and how his experience was ruined the moment he flew through a portal. LOL And, for course, he wouldn't have a detailed/ planetary scanner, or didn't even figure out how to set the fire groups, and so never confirmed discovery on it.


[Edit]
Oh and that brings me to an idea. If we did find the gateway to Raxxla, and, inevitably Raxxla itself, it will be the day for first contact with the Raxxlan's since the game has been out. I mean I don't know how you put Raxxla in the game and not the warrior Raxxlan race themselves...who are said to like to fight. So when finding it, if you find the gateway, go back and get your damn Python lol.
