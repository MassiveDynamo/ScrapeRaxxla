Wow ! I have been looking for them since the last beta ! Thx !



Well, if you are interested in the ancient E/F missions and want to look into them... what about some elementary geometry ?
Plot the clusters where they appeared first, then the other three, look at the distances between them and draw your own conclusions [yesnod]

And if you want make me a favour, as soon as you reach Elite, get allied with TDW at max rep, then fly to Ticushhpaki (Peral) and Maryacoch (Chamitoff), note the rep you have with the commanding faction and the first speech of welcome before doing any mission for them. Nothing special ? I would like to know if anything changed since I did this...time ago. It can't obviously be done twice...

I'll give that a go after I finish meandering around the LBN 623 sector. The little purple nebula within ear shot of Sothis.
