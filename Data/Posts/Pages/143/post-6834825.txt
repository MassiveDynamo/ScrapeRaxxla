Are these new in 3.1?

I can't tell, but I'd say no. I recall the new SC ships as being part of 3.0, including the non-military courier etc.. There are other ships that I don't know if are new, like the 'gameshow master', the 'convict convoy', the 'prisoner transport' or the 'military training unit' but I found them yesterday in different areas while looking for the sap8

IIRC, Sandro called them: New piracy targets, and as such they appeared in the Patch Notes.
