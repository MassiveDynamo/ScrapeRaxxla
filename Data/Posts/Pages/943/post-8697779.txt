Worth a shot getting allied the two factions, I'll see what happens.

Cool! I was surfing through the faction list and thought, "huh...I think I'll dump some explore data tow both of them when I'm back." I need to fully ally with Sirius - Mining as well and may as well try Atmospherics and Catering while I'm at it.
