Has anyone ever tried searching the exact opposite coordnance (adjusting for Delphi being the center) of the Zurara? Sirius Inc is in with the Club this we known. If the Zurara were hired out of Delphi? The ship logs say there are others sent out as waypoints. They could qualify as eagles I suppose. 2 more in 2 other sectors that never have been found near as I know. We know TWD seems to hate the clubs shenanigans hence the whole Salomé message. And maybe finding TDW will help to find raxxla. Maybe there’s one the opposite side or maybe they would form a triangle with Delphi in the middle?
