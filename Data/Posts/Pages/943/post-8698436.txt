Me too. I tried opening and lowering scoop, too. Doing some Close Encounters stuff.

Thargoids used to have a rep meter, called "Imprint" but I think it is now hidden BGS. Feed them Meta Alloys! See what happens! Don't attack or get too close though.
Now I want to grab my type 9 and hop about with a hulk full of meta alloys until it happens again and feed the bugs and see if anything happens
