I’ve not had this happen before I’m jumping around the Pleiades and I get Hyperdicted. One tharg left but there’s a Basilisk just sitting here staring at me for the last like 10 mins. I thought maybe the AI just froze but then I went to move and realized it’s mirroring my every move. When I move. It moves. And only when I do. It’s just sitting here with it’s cockpit eye pulsating making weird beeping noises. Anything I should try? Is this common?
never heard of that behavior before. record it, this is new!
