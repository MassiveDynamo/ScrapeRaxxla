Dang you were followed by two I tried honking at it but nada. Wish I had something to have tried to feed it or some such.

Me too. I tried opening and lowering scoop, too. Doing some Close Encounters stuff.

Thargoids used to have a rep meter, called "Imprint" but I think it is now hidden BGS. Feed them Meta Alloys! See what happens! Don't attack or get too close though.
