Now I want to grab my type 9 and hop about with a hulk full of meta alloys until it happens again and feed the bugs and see if anything happens

I've seen people have 8 bugs show up...well, including the two that initially interdicted them. That's with dumping about 30-50 out. But I'd suggest doing it in lots of about 15...so they don't expire. I've got about 150 in my carrier, so I'll probably use them for that. Just don't tell AXI. . I figured I killed enough of them. I owe it to them.
