‘THE ASTRONOMY OF MILTON’S ‘PARADISE LOST’
Re-visiting my studies on John Milton and the Silent Song of the Spheres.

The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Astronomy of Milton's 'Paradise Lost', by Thomas N. Orchard.

An interesting read which has already expanded my understanding of Milton outside of the classical reading aspect and to appreciate it in context to astronomy rather than religion or Greek mythology.
