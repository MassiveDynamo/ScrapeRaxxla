I can't answer that question, but I can tell you that nothing happens outside the base when you insert three guardian objects (mine being tablet, urn and casket). I put them in, activated the structure, and whipped outside and back in my ship in under 2 minutes. Then I flew up into the outside center part of the base. I could still hear the device buzzing inside, but no visual effects were present from outside the structure.
Thank you very much. Your example showed that all 3 elements can be placed in a single game, so the question about observing THIS from the side makes very little sense, unless it is a time game.
As long as the sky shows you have time to do something, as in the Guardian bases.
