(Disclaimer : been in Deep Space for 2 months already again... that's about the time weird thoughts start being computed in my head )

Since a long time I've wondered about a System I've scanned a very long time ago :
EDSM - Elite Dangerous Star Map
The Galactic Positioning System of Elite: Dangerous at your service.
www.edsm.net

This was during my pre-EDSM era but I got 1st Discovery tags on everything in the System (estimated in 2015) - except the main Star.


I turned the whole System upside down, scanned and entered every single Asteroid Belt Cluster (+ fired Weapons at each Asteroid), checked the dark side of every Planet... nothing noteworthy found.
Now one question I always had in the back of my mind - but couldn't find any answer for :
Who was "Alpha Backer #2" ?
In my imagination, Alpha Backer #1 essentially would have to be David Braben himself. #2 I'd imagine must be one of the Core Founders of the early FDev ELITE Team.
I found this quite peculiar and odd (apart from the fact that the System couldn't be easily reached during the pre-Synthesis era - it took me two attempts, as my AspX build ended up being too heavy and I was forced to return in a mildly stripped ExploraConda.

One of the reasons this got a bit stuck in my head was the (in)famous and disputed sentence/rumor : "The System had been honked by a CMDR but not scanned"

So I wonder : has anyone seen 1st Discovery tags elsewhere from that mysterious "Alpha Backer #2"?

Wild theory of the Day :
If there's a trail of breadcrumbs (1st discovery tags) left behind by the presence of that CMDR, would it possibly lead to something interesting? What was one of the earliest Alpha Backers of the entire Game checking out there?
