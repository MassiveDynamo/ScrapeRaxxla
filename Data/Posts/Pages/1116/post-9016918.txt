Just out of interest. Did you discover any system and get your 'name' on them as #9? Did they update after when you got your 'proper' name or are they still there as #9? Just wondering if #2 never played again lol
I am unsure, i have never came across my first discovery's back then and due to my travel logs being wiped when the game went live I wouldnt even know where to begin unfortunately, however I haven't came across my number since but have came across my name but that could have been from a long time ago and cant confirm, i didnt do much exploration until near the end either anyways was more testing the powerplay and combat, I only took one long trip which was towards Bovomit cant remember how far I had gotten, The not playing again is doubtful, most if not all the original backers are very well still in game ;-)
