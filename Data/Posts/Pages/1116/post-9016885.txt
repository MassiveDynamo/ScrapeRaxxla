Simulacrae has a good map of this I think upstream.

Thanks - ya if i remember right the Adamastor was heading vaguely towards Barnards loop before it got called back to help in the coalsack. Also (this is from memory as im not at my desk) if you take the distance traveled from chuckchan to the listening post and add it to the distance from the listening post to the coalsack.... you get the approximate distance to the Witchhead nebula.... again im going from memory here but might be worth checking. Maybe the Adamastor and Hesperus were both heading out towards the witch head.... still no explanation for the dogleg return of the adamastor to chuckchan... maybe their navigation computers were fried.
