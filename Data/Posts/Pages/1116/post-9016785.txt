And on returning from Coalsack after collecting Carverâ€™s team and their findings her hyperdrive failed when at HIP 69200, which is NOT on the way to BLoop, but approximately at right angles to that route, back towards the bubble but missing the centre, so she must have been headed to another facility! So I think there are two Azimuth sites to be found, and one of them may have the wreck of the Hesperus after a Goid (Klaxian?) encounter. That may be more likely to be at the BLoop site.
Simulacrae has a good map of this I think upstream.
