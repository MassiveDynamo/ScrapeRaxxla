Good stuff. Too many big time storyline elements in Elite are connected to constellations, with great intention. The Virgo, Cupid, Venus connection also includes that Virgo has been depicted as Persephone and Demeter as well. Van Maanen's star is a star of Pisces. Given that you earn its system permit from Tau Ceti might be a good indication of Something.
Yes, I think If I finish this and don't find anything the next step may be a Magical Mystery Tour of each of the constellations in game, and visiting/mapping each system in them while reading the various mythology around each. I find the constellation mythology is similar to the Galnet about the Soontill Relics as well, about how early humans, if encountered separately, could have been seen as different species by aliens because of their differing world views, technologies, religions, etc.

I'm in Sagitta now and have noticed a couple of curious things, but no major discoveries yet. Going to take my time and map everything even though of course it has all been first discovered/first mapped already from what I have seen so far. Came across a couple of systems with gas giants and eight moons so far too, but not going to say which ones yet! Also, would a Y Type Brown Dwarf (which "range in size from the most massive gas giants and the least massive stars") with eight planets perhaps also count? Keeping my eyes open for parallaxed stations also in those situations.

And I already have the Van Maanen's star permit as well, from some time ago, conveniently.
