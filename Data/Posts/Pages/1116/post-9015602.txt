Who was "Alpha Backer #2" ?

Chris Roberts of Star Citizen fame? I know they (DB & CR) backed each others KS. After all, CR must have been playing something while waiting for SC.

I wouldnt get too excited until you discover something discovered by Gan Romero, its that trail we need to follow*

*but its not in game, I still wonder where that story was going or what it was linked to if anything
