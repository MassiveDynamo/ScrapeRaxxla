The disappearance of those Elite missions in SD still troubles me somewhat. It may have been due to a retcon, but Iâ€™m wondering if a game update obviated them.
My personal suspicion on this is simply that the actual rate of people getting an Elite rank far exceeded the forecast rate which those missions had been designed to tie in to.

Could be wrong about it being the cause of removal, which could very well have just been down to a bug, but I'd bet the actual situation is as per above, and a rethink was needed at some point.
