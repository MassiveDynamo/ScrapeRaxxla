I hadn’t spotted it either until your comments yesterday prompted me to to a quick search. I really need to go back to the books and do another analysis of the characters.

yes, it seems significant that many characters are clones: Elyssia, Rebecca, Salomé, Octavia, possibly Arissa, maybe the spiky-haired woman...wonder if there’s something here we missed. Could do with a timely comment from DW on this.

I think they are all the same model as Elyssia. The description of the old lady from Reclamation made me believe she was actually Elyssia, long before Premonition.
