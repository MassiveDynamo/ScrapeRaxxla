Out of curiosity when you went there did you try turning off your engines and seeing where it took you? The grav well was strong enough in my anaconda to pull me until I went 500m/s and seemingly floated to towards the middle of the two planets.

And I thought of something interesting. Probably been said before, but a place that is not a place from game terms could be an asteroid belt.(Are the asteroids from the asteroid belt in sol missing btw?!) Some stuff says it's not in game. I wonder if you just have to manually find it. 8)

And the alchemy gold symbol thing is interesting. I saw something that referenced gold but can't remember. Raxxla could easily be related to the philosophers stone.

And early I mentioned another thing near tionisla or something. It was the beacon about the partially decripted message and the thing about a women riding a giraffe. Has anyone fit that into the sonnets or found anything that could be referencing?



I have to finish scanning sol(just got the permit) and go out to KM Cassiopiea and scan that large star cluster finally. And visit a certain large red exploded star on the way. Not to mention the hot dogs near orion, california, and barnards nebula. Did anyone realize there is a stream of 2mass comming out of barnards nebula like how they go through orions nebula?

I'm assuming this is a glitch, but Jupiter when targeted tries to scan it over and over again..

Edit: Does anyone realise we have the power to control all factions fundamentally and hence all politics in the game... It's just kind of dawning on me. We can determine any factions influence.

When I first visited Sol the asteroid belt was in the wrong place according to RL. Seem to remember the system map showed it correctly but it was wrong according to nav panel in-game & I reported it to FD. Didnâ€™t visit.
