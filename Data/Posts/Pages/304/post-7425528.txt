You know what? I hadn't noticed that. I guess when I read Premonition I must have skimmed over that since I was so familiar with the short-story version. Thanks!


Elyssia was a clone. I think the best explanation is that the spikey-haired woman is a subsequent clone.


Given that Rebecca was not the person talking to Thorn & Lestenio, I agree.


Rebecca was definitely employed by The Club at one point. I think she was more of a tool not a member.

I hadn’t spotted it either until your comments yesterday prompted me to to a quick search. I really need to go back to the books and do another analysis of the characters.

yes, it seems significant that many characters are clones: Elyssia, Rebecca, Salomé, Octavia, possibly Arissa, maybe the spiky-haired woman...wonder if there’s something here we missed. Could do with a timely comment from DW on this.
