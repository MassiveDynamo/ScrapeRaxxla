I already left. And it's hard to get pics. Someone may need to go with a more nimble ship. The gravity well from those planets is pulling you even when next to the gen ship. (I have a low thrust high jump range anaconda.)

I let the gravity well pull me till I was like 200KM+ away from the gen ship(turn gravity assist off and it will start to pull you.). I wonder where it takes you in the end. It only goes a max of 500m/s though. so, it may take a long time for it to finish pulling you. someone would have to leave a ship adrift for a good part of a day or more. to find out. Preferably a cheap one just in case. Maybe it would lead you to something. I don't have the tools to do it atm.

Either no body left the gen ship.

They left and the gravity well overtook them.

They had sufficient thrust to get away and could be in any of the many landable planets in the system. Assuming those messages were take while in the system.

I wonder what type of ships they have and how much thrust. Do we know the escape pod or other ship data from gen ships?
