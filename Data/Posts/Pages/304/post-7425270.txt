The Odysseus ship definitely has the 6 bars and 3 outer lines in the raxxla image. One of the bars is behind the center pylon. It has the same 3 partial circles like in the system map reticule... I think this is a fairly good match for the raxxla image. and Odysseus fits the greek names and stuff.

The middle bigger circles are cut in 6. The outer ones in 3. Both with the 3 partial circles. And manh parts of it look like the circle with a dot. The whole front does. Where is this ship supposed to going. And do other gen ships look like this?

Edit: If you turn off flight assist near the odysseus you start to get pulled towared the middle of the planets. I think it has a gravity well. I can't get to the front of the ship to take a pic directly at the nose because of this. That or they have a tractor beam on the ship to push me away. I'm at 2x my max speed and climbing going towards the center of gravity between the planets. I wonder if it can use this to sling shot back to higher speeds. It also seems you don't go above 500 when being pulled by gravity. Or at least not at this location.

BTW, the back of this thing make sit look like the ship that KSP built. STacking and all.

Intriguing though I don't think it's related. But leave no stone unturned, right? Can you post better pictures of it as an imgur album if you're near the site? From different angles like, front, back, from any side etc.
