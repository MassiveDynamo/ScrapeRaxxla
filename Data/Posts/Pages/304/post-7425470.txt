I was watching that video and then watched this video:

Did it dawn on anyone we are potentially in such a situation where an exodus could become needed.

Another idea. Is FD releasing content solely on when and how we discover stuff in game or is it just based on other criteria?! People figured out formadine and then eventually get get megaships released and now bigger similar ships. Maybe we have to figure out puzzles to get other content or something odd. Did anything happen that might make the guardian or thargoids make sense from a player driven perspective. I'm assuming that might just be them appearing as the games main antagonist. Although it could be either or both.

It mentions them needing waypoint and a conspiracy. What if all the mega ships and other gen ships are the same thing. It said something about zones. What does it look like when you look at the locations of all known gen ships. Especailly the ones with dead crew. Maybe the placement is a part of something. Could go to raxxla or other deeper activity. It's blatantly pointing to something like that. Is the formadine ship that different from the gen ships?
