In Premonition in the holofac vid played at Salomé’s trial it is the spiky-haired woman, not Rebecca, who represented TDW and was talking to Thorn & Lestenio.
You know what? I hadn't noticed that. I guess when I read Premonition I must have skimmed over that since I was so familiar with the short-story version. Thanks!

Might be Elyssia Fields but thought she would have been dead by this time since she was in the original novella.
Elyssia was a clone. I think the best explanation is that the spikey-haired woman is a subsequent clone.

Doesn’t preclude Rebecca being a member of TDW but is not evidence of that. Need to find a description of Elyssia’s hairstyle. Any other named character with spiky hair?
Given that Rebecca was not the person talking to Thorn & Lestenio, I agree.

I interpreted the books as Rebecca was a part of the Club. It could have been that the Club and TDW were associated in the Dynasty plot since I think DW said they were often antagonistic to each other, which implies occasionally they are not and may work together at times. Don’t know, rambling, awakened too early by restless pets, need more coffee.....
Rebecca was definitely employed by The Club at one point. I think she was more of a tool not a member.
