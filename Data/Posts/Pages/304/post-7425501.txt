The spiky-haired woman is almost certainly intended to be Elyssia Fields from the original Dark Wheel novella.

The Dark Wheel medallion is canon. It was mentioned in Galnet and appears in Premonition. The description of the medallion in Premonition matches the fan-fiction image that has been circulating about for years. I assume that Drew had that graphic in front of him while he was writing the description so it is safe to assume that the graphic itself is, for all intents and purposes, nearly canon itself.

As for whether the woman talking is Alessia Verdi or Rebecca ... I've always assumed Rebecca. The description seems to match. It can't have been Alessia Verdi though. The opening lines from the Children of Raxxla short story preclude that possibility. Alessia introduces herself and goes on to say that the events in the story occurred before she got involved with The Children of Raxxla:

In Premonition in the holofac vid played at Salomé’s trial it is the spiky-haired woman, not Rebecca, who represented TDW and was talking to Thorn & Lestenio. Might be Elyssia Fields but thought she would have been dead by this time since she was in the original novella. Doesn’t preclude Rebecca being a member of TDW but is not evidence of that. Need to find a description of Elyssia’s hairstyle. Any other named character with spiky hair?

I interpreted the books as Rebecca was a part of the Club. It could have been that the Club and TDW were associated in the Dynasty plot since I think DW said they were often antagonistic to each other, which implies occasionally they are not and may work together at times. Don’t know, rambling, awakened too early by restless pets, need more coffee.....
