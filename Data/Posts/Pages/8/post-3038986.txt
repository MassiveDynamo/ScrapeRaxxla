Methinks you need a wing mate to get into the slot or one of the docking bays in a fed capital ship.

Exactly, although if you notice the jammed Anaconda, the second the jump initiates, it breaks free. I suspect the ship inside the docking bay will be ejected, but only a test with a wing man will show what happens

Edit:As expected, ships inside the Capital ships are ejected as the jump begins.
