Pop quiz / possible bug?

Anyone been able to confirm Rigel as a Type A Supergiant in the Codex?
FSS isn't adding it and the marshmallows are melting closer than 150Ls.
Type B Supergiant, "Rigel B" was confirmed automatically during D-Scan.

Is there a one star per system limit so only primaries qualify in the Codex?

Edit: UC paid for both stars.

Hope the payment was equal
We keep hearing about gender inequality in Hollywood!
