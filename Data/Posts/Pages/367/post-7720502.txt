A brazen key she held, the handle turn'd,
With steel and polish'd elephant adorned;

Not to sound lude or anything, but that may literally be a euphemism! 8p (Which could fit the whole key and door thing. Isn't this a love story about the trojan war?)

I wonder how that translates in the original language.

I would assume most people know this but there is a system named penelope in the bubble. I have it marked for visit but haven't done so yet, personally.

BTW, I don't know if this is relevant, but why do all of the criminal secondary groups in distance space stations(heart and soul, ngc 1333, orion nebula) only get rep from passenger missions? Has anyone noticed this or know what the deal with that is? Also the normal ones all have mass donation missions. Is it so you can easily flip back from the criminal organization. Any way this is like TDW using them like the mafia as undercover extensions?
