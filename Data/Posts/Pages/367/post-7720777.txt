The is a thread somewhere (maybe in dangerous discussions) from no so long time ago.
It is called "what is left to discover in ED" or similar. It contains a picture of similar signal, IIRC tad better quality.
Maybe you you want to take a look.

I wasn’t able to find this thread or image, perhaps you can post a link. Have they tracked the signal down to three systems near Sag A*? Did they have a member of Canonn who is a trained audio professional isolate the noise? If they didn’t do that work then that thread isn’t worth a whole lot.
