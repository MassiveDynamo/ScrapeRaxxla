Hello everyone,

Researchers at the Independent Raxxla Hunters group have discovered a signal at the center of the galaxy that may have existed since the very beginning of the game. We have narrowed the source of the signal down to just a couple systems. Please find the post on this topic as well as information on how you can assist the investigation here:

The is a thread somewhere (maybe in dangerous discussions) from no so long time ago.
It is called "what is left to discover in ED" or similar. It contains a picture of similar signal, IIRC tad better quality.
Maybe you you want to take a look.
