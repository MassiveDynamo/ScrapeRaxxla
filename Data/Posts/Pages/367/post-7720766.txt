According to self-professed Dark Wheel expert Lyta Crane, a conspiracy theorist and
'people's journalist' who has painstakingly assembled an archive of relevant data, the
original group was based in a disused starport orbiting the eighth moon of an unnamed
gas giant. The station was toroid, hence 'wheel', and operated with a minimal power output
so as to avoid detection, hence 'dark'.
Read what you've quoted again...
Epsilon Indi BA is a Class T Dwarf STAR (not a gas giant), with seven planets.
Highly unlikely FDev will jam anything too extravagant in fully mapped systems.

Separate 8th moon TDW myth from Raxxla might also be a good idea
