What are you trying to say exactly?

That Raxxla is the Dark 8th Moon...
(From Raxxla Codex)
"It is extremely difficult to find consistency among the various fragmentary rumours of
Raxxla. Much like the ancient myths of Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John,
interpretations of the story range from the sceptical to the outlandish: Raxxla has been
suggested to be anything from an unremarkable moon to a state of cosmetic enlightenment.
The earliest document stories tend to agree on several points, however: that Raxxla is a
definite place and that it holds a mystical secret. "

(From Dark Wheel Codex)
According to self-professed Dark Wheel expert Lyta Crane, a conspiracy theorist and
'people's journalist' who has painstakingly assembled an archive of relevant data, the
original group was based in a disused starport orbiting the eighth moon of an unnamed
gas giant. The station was toroid, hence 'wheel', and operated with a minimal power output
so as to avoid detection, hence 'dark'.
