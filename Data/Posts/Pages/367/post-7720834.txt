So basically you are hypothesising that Raxxla is a moon and TDW station is orbiting it, based on interpretation of Astrophel and Stella, also hypothesising that is the reference referred to by “Astophil and the Spiralling Stars” mentioned in the Codex. Then you are saying FD haven’t completed the install because you couldn’t find what you were looking for in the location you interpreted (Alison?).

I like the hypothesis, it would be “a little bit obvious” (and somewhat ironic) if this were the moon and station depicted in the game startup menu image and we’ve seen Raxxla everytime we startup the game (I’ve posited this hypothesis several times in this thread). But sorry, I think your deductive logic is faulty, look elsewhere.
My bad.... Sorry. I will cry elsewhere...
