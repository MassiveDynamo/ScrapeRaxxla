That Raxxla is the Dark 8th Moon...
(From Raxxla Codex)
"It is extremely difficult to find consistency among the various fragmentary rumours of
Raxxla. Much like the ancient myths of Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John,
interpretations of the story range from the sceptical to the outlandish: Raxxla has been
suggested to be anything from an unremarkable moon to a state of cosmetic enlightenment.
The earliest document stories tend to agree on several points, however: that Raxxla is a
definite place and that it holds a mystical secret. "

(From Dark Wheel Codex)
According to self-professed Dark Wheel expert Lyta Crane, a conspiracy theorist and
'people's journalist' who has painstakingly assembled an archive of relevant data, the
original group was based in a disused starport orbiting the eighth moon of an unnamed
gas giant. The station was toroid, hence 'wheel', and operated with a minimal power output
so as to avoid detection, hence 'dark'.

So basically you are hypothesising that Raxxla is a moon and TDW station is orbiting it, based on interpretation of Astrophel and Stella, also hypothesising that is the reference referred to by “Astophil and the Spiralling Stars” mentioned in the Codex. Then you are saying FD haven’t completed the install because you couldn’t find what you were looking for in the location you interpreted (Alison?).

I like the hypothesis, it would be “a little bit obvious” (and somewhat ironic) if this were the moon and station depicted in the game startup menu image and we’ve seen Raxxla everytime we startup the game (I’ve posited this hypothesis several times in this thread). But sorry, I think your deductive logic is faulty, look elsewhere.
