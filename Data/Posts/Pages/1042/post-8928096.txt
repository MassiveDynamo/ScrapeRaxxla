I keep pondering the "Hidden on the Outer RIm" mission that disappeared.

SPOILER: I HAVE SLIGHTLY UPDATED THE CONCEPT OF THE RAXXLA LOGO.

The raxxla logo is not a map, as I said, but it is an allusion to the Sol system.
I really liked the idea that the stroke line is an engineering technique - to show what is hidden.

All this reminds me of current efforts of astronomers all over the world toward finding the elusive "Planet nine" or "Planet X" which affects orbits of TNOs. I can't remember: were they were in ED from the very beginning or were they added later? Also, am I the only one that sees 6 ASP-X's facing out on this logo?
