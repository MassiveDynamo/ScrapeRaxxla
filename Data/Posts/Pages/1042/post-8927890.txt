In my opinion, we are somewhere very close.

SPOILER: I HAVE SLIGHTLY UPDATED THE CONCEPT OF THE RAXXLA LOGO.

The raxxla logo is not a map, as I said, but it is an allusion to the Sol system.
I really liked the idea that the stroke line is an engineering technique - to show what is hidden.

But, the Raxxla logo does not have a specific explanation of the position of the desired object (we do not know what Raxxla is). Perhaps you should look for hints somewhere else, for example in the text of the codex.
Even despite the green glow in other systems, I am sure that the presence of it in Sol is not just a bug. I guess I'd like to believe that.

At the moment, I'm halfway out of Bovomit sector. I can't wait to test a couple of my guesses and theories, which I will definitely tell you about here if they give a result.

I've done a search around Jupiter's orbit for Trojans and Greeks; and also searched for Hildas, they must all be hidng in a wooden horse cos I didnt find any sign!

I keep pondering the "Hidden on the Outer RIm" mission that disappeared. If it's not hidden in the outer rim of the asteroid belt then it could be further out. Kuiper Belt? Persephone??
I'm not convinced that the three arcs represent the Hilda asteroids, or Greeks or Trojans. But maybe the hexagon is a nod to Saturn's hexagon? That was was discovered during the Voyager mission in 1981 so FD/DB were aware of it when programming ED.
