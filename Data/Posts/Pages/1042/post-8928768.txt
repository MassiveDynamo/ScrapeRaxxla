Persephone is ED’s “planet 10”, and to my mind suspiciously brightly lit for something that’s so far from the sun. Han_Zen’s got a better memory than me, but I think originally only out to Pluto was implemented & then the TNOs (Pluto is actually the first TNO) were added later.

Edit: mmm, Han_Zen must be out skiing. Found the patch note though:
