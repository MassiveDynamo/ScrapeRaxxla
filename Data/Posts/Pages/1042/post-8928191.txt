All this reminds me of current efforts of astronomers all over the world toward finding the elusive "Planet nine" or "Planet X" which affects orbits of TNOs. I can't remember: were they were in ED from the very beginning or were they added later? Also, am I the only one that sees 6 ASP-X's facing out on this logo?

Persephone is ED’s “planet 10”, and to my mind suspiciously brightly lit for something that’s so far from the sun. Han_Zen’s got a better memory than me, but I think originally only out to Pluto was implemented & then the TNOs (Pluto is actually the first TNO) were added later.

Edit: mmm, Han_Zen must be out skiing. Found the patch note though:
