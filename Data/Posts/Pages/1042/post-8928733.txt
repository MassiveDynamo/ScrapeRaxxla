Nothing special about 14th of March for us here in Brazil.
I just picked a random Sunday about a month from now so we have time to prepare...
But hey, people will find the face of some celebrity on a pancake.

Mid Feb I shall post a thread about it here on the forums trying to show more or less what we will be looking for and a Discord channel so we can have some voice comms for an eventual Eureka moment
