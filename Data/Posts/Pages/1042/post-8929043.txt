Ok, I’ll bite, what’s special about March 14th? (Edit: UK Mothering Sunday)

I think searching the Kuiper belt will take more than an evening. It starts at Neptune’s at 30AU and goes out to 50AU. That’s an awful lot of area to search!!!

But I’d say if we’re talking about the outer rim of the solar system for location of Raxxla, which has been in-game since the gamma, then around Pluto is more likely. That was the outer rim at the time, and I don’t think they’d move it when they added the TNOs.

But I’m convinced the Raxxla logo is a clue. Still think it’s Sol, but can’t see how it says Pluto, or anything else for that matter. It’s not speaking to me!
