... I keep pondering the "Hidden on the Outer RIm" mission that disappeared. If it's not hidden in the outer rim of the asteroid belt then it could be further out. Kuiper Belt? Persephone??...

I'd go first for Kuiper Asteroid Belt
1. It's solar system outer rim;
2. Eddb website shows mass equals 1 moon;
3. Not a lockable/targatable location.

It would be even worth to call for a mass search throughout the Sol system.
Maybe can organize one for March 14th starting at 17:00h (game time)
