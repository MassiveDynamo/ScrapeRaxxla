Dantes Divine Comedy ... is divided into 3 parts... Each part comprising 33 cantos

While Virgil guides Dante through Hell and Purgatory... Beatrice guides him through Paradise

Dantes pilgrimage is a spiral path based on Platonic theory (Music of the Spheres)

The relationship of Dante and Beatrice (I keep wanting to call her Bernice) is ..certainly a similar relationship to that of Phillip Sidney and Lady Penelope

just some thoughts...
