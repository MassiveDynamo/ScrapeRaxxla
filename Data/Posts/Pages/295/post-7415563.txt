BTW, there is a very interesting set of 2mass systems on the way to heart and sole. I never finished exploring them. They are next to a Cassiopeia star and one named MD 50 or something. I don't remember the spelling. They have some pretty unique system layouts and are a very visible star cluster on the way to heart and sole.
