it varied. But there were non 2mass or IC 1805 all around them. There probably is. I need to go back that way and finish exploring them. Need to get some engineering stuff finished on my ship though so I can get max jump range from Jamesons life support mod.

I also noticed something else. The tourist beacons are numbered. That one was 0676 I think. That means there is similar potential limit as the FSP stations. I wonder if it's a separate list or one big list using a max of 9999 assets.

Edit: It's near KM Cassiopeia and MWC 50. Also, if you want to see a cool system go to IC 1805 Sector EQ-Y E4. There is also an odd black hole nebula system at IC 1805 Sector DQ-Y E3 very near by to it.

The planets could be closer together for cool up close shots, but the system is pretty cool looking on it's own!



BTW, MWC 50 has one brown dwarf with 8 planets and a moon. So technically 9.
