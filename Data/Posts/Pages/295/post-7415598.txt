it varied. But there were non 2mass all around them. There probably is. I need to go back that way and finish exploring them. Need to get some engineering stuff finished on my ship though so I can get max jump range from Jamesons life support mod.

I also noticed something else. The tourist beacons are numbered. That one was 0676 I think. That means there is similar potential limit as the FSP stations. I wonder if it's a separate list or one big list using a max of 9999 assets.

Edit: It's near KM Cassiopeia and MWC 50. Also, if you want to see a cool system go to IC 1805 Sector EQ-Y E4. There is also an odd black hole nebula system at IC 1805 Sector DQ-Y E3 very near by to it.

The planets could be closer together for cool up close shots, but the system is pretty cool looking on it's own!

Thatâ€™s a neat system. Deff could result in some nifty shots.
