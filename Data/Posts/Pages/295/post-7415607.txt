Not that I’m aware of. The Zurara I think is the only thing found there of note. DW was adamant that the FR mystery didn’t boil down to just a POI, but once the Zurara was found a lot of people stopped looking there assuming the whole thing was over with. I think there’s prolly something else to be found there although that’s just speculation. And if there is idk if it would be in any way related to Raxxla, or if it would be related to The Club, etc.

For the first time I have just taken a trip through the Formadine Rift as well as visiting the settlements on the return to the Heart and Soul Nebulas.

After reading the transmissions at the various sites I came away thinking that there has to be something else to find in this location and the repetition in key phrases has got to be more than just a coincidence.

I also just wanted to say that the level of detail and input within this thread is incredible and even if Raxxla remains a mystery, it makes for continuous interesting reading.

Keep up the good work!
