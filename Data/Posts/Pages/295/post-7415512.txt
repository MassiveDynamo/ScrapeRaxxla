I just found this also, Maybe finding all the tourists beacons will help somehow. Maybe scouring all in game data is, again, going to help. This all sounds like previous data. I think it's been mentioned specifically actually:



We might just have to collect all this info and put it together. It is interestingly a cobraMKIII.

Is tourist beacon data stored in the codex or anything after reading it?

Yeah this was the old lady’s cobra that Salomé had spoken about. This info lead to the discovery of the Formanide Rift. Interestingly the answer to the riddle was the Andromeda constellation between the heart and soul nebulae. So Andromeda lead the way to the Rift. I think looking at the Cassiopeia constellation directly for clues is a mistake. I think the jewel on the brow of Cassiopeia spoken about is the Andromeda constellation. It sits off the face of Cassiopeia, Andromeda fits the description of the parents greif and the lovers woe, and she was the siren that called us to travel the void. I’ve been to Alpheratz, the head of Andromeda recently. Nothing there but a double star system and a metric ton of degraded emissions. But I’d like to check the rest of the stars in the constellation.
