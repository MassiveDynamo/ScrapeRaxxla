I was reading up on capital ship drives. Someone mentioned it might take weeks to jump. something also mentioned jaques and the gnosis. This got me thinking. Maybe this is related. The gnosis takes a week for reach destination. This could be the ships rev up time. I still need to go back to the gnosis and see if it's adding more destinations. It only had 2 left. Could raxxla be an old ship that has like a week to change destinations. Maybe we have to figure out how to find it and have a week each jump to catch up to it.

What does it mean the thargoid base is active? It has those canisters in it. I just didn't land to check them out because I was running an empty anaconda for exploration.

Enterable with an active map room. Some are collapsed and non enterable. I was just thinking since Omphalos is mentioned and Delphi has been renamed at the same time, the thargoid base is really the only thing there that would point us ‘somewhere’. The Omphalos rift is supposedly housed at Raxxla, and the only other Omphalos connection we know of is Delphi. Thinking maybe Delphi will at least point us in a beginning direction if there’s coordnance to be had from the base there.
