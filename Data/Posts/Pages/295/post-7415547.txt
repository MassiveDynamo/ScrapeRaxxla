Jewel in the crown makes me think of one interesting thing. There is a nebula that when looked at from earth or especially near heart and sole nebula always has a distinct dot on it. I think it's BD+55 191 in NGC 281 past heart and sole nebulas. It has a distinctive blue dot always visible in it.(the above mentioned system BD+55 191)And that system has a unique name and one landable planet. I did not surface explore it though. Maybe it has something on it.

Is that system related to anything known about formadine or anything?

Not that I’m aware of. The Zurara I think is the only thing found there of note. DW was adamant that the FR mystery didn’t boil down to just a POI, but once the Zurara was found a lot of people stopped looking there assuming the whole thing was over with. I think there’s prolly something else to be found there although that’s just speculation. And if there is idk if it would be in any way related to Raxxla, or if it would be related to The Club, etc.
