I was reading up on capital ship drives. Someone mentioned it might take weeks to jump. something also mentioned jaques and the gnosis. This got me thinking. Maybe this is related. The gnosis takes a week for reach destination. This could be the ships rev up time. I still need to go back to the gnosis and see if it's adding more destinations. It only had 2 left. Could raxxla be an old ship that has like a week to change destinations. Maybe we have to figure out how to find it and have a week or two each jump to catch up to it. Maybe it's a really old exploration base(With a pre publicly known form of jump drive.). It could be if we ever find the planets from the picture it's only it's starting destination or something. 8)

What does it mean the thargoid base is active? It has those canisters in it. I just didn't land to check them out because I was running an empty anaconda for exploration. I have yet to figure out how to use them for that. I'm still curious myself.

BTW, would congress in space be funny or scary? Would bureaucratic grade jump drives be of any use?
