I found an interesting article on the stellar aspect of the Elysian mysteries: http://www.panix.com/~gblt/eleusislaturarev82b.pdf

So the article talks about the X (X marks the spot) formed by the intersection of the Milky Way and possibly the Solar System orbital plane (different interpretations of what plane actually). But, the article has a picture (Fig. 1) that clearly shows the plane of the ecliptic intersecting the Milky Way at one star at the "foot" of Castor of the Gemini constellation.

So here's the Gemini constellation:


And with the stars named:


"Tejat Posterior" would be the X mentioned in the article.

This website gives a meaning for the name Tejat Posterior (as "Back Foot") and also names the other stars in Gemini.

Note how Athena (the star) is IN the constellation of Gemini.


EDIT: Interestingly, Tejat Posterior A is a red giant, and the star surface has a texture that is only in parts "plasma" like the surface of a star. In fact, there are large areas of the star surface that are transparent, and I can see a smaller sphere of swirling plasma INSIDE the star. Tejat Posterior 1 A orbits at 780 LS from the star, but the star is big enough that the view looks a lot like the image posted under the Dark Wheel codex entry (see page 1 of this thread). In fact, looking at the surface of the star in that Dark Wheel image, I'm inclined to guess that it's a red giant, and not a red dwarf.
