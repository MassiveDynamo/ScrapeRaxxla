I just found this also, Maybe finding all the tourists beacons will help somehow. Maybe scouring all in game data is, again, going to help. This all sounds like previous data. I think it's been mentioned specifically actually:



We might just have to collect all this info and put it together. It is interestingly a cobraMKIII.

Is tourist beacon data stored in the codex or anything after reading it?

I also just noticed something else. People from different locations have very obvious and destinct clothing color. I wonder if color can be a giveaway to something. Notice that raxxla is green. Like when allied.
