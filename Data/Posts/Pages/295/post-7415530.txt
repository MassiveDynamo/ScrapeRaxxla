Jewel in the crown makes me think of one interesting thing. There is a nebula that when looked at from earth or especially near heart and sole nebula always has a distinct dot on it. I think it's BD+55 191 in NGC 281 past heart and sole nebulas. It has a distinctive blue dot always visible in it.(the above mentioned system BD+55 191)And that system has a unique name and one landable planet. I did not surface explore it though. Maybe it has something on it.

Is that system related to anything known about formadine or anything?

Also, there don't seem to be a lot of these BD+XX systems. Maybe they are significant in themselves.
