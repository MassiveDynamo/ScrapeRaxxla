I'm not so sure I see the link here? How am I supposed to link it to some of the known facts?
NS are only object wich "wisper" if you target star during FSS. "Impossible" NS are shiny from being in witch space, like a bright beacon. So I was traveling among top -10 of them last months.
You can jump into Jacson system and see yourself what I mean. That is not usual animation, guy checked EDDB - it was couple tens or hundreds such "impossible" things.
P.S. Impossible - because NS cannot be more then 2 Solar masses. If it is over it - it can be young magnetar which will dies soon enough.
