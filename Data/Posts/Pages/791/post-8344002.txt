Oh I don't think you should feel sorry. It's just a pop culture rabbithole for oldey nerd stuff. Or a cross-franchise meta concept with many windows and doors, something to have a sense of having been part of, being part of you, something that was, nostalgia, sciency stuff, games, books, and whatever. Lines kinda blur with time. Also I love your beard.
