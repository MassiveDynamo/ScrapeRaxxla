And here we think we can't learn anything new. Yet the game just slaps us in the face to remind us how sloppy we are.
Accidentally via Drews stream tonight we discover that the game doesn't display some system-descriptions summary (via the galaxy map) unless you've visited them.
Before visit it looks like a generic / no description.
After visit, it should be updated.

Two test you can do yourself if you've never visited these systems:
1. Make sure you have never visited CD-86 4
2. Check system map, description summary. Observe if blank / generic
3. Visit system
4. Check description again.
5. Repeat with LTT 11159 if you like.

Screenshots what it should look like:
SPOILER: IMAGES
