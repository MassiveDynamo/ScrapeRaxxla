...okey ...Jackson Lighthouse is "impossible" NS too ...13 SoLs ...and 300+ millions temp, shiny from hyper.
And it is 1 NS near SoL at all. Coincidence?

Also although it has no population, it somehow has Federarion allegiance (At least in the Galmap - in the system map it has no allegiance - bug report has been made..)
