Even though this model was essentially wrong
What? How do you navigate the aether then? When you reach the upper wheel, there are fiery spoke-holes and travelling spheres everywhere, it's very dangerous. Sometimes there is only dark void where the fire should be. When I followed a three-headed dragon to the west, there were so many of them I had to use patches of primordial steam to calculate my position. And if you go far enough, and look to the wheel sideways, you can see the Tower too.
