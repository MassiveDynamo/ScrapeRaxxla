Reach Heaven by Tothos-Fire!
"...And if one puts the head of a fresh Herring upon the Coals to fumigate, and he gets upon the house in the night, he will think that all the Stars run into one. And if any one at the full Moon shall put the head of the Animal into a dry Fig, and shall lay it on the Fire, when the Air is still he will see the Orb of the Moon as big as half of Heaven. And if you mix a little of the Sea-star with it, you see great Stichius, he is the Daimon Fortune, made, and standing at your feet. And if you powder the Stone Pyrites, and in like manner lay it on, there will be Thunder and Lightning..."
