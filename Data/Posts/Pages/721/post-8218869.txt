I see you have been reading that speculative chymist, Isaac Newton, and his Opticks theory. Of course light is going to have a miniscule effect, if any, when you only pour a little into an ossuary filled with darkness. The false Newtonian teachings reduce light into mere white rayes, completely ignoring all that surrounds it, and rejecting all good tradition of Natural Philosophy. These theories completely ignore moral and philosophical associations of light, and effects light has on plants and asteroids.

"Newton's error.. was trusting math over the sensations of his eye."
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
