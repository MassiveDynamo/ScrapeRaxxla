I’ve seen the ruby quote before. I found a string of numbers in a comment on YouTube, cracked the code, googled the quote, sent me here..

The Greek quote of Xenophon symposium (chapter 1, section 8) is slightly different depending on the edition you source from.
Roughly translated.
beauty is naturally regal, especially when joined with virtue.

Both quotes describing a beauty both outward and inward. A combination of the physical and spiritual?

Prudence is the mother of virtues. At the bottom of the map you can see she is reading to the other virtues

the ‘mother’ is on her way to the empyrean
The way for her chariot is locked, a path of stars shows the way around on a single horse.

Prudentia is associated with a mirror for self judgement not vanity and a snake. (Lots of snakes in Elite)
In these images she is represented with scales balancing the other virtues, which can become vices if taken to extremity

(If you get there before me. Remember my name.)
