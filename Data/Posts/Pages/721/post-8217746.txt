probably nothing but i haven't seen any similar backgrounds and they kind of stick out.

I did some checking into this after Guru spotted the facial tattoos on potentially linked entities across systems, but I was checking the backgrounds.

From my investigation the backgrounds appear common for all factions in any given system.

Usually some 'portraits' are closer to a section of the image, some to the left or right, but if you look at all the factions offering missions you'll likely (in my experience) see a common feature behind them.

It also seems to be random chance if you see the same background in another system. No linkage that I could discern.

Remember though, you may encounter something new and exciting that we haven't seen, or overlooked. So don't be discouraged by my findings, just keep a sharp eye out and follow your gut!

And let us all know if you find something different. ;-)
