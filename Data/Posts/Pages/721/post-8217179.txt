An etheric voice (this is the only way I can describe it) lead me to Olaf Stapledon’s starmaker. Which has lead me to Ancient philosophy, and now onto Dante’s Devine comedy.
Never before has a game given me so much to read.

Hearing etheric voices is one of the signs of space madness (or terminal addiction to Lavian Gin, only you can decide which). Talking to yourself is another, believing in and hunting for Raxxla are two more. Playing ED is the first!
