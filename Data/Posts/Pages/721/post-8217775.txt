For those looking at the conspicuous similarities between various myths from apparently disparate people all over the world, there's a reason. Before the age of TV, or electric light there wasn't a lot to do after dinner except sit around looking at the only things you can see easily after the Sun 'fights his brother' Set.

It's little wonder the wandering "stars" became the actors following the days of our lives, providing heavenly guidance as they enter into each other's houses and present differing aspects of their archetypal person when forming demonically difficult or angelic angles to each other. We all witness the same sky at night.

I am the Alpha (Angstrom) and Omega (Libra), dawn and dusk, Sun rise and Set, behold the diurnal cycle.

SPOILER

*In case you miss the hint: Maya, Mary, the virgin mother is Virgo. Reduce the ecliptic search to 1/12th.
[Further, this idea is 'occulted' (hidden) standing-under almost every aspect of life on Earth. Pay attention.]
