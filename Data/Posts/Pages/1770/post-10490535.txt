Nice spot!
But it leads me to wonder how much obfuscation has been built into the lore!
Is it all just loosely used to construct a thin veneer of reality for the game, or is this instance a reflection of the codex mention of the Omphalos raising the ancient Greek Zeus/Eagle/Omphalos myth and suggesting that the critical clue lies within Elite Legacy?
(That's poorly phrased, bad night's sleep and need more coffee!)

Because Ive been pointing out for some time that Legacy has Julia, apparently from childhood, fixated on Raxxla (I know the feeling!) and intending to fly to Alliance space to look for it (but with no indication of why she suspects it is there).

The question is ... where in Alliance space?

"As a girl she’d even dreamed of being the first pilot to discover Raxxla. Her father disapproved of such tales when she’d been a child. Even so, the desire to head into deep space called to her."

Is deep space the direction she would go for Raxxla or just her yearning for exploration?
