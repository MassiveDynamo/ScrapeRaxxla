Nice spot!
But it leads me to wonder how much obfuscation has been built into the lore!
Is it all just loosely used to construct a thin veneer of reality for the game, or is this instance a reflection of the codex mention of the Omphalos raising the ancient Greek Zeus/Eagle/Omphalos myth and suggesting that the critical clue lies within Elite Legacy?
(That's poorly phrased, bad night's sleep and need more coffee!)

Because Ive been pointing out for some time that Legacy has Julia, apparently from childhood, fixated on Raxxla (I know the feeling!) and intending to fly to Alliance space to look for it (but with no indication of why she suspects it is there).

The question is ... where in Alliance space?

Her grandfather also survived the story, and he indicated Julia would likely end up searching for him and the wider family. Did Brookes indicate in the forum that Julia may have left Freeholm?

“That depends on whether Julia is still there” M Brookes.

In Elite Legacy, Darik Cavus (oak hearted / cave) was primarily focused upon protecting his daughter Julia Cavus (Joves child / cave) from her grandfather, and he was against her engaging in exploration, particularly because she had an interest in looking for Raxxla.

His family had a nefarious and lucrative business, which utilised various shell companies to remain hidden.

Then we have the indication from the Codex that some members actively try to keep their children out of the Dark Wheel.

I long suspected these characters may be part of the Dark Wheel and the book is giving us some indications on how they may hide themselves, or at most a sphere of influence of where they may be?
