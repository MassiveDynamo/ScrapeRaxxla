I have recently been able to find a system nearby that's got a T Brown Dwarf .8ly away from a nearby star - it is invisible in the skybox. An L class is visible 1.5ly away though.

So if there is any hidden system anywhere we can't even guarantee they'd show in the skybox
Interesting... Which system?
