Nice spot!
But it leads me to wonder how much obfuscation has been built into the lore!
Is it all just loosely used to construct a thin veneer of reality for the game, or is this instance a reflection of the codex mention of the Omphalos raising the ancient Greek Zeus/Eagle/Omphalos myth and suggesting that the critical clue lies within Elite Legacy?
(That's poorly phrased, bad night's sleep and need more coffee!)

Because Ive been pointing out for some time that Legacy has Julia, apparently from childhood, fixated on Raxxla (I know the feeling!) and intending to fly to Alliance space to look for it (but with no indication of why she suspects it is there).

The question is ... where in Alliance space?

Since Vega is also the the location of the Gan Romero story, I see it as a more likely region (or direction) than 'Alliance space'. I suspect that Julia's book tells a child's version of the TDW story and she plans to go to Lave.
