"As a girl she’d even dreamed of being the first pilot to discover Raxxla. Her father disapproved of such tales when she’d been a child. Even so, the desire to head into deep space called to her."

Is deep space the direction she would go for Raxxla or just her yearning for exploration?
"Julia as a girl dreamed of being the first pilot to discover Raxxla. ....
As a girl Julia grew up without toys with a single possession, a book about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon locked alone each day in the tiny family cell while her parents slaved in the mines. She hoped to keep her Eagle as she’d grown accustomed to its idiosyncrasies...whether it was a suitable ship for travelling all the way to Alliance space was another matter”

Edit
I imagine from Freeholm anything more than han 10ly or would be "deep space"
