Yes details please. This sounds like a potential candidate which may match the description of a dark system?

I’ve long thought such systems exist in game but are bugged or common place, but the mechanism for exploiting them not implemented.

Like comets I suspect FD don’t want us to find them because it identifies an archaeological aspect of the game’s design which was edited to allow it to get the launch under scrunch. But that just wild conjecture
"Dark Systems" are just Brown Dwarf or similar systems. AFAIK early on there was a plan to have them hidden and discoverable as "shortcut" systems but that was never implemented, so technically every dim star is a potential dark system. That's why they appear in some of the novels though because the writers were working off very early drafts of the overall design documents.

It's just yet another one of those Elite myths that clouds the real mysteries that get propagated by this community.

Note: I think this is also a misunderstanding of my post! I was only commenting on the visibility of stars in the skybox within set criteria.
