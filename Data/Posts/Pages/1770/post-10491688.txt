Interesting... Which system?
No idea, it's not important, it's just a random star that happened to be a similar distance away as a hypothetical hidden system would be to Stuemeae JM-W C1-5825, I'm sure there are millions or billions of others.

The question I asked was "would any star type be visible in the skybox at that distance" and no-one answered, so I was just recording my own answer for anyone in future who wondered the same thing. The answer is no, not any star type, it seems from that one example I happened to be passing that a T-type is too dim, but an L-Type is not. I assume too that a black hole would also not be visible at less than 1ly, but that's a guess.

That means there might be a hidden system there (near Stuemeae JM-W C1-5825), or there might not be, and there's simply no way to know under present conditions.
