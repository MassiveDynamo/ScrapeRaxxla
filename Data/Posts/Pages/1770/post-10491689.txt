Yes details please. This sounds like a potential candidate which may match the description of a dark system?

I’ve long thought such systems exist in game but are bugged or common place, but the mechanism for exploiting them was simply not implemented. Hence difficult to find.

It would be a perfect way to hide Raxxla, however it relys on the assets being intended and therefore an acceptable game mechanism, if they are unknown to us, it indicates that FD are withholding information and the likelihood drops considerably. Because I suspect the Codex is intended to be accessible…

As with comets I suspect Dark systems and rogue planets are one and the same and likely in game but like comets an unfinished asset.

But that just wild conjecture
