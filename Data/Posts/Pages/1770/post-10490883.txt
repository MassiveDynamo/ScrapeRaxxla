I'm somewhat new to the whole Raxxla thing and it's piqued my interest. Um.... 1770 forum pages is a LOT to chew through. Is there a TL;DR floating around please guys and gals?
On a serious note the very first post is where to start...

The codex is about the only other piece of information that mentions Raxxla in game...

There's the odd mention in official books on Elite dangerous...

Some think other games in the series are relevant, others don't...

And Jorki has a link in his signature on mentions from FD (from David Braben and Michael Brookes)...

The rest is conjecture and ideas from other pieces of literature linked in some way to Elite or Michael Brookes favourite books to Greek (and other) mythologies

And there is also the landscape signal and whether that is Raxxla or linked to it ...

I will have missed many other ideas, thoughts and suggestions but that's stuff off the top of my head....

Oh and not ruling out it might not actually be in the game or you can't get to it currently...
