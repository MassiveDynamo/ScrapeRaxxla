Probably isn't relevant, but in case it gives someone an idea, there appear to be exactly five inhabited permit-locked systems in the bubble for which the permit is available but the system is Powerplay exempt. (So far as I can tell all the ones where the permit is still unavailable are exempt)

Two of them are obvious: Shinrarta Dezhra and CD-43 11917 (CQC) are the two "neutral" universal outfitters.
A third - HIP 54530 - had the permit only made available relatively recently as part of the Jupiter Rochester storyline and maybe they forgot to enable it for Powerplay at that point.

The other two - Hodack and Nastrond - have been permit-locked since the beginning, haven't generally been involved in the plot, and yet are still PP-exempt. Lots of other potentially plot-significant permit systems (Isinor, Mbooni, etc) participate in Powerplay normally.

Any ideas why those two specifically might be exempted?
