Ross 788 is home to the station Brookes Abyss, as memory serves it’s named after Michael Brookes.

In Ross 788 the controlling faction is the ‘Defence Party of Nastrond’, this same faction that’s required to obtain the permit for the locked ‘Yggdrasil’ system ‘Nastrond’.

Nastrond is a place in Hel, below the world tree Yggdrasil.

Considering my investigations this Yggdrasil exists in game, and Nastrond is located in the correct position relative to it. I obtained the permit years ago, but as with other permits it never led towards anything, but maybe it does?
