Well, in mi opinion, Raxxla will be found only in the last official season of the game. And this will mean that the game has officially ceased to be developed

BTW: Did you noticed that in the codex only "Omphalos Rift" term are not translated in different localizations? And FD do it only with items related to the galaxy map
