90% of this thread has nothing to do with Raxxla, but you never know what is or isnt connected and we have to something to pass the time. Weve all seen the 'Ive solved it' followed by vague posts that say theyve found something or evidence without actually providing any evidence too many times to jump on board that train any more. The cultists left long ago, only the rationals and the tinfoilers remain, both of whom are having lots of fun.

I think weâ€™ve still got a few cultists hanging on by their dogmas!
