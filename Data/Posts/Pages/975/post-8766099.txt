And has been pointed out, nobody can say what doesnt have anything to do with Raxxla because nobody know what does and doesnt.....until we find it and then we can all go 'Whod have thought the Teletubbies would be the crucial clue we needed?'

You ever watched what really goes on in that television show? I mean, you have these sun-worshipping aliens living in some sort of mythical plains-Eden with kurgan-mound houses, a social stratification of different castes, a distinctly technological species with a pastoral lifestyle, in Eurasian steppe basically. Here is a clip of some of them undergoing a religious experience, with an appearance of the Tree of Life, in different seasons symbolizing the cycle of life, and doves.

What is missing here is only the horse sacrifice, and you'd have pretty much depiction of old faith of native Mari peoples, who in turn perhaps acquired these cultural innovations through connections with peoples who then turned out to become late bronze-age Vedic Aryans in north-eastern India, and thus the oral tradition of Rigveda began.
