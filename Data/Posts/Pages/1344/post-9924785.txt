I created an Excel going through some details of the word Eye/Eyes, going by the Raxxla Codex which says "For Those with Eyes to See".
There are 84 words (Eye/Eyes) in Astrophel and Stella.

The Songs are still hard to figure out how I would implement it. I still figuring out the Rhythms structure of Sonnet that I would like to add to it. And hopefully Meter if Possible.

I'm looking for a good version with Today's English then old English so I get the right translation.
to add to it so I cover my basis
It would have to Fit the 14 line Sonnet.

I use the Roman Numerals as a way to find out what Character/Word is the 5th character/word (spaces and punctuations included with characters only)
So V = 5 = the Fifth word of the Sonnet like D-2 which is the word "That".
I also over think the idea that since each Sonnet is 14 lines I used that idea to find the 14 character and 14th word of Each Sonnet
Though it's very... Mixed up and means nothing. But I did this to remove any possibilities.

This is still a work in Progress and seeing other ways I can approach this.
