funny that you mention fish

remember the first engineering Beta?
fish was the key to everything. just a beta though.
make a new commander and play through the opening part of the game, get your sidewinder from the mysterious benefactor then do the trading mission to exit the starter systems, tell me, what is the commodity you trade?

fish?

its always fish.
