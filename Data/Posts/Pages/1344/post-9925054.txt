Raxxla could be a Guardian site?
Could the Guardians have made a portal to another galaxy to escape Thargoïds?
Or are Thargoïds themselves using Raxxla's portal, or some derived tech on their ships that could explain their travel capabilities?
Have I had enough coffee this morning?
All of the above or none of the above. TBH I was never in the conspiracy tank myself. But a third of my first team believed the guardians had something to do with this particular location. The speculation being, that the guardians were not originally from our galaxy but had come from somewhere else. But six months before that, I had heard a similar rumor about the Thargoids. Truth is, until someone finds it, or finds more clues to clear the picture a little, these debates are going to go on.
I am hunting guardians and keeping video logs now, but if I ever find a home world I guess this mystery will be next on my list. Space Atlantis.
