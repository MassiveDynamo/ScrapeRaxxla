Hi Allen. Hope you’re well and still enjoying our ramblings!

Can you clarify a couple of ED lore questions for me please?
1) Is Fortuna the same deity as Randomius Factoria? If not what is the difference?
2) Were you involved in the design of Trinkets of Hidden Fortune?
3) Is there a lore reason why Trinkets are prohibited everywhere? On the face of it they’re innocuous containers containing items of religious significance to believers in FORTUNA. I cant see any lore reason why they should be illicit goods everywhere; the implication seems to be that they’re harmful in some way....
