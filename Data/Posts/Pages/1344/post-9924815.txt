Elite Dangerous: The Guardians 2.2 update
Seem to remember that was to do with stations not appearing in very busy systems, but interesting...
Just noticed I forgot a bit from the patch notes when I copied it... It was a "speculative" fix for them disappearing... It could have been a tricky bug or they may have been trying not to break some functionality would be my guess having been in software development for far too many years...
