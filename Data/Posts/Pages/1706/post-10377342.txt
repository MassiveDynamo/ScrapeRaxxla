I did make an attempt at something like that recently. It felt compelling but at the same time intensely confusing as I lack the knowledge to extract anything sensible out of it all
ah ok cool yeah i just thought it was a very coincidental --> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10375970 ... AND btw , i edited that post because i realized later i mixed up the word "acronym" with anagram ( i meant anagram , but i'm guessing u guys knew that and were just being nice to me the newbie lol )

Arx is latin for castle

Arcis is the the genitive of Arx... so Arx arcis could be the Keep of a castle?
Interesting indeed ! .... i can't wait 'til i'm more experienced ( aka richer ) so i can really start to EXPLORE and contribute to uncovering this mystery someday.

Welcome to the Quest!
Macros has a useful summary on the first page of the thread!
thanks and yeah i been reading as much as i can ... and... someone in-game also said apparently there's like some BOOK about 'Raxxla' , written by the original EliteD architects? ( i checked Amazon but couldn't find the right one yet )
