Mmm
"Titan Hadad is vulnerable!"
Hadad is an alias of Rimmon, one of Satan's named followers in Paradise Lost, and Satan is a subanagram of Taranis!
Stayed out of the Thargoids war (thumbs still painful after bashing 1000+ Scouts during Covid lockdown!)...where are the other Titans? Are they all PL-related?
Took me a while to realise that all ships are named after snakes AND this might be a reference to PL when Satan took a serpent form when he tempted Eve ...
From PL Satan's followers were: Satan (Lucifer, tempter, devil, serpent, Baphomet, old nick, Mephistopheles, Evil one), Beelzebub (Beelzebul, Belzebuth,Belzebub, Belzebu), Moloch (Molech, Molek), Chemos (Chemosh), Baal, Astarte (Ashtaroth, Astoret, Astarit, Inanna, Ishtar, Istar, Ishara, Ashtart, Astart, Athart, Attar) , Thammuz, Dagon, Rimmon (Hadad, Had, Hadda), Osiris (User), Isis (Aset, rusat, usa, else, esa, wusa)...a,iases in parentheses!

Astrophel sounds like "astro fell" ("for those with eyes to see" is stated in the codex. BUT the original (biblical IIRC) saying is "for those with eyes to see and ears to hear"), which implies "fallen star". "Princess Astrophell" could therefore mean a female fallen star- Astarte and Isis were the only named female prime followers of Satan in PL, however since Satan ruled in Hell then his daughter Sin could be viewed as a Princess...
