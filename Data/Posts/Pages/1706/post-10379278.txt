mmm, still pondering anagrams and playing with my spreadsheets investigating same. But Ive found an interesting thing-since starting (a couple of weeks back) my investigation with data for systems within 60 ly of Alioth I've realised I'd forgotten to include the number of bodies in each system. Trying to add the #bodies back in today I did another Spansh systems search for 60ly from Alioth & found a few systems seem to have disappeared from both EDSM and the Spansh system searches :
LHS 2921- unknown permit required
Blu Thua EK-Y b2-0
Traikoa VX-W b30-2 49.4ly - suspiciously all at same distance??
Traikoa VO-R e4-5 49.4ly - " " "
Traikoa FV-D b55-0 49.4ly- " " "
Byeia Thaa LS-Y c28-9 49.4ly- " " "
LHS 3091 57.99ly - unknown permit required

Anybody heard any reason why these should have been deleted?
