Never really got into that narrative but just noticed that one of its listening post is situated in Jotunheim.

So are all listening post AI?

Long time ago I used to think these narratives were only environmental storytelling seeding the forthcoming Thargoid narrative, but I do wonder now if they are more integral to the ‘wider’ Raxxla timeline?!

Likewise I used to think of the Genship in a similar light, until I noticed various hints behind them, like those I would not be surprised if these too were linked.

Interesting

Thread '"Thunderchild" is Jameson's Son'

Mmm, haven't got the patience to read that without more coffee, and short of time this morning. It was fairly clear at the time that a long-delayed light-speed message was picked up by a listening post (think it might have been that which started up my work on a check sheet for LP and UCB). I think Thunderchild was an AI anti-Thargoid entity (either sensor &/or weapon wasn't clear). Nor was it clarified whether it was still onboard GCS Sarasvati or whether it was mobile (a robot?) and had left the ship by some means. The associated numeric seemed to imply it was the first of a series so for a while some of us hunted for those, fruitlessly. It was discussed in this thread, ages ago. No, the LP aren't inherently AI (though it would make sense to incorporate that technology in the signals monitoring devices fitted)...the AI was Thunderchild (unit001) aboard Saraswati. I've always viewed the LP as remote signals monitoring satellites which detect and report their detections to in-game planetary-based monitoring organisations that use the huge dishes seen in many surface sites.
