If The Dark Wheel still exists, it is a far more ruthless organization than The Club. They have managed to keep proof of their existence buried and apparently do not let traitors remain for long. One of many ways to achieve that is cultural passphrases which if mis-spoken carry mortal consequences.

The ‘hero’ travels there either using a magical item, a silver branch, or apple etc; or is kidnapped, or tricked. Once there they experience time shifts and usually have to sacrifice something to return, such as memory or age etc,
A reminder about J. Jameson Jnr.:



This is what Holdstock had to say on Merlin in "About The Broken Kings":

The Merlin in my cycle of stories, the Codex, is a configuration of ideas; the endlessly travelling traveller; the man outside of Time; the wise man and the Fool, embodied in the flesh; the shape-changer who challenges nature. Merlin is the consummate dream of Power over Nature and Weakness over Man.

The CMDRs are special. They exist in different world from that of most humanity. They can travel in ways most humans can only dream. They control their destiny and can see outside of official narratives.

I also find it hilarious that so many CMDRs forget that the Duvals aren't the only royalty of this Universe. The Duval lineage is just the most famous. There are many kingdoms in Elite's Universe.
