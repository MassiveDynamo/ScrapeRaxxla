Never really got into that narrative but just noticed that one of its listening post is situated in Jotunheim.

So are all listening post AI?

Long time ago I used to think these narratives were only environmental storytelling seeding the forthcoming Thargoid narrative, but I do wonder now if they are more integral to the ‘wider’ Raxxla timeline?!

Likewise I used to think of the Genship in a similar light, until I noticed various hints behind them, like those I would not be surprised if these too were linked.

Interesting
