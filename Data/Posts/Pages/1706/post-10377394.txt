Thinking back on things -was there ever any connection made to Project Thunderchild from the Saraswati? Was it an INRA thing or are we still in the dark?
Nope, never saw anything that came from/related to Thunderchild/Saraswati. A few of us hunted for other units that seemed to be hinted at but found nothing. A storyline that was deleted? Something missed? Just a hint at AI that hasn't yet been brought into the game (probably the next threat to fight after Thargoids are beaten?).
Who knows? Hopefully FD, but on that I have some doubts....
Did in passing come across a mythology reference to Saraswati last week, something about a possible link to Hecate and/or rivers of the dead...my mind and memory are currently swamped by Visual Basic (I found a serious error in my anagram testing spreadsheet- fixed that, now trying to figure out how to pass a list of dictionary names to be checked into a Function macro-why is the documentation so bad? Not even found the info in the VBA for Dummies guide)
Edit: now got a copy of Excel VBA programming for Dummies & from the TOC it seems to have what I was hoping to find, but strange it wasn't in the first book; now to read a couple of hundred pages to refresh my memory from around 2010 when I actually knew a bit of programming
