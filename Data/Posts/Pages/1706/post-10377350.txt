Interesting indeed ! .... i can't wait 'til i'm more experienced ( aka richer ) so i can really start to EXPLORE and contribute to uncovering this mystery someday.
Ya ive been playing this from the early days and am always skint. Cant be bothered to do the get rich quick schemes - so am currently waiting for the Arx fleet carrier bundle to be available in the store - i guess that still counts as a get rich quick scheme thoughâ€¦ as to the mystery - ya we havent got far ( well anywhere really)- so lots of room for contributions ! o7
