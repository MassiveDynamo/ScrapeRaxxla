I've been enjoying the game lately more than ever before thanks to exobiology and what I'm doing doesn't even require any meta-builds, engineering, or unusual "exploity" methods. Exobiology hunting on 'first scanned' discoveries is extremely lucrative (tens to hundreds of millions of credits) for such a low effort mechanic and it scratches that itch of being out in the void while mulling over the Raxxla mysteries.
