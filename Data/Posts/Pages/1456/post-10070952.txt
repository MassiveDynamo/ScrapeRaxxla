Prior to FD dropping Guardian teasers what evidence was there to their actual existence?

None?

In terms of development costs and time investment of the Guardian release and subsequent updates in terms of bases, gameplay loop, Ram Tah mission, beacons, lore, ships, weapons, modules, etc... Was that quite a lot for just a way to fight Thargoids?

A few community goals for the engineers to knock up some new weapons based on some Thargoids materials would have been a lot cheaper and quicker?

Another piece of development work that would have taken some time, money and resources... Did anyone work out why?
