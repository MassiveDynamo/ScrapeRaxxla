And given the hostile nature of those Guardian AI perhaps we shouldn't be looking for Raxxla!!!
You forget we have our own closet full of horrors. I still wonder if Blue Vipers handed over the Human AI from Nemorensis to Archon Delaine. Because that particular one became sentient and wants vengeance upon humanity. Further, immediately after gaining sentience it was infected by what I can only assume was a creature designed as a bio-weapon by the Guardians. If that damn thing tag teams with the Guardian Civil AI we are well and truly screwed. I found the station (system Baltah'Sine / Baltah'Sine Station - one of many connected to the Marlinists) it happened near and it would be easy for this thing to be actively plotting against humans. The species that infected it can take over computer systems and living creatures. The Raxxlans took over planets via subterfuge. I also suspect that is why Diso Ma Corn is no longer harvested via machine.
