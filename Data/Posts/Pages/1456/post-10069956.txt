So the Ram Tah lore and his discoveries, yes I've read those but not in details for some time. Whilst I haven't personally ruled out that Raxxla is the construct, not knowing what it is means I haven't ruled out much

So weren't the glyphs used to identify which type of Guardian ancient artifacts you needed to complete his mission?
People read them. But I don’t think they picked them apart the way that we are doing right now which we are starting to understand was probably the developers intentions in the first place. Regular video games just give instructions like what you see is what you get. I think a lot of the clues were missed because this was read the same way. People just thought it was basic knowledge. They are not used to developers throwing a little hints that basically tell you, hey, go over here and Investigate this thing. I just started picking them apart recently. I’ve read them before. Can’t believe how much I didn’t notice. And I’m having the same Epiphany’s looking at some of the markers on the Alpha sites. I am noticing discrepancies in symmetry, certain things aligned a certain way and pointed at certain things, I could go on. It is an enormous amount of stuff to try to figure out on your own. I feel like my head is going to fall Off
