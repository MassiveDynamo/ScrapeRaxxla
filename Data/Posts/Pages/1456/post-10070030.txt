I was drinking next to some old snaggletooth at the bar... I told him I was looking for Raxxla...he drew a symbol with his thumb on the dusty surface....
A line with a triangle attached...

What is that? (I asked)

Thorn - the tree... the
the arrow... The flash of lightning... said he

I remember a Tornqvist.. thorny branch I think... and Cora is that what you mean?

Cora - Kore - the core
The womb, the maiden (he mumbled through his beer)

What do you think the Omphalos is kid? He said with a sideways grin.

I replied: I dont really know I - I was trying to figure out "a place that isnt a place - a door that is also the key"...

Having finished his glass he lifted himself up off his stool - looked at me - and said "if I knew that- would I be here drinking this swill?... but it sounds like Utopia to me...definitely not a place." He winked... As to the key, youve got me... And he proceeded to stagger his way out the door... towards the Arcade.
