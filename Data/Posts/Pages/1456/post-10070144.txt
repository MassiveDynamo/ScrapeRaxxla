So the Ram Tah lore and his discoveries, yes I've read those but not in details for some time. Whilst I haven't personally ruled out that Raxxla is the construct, not knowing what it is means I haven't ruled out much

So weren't the glyphs used to identify which type of Guardian ancient artifacts you needed to complete his mission?
The original description of Raxxla from the Dark Wheel, fits nicely with every planet that has Guardian structures.

"It's (Raxxla) a ghost world. A planet. A legend"
"on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes"

Going by only this information, it's valid to assume that we have not only have found Raxxla. We have found a bunch of Raxxlas. We just don't know how to opperate the gateway.

All Guardian planets are ghost worlds. Their inhabitants are long gone, but the structures are not dead. They also all have alien constructs, that are gateways to the monolith network. That network is probably a universe of it's own, with all the sentient AI that are probably still inn there.
