The original description of Raxxla from the Dark Wheel, fits nicely with every planet that has Guardian structures.

"It's (Raxxla) a ghost world. A planet. A legend"
"on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes"

Going by only this information, it's valid to assume that we have not only have found Raxxla. We have found a bunch of Raxxlas. We just don't know how to opperate the gateway.

All Guardian planets are ghost worlds. Their inhabitants are long gone, but the structures are not dead. They also all have alien constructs, that are gateways to the monolith network. That network is probably a universe of it's own, with all the sentient AI that are probably still inn there.

And given the hostile nature of those Guardian AI perhaps we shouldn't be looking for Raxxla!!!
