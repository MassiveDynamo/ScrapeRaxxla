I replied: I dont really know I - I was trying to figure out "a place that isnt a place - a door that is also the key"...

Having finished his glass he lifted himself up off his stool - looked at me - and said "iHe winked... And he proceeded to stagger his way out the door... towards the Arcade.

The story of the Thorn seems to be a little complex.
It started as a scandinavian rune Thurisaz - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurisaz
It ended as a bit of cheesy advertising as in “Ye Olde Pub” due to the corruption of the thorn symbol and laziness of medieval typesetters.
"Ye Olde" Is Fake Old English (And You're Mispronouncing It Anyway)
You've probably seen phrases like "Ye Olde Tavern" or "Ye Olde Shoppe" scrawled across English-language signs, trying to evoke a sense of the medieval. But the practice of naming shops this way didn't start until the late 19th century and it was done to make things sound, well, old.
