FYI: new update may be the much wanted on-foot alien update. If that is the case, pay attention to limbs and markings while trying not to get killed. We might be about to find out what in the hell we are fighting. Oresrian and Klaxxian had slightly different legs and markings. I don't think this is merely as simple as Thargoids want us dead. If they wanted that, it could have been arranged. Current alien posturing doesn't fit with an agenda of extermination. In other words, please don't shoot first and ask questions later. There is very real chance we haven't been told the truth about what we are fighting. If it doesn't match Codex, I would strongly advise we find a way to de-escalate as this species may or may not know something of this Raxxla business.
