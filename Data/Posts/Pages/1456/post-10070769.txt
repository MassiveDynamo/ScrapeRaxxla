Yes seen it too; very perplexing…

I wouldn’t be surprised. Recalling how FD implemented the Stargoids. The first Cmdr to fall over a Stargoid (apparently they had a RL tip-off) they stated they were able (like many a Cmdr) to chase them, but to their surprise the Stargoid did not just travel in a straight line… but it manoeuvred around stars (like a gravitational sling shot)…?

Not sure how much I put into that source, because if true it’s pretty amazing FD did that… but even MORE amazing they didn’t tell anyone about it (or did they?) and such behaviour went by essentially ignored!

Likewise to this oddity, why would FD intentionally do this, but never promote it nor give us tools to find it!

My gut tells me bug or graphical anomaly…
