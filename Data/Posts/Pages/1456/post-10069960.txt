interesting theory...

"The Lord says the changing positions sometimes dictate motion, and change the meaning of the word. So does the mirroring of two symbols turned facing each other or turned opposite each other. All of these things change the meaning of the actual glyph. So this is an extremely limited written language that changes meaning every time you change the position of its characters." - did you really mean "the Lord"?? and what do you base this on and do you have some evidence to demonstrate it?

in terms of the images you mentioned can you put them on here?

"None of the markings are decorative. All of them have a purpose or an instructional reason."
