Uhh, okay so something freaky is going on in Sol and I managed to record it. I'll need to go back and verify, but I was traveling through Sector 16 and using the Orrery map to position myself. At first nothing was happening, but when I switched back to the Orrery map I was suddenly in sector 30. After traveling downward some I jumped back to 16.

It only appears to happen on the Orrery map, not actual physical locations in space, but I'll test some more and see. I'll upload the video later.

Yep, pointed this out last Wednesday
The Quest To Find Raxxla
I googled “a place that is not a place “ And found this https://www.academia.edu/12797296/A_Place_That_Is_Not_A_Place_Essays_in_Liminality_and_Text_Introduction_ Has anyone read this? Deff an eyebrow raiser.... Why do I have a sinking feeling that book would somehow explain the Toast of TDW...
