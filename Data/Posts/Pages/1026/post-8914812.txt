I never said that I thought discovery of Raxxla required a Wing.

I said that I think whatever is in Sol’s asteroid belt is triggered by discovery scanner honk but that you need to be very close to it. That would be easier done by coordinated scanning in a Wing. I fully expect since Raxxla is DB’s own Easter egg there is likely to be something special about the trigger to access it.

But that does give an approximate date for the supposed DB quote which might help in searching for the source, it was released in March 2015, though I suspect the interview was deleted by FD.
