Uhh, okay so something freaky is going on in Sol and I managed to record it. I'll need to go back and verify, but I was traveling through Sector 16 and using the Orrery map to position myself. At first nothing was happening, but when I switched back to the Orrery map I was suddenly in sector 30. After traveling downward some I jumped back to 16.

It only appears to happen on the Orrery map, not actual physical locations in space, but I'll test some more and see. I'll upload the video later.
I sadly think there is a bug in orrey map with the location of the player spaceship. I have seen this a lot of starsystem and I have reported that bug.
