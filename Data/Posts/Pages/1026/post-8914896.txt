I heard they failed their last health inspection. the last thing I need is another case of space sharts.

you likely wouldn't know if you did or not. Since we live forever in our suit while in the ship, it's likely that our space suit has a tube that goes right up there so your waste can be connected to your chair's port. Special little tidbit, your ship ejects the accrued waste whenever jumping thru hyperspace.

And now we know why the thargoids are hostile to us.
