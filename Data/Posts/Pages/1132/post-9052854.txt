I like your hypothesis, the only thing I would disagree with is this statement, as we aren't really certain on either of those points. The previous game lore is incomplete and/or questionable (both in terms of its accuracy, and as to whether it is canon or not).

My comment about what fdev had done previously with raxxla has nothing to do with lore in elite dangerous. Just noting what they've done in the past. Nothing about the previous games is canonical. Some of things that were canon in elite dangerous at launch specifically for elite dangerous aren't even canon anymore.
