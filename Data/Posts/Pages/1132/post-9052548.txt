Ya i do like that - It would give a date for the Thetis crossing the moon. I just seem to remember the Golconda saying they were going to send a message to all the dynasty projects on that same day and I only saw the one message being received... so I assumed it was the Golconda one.... but I like your idea much better
Not familiar with all the megaship logs, so will take a look at Golconda and others also. Most of that stuff was found during my hiatus.
