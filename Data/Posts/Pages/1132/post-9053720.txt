My comment about what fdev had done previously with raxxla has nothing to do with lore in elite dangerous. Just noting what they've done in the past. Nothing about the previous games is canonical.
Actually, with some exceptions like the Guardians and other new plotlines, most of the lore in Elite Dangerous draws from Frontier First Encounters. The issue is that they have been selective, so we often do not know what is or is not in play, so to speak, until something is confirmed in game. Take a look for a certain tourist beacon that discusses a certain assassination for example (hint: it is in Beta Hydri). Then take a look at the FFE journals for that person's name and what they had written that caused them to be assassinated. The references are sometimes obvious, sometimes more subtle.
