Ya i do like that - It would give a date for the Thetis crossing the moon. I just seem to remember the Golconda saying they were going to send a message to all the dynasty projects on that same day and I only saw the one message being received... so I assumed it was the Golconda one.... but I like your idea much better
Ya i looked kind hard into this because of my interest in the confluence- but I think the "Signal" that everyone heard was the signal from the Galconda warning the other sites that they were about to be attacked by their supposed "guards". I will have to dig it out later - But ya the thing about witchspace being "different" there i still need to follow up on

Golconda?? Think youâ€™re getting your megaships mixed up. Formidine Rift was Zurara!
