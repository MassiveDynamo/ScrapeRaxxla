Cant find it, maybe archived. Not under Allen Stroud or Thargod or Thargoid123 anyway. Hope you have better luck.

All - remember DW wrote the whole Zuara mystery and doesnt know where Raxxla is, but almost certainly added some tinfoil to mean it could be read as linked to Raxxla somehow, misdirection or just good writing to create mystery. It was more about the Club's previous solution to the Thargoid Invasion before FSD iirc and to build into the bigger plot about the next Thargoid Invasion which may have been postponed (out of his control, it was written in good faith at the time). Follow his Lore Tour and youll see hes not even certain anymore what has been left in and what has been retconned or postponed or chucked out completely. And that Tour was in the middle of the GalNet strike so it may have changed again....as in the Thargs may be back in 2 years and its back on course or it may be something else entirely now.
With the tharg build up in the Coalsack after the Alliance terrabombed their homes it ain’t going to be 2 years!

I predict they’re waiting for Odyssey release so they can get their tentacles/claws on us & rip us to shreds!
