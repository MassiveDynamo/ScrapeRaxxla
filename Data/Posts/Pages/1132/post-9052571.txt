Ya i looked kind hard into this because of my interest in the confluence- but I think the "Signal" that everyone heard was the signal from the Galconda warning the other sites that they were about to be attacked by their supposed "guards". I will have to dig it out later - But ya the thing about witchspace being "different" there i still need to follow up on
