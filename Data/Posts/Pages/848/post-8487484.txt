Yep. Raxxla is an asteroid, which is why we haven't managed to find it

No, dont have a mining laser. The Audet Somniare is over-engineered for jump range 70ly on fumes - not bad for an ASP Explorer - but it does mean limited mod cons

Mmm, in that case in the event of running low on jumponium when you find Raxxla you might have to wait for space legs to get out on that asteroid with a hammer & chisel!
