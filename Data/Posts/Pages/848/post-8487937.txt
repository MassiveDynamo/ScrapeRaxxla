I have a question about raxxla in old elite games. If i remember correctly the first elite game uses pairs of letters to give planets names and there wasn't "xx" combination. The closest combination was planet "Rainla".
And I found interview with Ian Bell that tells about it Link .
Q: The most important question that worries many so far: was Raxxla in game?
A: I remember this. Although the rumor about Raxxla was widespread, it was not in the original program.

So my question is - which old elite game has raxxla? (If it known for sure)
