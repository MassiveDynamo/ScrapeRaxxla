Ya I got it from an old monk, I traded some Leestian Evil Juice for it while I was traveling through Grandmort a few years back ... looking for the real Soontill. The monk had several different trinkets for sale as well... I think its where I picked up my Bobbling Effigy too... he called it The Brayben or something like that.
That wouldn't happen to have been an electric monk would it?
