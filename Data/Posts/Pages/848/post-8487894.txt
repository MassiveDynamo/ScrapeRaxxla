Not sure, maybe it is collectible? I just found example, in russian it is called "inhabited island", not sure why was translated as is now. Also there is movie.
It doesn't have to be a collectable. I've just checked and it's gone now, but a while ago, there was some cheeky git seller on Amazon selling one of my books for £250!!!! (Pro SQL Server Administration - Amazon price £35)
