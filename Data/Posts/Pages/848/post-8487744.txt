so I found this in my random searches online, and im wondering if anyone here can confirm this was the case in the game?

"First Encounters actually contains a mission that takes the player character to the Polaris system, where he can dock to a Thargoid Space Station. When you leave it, you discover that you are not in the Polaris system anymore, but in another solar system called Miackce, home to the Thargoids. If you accept and complete the mission that the Thargoids give you, you can then get several extremely powerful Thargoid ships"

And if that is true, what are the chances or atleast, everyones opinon on, this being a viable option for ED ? a mission that will take us to Polaris or another system, more likely a current Thargoid system, and ect, maybe leading to becoming "allied" with the Thargoid and not being attacked by them when carrying their tech or somthing?

I dont know how I thought it would apply to Raxxla specifically, but I am curious if it sparks somthing in anyone here....

Other than that, im going to log in shortly for a few hours, if anyone has any ideas of systems to check out, please feel free to send em over, Im currently completely out of ideas of where to search, SpaceX launch yesterday didnt give me any ideas lol

Speaking of which, was a great time to view the launch in person yesterday, I reccommend it to anyone who gets a chance to go see one in person, its a really great experience!
