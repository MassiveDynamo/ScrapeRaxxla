This black magic, labyrinth, darkness......This is relevant to me, big time. This is the first time I've seen this book. Thanks for sharing.
Ya I got it from an old monk, I traded some Leestian Evil Juice for it while I was traveling through Grandmort a few years back ... looking for the real Soontill. The monk had several different trinkets for sale as well... I think its where I picked up my Bobbling Effigy too... he called it The Brayben or something like that.
