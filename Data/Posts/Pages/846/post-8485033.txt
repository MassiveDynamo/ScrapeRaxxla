Wasn't the lore also indicating the intelligent half of the Goids where Raxxlan or am I mis-informed?

The latter!
Lore from two books (Premonition & Out of The Darkness says two tribes(?) of goids in a civil war. Nothing about originating in Raxxla. Soontill was theirs until they lost it. Robert Garry destroyed the treasure in OOTD
