Miacke, a bilingual combination of Arabic and Greek, miyāh and νίκη, means: "victorious waters". The Anointed one (with sheep-fat?) once said in his Magnum Opus:
"And he said unto me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely."
It's the Universal Solvent, The Eagle Stone, Chrysopoeia, Prima Materia, Apa Vietii, The Waters of Shintara (carbonated)!
No wonder all major world religions were trademarked by the Coca-Cola company in the 23rd century...
