The latter!
Lore from two books (Premonition & Out of The Darkness says two tribes(?) of goids in a civil war. Nothing about originating in Raxxla. Soontill was theirs until they lost it. Robert Garry destroyed the treasure in OOTD
Oh I see. I got the goid info from the OP. Specifically "The Holdstock Report". If information in that is wrong then should it be in the OP or a least inform the reader the info in it may be wrong.
