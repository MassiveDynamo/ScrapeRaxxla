I was interdicted many times by 3 Thargoid interceptors. 2 of them always immediately leave after scanning while third stays to attack.

Ive been interdicited many times, but never been attacked once....
What are you doing when you get interdicted? Thargoids usually just scan you and leave you alone unless you prevoke them by having thargoid tech in your cargo, or trying to scan them, or attack them, or have guardian tech I think...
