good theory... only, if recolection serves, thargoids attack if you have any of their tech in your cargo hold, so they wouldnt make a hyper jump to leave.... if you happen to find a left over hyperspace window with no thargoids around, that might work... i did see one youtube video like that, someone found one and tried to enter it, but they were in normal space, not SC or anything, and no thargoid tech on them....

couple different theories that could be tested for the right pilot... i might test entering it while jumping into SC, but Im not risking thargoid tech, not too mention i dont have a proper cargo hold for it yet.... lol i did one mission with thargoid tech for Obsidian Orbital, lmao, it was only 1 system jump away to get it and come back... was not the best experience haha, i made it first try tho, lol didnt have to jettison it and try again

anywho, i really gotta crash out, lol shouldnt even have replied now haha

07 CMDR, safe flying!

I was interdicted many times by 3 Thargoid interceptors. 2 of them always immediately leave after scanning while third stays to attack.
