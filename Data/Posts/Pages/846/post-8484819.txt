Are you trying to follow a goid wake?
I’ve tried unsuccessfully & I’m sure others have, but would be interested to hear if you have any success.

At the surface sites seem to remember you need a UA to get through the door, then shoot the UProbe from the antechamber to load into the machine to trigger the galaxy display. Cant remember the details, so long since I did it, but seem to remember Cmdr Exigeous has a good vid.
