They're only in normal space. My thinking is from thargoid surface sites require a thargoid sensor to enter and the door just opens for you as if you were meant to be there. Granted the thargoids themselves recognize you as not being a thargoid visibly but I doubt the same could be said for a wormhole unless it is somehow sent you.

Maybe drop them a metal alloy and they'll leave you alone I haven't tried this myself yet
If you managed to get through, what do you expect to be on the other side?
If it's the Thargoid home system I think you'd be in trouble from the Thargoid authorities the moment you got there and I think that they wouldn't be the most welcoming bunch if you're not Thargoidy in any way.
But hey! I may be wrong and they might welcome you with open arms/tentacles or whatever appendages they use.
