May not have undergone rigorous scientific peer review!
If that's the case then IMO Most of the OP Needs a revision of some sorts. As I see it, there is a lot of confusion as to "what is" and "what isn't". Lots of potential clues leading peeps off in the total opposite direction of where they want to or need to go and wasting time and effort on fairy tales instead of viable clues and finding out after (in this thread) that they are just wasting their time fumbling about in the dark.
