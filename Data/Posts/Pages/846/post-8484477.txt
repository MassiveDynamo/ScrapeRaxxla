They're only in normal space. My thinking is from thargoid surface sites require a thargoid sensor to enter and the door just opens for you as if you were meant to be there. Granted the thargoids themselves recognize you as not being a thargoid visibly but I doubt the same could be said for a wormhole unless it is somehow sent you.
