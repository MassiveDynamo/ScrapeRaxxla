...about orbits & speeds. FCes do the same. On low orbit speed is so big so people could not catch own FC.
Well, everything is proper as for me - close to planet = bigger orbital speed (rotate faster). So u need faster ship to maneuver around. 290m/s is nothing. It's a slowest military air interceptor, too slow for orbits.
I had similar I think. Couldn't drop into war zone which was too close to planet. was always missing it
