They're only in normal space. My thinking is from thargoid surface sites require a thargoid sensor to enter and the door just opens for you as if you were meant to be there. Granted the thargoids themselves recognize you as not being a thargoid visibly but I doubt the same could be said for a wormhole unless it is somehow sent you.

Maybe drop them a metal alloy and they'll leave you alone I haven't tried this myself yet

very true, and eveyone here has good opinions about this, i like it

but my idea, is to start like 2 or 3 KM or somthing away from the wormhole, pointing straight at it, but sitting at Zero throttle....charge your SC to full... than give er full throttle and hit your boost so that your SC drive starts the 4 sec count down, and then see what happens when it kicks in and you go into the wormhole...

I know they only exist in "normal" space, but as your accelerating towards it, it should still exist, until you hit SC speed, at which point you should be hitting the wormhole head on....
Just kinda like the same thinng when you forget to slow down when SC Assist cant see the target, and you go flying past, somtimes hitting planets orbits or worse, slamming right into the station you were trying to get too... basically same idea, but into the left over wormhole... again like @Filthymick420 said, it also may require having Tharoid tech, like a probe, on board as well....
