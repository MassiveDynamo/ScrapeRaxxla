Mmm, thought the lore is (used to be) that they didnt know where it is and are also looking for it.
Goid wake more likely to lead to Miacke (spelling ?) (Col 70 sector FY-N C21-3 !!)
If the lore says the bugs are looking for raxxla, does that add credence to my theory about us being "supposed to find Raxxla" when finding the Zaraua and the logs from that ship matching Raxxla codex?
