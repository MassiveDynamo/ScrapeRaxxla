You are probably right, but I seem to remember Drew saying there were some things he was asked to put into the story.
Personally I would not be surprised if there was a link, although if there is, Drew was obviously not made aware
I watched his stream about Raxxla and I don't remember him using the requirements made by FDev as a clue. Given the fact, the he enlisted in supporting the expansion of TDW, I would personally not invest time searching Sol at this point in time.
