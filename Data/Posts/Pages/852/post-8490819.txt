The unnamed gas giant. I have always read it as the name was not given. Never occurred to me that the gas giant might not have a name. Lol. Funny how people read things differently.

Regarding Triton - I had similar thoughts. Spent ages becoming an ally of Mother Gia and every other faction in Sol. Didn't unlock anything, but I am only double elite. When I get back to the bubble I might grind out my combat ranks and head back to Sol.

I have some other Sol theories as well. One regarding the Martin artifact. One regarding the brightest asteroid in Sol which I'm yet to locate in game. The final regarding Sue, Cripple and Sneer (but that will require space legs!)
"The essence of all things is the Nameless. The Nameless is unknowable, mightier even than Brahma. Things pass, but the essence remains. You sit, therefore, in the midst of a dream. Essence dreams it a dream of form. Forms pass, but the essence remains, dreaming new dreams. Man names these dreams and thinks to have captured the essence, not knowing that he invokes the unreal. These stones, these walls, these bodies you see seated about you are poppies and water and the sun. They are the dreams of the Nameless. They are fire, if you like."
