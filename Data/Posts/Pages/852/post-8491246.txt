Salomé is Drew Wagar's character and he mentioned multiple times, that he does not know the location of Raxxla. Therefore I find it unlikely Salomè's actions in-game are a direct hint.
You are probably right, but I seem to remember Drew saying there were some things he was asked to put into the story.
Personally I would not be surprised if there was a link, although if there is, Drew was obviously not made aware
