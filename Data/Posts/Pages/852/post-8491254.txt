You are probably right, but I seem to remember Drew saying there were some things he was asked to put into the story.
Personally I would not be surprised if there was a link, although if there is, Drew was obviously not made aware
I wouldnt at all be surprised if, Raxxla being unfound, certain things were possibly retconned for there to be clues in books without the authors knowledge.

I dont necessarily believe that to be the case but I am open to its possibility
