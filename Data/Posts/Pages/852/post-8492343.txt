I watched his stream about Raxxla and I don't remember him using the requirements made by FDev as a clue. Given the fact, the he enlisted in supporting the expansion of TDW, I would personally not invest time searching Sol at this point in time.
There's a LOT of funny things happening in Sol... for starters, just yesterday I was passing by and as I target the Sol star it would scan it indefinitely and after getting close enough to it my main screen lower left corner box was stating "UNEXPLORED"... the asteroid belt is displayed on system map but you cannot target-to-drop there.

So, let me ask you this... can anyone be 100% sure that there's nothing else to uncover in Sol?
