well, looks like space legs and atmospheric landings is confirmed. we have to hurry boys, and find raxxla real quick before then, or else, we will have to add walking on foot to the search and tinfoil. walking everywhere, checking every hill and crater for raxxla. i am not ready...lol
SPOILER: ELITE DANGEROUS ODYSSEY

SWEET, looks SICK..... I have been flip floping on Elite Feet and if they'd add them ever, because I couldnt find anywhere where Fdev ever promised them....
But this is amazing, I knew the game was designed around "full size" simulation, but with "no gravity" in our ships, and only SOME gravity in stations, depending, lol., I was very unsure if ED was going to give us Elite Feet at all...

OMG, what happens if you go to planet with high gravity, and can just barely land safly, lol, but you decide to go for a walk... do you get crushed?? LMAO... Cant wait for the testing to begin lmfao
