The SOL system includes the gas giants JUPITER, SATURN, URANUS, and NEPTUNE.
Salome (aka KAHINA TIJANI LOREN) made a seemingly special effort to visit the outer gas giants of the system SOL prior to her disappearance.
Salomé is Drew Wagar's character and he mentioned multiple times, that he does not know the location of Raxxla. Therefore I find it unlikely Salomè's actions in-game are a direct hint.
