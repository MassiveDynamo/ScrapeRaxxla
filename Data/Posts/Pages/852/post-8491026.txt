In my understanding, the DarkWheel home system and hidden station is a Brown Dwarf star somewhat close to Sol but not visible in the Galaxy Map... this would make it "Unnamed" and most likely would require a player to actually fly there in SC until it shows up on the left-side panel so you could hyper jump there.

NASA estimates about several of such Brown Dwarf star systems close by

and there's Michael Brooks mentioning "dark" stellar bodies/systems being added to the game and I have no news on if any of those were already found.

I think MB comments relate to LYT type stars, seem to remember someone said those were “dark systems”, though might have been during an FD livestream. But I think in-game L & Y are too purple to be the star of TDW station pic; I did have a look at quite a few T systems around the bubble but never found that looked the right colour. I snipped out that codex pic, compared the lights on the back of the station to those of Aulin Enterprise (which is the same type), adjusted the colour balance to match them and think the star is an M VI, a subdwarf which are really quite red. Of course FD might have just created a random example for that pic, but...

But hey, I’m the man who spent weeks trying to track down the viewpoint of the startup video sequence on the assumption that was a hint to Raxxla!
