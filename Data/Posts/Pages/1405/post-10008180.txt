Well, we also have the crash of Transport Lakon Baker Gamma Sierra Heavy which is suggestive of source material being hundreds of novels, background simulation being also more akin to universe simulation through something like Utopia's Sim-Archive as hinted at in the GalNet "Utopia Plans for Humanity's Extinction". It is notable the crash probably happened from the Wiccan Ware Race that is in First Encounters and became the basis of CMDR Alec Turner's Buckyball Racing Club Cargo manifest from the crash is as follows:


TRANSPORT LAKON BAKER GAMMA SIERRA HEAVY
Committed cargo manifest:
10 units – Heavy Metals
419 units – Historical Novels (Secrets of Simulating Backgrounds)
7 units – Liquor
11 units – Explosives
