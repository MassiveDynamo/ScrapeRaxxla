Argh! Well, I think you're actually crazy

The issue with a lot of the stuff you're suggesting are connections between AW and ED - ultimately it doesn't seem to actually help make any more sense of any clue we do have (I.e. the Codex) and doesn't seem to produce any result that can be tested and eliminated or proven. Even if, as you believe, there are connections to AW, how does that actually help? and moreso, why hasn't it helped over the past 8 years of people making those same connections?

Having said that, If you have anything actually testable that you need a hand with I'm genuinely happy to help - I think we're only going to progress by helping each other test ideas - but I really do need some actual things to test out or I'm going to keep saying your ideas on AW connections are crazy

I'm currently heading off to the system wanted someone else to look at, although I think he's got me on ignore (lol) so could someone he's not ignoring please find out from him what he actually wants tested? He said something about combat there? it's over 2kly from Sol so it's not a quick trip

Once that's done I'm happy to test whatever crazy Talmor Lens idea you've got, so let me know

You're certainly entitled to that opinion yet I'm still the one who has made the most thorough case for unified lore between all the games and books. I'll be back in the Bubble once I have fueled up my carrier for rescue operations and looking for the station referenced in the Brewer Corporation codex. We have clues. It is high time we find something that actually limits scope of the search.
