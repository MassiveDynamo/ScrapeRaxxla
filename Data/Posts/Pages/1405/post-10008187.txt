1) Soontill is a planet and is nothing to do with Raxxla, which doesnt even have a physical form.
2) Raxxla wasnt 'made' by anyone nor has it anything do with the Osir-Raxxla who named themselves after it.
3) Trying to tie Raxxla, Soontill and whatever other random theories people throw around wont be helpful, as they all have as little to do with it as TDW, who never found it.
It was though the cover story proposed presumably by The Dark Wheel or The Club as to why they supposedly didn't have access to Raxxla which seems highly suspect given it happens 999 years after Raxxla.
