Ok, just to keep you informed. Second account young clone Tyko has just dived the black hole star B in PSR J0737-3039A system, with no result.
IRL PSR J0737-3039A and B are "Marta's Pulsars", the only known double pulsar according to Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_J0737âˆ’3039

In ED there are two co-located systems here, PSR J0737-3039A and PSR J0737-3039B. PSR J0737-3039B has a pulsar as the main star plus several gas giants and moons.
PSR J0737-3039A has the primary and tertiary stars as NS, with B as a black hole. Since I expected PSR J0737-3039A to be a handcrafted system due to its astronomical importance I was a bit surprised by the way these are laid out in-game, and intrigued by the double system- I can't see an astronomical catalogue used for game input only containing PSR J0737-3039B, so it seemed like perhaps a clue... But, as I said, nothing found in the BH

Beginning to run out of reasonably accessible gravitational wave sources...I know MB said it was a personal journey, which might imply it's a long way away. But FD were surprised when people reached SAG A* so quickly after game release, they thought it would take years for people to journey that far, so I feel that implies they would have located Raxxla not quite so far away. This system is 3,586 LY from Sol!
So my thoughts are turning back to HIP 68385 and that rather strange "comms installtion" Josie Rosa for a disguised Omphalos Rift...

Edit: have just supercharged at the NS primary stars in systems PSR J0737-3039A and PSR J0737-3039B, but each only gave the usual 4X boost. Now on my way to check otut the NS PSR J0737-3039A C, but it's 220,000ls away and I feel lunch will intervene, the copawlot is giving my left leg strange looks....

edit2:
made it with all limbs intact, copawlot definitely hungry though. Only got the usual 4x boost at PSR J0737-3039A C

Next stop Circinus Pulsar- only 16.4 kylies... 233 jumps!
