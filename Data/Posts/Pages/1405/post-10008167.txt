First problem, Soontill was Thargoid at least per "..And Here The Wheel". Let's not forget that both species seem to be utterly allergic to presence of the other. If Thargoids are behind Raxxla it will repulse Guardian technology. Correspondingly, if Guardian no Thargoid will go near it or it would have been destroyed. Seemingly, humans are the only ones foolhardy enough to touch both, let alone put either of their technology anywhere near the other.

You second problem is you are forgetting a certain 999 year problem in that "...And Here the Wheel" based on ships present happened approximately 3297 which is 999 years AFTER the Raxxla rumor.

Thirdly, even the experts had major problems validating Soontill Relics. Nevermind that Elvira Martuuk thought the Soontill Relics were a scam which is why she requested them to gain access to her facility. So, too, did the people who analyzed the artifacts in the GalNet "". This two paragraphs are important:

And the results? Inconclusive. The research team’s results clearly state that no known human technology could have created the relics, . Whatever they are, they are indeed very old, with isotopic dating indicating that they .

1) Soontill is a planet and is nothing to do with Raxxla, which doesnt even have a physical form.
2) Raxxla wasnt 'made' by anyone nor has it anything do with the Osir-Raxxla who named themselves after it.
3) Trying to tie Raxxla, Soontill and whatever other random theories people throw around wont be helpful, as they all have as little to do with it as TDW, who never found it.
