It was though the cover story proposed presumably by The Dark Wheel or The Club as to why they supposedly didn't have access to Raxxla which seems highly suspect given it happens 999 years after Raxxla.
None of that counters what I said,if anything you confirm they didnt have access to Raxxla and therefore neither The Club nor TDW have had Raxxla at least TDW are honest enough to even admit publicly they never found it... knowing what something is and having it in your hand are two different things.
