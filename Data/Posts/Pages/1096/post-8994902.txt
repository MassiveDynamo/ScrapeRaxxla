Nope, AFAIK, Jacques was originally intended to go to Beagle Point by FD. The misjump to Colonia happened as a result of the massive UA bombing of Jacques Station by various players in advance of the jump happening. It was still done by FD, as those kind of jumps were all server side things implemented by FD, and so still is a plot device of sorts, but a one which was responsive and adaptive to player action, rather than being a purely pre-planned plot device. It's been cited before by FD as an example of where player action changed the storyline.
Ah yes, the reported destination was BP and the “misjump” was implemented by FD server side, but come on-
as soon as Galnet reported that UAs damaged stations FD were hanging a sign on the side of Jaques saying “bomb me”!!!
I think if certain players hadn’t jumped on that “gameplay” path then FD would have still had gone that route.
