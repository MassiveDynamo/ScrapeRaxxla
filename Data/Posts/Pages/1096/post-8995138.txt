they were joking, the Morse spells out Hesperus, and theres a whole GalNet article about the Hesperus....basically its a mystery in the making so keep your eyes open co nobody knows when it will drop....or where for that matter.

Edit: There was a Twitter pic with Morse Code spelling 'Hesperus' and a separate LS where in Morse 'Adamastor' was repeated twice at the beginning so they werent joking although as you will see it took me some time to catch up
