Currently in Sol's main asteroid belt investigating the "asteroid clusters". Sunday I found them in segments 5, 17, 8, today in 21, 5, 22, 5. In mid December I found them in segments 21, 17, 6, 15, 8, 11, 19, 5, 19 & 6. (My numbering scheme:

). Now someone spotted that the belt is rotating slowly, so don't know if that affects my numbering scheme. Getting fed up with this! Not interesting gameplay!!
