Currently in Sol's main asteroid belt investigating the "asteroid clusters". Sunday I found them in segments 5, 17, 8, today in 21, 5, 22, 5. In mid December I found them in segments 21, 17, 6, 15, 8, 11, 19, 5, 19 & 6. (My numbering scheme:

). Now someone spotted that the belt is rotating slowly, so don't know if that affects my numbering scheme. Getting fed up with this! Not interesting gameplay!!
Asteroids in the main belt orbits the sun in about 3.5-5.5 years. I guess even invisible clusters orbits at about this pace.
