In the original Elite game, a miss-jump would imply you dropping in whichspace... you ended up on a dark area with no visible stars or planets and a bunch of Thargoid ships around just to attack if they notice your ship flying too fast.

In Elite dangerous, whenever your jump drive malfunctions, you arrive someplace else in normal space... you can still call it a miss-jump, but not the same kind we'd would have in the original game.
In FE2 and I think also FFE you would get a drive malfunction, if you skipped drive maintenance. It would drop you in interstellar space, between the departure and the destination system. This would often leave you stranded, with no option but reloading a save file.
