OK so it looks to me that this whole ship of fools narrative is obviously gearing up towards Odyssey.

Thanks to leaked content and FD we know there is to be Thargoid fighting coming, there’s war brewing, and I believe this story is setting up for some reveal possibly within the loop or some other nebula. That much I feel is certain.

Just a waiting game at present, in my humble opinion, no content will be uploaded until FD are ready, possibly just in time for Alpha. So I’m not going to get my pantaloons in a twist over it.

Is it regarding Raxxla? I hope by Zeus’s beard it isn’t but experience teaches if something seems too good to be true, it probably is, so it works in reverse here.

At most the Col sector will get unlocked or the ships give a triangulation point of origin / destination and a star to sail by...
