Heres one for you, the new spinning wheel of death that is coming for us currently can be listened to through the FSS from anywhere within around a 2k ly radius (Not confirmed further but I can do it 2kly out) what if Raxxla could be "listened to" also as a way to locate, this was proposed in the past with the sound of Sag A and other fss noises.

Here be the wheel ;-) also what if the Dark wheel station is the old Thargoid station (its going to be like a round wheel if Thargoid designed) from the older Elite game in Polaris and they are using that to travel far distances to try find Raxxla ;-)
This is what i always though "The Whisper in witch space" meant but FSS is a very time consuming thing when you have 0% idea on where to point it lol

Ive been out of the game for 2 years trying to read up all on these posts is killing me, and so far it appears all we Truly have is the Dark Wheel Toast to go on for sure lol.
