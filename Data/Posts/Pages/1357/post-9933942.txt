Very good analysis, I think you're right about the public TDW, it must be impostors.
My current theory is that it is impossible to find Raxxla directly. We have to go through TDW, and with hints from them (or possibly with a relic in their possession that "open one's eyes"). TDW, they could be findable, but it's probably useless (either no interaction, or swarm of very high profile NPC). We may have to make ourselves worthy to be contacted, like those ancient adventurers.
It is hinted that they were treasure seekers, explorators. Combat isn't mentioned at all. Exploration might be the key. Maybe visit enough sectors of the galaxy? Half? All?

Besides, I have a question. I'm not a native english speaker and I can't find the correct meaning for "on the brow of the mother of galaxies".
It is often translated as "on the forehead". But "brow" could also be a singular for "eye-brows".
"forehead" => something central
"eye-brow" => something peripheral, possibly rounded
How do you understand it?

It’s poetic license, can mean anything, it’s interchangeable, something don’t believe FD countered for, it’s interpretation into another language.

Brow could be associated with a face true, but also the cusp of a hill, or a very large object.

Mother of galaxies is the same, there are multiple historical as well as literal interpretations to choose from.
