I don't know if this has been posted in 1357 pages so here goes.

RAXXLA (All upper case).

RAXXLA: The connection between matter and spirit. These letters stand for material, money, power, ambition, strength, intelligence and courage. But it also represents pride, intolerance, domination and impulsiveness.

RAXXLA is an esoteric word relating to numerology and there is also some cosmos and planetary info included. At first I thought this might be to do with Roman numerals but there is no Roman number represented by R or A.

Big long article here:

Here is another link relating to RAXXLA numerology in Gematria format. How you decipher it I don't know.
