The Club is Drew's creation, if I am not wrong.
Then I seriously doubt it is related in any way to Raxxla.
I even would say we'll never hear of it again.

Drew has confirmed that the Club is an inhouse creation from FD.
I’m not sure they know any more of Raxxla, than we do. They do fit the ‘sinister cabal’ description though.
