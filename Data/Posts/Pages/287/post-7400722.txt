Has anyone looked at dates in the game and compared them to real life. Now that this game has a real time date we can compare anything in the games history.

For instance: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Cooperative

First conflict with the thargoids in 3125. if it's 3305 then: 3305-3125=180. 2019-180=1839. What if anything happened in 1839 that would make sense. Since this game is british I would assume it's something from their perspective potentially. So, what is notable to the british from 1839? If not what else happened in 1839 that might equal the thargoids? https://www.hisdates.com/years/1839-historical-events.html

The same thing can be done with the disbanding of the galcop charter: 3305-3174=131. 2019-131=1888. What if anything collapsed in 1888? https://www.hisdates.com/years/1888-historical-events.html

3305-2498=807. 2019-807=1212?! https://www.hisdates.com/years/1212-historical-events.html


<Not really needed.>


1839 Jan 09 Thomas Henderson measures first stellar parallax (Alpha Centauri) on this day in history.

Stuff in game dates like this also line up to potentially important astrological related history conveniently.

Jan 10 Tea from India 1st arrives in UK on this day in history.

Or do the thargoids represent tea i some manner... Maybe they equate to a real life thing related to tea coming to england?! What type of tea came to england at that point. Or what is the significance of Indian tea?

Or are the thargoids the british? Jan 19 In the year 1839 aden conquered by British East India Company
Aug 23 On this day in history hong Kong is taken by British in war with China.
Sep 05 In the year 1839 the First Opium War begins in China.
Nov 03 First opium war-2 British frigates engage several Chinese junks on this day in history.
