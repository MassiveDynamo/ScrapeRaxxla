Identifiers from different Star Cartalogues are used in Elite Dangerous (e.g. HIP, HD, HR, UBV etc.). You may search for different Identifiers of a star by SIMBAD Astronomical Database.

E.g. if you are looking for zeta cassiopaie http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=zeta+cassiopeiae&submit=SIMBAD+search
you will see that for example its Identifier at the HIP -Catalogue is: HIP 2920

Thanks, that's perfect, I'll use this to dig up those unnamed stars although I'm not elite on anything yet so not sure what Raxxla secrets I'll find of any at this stage.
