Ok, but knowing (a little bit) Drew... Not sure he would have accepted someone telling him what to write.
Which is not the same thing than accepting off-limits and border lines (Raxxla, Thargs and antigravity).

Btw... Where are Raan, Luko and CÂ° ? And The Club ?

EDIT: right , Comandante ! FD's idea ! A guidance for Premonition script ? Or will it have further developpements ?
