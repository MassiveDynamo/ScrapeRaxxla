I know it's really the only true source we have about Raxxla now, but how is it that we know the Codex entry is a clue at all and not just a red herring?

It's kind of like TDW faction in Shin, would this deeply secretive group really advertise their map to their station? Or Raxxla, if that were the case?

Unless they needed independent, loose cannon CMDRs to find something, and maybe the riddle is the crucible for the worthy.

I've come to believe that the Dark Wheel group in the Shinrarta Dezhra system is indeed the actual Dark Wheel, and I believe the first paragraph of the Dark Wheel Codex entry lends evidence to this assertion.

"Oh, they're out there alright. I've never met them, but I know they're out there. Think about
how well known the stories are. Now think about how easy it would be for some two-bit
band of hucksters to pass themselves off as the Dark Wheel and start trading on their
reputation. Doesn't happen, does it? Not for long, anyway. Whenever someone tries to
usurp the Dark Wheel name, sooner or later they get quietly shut down. And that's how I
know"

Simply put, if the Dark Wheel organization present in the Shinrarta Dezhra system was not the actual Dark Wheel, then the true Dark Wheel would have shut them down long ago. Even if the Dark Wheel lets them operate only to serve as a front or a ruse, I believe that the search for Raxxla will start with them, as Frontier has stated that they do have to make it "a tiny bit obvious" and nothing is more obvious than having a group calling themselves the Dark Wheel out in the open.
