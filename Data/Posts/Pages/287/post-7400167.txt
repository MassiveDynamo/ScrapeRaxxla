Well, considering CODEX gives us that rumor and "The Club" perfectly fits - for the time being we can assume that they indeed found it and use it for their own good.
I don't think we can. There's no indications of The Club having anything akin to what Raxxla is rumoured to be. They're powerful individuals who are manipulating events from positions of influence, but they appear to be having to rely on that as opposed to having access to anything beyond the normal human means.

I've always viewed the people on Raxxla - the Elite Corp of Powerful, Twisted Men (& Women, etc.) - as a different group to The Club.

Always possible there's some crossover though. Exo would be a good candidate for one of the former who's also in the latter IMHO.
