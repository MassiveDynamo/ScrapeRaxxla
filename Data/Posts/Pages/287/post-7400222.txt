Ok, but knowing (a little bit) Drew... Not sure he would have accepted someone telling him what to write.
Which is not the same thing than accepting off-limits and border lines (Raxxla, Thargs and antigravity).

Btw... Where are Raan, Luko and CÂ° ? And The Club ?

EDIT: right , Comandante ! FD's idea ! A guidance for Premonition script ? Or will it have further developpements ?
Well, I guess it depends on what constitutes telling him what to write. I don't know how far FD would go with it in terms of microdetails, but AFAIK they asked Drew to write Premonition as the story of what had been going on within the ED universe, so where they've had particular storylines going on (or if they've been taking a certain approach to GMing, for want of a better term), I don't really see what choice there would be but to give Drew various things that had to be built in as part of it.

For the characters, from what I remember:

- Luko's dead
- Raan and Co are in Colonia (no idea if that's still the case, obviously)
- The Club are still doing their stuff

The Club are people who have featured in Galnet, and aren't Drew's creations that only feature in Reclamation of Premonition.

My latest set of guesses are:

Different to CoRs guesses but I'm sticking with mine for the moment.

No idea in terms of future developments I'm afraid. For all that happened, The Club and all the things in Premonition are just part of things in a big galaxy, with many many people and a long history. Other groups and individuals activities may be coming more to the fore. Who knows.
