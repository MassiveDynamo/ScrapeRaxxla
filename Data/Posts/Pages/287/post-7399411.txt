I know it's really the only true source we have about Raxxla now, but how is it that we know the Codex entry is a clue at all and not just a red herring?

It's kind of like TDW faction in Shin, would this deeply secretive group really advertise their map to their station? Or Raxxla, if that were the case?

Unless they needed independent, loose cannon CMDRs to find something, and maybe the riddle is the crucible for the worthy.

From lore perspective and with some tinfoil-addition, it looks like that:

1. There are reasons to think that the pilot federation and universal carthographics are both under control of "The Club".
2. That would mean that what you see in CODEX is under control by them too.
3. There are reasons to belive that Raxxla is actively used by "The Club". Might be that Raxxla is a very reason why "The Club" is able to have so much power, with so little exposure.
4. The Real Dark Wheel is obviously trying to undermine "The Club", expose them, and thus are looking for ways to do it, including finding Raxxla, and also are looking for new members which would be considered "Worthy".
5. So what they do is somehow infiltrate Pilot Federation and Universal Carthographics during writing of a CODEX articles, and leave subtle keys on how to find them. Those who manage to do it with that info - join them in their search for Raxxla.
6. For now The Real Dark Wheel have not found Raxxla yet, but have more info on how to do it, and that info is gathered and presented on their "dark wheel station".

Well, at least that's a reasonable way to make it into the lore.
Doesn't mean it's 100% so.
