I know it's really the only true source we have about Raxxla now, but how is it that we know the Codex entry is a clue at all and not just a red herring?

It's kind of like TDW faction in Shin, would this deeply secretive group really advertise their map to their station? Or Raxxla, if that were the case?

Unless they needed independent, loose cannon CMDRs to find something, and maybe the riddle is the crucible for the worthy.
