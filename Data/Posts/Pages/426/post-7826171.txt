The rogue planet probably moves on a predestined path for m system to system every week on serve tic like one of those ferries like the gnosis. Someone put up an overlay of the raxxla icon over the galaxy map, it was beautiful please do it again, I suspect the dotted line represents the path of the rogue planet potentially. Or something's ng like than.

I have been for two days following everysingle DBX I saw. Nothing strange, but, I'm still waiting for one with a pilot named Gan Romero.... xD
In Vega? If so you needed to be doing that 3+ weeks ago. If just everywhere, same here lol
