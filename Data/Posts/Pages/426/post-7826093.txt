Well from what relativity states, in wormhole travel time gets a bit ifffffyyyy. Relativity Implies that when you enter you would exit at the same time in a different location so space time isn’t broken. You would, I guess, travel through the worm hole and could feel the affects of time whilst inside. For example you could technically feel like you where inside it for hours but in reality you would spent < 0 amount of time inside.
But we are getting into the realm of theory not reality so we can’t infer anything
Hope this helps
Travel time is always iffy. It's just in everyday circumstances the iffiness is too small to worry about.

But regardless, if the distance is non-zero then the travel time is non-zero.

Some further points with regard to specifics....

"Relativity Implies that when you enter you would exit at the same time in a different location so space time isn’t broken."

What are you basing that on? That's phrased as though you're talking about an absolute time, but a key principle of relativity (and reality) is that time is relative, not absolute.

"You would, I guess, travel through the worm hole and could feel the affects of time whilst inside. For example you could technically feel like you where inside it for hours but in reality you would spent < 0 amount of time inside."

'In reality' doesn't apply because time isn't absolute. You would experience what you experience, others observing would observe different things depending on their frame of reference. All would be real.

This isn't getting into theory at this point, it's just basic principles.
