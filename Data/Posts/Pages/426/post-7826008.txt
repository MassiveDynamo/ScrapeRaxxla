It’s possible that in game if it is a rouge planet it could travel through multiple systems. I.e. be present for some time before moving through another, that could explain the place that isn’t a place?
Possible, but if it did enter multiple systems, it would have to have some sort of irregular path, which would make prediction very difficult and would seem to defeat the purpose of even calling it a rogue planet. If you draw either a straight line or a parabola through any two systems in the galaxy, you would be very hard pressed to find even one of such paths that would intersect a third system. Probably none would intersect a fourth. I dont know this for certain, but the distances between stars are... well... astronomical.
