Having thought about it, I do wonder if the stellar forge would generate 'pure' rogue planets, by which I mean ones that form from a gas cloud that lacks the mass to form a star. I don't remember anything from the video on the stellar forge which would seem to preclude it, but equally it's a long time since I watched it, and it's not necessarily something that would be specifically covered anyway.

I believe the theory is that rogue planets are formed normally within a star system, but due to instabilities the planetary orbits move around within that system (just as apparently happened in Sol) and occasionally some planets may be thrown out of the system entirely, becoming rogue and wandering the cosmos for eternity, unless captured by another system-some of the highly angled orbits we see (e.g. in Merope) might represent such a rogue body that has been captured.

Edit: such a rogue body might enter another star system, but I think if it was not captured by that system its trajectory in-system would be parabolic/hyperbolic so at some stage it would exit that system and continue on its merry way.
