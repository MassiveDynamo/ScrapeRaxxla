Regarding the missing DBX:

One of the things mentioned was “a place in the Galaxy not dark, but bright like the heavens” and now the stuff is being said about a long journey. It really would line up with the galactic core. Paired with the signal that’s been picked up by Sag A, it seems like a pretty good thread to yank.
