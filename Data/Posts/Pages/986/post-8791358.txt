I don*t think Salome and TDW toast are related, but we could see what @drew 's take is on this.
Given that Drew doesn't know anything more than we do about Raxxla; at best, they might have used the same source/myth for their story arcs by a chance. Drew stated repeatedly that he doesn't know anything else than we do, he's never been involved with Raxxla story and Raxxla has always been out of reach for the writers.

However, even if we are absolutely sure that Drew hasn't written anything for Raxxla intentionally, FDev might have used some of his or other writer's work to build Raxxla storyline. So nothing should be disregarded imo.
