At this point we may be overthinking things. Myths may be relevant later, but at present we seem to be lacking context. Ryder managed to find a clue to raxxla in the galcop bubble of the early 3100s. He seems to have primarly frequented anarchy systems like Reidquat etc. Uszaa has the only reference to Jameson outside of his cobra and Jameson Memorial in SD (and possibly the engineer in SD) namely Jameson's Pride.

My current thinking is that the puzzle will lead us through the systems that have been added to elite dangerous from previous games more or less in chronological order. Some of the manually added systems/planets from the previous games have oddities like mysterious idols etc on their surface. (like in Epsilon Indi for example if memory serves.) With Myths and other lore stuff coming into play along the way.

Some of the old drive tech did not always drop a ship at the main star so the possibility that stuff is located out at the far reaches of a system and thus hard to find seems to be non-zero. We still seem to be missing tourist beacons, and not all tourist beacons seem to generate missions. (presumably these tourist beacons are tied to story or lore) Focusing on era appropriate systems and the paths between them might be a way to narrow down the search. (more so if someone know the correct/typical drop in ranges for the old systems.)

We have checked for systems in the 1984 game, but has similar surveys of the systems from the later games been done? I could not seem to find a complete list of systems for the later games other than those listed on a star map that came with one of the games.
