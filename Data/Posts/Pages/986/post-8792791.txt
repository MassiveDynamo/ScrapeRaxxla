On the hypothesis that Ra XX La -> 88 20 57 (in atomic numbers) I've just mosied around Crucis Sector LS-T b3-1, Crucis Sector NN-T b3-1 & Crucis Sector LS-T b3-7,
Nothing to report other than Crucis Sector LS-T b3-1 planets 5 & 6 have quite high inclinations (possibly two captured rogues?), but then since we don't know what we're looking for & therefore how to recognise it should we be successful, this search strikes me as a hiding to nothing!
