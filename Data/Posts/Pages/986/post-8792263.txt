At this point we may be overthinking things

You mean after 2 threads and nearly 30,000 posts? You may have a point

could not seem to find a complete list of systems for the later games other than those listed on a star map that came with one of the games.

I think the old ones were taken from the game files directly, legally I hasten to add afaik. I know D2EA did a vid on it, 4hrs of watching him program then he gets the list of names to check against the ones in ED. I cant program so it was fascinating but critically speaking there are better training vids out there, even I was spotting mistakes in the maths and the chat was going wild at times, must have been the end of a long day That was for original 1984 so presume the lists you mention have come from similar sources, so a FFE or other one would need the same. Anyone?
