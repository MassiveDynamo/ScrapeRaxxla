Does that imply there are some systems in the oroginal Elite that aren’t in ED?
That might be significant?

I wasn’t involved in Elite between the first and current versions-had a family to raise
Most aren’t in ED. A good handfull of systems from galaxy 1 are included. From the other 7 galaxies combined, only a few are in.
