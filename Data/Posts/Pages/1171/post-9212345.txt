Take a close look at the Alioth system.

Bifrost, Golden Gate. On the 2D map it even looks like a key.

Another element is the Waypoint in Sirius.

And the exit of whatever this creates and however this is activated is in Polaris.

Raxxla, if anywhere, is in Polaris.

Also, remember the super rare cargo item SAP80 that I am convinced is a key or crucial element of sorts?

S.A.P.

Sirius (Waypoint - also a system with the ONLY known anomaly where you get FSD super charge message despite not charging on the star)
Alioth (Golden Gate and the Heavenly Bridge "Bifrost")
Polaris (Unobtainable permit lock, tied to the Thargoids in the Elite lore)

I'm sure that's it, it is either dropped and not actually implemented correctly in the game or there is a piece of this puzzle I haven't found yet or something so obscure I just don't see it or something so minor it can't be figured out (like drop the container here at that time at that moment etc)
