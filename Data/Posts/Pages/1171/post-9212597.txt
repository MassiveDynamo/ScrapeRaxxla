Axi Mundi is interesting, because there are other ‘axi’ in game such as Delphi/Donars Oak, Yggdrasill and the 4 Roman gods of the winds. Which themselves are interesting and purposefully named and placed.

I wonder how Axi Mundi aligns along with any of these.

Or with the Great Rift. Or Vega and Altair.
