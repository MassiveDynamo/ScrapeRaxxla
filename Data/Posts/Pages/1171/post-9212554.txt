the 7th day of the 7th moon got me. cause if the portal did only open on that day then it would mean 07/07/2021

o7 commander.

would fdev realy do something like that? i think yes...maybe..
perhaps something with polaris on the 7th of the 7th? or just before it? many of the stories allude to meteor showers from that region of space, the meteors being the tears of the princess IE the crystals inside the SAP80 containers.

Yet the sky gods are kind, and they reunite on the 7th night of the 7th moon each year. Sometimes Hikoboshi’s annual trip across the Celestial River is treacherous, though, and he doesn’t make it. In that case, Orihime’s tears form raindrops that fall over Japan.

Many Japanese celebrations of Tanabata are held in July, but sometimes they are held in August. If it rains, the raindrops are thought to be Orihime’s tears because Hikoboshi could not meet her. Sometimes, the Perseid meteor shower is said to represent Orihime’s tears.
orihime/hikoboshi (china) = altair/vega (it differes by country)
