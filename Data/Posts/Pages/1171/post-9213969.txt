It's not aimed at the console owner players - look at the Odyssey release. I would love to have more folks in the universe to interact with, if only Frontier would let us...

It is simply a statement of fact at the moment, sadly.

Also, the ";-)" means joke or humour, in my case usually sarcastic or ironic or both.
Sorry. It's very sensitive as frontier actively stated they don't care about the open insulting of console players even though it clearly violates both forum terms and game terms. I have an email pretty much saying that if the mods don't care neither do they
