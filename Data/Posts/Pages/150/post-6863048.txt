Well there you go! I genuinely didn't even know this was a thing (and I wouldn't describe myself as completely uninformed when it comes to astronomy). Thanks Jaitou!

A little easier to follow on the Wikipedia page with those pretty pictures and some additional info describing the movement of these bubbles within the MW.

EDIT: Can't rep you so have a +1.

I honestly had no idea it was a thing either. Saw your response and went to Google it. The one thing about this game and it's community is that it is very educational.
