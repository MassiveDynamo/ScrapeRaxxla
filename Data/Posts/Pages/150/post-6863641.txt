At times of past glories, I would have told you, obviously, start it at the tiny obvious part... but today...

I learned that some stars are small and close by, and that other stars are large but far away.

Mind. Blown.

Careful now!

Besides it's the other way around - the large stars are close, the small stars are far away. For galaxy's sake man, learn some physics!

Continuing on bitstorm's idea (it's been suggested several times by others too), I think FD would be mad to make Raxxla a 'one off find' where one CMDR gets the glory and then everyone else just piles in, takes some screenshots and says 'meh'.

If anything, it makes much more sense to weave it into a story arc (missions?) that are relative to every CMDR. That's what I am hoping, anyway. I also hope it is a long journey!
