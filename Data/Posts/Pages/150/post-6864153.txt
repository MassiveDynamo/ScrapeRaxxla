And what do you think about the rest of his phrase ? The tiny bit obvious-thing ?

I think the ‘tiny bit obvious’ thing referes to the texts in the mission descriptions.

«A certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth.»

That’s a tiny bit obvious, isn’t it?

The problem is that these texts may not have any other function than being an ingame confirmation of the existance of Raxxla.
We can’t be sure that they give any hints to the whereabouts or nature of it.
