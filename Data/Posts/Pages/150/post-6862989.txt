This doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Unless I've misunderstood what EDSM is getting at, I don't see any real evidence of a 'cavity' that exhibits a star density different from other parts of the Orion Spur, or any outer arm for that matter.

While it is indeed possible that a supernova could have seeded an area of space, thereby creating new star formation, it would most certainly have to be older than 20M years otherwise we would still see signs of it (Sol is over 4 billion years old after all). 20M years is certainly nowhere near enough time to account for most stars in the "inhabited bubble".

I don't think it's a very well written piece if information if I am to be honest. I simply don't get what they are trying to describe, or if it is even a real thing in astronomy?
