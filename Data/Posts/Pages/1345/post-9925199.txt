Thargoid roar..... not a Thargoid mother ship/Queen but we woke up the Guardians...

And perhaps we shouldn't have....

Just a thought....

Also I did a spectral analysis of the roar and couldn't see anything in it... Has anyone looked at the trinket noises for any hidden info in the sound?
In Horizons I've listened to the Trinkets container floating in space and also to my ship carrying them. I can detect NO sounds!

Edit: meant to retry but switching music options on one by one, but distracted by the Great Comet Hunt!

But the sound settings recommended in the good ol days of analysing UA etc were:
If you can change "Windows Sounds, Playback-devices" the you device and the tab for "Advanced". Select 24Bit 48000HZ or better

In Elite, Audio options: Select "Night Time" mode. And you can safely disable music. (Screenshot provided at the end of the video)

Fly as silent as you possibly can. F/A Off will turn off the engines. Intermittently turn F/A on if you need to adjust your course

Better still switch to your external camera and move as close to the source of the noise as you can leaving your ship at a distance.
