Hi Allen. Hope you’re well and still enjoying our ramblings!

Can you clarify a couple of ED lore questions for me please?
1) Is Fortuna the same deity as Randomius Factoria? If not what is the difference?
2) Were you involved in the design of Trinkets of Hidden Fortune?
3) Is there a lore reason why Trinkets are prohibited everywhere? On the face of it they’re innocuous containers containing items of religious significance to believers in FORTUNA. I cant see any lore reason why they should be illicit goods everywhere; the implication seems to be that they’re harmful in some way....

1. No idea.
2. No.
3. No idea.

I remember Randomis Factoria being something we did a little work in the fiction, but it was treated fairly lightly at the time.

Worth bearing in mind that I have moved on a ways since then. I've worked five or six other computer game franchises since then and a variety of other fictional worlds.
