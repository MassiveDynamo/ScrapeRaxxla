I’ve heard vocal transmissions from the sites as well. I don’t suppose you remember any of these locations where you heard voices at the brain trees? These are sounds that I want to get canon to analyze.
checking in my EDDiscovery history I had brain trees at:
Eta Carina Sector EL-Y d23 4
2MASS J10433563-5945136 1a
2MASS J10442850-5951550 A2c&d
Skaudai CH-B d14-97 A 4

but I think they all talk. Fairly sure Canonn have noted this. Seem to remember a few people trying to decode, but long time ago...
