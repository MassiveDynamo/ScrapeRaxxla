Raxxla could be a Guardian site?
Could the Guardians have made a portal to another galaxy to escape Thargoïds?
Or are Thargoïds themselves using Raxxla's portal, or some derived tech on their ships that could explain their travel capabilities?
Have I had enough coffee this morning?
If you visit Brain Trees or Guardian Ruins you can in places clearly hear voices.
It is possible that Raxxla is a Guardian AI or gateway into the Guardian comms network that links all their sites and once you find Raxxla you die and are incarnated as an obelisk
Who knows? David Braben does! But he’s not saying!!
