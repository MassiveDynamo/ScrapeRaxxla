If you visit Brain Trees or Guardian Ruins you can in places clearly hear voices.
It is possible that Raxxla is a Guardian AI or gateway into the Guardian comms network that links all their sites and once you find Raxxla you die and are incarnated as an obelisk
Who knows? David Braben does! But he’s not saying!!
I’ve heard vocal transmissions from the sites as well. I don’t suppose you remember any of these locations where you heard voices at the brain trees? These are sounds that I want to get canon to analyze.
