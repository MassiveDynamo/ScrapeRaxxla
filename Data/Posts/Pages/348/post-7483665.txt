Similar missions appearing out of the black is fairly common. They typically involve tasks that are anywhere from inconvenient to impossible in the ship you happen to be flying, like transporting biowaste while you're in a dogfight, and thus don't have any cargo bays equipped.

The Dark Wheel faction used to offer these too...

But they were mysteriously removed.

Funny that you mention that but I think that's how I got these missions as I was fooling around with The Dark Wheel Missions for the hell of it.
