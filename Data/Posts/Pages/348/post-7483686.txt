Funny that you mention that but I think that's how I got these missions as I was fooling around with The Dark Wheel Missions for the hell of it.

Check the OP to see if what you saw matches any of the Dark Wheel mission testing data. As discussed within this thread the mission details used to contain hints with a somewhat "Raxxla" flavour, and now they don't. It's possible they've been removed to prevent us finding Raxxla, and thus solving (and ruining) the mystery which might have detrimental effects on FDev's long term sales figures.

The reappearance of both The Dark Wheel and Raxxla, in their own dedicated Codex entries, when there are historical public statements by FDev (MB) there would be no clues seems to have thrown a brand new cat among the pigeons though. Maybe FDev have done this to divert and occupy our attention chasing wild geese until the next major patch in late 2020?

Maybe the recent migration of all mission related functions to a dedicated server, which can be modified independent of a major patch, perhaps supporting the upcoming 'dev assisted CG system' is a hint at what might be coming next?

Edit: TDW Raxxla missions that actually work this time?
