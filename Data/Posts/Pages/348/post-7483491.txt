Someone in the UI department at FDev clearly has a love of logo's using hexagons...

Awesome I was wondering about an overlay. I’m at the base now. So far there are actually 2 variants of the “Mycoid” symbol. One has the circles as the one you’ve overlaid. The other has hexacons instead. If I can finally figure out how to post a picture here I’ll do it. If not I’ll post to my Insta and give a username.
