I can say confidently that when I said we were actually looking for Raxxla, I was not looking for a legitimate response and I'm sure we didn't get one.

Ah. Didn’t get a chance to see the stream myself but heard through the grapevine about that. Both good and a tad disappointing to have the news shot down. Good mainly because there’s a whole lot of belts out there lol. Although the Mycoid/Raxxla symbol similarities have piqued my interests.
