Anyone ever get a mission out of the blue in mid space? And when you get there a random ship is there asking you to do a mission for them as it was foretold?

Edit: At this point I didn't really get any information. I took the mission due to the fact that a ship would travel to find me just to do a delivery mission to send Progenitor Cells to Sheperd Gateway in Arro naga system.

Similar missions appearing out of the black is fairly common. They typically involve tasks that are anywhere from inconvenient to impossible in the ship you happen to be flying, like transporting biowaste while you're in a dogfight, and thus don't have any cargo bays equipped.

The Dark Wheel faction used to offer these too...

But they were mysteriously removed.
