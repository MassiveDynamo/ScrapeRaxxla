Apparently on the FDEV stream when asked about Raxxla the reply was “well you’re looking in an asteroid belt, so you’re looking in the right place”. Whether that means Raxxla is in a belt or clues to its location lie in one idk. But would make sense that they would remain hidden in those as nobody really ever bothers to go into asteroid belts.
