This has probably been mentioned before in this thread but, was there a boundary limit in the Gamma release? If Raxxla was supposedly added then, what's the chances it was added within the boundary? I assume the entire galaxy wasn't explorable before release.

Think CMDR Zulu Romeo traveled to Sgr A* in Gamma, so that suggests at least a boundary to the center of the galaxy.
