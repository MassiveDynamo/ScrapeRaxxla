Anyone ever get a mission out of the blue in mid space? And when you get there a random ship is there asking you to do a mission for them as it was foretold?

Edit: At this point I didn't really get any information. I took the mission due to the fact that a ship would travel to find me just to do a delivery mission to send Progenitor Cells to Sheperd Gateway in Arro naga system.
