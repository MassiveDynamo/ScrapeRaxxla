I think what they were getting at is that according to all the books and the codex Raxxla *contains* a portal, not that Raxxla is the portal itself.

According to the codex and my common sense Raxxla has/is not a portal but looks like mine is an unpopular opinion.

Also, there’s nothing ties Polaris with Raxxla but there is one for Thargoids, a strong one, canon or not. And according to the codex, again, it’s the only official clue we’ve got, Raxxla is still a myth. Noone has found it, noone knows what it is and noone seems to be exploiting a super advanced alien device’s power. And to be fair noone from FDev said it’s a very interesting and special thing definately worth searching for, it might _dissapointingly_ be very well an easter egg. So, taking Polaris away from an active storyline and giving it to Raxxla does not make any sense to me.

I’m hoping Raxxla to be a special thing but I don’t know how it or super secret ultra elite TDW would fit in ED’s “everyone’s a regular, noone’s special” gameplay design.
