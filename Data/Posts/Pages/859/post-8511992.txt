Sanity check....
Just thinking.....TDW - Are they simply too big to be The REAL DW? Only a few in each generation get selected to join TDW - being Elite is not enough. Yet, TDW have multiple bases in Shin and a presence in lft 926. Not to mention all the mostly harmless Dark Wheel NPCs flying around????
Im hoping for 1 of 2 outcomes. Either they are the real dark wheel and all this assistance gets rewarded with an invite for all ive been doing for them for the past year and a half or the real dark wheel is drawn out to stop us and puts some closure on if this one is real or not.
