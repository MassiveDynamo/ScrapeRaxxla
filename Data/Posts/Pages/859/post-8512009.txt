Im hoping for 1 of 2 outcomes. Either they are the real dark wheel and all this assistance gets rewarded with an invite for all ive been doing for them for the past year and a half or the real dark wheel is drawn out to stop us and puts some closure on if this one is real or not.
Agreed. I think if Turning The Wheel fails, we have to assume they are being closed down by The REAL DW
