Sanity check....
Just thinking.....TDW - Are they simply too big to be The REAL DW? Only a few in each generation get selected to join TDW - being Elite is not enough. Yet, TDW have multiple bases in Shin and a presence in lft 926. Not to mention all the mostly harmless Dark Wheel NPCs flying around????
