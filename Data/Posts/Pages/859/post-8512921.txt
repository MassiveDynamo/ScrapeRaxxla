Circled the planet, the opening in space, and the direction of natural light coming through.

I downloaded your pic, and tried playing with it in photoshop abit, and yes i can see a defined planet or moon shaped object in that space, but without knowing the exact moment of your jump your in, beg mid end, or the systems to and from, or having a video, there is no way to verify its not just a trick of light/space while in witch-space...

My best guess is this is the begining of your jump, just after the countdown disappears, and your passing by the planet/moon in the system your leaving, and it was just looking like it was disappearing into a "portal" when you saw it because you were still accelerating through the system, so in each frame you were at a higher speed and it appeard to "suck" into nothing....
