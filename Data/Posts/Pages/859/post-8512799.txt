Found the picture I was talking about. You can see it on the right side, with what appears to be a little portal/opening in space to the right of it. Furthermore, looks like some natural light coming thru it and hitting the planet looking thing.

You also said you cant remember the systems you were jumping to and from...

Well, if you can do some investigating, you have the time the frame was taken, and if you still have the original file, you should be able to check the properties and see the date the file was created... and if you use EDSM, you can go thru your flight logs, and narrow it down to atleast a small group, and youll have the order you jumped in...

this all banks on you having the original file, and being an EDSM user at the time though...
