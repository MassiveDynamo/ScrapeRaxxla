I went from Tycoon 27 to Elite in a single week's ring 'roid core mining CG (Starship Enterprises), so if they offer something like that again I'd recommend it. I really only started serious core mining after I hit Elite so I can't comment in detail on it's ranking effect, but seeing as how it's ludicrously lucrative, it can't but help to spend some time at it.

I enjoy mining in small amounts, but finding the right spot is difficult. Only got around 18% of Broker remaing, guess that’s 18MCr, might have to do some trading! Pity the Sothis passenger missions rank exploration rather than trade (never understood that). Of course I’m assuming with that size donation it might actually lead to something!
