It will lead to a message saying something like 'With your money we bought 18 Tons of Gold that need delivering to XYZ Station' Honestly the price they pay for the stuff is ridiculous, makes you wonder where they are buying it...ofc it could just be a small enough amount to fit in your current cargo hold with 1 trip and I've always been in a small ship at the time when donating

Confirm void opal mining is easy way to rank up Trade, its based on profit only, not number of markets bought at or sold at, not number of trade trips or amount of traded goods....just profit made at market and obviously mining is pure profit. Have avoided VO mining after couple of trips as rank shot up and don't want to rank up the easy way, want to feel like I earned it, yes its me, Im the one, the one who plays it as designed/imagined, not rushing to end game and complaining nothing to do anymore, I may get there Ill just get there slower and be even crankier.
