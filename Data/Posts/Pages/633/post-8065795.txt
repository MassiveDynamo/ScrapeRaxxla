Someone told me that's there to somehow keep the mission screen from locking up like it's been doing. I wondered about that too, It was saying locked becasues my rep wasn't high enough but I was fully allied.

I'm back, it's too hard to stay away

Think the two patches were supposed to fix mission board bugs. Been running plenty of other mission types ok. Just been offered a massacre mission but not into those.
Just surprised by the size of the required donation!

Edit: got back to find its been replaced, now 23MCr for Entrepreneur. Whatâ€™s the quickest way to rank up on Trade now?
