After 640 pages and 12,766 posts, no one has a clue where Raxxla is?

I went back to mining VO's. I had 120Mcr when I started and I now have 2.35Bcr. If you want to rank up in Trade to Elite, you can do it in a couple of days. Make sure you find a place to buy them at 1.6Mcr. each, or you will loose what you spent time gathering. I was not paying attention to station price drops, sold my first load of 90 VO's for maximum price. I went back to the same station and sold another 90 VO's and without realizing it, the price had dropped to 762K each and I lost about 130Mcr. Check the station prices if you sell more than one load to the same station.

Lol I started ED in Dec, looked at Raxxla a bit in April, mined for a few months for self imposed challenges. 14B now and came back a month ago and still the same.
