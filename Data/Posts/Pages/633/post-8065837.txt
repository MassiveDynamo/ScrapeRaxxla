Whatâ€™s the quickest way to rank up on Trade now?
I went from Tycoon 27 to Elite in a single week's ring 'roid core mining CG (Starship Enterprises), so if they offer something like that again I'd recommend it. I really only started serious core mining after I hit Elite so I can't comment in detail on it's ranking effect, but seeing as how it's ludicrously lucrative, it can't but help to spend some time at it.
