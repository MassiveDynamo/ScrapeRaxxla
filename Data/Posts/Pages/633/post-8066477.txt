Think the two patches were supposed to fix mission board bugs. Been running plenty of other mission types ok. Just been offered a massacre mission but not into those.
Just surprised by the size of the required donation!

Edit: got back to find its been replaced, now 23MCr for Entrepreneur. Whatâ€™s the quickest way to rank up on Trade now?
Mining profits count towards Trade rank, ~1BCR [CASH, not total] = Elite but that mission will then apply another lock so you can't take it until you're allied with them and it will still be locked until you're, allied...

You're not supposed to be able to take it is the point.
