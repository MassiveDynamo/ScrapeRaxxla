Much of the galaxy is pseudo-random, but the most interesting/relevant parts (with respect to the raxxla problem) are likely to be handcrafted/modified in some fashion.
1. The assumption that Raxxla is hand placed or even a planet is just meh.
2. If 1 is an acceptable assumption then I would equally assume a puzzle designer will not hide it in something as obvious as a hand placed system.
3. And by the same measure, I would assume that the designers are good enough to hide it in the actual procedural generation itself.
4. There are very weird systems I've seen over in reddit which seems to have impossible stats and yet are most probably useless random systems. Systems with stars too close to the planets etc, Would I then assume they are handplaced? I forget but isn't naming conventions 1 way to distinguish hand placed vs generated? Pretty sure the naming convention has already been solved?
5. Imagine if Raxxla really is hiding in an empty asteroid cluster like Sol's. How in depth did the TGPH CMDRs really go into per system? Did they drop into every cluster?
6. Certain things like installations are not recorded anywhere the last time I played i.e. Those places named Hidden Mountain Ranch, Secret Oasis Island etc. Are the TGPH CMDRs recording those down as well?
7. What if inventory triggers are involved? Timing triggers? What if CMDR's Elite status are a trigger? Wouldn't you need to have CMDRs with almost identical stats as a baseline?
8. What happens after TGPH has completed their search and realized that there are a set of variables that they did not check? Do over?

Shrug. Its insane.
