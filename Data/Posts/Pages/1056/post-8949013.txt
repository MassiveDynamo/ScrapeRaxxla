'What a silly question, of course it exists' and 'Its in the Milky Way' is pretty much all we have. Interpret them at your leisure.

I dont want to find it through brute-forcing, or code-dipping or any way other than having a lot of fun on a treasure hunt. But I dont need tofind it tomorrow, Im good for it to be found in another 3 or 4 decades easily.

That it will only be revealed once we either stumble upon some clue, or enter another chapter of FDs 10 year narrative. And like every other narrative element, FD will inject or unlock it (that is their modus operandi).

But it doesn't stop me looking. Its foolish, yes its pointless. But Im an old 84 Elite pilot. The nostalgia drives me. I dont play to grind, I dont play to kill, I am an explorer.

Whole post I agree with. And also have a horrible feeling this is the intention. I hope not, they have enough other lore to keep this one separate and contained. I hope I hope I hope. They love their puzzles please let this be the one they dont need solving for a plot line.
