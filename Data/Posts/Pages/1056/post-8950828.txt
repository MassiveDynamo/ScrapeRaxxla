Best guess: It's a series of hoops to jump through (visit specific systems and scan them entirely in a certain order/or visit specific locations in those same systems -- not including the systems between because we can't teleport between them), after which a final puzzle/information-piece is revealed (likely via a direct message) that declares the final location.

I fear it'll be a relic site like the guardian sites. An homage to the Raxxlans that are now gone or gone elsewhere. I don't think we'll have any success finding it via "swinging in the dark" method many are doing at the minute.

I would like it to be a cut-scene, a vision or something that's written by someone much more imaginative and creative than I am that takes you when you land or reach that point, but I feel I'm hoping for a LOT in this case.

Raxxla should be an addition to the lore, an experience to be had, and fondly remember.

Pretty sure the rhyme is the only key we need. It contains the location of all the clues if that's what they are.
