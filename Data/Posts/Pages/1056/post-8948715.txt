Because it’s a waste of time.
What are they searching for? (DB told us “You don’t know what it is”) Raxxla as a planet? Raxxla as a poi on a planet? Raxxla as a station?
IFF Raxxla is so named and so appears on the scanner when entering the system it’s in then fine
But if it’s disguised as something else until closer inspection, or hidden until some trigger condition is met then that hunt will not find it.

Yes, this thread was moved to Lore&Roleplay; “does this mean Raxxla is just lore with no in game asset” NO!!! Let’s stop trolling this stupid idea! DB has said it is in-game, it has been in-game since the gamma! If it hasn’t been found yet “then you aren’t looking in the right way” is a far more logical conclusion than “oh, it’s locked behind a permit we can’t get” or “it isn’t in game” or “ it’s the friends you meet on the journey”. That argument is reminiscent of the “Rogue planets aren’t in-game because we’ve explored thousands of systems and haven’t found one” claim, blithely ignoring the fact that those “thousands” are less than 0.01% of the game area.

This thread is for those who enjoy the hunt, which is based on the premise that it is locatable and has been accessible since the gamma. If you don’t believe that then posting in this thread is just trolling.
