The biggest issue here is that FD have given us NOTHING.

Its like going into the middle of the ocean and not knowing if youre looking for an island, a shipwreck, a fossil, a whale or a piece of coral.

Its kinda stupid tbh that they've not even given the most vague of clues. For all we know its been passed by thousands of times. For all we know, they could just be trolling us and there's nothing there.

I mean, how long was Zurara floating out there? 5 years? And still nobody found it until they basically told everyone where it was. Who knows if there are even other project dynasty ships?

For what its worth, I dont think its anywhere near sol.

From the wiki about Dynasty, John Harper, author of And Here The Wheel, wrote in a Kickstarter comment:

"You don't know what I've seen. I've sailed beyond the Formidine Rift, seen the fleets of Octagonal ships blocking out the stars. I've stood on lost worlds, sterilised clean by the Thargoids and erased from humanity's maps. I've seen the graves from the Thargoid wars, countless headstones stretching beyond the curvature of the horizon, little spots of reflected light dottering the abandoned continent ..."

For me, it's either in the Formidine, or more likely one of the sectors near to Formidine.
