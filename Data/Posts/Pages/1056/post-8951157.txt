I checked again and the Harrison XIII may be a false lead, since I found that it is a player named/kickstarter backed planet name.
It's possible that FDev incorporated this into a puzzle, but currently I'm going to be careful and consider the name "tainted" and not a real hint.
But the connection to The Club may be real, as Isis I to Isis V show a similar pattern related to their composition (3 identical, 2 identical).
