First rule of Lore Club:
There is Lore and there is Not Lore... there is no Fluff

Ya not sure about the signal - but I do like it - another string to tug on

Regarding your post, and again I will announce this forum topic was moved to "Lore & Roleplay" Removed it from the ingame discussions Tabs ages ago...so....for the god knows how many times does this mean Raxxla is just lore with no in game asset They said it exists, we just dont know what it is yet, i see no mention of them saying "Yes you can find it"
