Because the Great Raxxla Potato Hunt is by definition madness.

The entire ED universe is a one time pad. Even though it is procedurally generated but to us humans, it might as well be random.

Brute forcing it would be an exercise in futility.

Maybe so.... However brute force does more work than current rabbit holes until we get actual clues and not vague "it does, doesnt, maybe could exists" off of devs lol
