the cube ..if it is a cube. sounds like it is a drone satellite like how some scientists believe we would best be able to send messages to other star systems if we are without ftl. You send a tiny satellite at relativistic speeds and it can reach another star system far earlier than anything large we can send... and we can send thousands upon thousands of them for relatively cheap.

They wouldn't be able to broadcast back to us but if anything intelligent found them, they could try contacting us.

Since it was deep under mars, it stands to reason that it could have been a probe like above sent by an alien race probably to many many systems found to have habitable planets. It crashed into mars accidentally and remained there until found. It was mentioned back when thargoid probes were discovered...implying that it could have been the first evidence of thargoids
