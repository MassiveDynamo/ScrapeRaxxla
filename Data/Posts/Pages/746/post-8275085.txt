Funny thing is before he even mentions the part of the secret organization. He also mentions about being invited to do things. Which is the obvious random missions we get in comms, and also the random appearance of the Type-10's you run into in space.

So are they hints? Are we being directed to help certain factions?

How many organizations do we need to be allied with before we finally get that fabled invitation of the The Dark Wheel? For those that played this game for years it's hard to figure out how many factions we allied with. Most of us never keep track of this sort of information nor does it give us a number of allied factions we worked with.
Perhaps Fdev meant for us to move from system to system once we've 'allied' with the local factions? With those T10's and tip offs nudging us to start doing that?

I bet they didn't quite count on human nature in wanting to settle down and make a particular location feel like home.

I seem to recall in one of the many vids I've recently combed that DB and/or MB were surprised people didn't move around more...or explored more of the galaxy. Something along those lines.

I guess you'll never become a member of a "a mythical, secretive organization comprised of exceptional adventurers, explorers, investigators" by staying in a single system.

Time to slow down the research and amp up the game time! (Well, when the Oz Open tennis finishes at least since it overlaps my usual game time!)
