There is no third party at this time. There's just Sol and the new colony on tau ceti.

edit: the only way your theory would work is if raxxla was entirely fabricated ...and then something was discovered later and adopted the name. Which is unlikely ...but i suppose if you widen your net of plausibility to infinity...anything is possible. Of course when it comes to what is actually going on in this game, retcons retcons retcons will spontaneously appear wherever fdev has contridicted themselves if it turns out that raxxla isn't within 300ly of earth.
Or! As I've theorized before. Nobody had been to Raxxla back then, nor would have needed too. The legend began somewhere, and i think it is Guardian related. Thanks to the Codex, we now know to connect Halsey's "dreams" with Guardians. Since her dreams (lore wise) lead to the discovery of the first Guardian Ruins, that seems appropriate. IF Raxxla is Guardian related, it would stand to reason that they (or what ever) have been contacting humans this way for eons via dreams. Just as Halsey's showed the Guardian's past worlds, some of those earlier "Dream Contacts" could have showed some people Raxxla (possibly their current world), and they in turn spread the legend, and were the first to go out and look for it! Raxxla could be far from the bubble, and in this humble CMDR's opinion, is located in the system CD-3[DATA EXPUNGED].
