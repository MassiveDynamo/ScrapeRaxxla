Lyta Crane is at least an interesting name. It's anagrams contains several funny words, like Cat, Art and Lyre.

I dabbled a bit with the Lyre / Lyra / Lyra variety, because of Vega and stellar princesses and all that.

My best find is the Anagram: T Lyrae can.

T Lyare (HIP 90883 in ED) is a Binary system with a carbon main star. That would take care of T Lyrae a C (HIP 90883 a is a C class star) and just leave the N. I haven't scanned it, so I dont know if the star is actually a C-N class.
The N could also be a counter. As the 14 letter in the alphabet, it could point to the 14th planet: HIP 90883 A 2f. This is the 8th moon of the A 2 gas giant.


T Lyrae is also known as "The Jewel in the Harp":

That name is sometimes applied to Vega, as well.

I haven't had the chance to visit and probably wan't for a few day. If anyone is close, you could take a look.

I like your thinking there H_Z! Lyra-> Eagle! Though it's a bit far out at 2350 LY!
If Lyta Crane is an anagram then other potential astronomical possibilites are:
CENT alyra
LAC ytrane
ANT clyrae
ARA lyecnt
CAE ntlyra
CAR ntlyae
CEN atlyra
CET lyraan
CRA nelyta
CRT anelya
LAC ytrane
LYN raecat
LYR aecant
RET cranlya
TEL yacran
TRA lycane

P.S. I forgot I hadn't checked halfway from Sol to Saturn at 2512ls. Done! Nowt!!
Getting utterly bored, Might head out to T Lyrae for a change of scene, it's a mere 40 jumps!

Bored of Mu Leonis
