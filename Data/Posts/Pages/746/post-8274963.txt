So this is the first reference I've explicitly found where DB mentions the possibility of "If you get invited to join a Secret Organisation, that's something that can happen to lots of people...", and this premise is based on the "story of your life through the game, your progression" and "things will happen to you as you reach certain stages of the game".

Listen starting at ~8:20 in the video Elite: Dangerous has a story that "embraces all the players" - David Braben Interview (this link should start there):
Oct 13, 2014



His throw away comment - "well maybe I did kill that policeman the other day, maybe I need to get my reputation a bit higher". In my reviewing of his interviews and logs I've noticed he doesn't really every say something off the cuff often, it's usually linked or planned (IMO).

This interview was a long time ago in the timing of Elite, but given his passion for this I strongly suspect it still holds true to the current game.

So play the way you want, enjoy all that's out there and perhaps you'll just get lucky one day.

Fly Dangerously!

P.s. Watch till the end and have a laugh at ~13:10.

Mmm, very interesting! Never come across this vid before, despite much googling around DB; wonder why it didn’t crop up. Will watch later, after shopping etc & before further exploring T Lycrae...
But reading the comments the bit about killing a policeman seems to me to imply that invitation to join secret organisation lies in your reputation, presumably with the right faction(s). Perhaps you have to become allied with all “layers” of TDW to get the invitation.
