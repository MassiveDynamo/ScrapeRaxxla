There is no third party at this time. There's just Sol and the new colony on tau ceti.

edit: the only way your theory would work is if raxxla was entirely fabricated ...and then something was discovered later and adopted the name. Which is unlikely ...but i suppose if you widen your net of plausibility to infinity...anything is possible. Of course when it comes to what is actually going on in this game, retcons retcons retcons will spontaneously appear wherever fdev has contridicted themselves if it turns out that raxxla isn't within 300ly of earth.

Tinfoil ENGAGED! Well, I've hypothesised many times that Raxxla is a Guardian ark ship, now covered by the space detritus of millena so it will appear to be a moon. It could have landed in Sol, led to the development of humanity (as a prey species? or as a Guardian species offshoot?), the Feds found it (following their discovery of the alien artefact on Mars; clue- Omphalos Stone was in greek myth a mechanism for communicating with the gods). Then Feds moved it into a stable orbit and engaged its cloaking device to hide it from the Thargoids (and TDW, and the rest of us, and I'm getting pretty fed up looking for it; this is supposed to be a game FD, played for amusement!!).
