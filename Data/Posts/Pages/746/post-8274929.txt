So "that story" on secret organization. Perhaps someone got the invitation and never told us. heh.
Nice flashback.

Funny thing is before he even mentions the part of the secret organization. He also mentions about being invited to do things. Which is the obvious random missions we get in comms, and also the random appearance of the Type-10's you run into in space.

So are they hints? Are we being directed to help certain factions?

How many organizations do we need to be allied with before we finally get that fabled invitation of the The Dark Wheel? For those that played this game for years it's hard to figure out how many factions we allied with. Most of us never keep track of this sort of information nor does it give us a number of allied factions we worked with.
