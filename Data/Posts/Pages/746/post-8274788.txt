Raxxla was Holdstocks idea, Thargoids DB & IB I think, Guardians DB or MB, The Club was DB idea as attributed by Drew Wagar and Drew invented the whole Exodus storyline I think.

No particular reason to mix them all up as being the same source or beings. Besides, Guardians weren't mentioned in 1984, Thargoids were a thing, no reason it cant be retconned but no real sign it has been.
