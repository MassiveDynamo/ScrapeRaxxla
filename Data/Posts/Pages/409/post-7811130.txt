Do you think FD have designed this game in such a way that a faction will allow discovery of the Dark Wheel? I'm highly doubtful. I suspect that what they have provided in the news articles, and Codex are probably all the clues that will be provided. I'm allied with the Dark Wheel faction, but I highly doubt that this will do me any favours when looking for the station, or finding Raxxla. I could, of course, be wrong...
Unfortunately none of us really know, we can only make assumptions based upon clues Fdev have placed in game (such as codex, etc). Until someone actually finds DW station or Raxxla itself, all we can really do as commanders is communicate with one another here in the forums about all the different things we’ve tried and what we’ve learned along the way. The more info we share w each other about what we’re all doing and trying, the better prepared we are to “solve” the mysteries at hand - if they’re even solvable in game. For all we know they could be in permit locked systems, or mechanics not even existing in game yet, we just don’t know - but until then all we can do is try or not try.
