Hi Midian Cabal,

Did you ever get another 'tip off mission' after doing rank up missions for TDW? Or does the game still crash for you?

I'm interested, because I've received a tip off mission after doing a Founder/Elite mission directly for TDW and although my game doesn't seem to crash - sneaking into a Military +++ large installation is certainly ranking as one of the most impossible things I've attempted in-game to-date. Cost me roughly 20M in fines / bounties, and I've lost 4 SRVs scouting and trying to get to the core for scanning. Can't take it by air solo doesn't seem to work for me (fully engineered Vette + Elite Pilot) vs 4-5 System Defence + Police after 4 minutes + Ground Anti-Ship turrets, and/or having 5 goliath skimmers chasing me + turrets when I'm on the ground isn't working for me either.

Anyone else successfully raided a Large Military +++ High Security? Any tips?!
...

It might just be a 'normal' tip-off, but I'd like to complete it to verify that is the case.

You can do the scan with the data link scanner (?) of your ship. Simply boost towards the core data terminal and get really, really close too it. This makes it appear under the contacts panel and therefore selectable. Select it and finish the scan. In order to avoid fines and agressions you need to be very quick! Did a lot of these successfull with my DBX, without SRV onboard. Collected 7 or 8 different messages by now and got a lot of duplicates. In fact I had even more messages, but those got wiped back in january.

However, here is the link to the messages for those of you who are interested:
(sick of trying howto correctly embed an Imgur album, so here is just the link)
