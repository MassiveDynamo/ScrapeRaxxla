I’m assuming that before one can find Raxxla (or even know for certain what it is) one must find The Dark a Wheel station, and access their “knowledge” whatever that is... so in my DW endeavors, I got the same nano-med tip off mission after getting fully allied w The Dark Wheel in LFT 926 - same base if I recall correctly HIP 1742 Ruthfoss Depot it was a pain to complete took about an hour before I decided to take time to actually map it out and mark where the uplinks were, then once I did that I was able to figure out best possible route to unlock the barrier thing and scan the main datapoint. It was challenging but fun. Nothing special afterwards though, no invitation to Raxxla or their secret station etc. still been running missions for them and had a few other tip off missions this past couple weeks but mostly salvage recovery, black box, etc. earlier when ranking up it was mostly combat type missions against Los Chupacabras or Nunets Blue Crew (lots of those) and some courier missions. I haven’t run any passenger missions yet. Seems Dark Wheel is tight w Fong Wang factions, often helping them too. Now I sometimes hang outside station and scan wakes until I get a Dark wheel ship. I scan and follow them, usually they’re going to ShinDez or another local very close system and usually after 2-3 systems of following the ship they just disappear. Once I followed a ship through 4 systems before I lost it but that was the longest one so far. I find after about 15-30 minutes of wake scanning outside station, I’ll occasionally get a tip off mission from Dark Wheel although not sure if it’s because I’m lurkijg outside Meridith or just coincidence.
