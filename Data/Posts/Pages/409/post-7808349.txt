Hi Midian Cabal,

Did you ever get another 'tip off mission' after doing rank up missions for TDW? Or does the game still crash for you?

I'm interested, because I've received a tip off mission after doing a Founder/Elite mission directly for TDW and although my game doesn't seem to crash - sneaking into a Military +++ large installation is certainly ranking as one of the most impossible things I've attempted in-game to-date. Cost me roughly 20M in fines / bounties, and I've lost 4 SRVs scouting and trying to get to the core for scanning. Can't take it by air solo doesn't seem to work for me (fully engineered Vette + Elite Pilot) vs 4-5 System Defence + Police after 4 minutes + Ground Anti-Ship turrets, and/or having 5 goliath skimmers chasing me + turrets when I'm on the ground isn't working for me either.

Anyone else successfully raided a Large Military +++ High Security? Any tips?!



It might just be a 'normal' tip-off, but I'd like to complete it to verify that is the case.

Ra,
Have you considered being more Sneeky? As in using a Stealth Build with molto heatsinks? A corvette seems like overkill on an installation. I would use a Sneeky DBX or FGS and just do it by air. If you would like, I could try it out for you. Lemme Noe.
