Do you think FD have designed this game in such a way that a faction will allow discovery of the Dark Wheel? I'm highly doubtful. I suspect that what they have provided in the news articles, and Codex are probably all the clues that will be provided. I'm allied with the Dark Wheel faction, but I highly doubt that this will do me any favours when looking for the station, or finding Raxxla. I could, of course, be wrong...

I suspect if you find their dark station and you’re not allied with them (& perhaps also Elite) you’ll get a very unfriendly welcome.
But I also suspect if you can dock with it you might find some mission that helps to get to Raxxla,
