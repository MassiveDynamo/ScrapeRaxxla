Hi Midian Cabal,

Did you ever get another 'tip off mission' after doing rank up missions for TDW? Or does the game still crash for you?

I'm interested, because I've received a tip off mission after doing a Founder/Elite mission directly for TDW and although my game doesn't seem to crash - sneaking into a Military +++ large installation is certainly ranking as one of the most impossible things I've attempted in-game to-date. Cost me roughly 20M in fines / bounties, and I've lost 4 SRVs scouting and trying to get to the core for scanning. Can't take it by air solo doesn't seem to work for me (fully engineered Vette + Elite Pilot) vs 4-5 System Defence + Police after 4 minutes + Ground Anti-Ship turrets, and/or having 5 goliath skimmers chasing me + turrets when I'm on the ground isn't working for me either.

Anyone else successfully raided a Large Military +++ High Security? Any tips?!



It might just be a 'normal' tip-off, but I'd like to complete it to verify that is the case.

Hey Ra,

unfortunately I didn't. I did get a few follow-up missions for planetary jobs, but no tip off missions. I did them and the game didn't crash. It seems like they fixed it, although it wasn't in the patch notes, but I don't see anyone complaining about it any more. EdPathFinder was somewhat helpful to me, because it has maps of bases. Here's a website with settlements. I scouted and planned my route first, and only when I was ready I ran in while scanning, shooting and repairing my hull.
