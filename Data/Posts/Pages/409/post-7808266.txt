I'm curious as to what system your mysterious tip off mission sent you. I also was working on a mysterious tip off search that led me to a rather sizable installation that I have yet to successfully complete. I believe mine is in HIP 1472 (1742?).

Hi Filthy,
The very same... HIP 1742 Ruthfoss Depot.
It's pretty brutal.
