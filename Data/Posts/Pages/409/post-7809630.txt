Wow, never thought to try it that way. Interesting how this holistically came back around to a DBX. Perhaps the stolen DBX is intended to serve a similar purpose...

Well, not sure it was a large Military installation, definitely a 3+ though. After experiencing a CTD having just killed 4 Goliath's with my srv, I decided to brute force my way to the data terminal in the srv using only speed, and finally succeeded in doing the scan. The DBX way sounds more expedient.
The brute force way is how I did these at first, too. You need no drive and fly very fast and precise for this, especially if you get a warning already 3-5km away from the settlement - found it too thrilling for me. Then I discovered the possibility to scan the core data with my ship.
The DBX is just the quickest way to do the scan, due to the jump range and agility. But I have done the scans also with my Cobra, Python, Krait Phantom and FDL.
