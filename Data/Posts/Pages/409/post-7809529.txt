You can do the scan with the data link scanner (?) of your ship. Simply boost towards the core data terminal and get really, really close too it.

However, here is the link to the messages for those of you who are interested:

Wow, never thought to try it that way. Interesting how this holistically came back around to a DBX. Perhaps the stolen DBX is intended to serve a similar purpose...
