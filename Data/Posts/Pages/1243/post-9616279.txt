Ive tried flying through the tunnels in the installations Ive come across. Nothing happened, but why are they there? Seems a likely possibility for the Omphalos!
Yes, that asteroidbelt discrepancy is odd and would warrant investigation! Try doing the xame as you can do in Sol- select the asteroid belts in the system map then go back into cockpit and see if the star or anything else is selected.
Since she mentions it in her upgrade chat I went out exploring the area of the Great Rift and sold the data at Felicity’s base UC outlet. Didnt trigger anything, however I had been out to HIP 84605 on an earlier trip, so couldntget any scan data there, perhaps you need to get that specific system data for her. Ive also got level 5 on at least her fsd upgrade. Perhaps need to get maximum level with all her blueprints?
Cant remember trying to ise her market & dont know about the old worlds faction building.

P.S. it’s bloody difficult trying to type left handed on my ipad while right hand wrapped in a heat pad!!!

When i was in search with other players for salvages, we found that there were DataCore in military installations. In fact in all installations there are cargo bays INSIDE tunnels.
But like you (or someone else) said: one installation's tunnels could be hding something. Then people would only see the installation and not what there is inside.
