Yea, for Raxxla to exist in-game from the outset (i.e. gamma release), within 30ly of Sol, but not be found by now must mean that itâ€™s disguised as something quite normal. This was the reason for me asking a few days ago if installations had been in-game since the gamma!
Why is everyone saying 30ly.....we made it further than that before 2296, we discovered life on Beta Hydri in 2190 and i presume further probes etc where way out further than that, 30ly would be just colonies established while probes and ships would ahve spread out much further we caused an extinction in Delta Pavonis in 2180 whihc is 20ly away so coming up to 2296 we would have surpassed 30ly by a lot
