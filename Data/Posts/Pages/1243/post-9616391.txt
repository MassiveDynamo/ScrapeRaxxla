When i was in search with other players for salvages, we found that there were DataCore in military installations. In fact in all installations there are cargo bays INSIDE tunnels.
But like you (or someone else) said: one installation's tunnels could be hding something. Then people would only see the installation and not what there is inside.

Yea, for Raxxla to exist in-game from the outset (i.e. gamma release), within 30ly of Sol, but not be found by now must mean that itâ€™s disguised as something quite normal. This was the reason for me asking a few days ago if installations had been in-game since the gamma!
