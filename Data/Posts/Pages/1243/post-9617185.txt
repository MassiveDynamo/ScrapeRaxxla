Nice to see such energy and passion devoted to all this. You can ask me things. I'm not hard to find.
Where is Alxxar? Will it have a Fur coat for sale when I dock there? How fast do I need to frameshift away from the Loach so it doesn't eat me when undocking?? and most important of all.....does my head look big in this Pioneer helmet?

Serious though any hints, clues or even vague points in a direction other than "Raxxla is in Elite" in some form that we dont know of lol
