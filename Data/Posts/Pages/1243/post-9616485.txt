Yes, there was a logic flaw in one paragraph (now updated) in my current hypotheses post. 2296 was the first documented Raxxla rumour date, & around that time Achenar was settled (139 ly from Sol). That fits my interpretation of the clues.

I originally favoured near/in Sol because of over-emphasis on the existence of the Mars Artefact, which that paragraph was originally supporting.
For some reason I tie the Mars artifact with either the Thargoids or Guardians (Or maybe even the AI) and is what gave us our first proper upgrade to Hyperspace hecne not needing outposts and beacons anymore, I believe Raxxla to be something else beyond the reach of these two species (I am hoping it is to be honest as those storys are just gap fillers rigth now and emntion in previous games suggest Thargoids feared the word Raxxla but this may tie in with Guardians)
