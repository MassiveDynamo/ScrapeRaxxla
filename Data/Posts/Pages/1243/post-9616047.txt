Since my hand RSI problem seems to be getting worse I cannot fly. Ive had two 1-hour duration sessions looking in Deciat this week and greatly regretted them, so I think it’s time to post up my thoughts for others to chase down.

@yelboc @Adel- the codex is very clearly largely waffle/obfuscation, but IMHO there are some parts which are not and stand out in an obvious manner, such as the first Raxxla rumour date, the “Astrophel and the Spinning Stars” ‘book reference’, and the odd usage of the word “Fernweh”. These stand out and ought therefore to be real clues. See below for my thoughts, they are a bit disconnected, but if you read through you should follow my logic and see the possibilities.

Good hunting! I will stay on the forum, but I think my gaming days may be over. Currently trying to keep my hands warm by using heat pads & wearing gloves, even during the night. Osteopath booked in 2 weeks, that’s going to be painful!

@yelboc : thanks for the like mate! I’ve made a few minor clarifications/additions so you might want to re-read it.
