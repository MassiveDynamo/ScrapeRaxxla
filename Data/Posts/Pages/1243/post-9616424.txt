Yea, for Raxxla to exist in-game from the outset (i.e. gamma release), within 30ly of Sol, but not be found by now must mean that itâ€™s disguised as something quite normal. This was the reason for me asking a few days ago if installations had been in-game since the gamma!
I just checked if the guys involved in the "Great Raxxla Potato Search" are checking installations too and indeed they do.
So they must have found it already if there were something in there.
