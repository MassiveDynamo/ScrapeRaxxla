Why is everyone saying 30ly.....we made it further than that before 2296, we discovered life on Beta Hydri in 2190 and i presume further probes etc where way out further than that, 30ly would be just colonies established while probes and ships would ahve spread out much further we caused an extinction in Delta Pavonis in 2180 whihc is 20ly away so coming up to 2296 we would have surpassed 30ly by a lot
Yes, there was a logic flaw in one paragraph (now updated) in my current hypotheses post. 2296 was the first documented Raxxla rumour date, & around that time Achenar was settled (139 ly from Sol). That fits my interpretation of the clues.

I originally favoured near/in Sol because of over-emphasis on the existence of the Mars Artefact, which that paragraph was originally supporting.
