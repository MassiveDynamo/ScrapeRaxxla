It wasn’t. The code has been checked. FE2 didn’t have much custom content at all. It was very generic.

FFE had much more hand written content. No Raxxla there either, though.

Ya just reading about about the Fractal - Langford Basilisk,,, And lenslok being used on the Firebird.... A lens you had to align between two lines.... I just had a sneaking suspicion that maybe in the Firebird and Commodore systems that used the lenslok - maybe there was a lenslock easter egg.... Which i suspect ties in to the hidden images we are seeing in some of the sound files... a door of perception?
