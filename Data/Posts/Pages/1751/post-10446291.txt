Project Seraph
The name itself clearly references angels. However, it is much more clear now that it is likely not referring to beings of purity, but more like the fearsome burning dragon / serpent imagery. This correlates with the Galnet entry referring to Thargoids as dragons and further reinforces the Thargoid's position in the lore as fierce guardians of something.

Yup - ive been looking into this as well. I mentioned back a bit how I think the Thargoid Artefacts are some sort of Seraphs. I suspect they are identifying Merope as The Garden. We might have re-enacted a bit of mythology when we stole the Meta-Materials from the Barnacles....
