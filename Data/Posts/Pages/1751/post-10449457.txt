Hearing of Azimuth leaving Xi WangDa system got me word sleuthing again. Probably nothing, but there is a curious theme appearing.

Wang is a king, monarch, or 'to reign over'
Da is great, to attain, reach, eminent.
Xi means West... another Azimuth west pointer....

So the name could be King of the West? West Great Monarch?
This gives me Sun Wukong vibes - aka Monkey, Journey to the West. The journey of a monk alongside three fallen gods who seek atonement for their sins.
Sun Wukong was born from a magic stone atop the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit (Mount Huaguo)
Early in the story he is proclaimed Monkey King by bravely passing a test to enter the Water Curtain Cave after crossing a large iron bridge.
A defiant king of a cave.... where have I heard that before
