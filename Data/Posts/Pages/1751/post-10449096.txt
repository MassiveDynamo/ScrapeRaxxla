I suspect localisation in Milton is kept intentionally vague, as although he utilises various methods of gauging dimensions, primarily for orientation, these vary dramatically and he mixes them to a degree; I suspect to intentionally confuse our perspectives of size, trying and achieving to convey god-like cosmological distances to a 17th century audience!

In the text Eden is described by the character Chaos as not far off when Satan first fell.

The location of Satans fall I don’t believe is actually specified, but he and his army on the dawn of the battle congregate and attack from the North. They are then at the end of the battle ‘pushed back’ so logically the fissure they fall through is notable towards the North.

Eden (our universe inside a sphere) hangs from the wall of the Empyrean, not far off it, so relatively close in distance, indicating it is not separated from gods grace and with reach. Heavens gate is confirmed as being at the East gate (open to interpretation) but its staircase, logically it doesn’t extend straight down but winds downwards and would therefore be at an angle before landing upon the glove of Paradise (or universe).

So based upon both, it’s possible that Eden hangs upon the North East (or North West based upon interpretation).

The Empyrean is described to have the shape of a squircle, yet it’s infinitely huge, yet visible enough with high defined sloping walls (hills) for Satan to comprehend its shape when he sees it from Chaos!
