I will start off with - I think the base Story might be related to Welsh Myths - relating to Taliesin Annwn and maybe a little Golden Fleece tossed in...

Before i get into that - i want to point out that I believe there is an overlaying of related stories/myths going on which is part of what has been so confusing. A series of palimpsests... to steal an allusion.

Lets start with Holdstocks Alien World... Where we get this (paraphrased):

SPOILER: ALIEN WORLD BIT





The Narathnu are Bards... (Taliesin) Who tell us of a Great Ship that passes through a Rift and travel to the Otherworld...
The distinction between two types Narathnu seems to be important as well. And we get the Great Explorer who discovers the Pearls... where Raxxla is located.
This is a pain to put together - so im subjecting you to a bunch of ramblings now....

SPOILER: RAMBLINGS
