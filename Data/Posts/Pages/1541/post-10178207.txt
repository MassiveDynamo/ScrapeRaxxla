I think the background logo is an icon for government of the controlling faction (the one in red). I believe all asteroid bases will have same station type logo (blue upper left).
It was the center government logo i was refering to, iv also seen a trinagle and a cicle one simular, a a hex without everything else but always in random locations never in big systems or ones with a big population etc, could the raxxla logo simply be a reference logo for the Dark Wheel? the real dark wheel when we are able to find/use their station?
