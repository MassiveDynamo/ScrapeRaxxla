Keep in mind, the Elite Dangerous coordinates are left-handed Cartesian coordinates. Most tools you use will be using would be setup for right-handed Cartesian coordinates

Right-handed coordinates (X, Y, Z)
Left-handed coordinates (X, Z, Y)

More info:
Right-hand rule - Wikipedia
Remember discussing a few years ago that the chain of dots on the logo is maybe radial coordinates from a galaxy map with a Codex.
Why did they need to show radial coordinates on that map in the first place (map from Codex)?
