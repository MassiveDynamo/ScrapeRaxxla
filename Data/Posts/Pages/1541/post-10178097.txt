but you can obviously work it yourself.

Mmm, thought the centre point was the hypothesis for Raxxla location?
But I got 325 systems with search range from 0 to 39 ly from that point. Just redo the Spansh search with range 38 to 39ly.
Remember that 38.1473 represents the numerical points in distance of the XYZ central point. I don’t know if this relates directly into game as light years.

Oh hang on it does, it is 38.1473 light years.

Currently not in game to test this…
