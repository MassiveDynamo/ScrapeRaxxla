Mmm, hope Ive not found it!
Dropped into a system, several High Grade Emissions...dropped in on the nearest but nothing there at all, no mats, no wreckage, nowt! Honked but nothing, night vision on & nothing. Fired up FSD to go look for another but it wouldnt engage...up to full bars but wouldn't kick in. Tried to jump to a nearby system & same thing. Tried to pull up menu to close game....nothing!
Had to press the PC reset button. When I got back in-game there was a HGE close by, about 0.36ls away & everything was working ok..odd!!

Hope Raxxla has been tested recently!!
