@Rochester Nu is within your “underworld region”. Nu in ancient Egyptian religion was the personification of the primordial watery abyss which existed at the time of creation and from which the creator sun god Ra arose. So a more likely contender for “siren of the deepest void”
That’s really good, missed that one, it’s slap in the middle, good find. But I think I saw Nu initially as a potential ‘destruction god’ and might have initially sidelined it to ‘hell / underworld’.

Can’t say for certain but Nu certainly fits this area of tight correlations of systems named either after the Greek underworld, cities of gold, sunken kingdoms, mythic lost lands and deities linked to death or destruction - which does correlate with the phrase in the codex!

“It is extremely difficult to find consistency among the various fragmentary rumours of Raxxla. Much like the ancient myths of Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John, interpretations of the story range from the sceptical to the outlandish: Raxxla has been suggested to be anything from an unremarkable moon to a state of cosmic enlightenment.”
