Yes that tool will only find the nearest system to an XYZ location, we need a method to calculate all systems 38.1473 away from 48.31 , -109.185 , -5.49.

48.31 , -109.185 , -5.49 is just empty space, thereâ€™s a system 9lyr from there but we need to assess all systems around that point, if any fall upon that circumstance they likely are a potential candidate.
Keep in mind, the Elite Dangerous coordinates are left-handed Cartesian coordinates. Most tools you use will be using would be setup for right-handed Cartesian coordinates

Right-handed coordinates (X, Y, Z)
Left-handed coordinates (X, Z, Y)
