To help identify the potential location of a centre of our hypothetical Raxxla logo, in the diagram below a torus shape has been inserted to establish the 38.1473 radius calculated previously overlayed at 48.31 , -109.185 , -5.49 the midpoint between Tartarus (deepest void) and Persephone (lovers grief / parents woe).



The nearest systems this hypothesis identify are: Morai; ICZ AQ-X b1-4; Aymifa; Miphifa; Gender; ICZ YE-Z b5; ICZ YE-Z b1; Ceti Sector OS-T b3-4 and Slavisc.

Upon reviewing these points against systems in the ED gal map, not one is perfectly aligned, drawing me to the conclusion that either, accuracy is not a factor (!) or Tartarus or Persephone aren’t relevant to this concept, or that this whole hexagon hypothesis is just total twaddle.

Currently redrawing this data to focus upon Nysa, or the plain of Nysa location of the abduction of Persephone. Or Mount Nysa home of the Nysiades (do suspect ‘mountains’ have some deep relevance).

The Nysiades were named: Cisseïs, Nysa, Erato, Eriphia, Bromia, and Polyhymno (none except Nysa in game).
