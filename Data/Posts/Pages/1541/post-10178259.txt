Yup that’s exactly true, it’s reliant upon the two points being accurate, so yes it is a total shot in the dark (well, actually an informed assessment) and I totally accept it’s highly likely an irrelevant waste of time, as they might not be accurate, and this theory likewise is twaddle too.

But it is just simple math, not difficult to apply, and is something to do in game.

Currently in a doldrum so this is going to engage me for ages, my ‘John Milton Universe’ idea was similarly based on practical math yet proven hogwash, but it was fun figuring it out and allowed me to draw a line under that hypothesis, likely the same applies here.

It gives me something to do other than tooling around shooting stuff.

It's not quite clear if we don't know the center, but we can find out about other points from this diagram and they should coincide with specific locations. And what are those four dots ?
