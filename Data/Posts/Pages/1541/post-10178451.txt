Yep, I think it’s becoming clear your “Underworld region” is a highly likely area for Raxxla’s system. Proximity of Artemis from MB’s novel Elite Legacy is IMO another hint. It has just struck me that Persephone was Queen of the Underworld, hence when young (named Kore) she would have been a princess. She is said to be the origin of the Virgo constellation which rises in the Spring night sky, & Persephone is also IRL name of a Sol main belt asteroid...hence Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars could be a clue to Persephone (name is also a subanagram of the book title!).
