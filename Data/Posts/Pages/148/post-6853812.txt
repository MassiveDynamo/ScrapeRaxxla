It also says it has a star and 6 planets. The picture from the original artwork for raxxla included the star and 6 planets plus the giant eye. I wonder if that is a coincidence. And only 1 person went through it. But that was in the last 7 days. So, I don't know if that fits that other rumor. If that system is found to have something like different coordinates over time that would be a pretty obvious give away. Is it in a space on the map near anything significant in the game. Either related to raxxla or not?

Maybe raxxla was moving and got frozen?!

If 14 is significant there is an odd number theme here two. There are 28 systems with the name Braxxla. Assuming the above list is complete. Seems to be revolving around the prime number 7 potentially. I wonder if the locations involve 7 fractions as well. Maybe that is part of the ratio of separation. 0.142857 repeating if I'm not mistaken. You see those fractions(1-6/7) in a lot of video games, and if you account for them often explains rounding issues.

They pattern out where the repeating value is repeating but starting at the next largest number going through the list:

...=repeating value

1/7 = 0.142857...
2/7 = 0.285714...
3/7 = 0.428571...
4/7 = 0.571428...
5/7 = 0.714285...
6/7 = 0.857142...
7/7 = 1 or 0.9...
