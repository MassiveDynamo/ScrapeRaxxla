I'm loathe to ping Drew Wagar for input to clarify all this as he is busy basking in the success of his "Lords of Midnight" release, as well as feverishly writing the next parts in his Shadeward saga. Is it worth getting some feedback from him to clear this up?

I guess it depends on how much you think the whole "clone" thing might be connected to Raxxla. I doubt that there is a direct connection between Rebecca's status as a clone at all and perhaps it would be best to leave that answer to the mind of the reader. I for one would be greatly disappointed to discover that Rebecca was one of the clones while it appears that others are quite keen on the idea. In the end I don't think it matters ... especially to this current discussion. If others feel that it is worth pursuing though then, by all means, someone could ping Drew on twitter and ask him to weigh in.
