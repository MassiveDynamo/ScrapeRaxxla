I don’t think there is much to find in the lore about Raxxla. Several of the authority have confirmed that they know nothing about it.

We have the description in TDW(which is considered a ledgend, not lore) and we have the missions listed in OP.
The year 2814 was leaked by Salomé as the time of discovery, but I don’t think Drew got any more info at all.
