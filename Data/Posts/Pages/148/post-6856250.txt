Not at all!
I'm asking you to:

1. Clear your save
2. Buy a Cobra III
3. Get allied with the Dark Wheel
4. Fly 35kLY to Dryu Bra XX-L a9-0
5. Scan it
6. Fly 35kLY back to Shin
7. Sell the UC data to the Dark Wheel

Off you go, there's a good chap

Sounds reasonable to me. Just make sure, Friedenreich Xante, that you're sporting the 30th Anniversary limited-edition Cobra Mk III Wireframe paint job when you make the trip. If you fly there in just any old Cobra then that still would leave the possibility that you need to be in one that is a reasonable facsimile of a vintage model in order to make the magic happen.
