Of course it could be that they've gone whole 'next generation' on us and expect us to use a Mk IV Cobra. Maybe we need to muster an entire Cobra fleet with every possible combination.

My bet is that we'll need a Cobra Mk II and those are pretty rare. Only available at Hutton Orbital.

Oh yes, the one that can act as an SLF for large ships.
Best go to Hutton with a 'Conda.
