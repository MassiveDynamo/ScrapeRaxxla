And if there was supposed to be a battle maybe that means there would be a:

Ship Graveyard!

There is supposed to be a ship graveyard at Tionisla (see Drew Wagar's stories) but I don't believe that's in-game (happy to be corrected). That video is quite old and appears to have been captured in Eranin, so not directly relevant here. However, it shows that FDev could at least have included a ship graveyard at Tionisla, but I suspect that got pushed to the back burner with focus switching to other things (unless, as I say, it IS there).

I'm curious about the Micro Bit references though. I have seen those discussed in this thread before but assumed they were not accepted as cannon because it seems that when we're talking about Raxxla, not much is anymore!

Keep up the tin-foiling Noobilite... I enjoy the new energy you're bringing to this tired, jaded thread.
