Man are you seriously asking me to go back 1.370 ly to Dryu Bra XX-L a9-0?

Not at all!
I'm asking you to:

1. Clear your save
2. Buy a Cobra III
3. Get allied with the Dark Wheel
4. Fly 35kLY to Dryu Bra XX-L a9-0
5. Scan it
6. Fly 35kLY back to Shin
7. Sell the UC data to the Dark Wheel

Off you go, there's a good chap

So we keep assuming the 'ED Raxxla'-thing, whatever it is, may be in a RA XX-L A named system ? And they said there would be no clues... Must be the "a tiny bit obvious"-thing
Anyway, it seems the PF and Catographics know very well the location, then. So kind, they even put it in our GalMaps !

They know the system is there, but they don't know that Raxxla is in the system - which is why you'll never see a planet named 'Raxxla'.
