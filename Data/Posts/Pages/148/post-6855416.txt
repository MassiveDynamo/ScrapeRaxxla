The problem with something being implied, IMHO, is quite simply that its only an implication. I took the statement "I'm not the first and I'm not the last" to mean that she wasn't the first to try and stand against the club and nor will she be the last ... not that she was a clone. It is also strongly implied that this Rebecca is the same Rebecca from Drew's Oolite saga. After all the Prologue included in Premonition is almost word for word from Drew's Oolite short story Altera. If Rebecca Tiley/Weston is not the natural born daughter of her parents in the Oolite saga then it really changes that storyline in very significant ways.

Yes. A clone can certainly be recruited but I guess I've always been struck more by how the physical descriptions of these clones are dissimilar. Especially Octavia with her increased size and strength but then I suppose each of these ladies had undergone plenty of ... enhancements ... that could account for Salome not quite recognizing a similarity upon meeting the others.

Of course ... none of this probably relates to the quest for Raxxla, aside from the fact that both Rebecca and Elyssia had connections to Cobra class vessels and the conjecture that discovering Raxxla might require some token homage to the 1984 Elite's only player-flyable vessel.

I'm loathe to ping Drew Wagar for input to clarify all this as he is busy basking in the success of his "Lords of Midnight" release, as well as feverishly writing the next parts in his Shadeward saga. Is it worth getting some feedback from him to clear this up?

If you look at the pattern from far away, you notice that it is pointing towards colonia (don't mind the lower right bookmarks, those are leftovers from a previous exploration)

I really find it to have a human shape, if you don't consider the very long neck.

Pareidolia anyone?
