Sounds reasonable to me. Just make sure, Friedenreich Xante, that you're sporting the 30th Anniversary limited-edition Cobra Mk III Wireframe paint job when you make the trip. If you fly there in just any old Cobra then that still would leave the possibility that you need to be in one that is a reasonable facsimile of a vintage model in order to make the magic happen.

Good call!
