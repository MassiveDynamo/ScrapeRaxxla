"No ship was lost during the taking of these 3 SAP 8 Core Containers"

Found 3 Imperial Courier Elite Imperial Cutters in Pancienses (Civil War) tonight. Lost sight of one, destroyed the second (High Sec is a real bother), and finally emptied the third. I was patient with this one, which intercepted me after a very long time making circles around me. It high waked to a non-populated system along with it's Vulture escort, thereby sealing it's fate.

Notes to self:
Pack-hound missiles work very well.
Disable the drives first.
You don't need a class 5A Hatch breaker. Use that for a class 5A collector instead.
Prismatics are really handy. (And a Federal Corvette is handy too).
Fighters are also very handy.
The amount of crap you need to fit on your ship to rob someone is unbelievable, glad I'm not a pirate. Oh wait...
Wonder if 3 SAP Core containers were tried at the Thargoid site?
