Maps were obtained in game by parking your fc close to a permit locked system and buying the exploration data in game.

If that is against the Eula or this forum, then we have some really odd ways to read and understand English

sure, and i agree with you, theres nothing in the EULA that says you cant use ED supplied features to do things in game.....

but from the standpoint of a fdev moderator (i am not one, just playing devils advocate), there has been nothing but a story about how it was obtained thats been posted. No one has posted a linked video, or somthing with PROOF thats how the map was obtained, so as far as they are concerned, its been data-mined or hoxed or w.e. you choose to call it...

Now, wether its a bug or intended feature or just a mistake, doesnt matter, if you cant or wont back up your claims to how it was obatined, they have the right to assume it was thru a "hack" since its never been possible to obtain those system maps, with all the data shown, and they assume it still isnt, because unvisited systems dont show the entire system contents, even when you first jump in, you need too fss or some cmdr has to have done it and sold the data on UCard, which would mean it would probably be on EDSM, where its not....

It probably falls under 'exploitation of a bug'. Kind of like the free engineering bug exploit.

there is actually NO rules about that in the EULA, not that i can find atleast..
If its a bug caused by Fdev supplied software/in game content, than its their fault they didnt block or stop the actions, its not considered a ELUA violation, at least, from how I understand the EULA
