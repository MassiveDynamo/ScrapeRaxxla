10 March: v1.2 is released. Includes "- Adding valuable salvage convoys to three permitted systems: LFT 509, Isinor, Witch's Reach". Using the wayback machine I was able to find that page was last updated and the above was included in each version. You can't access that page now.
interesting.... does seem to imply that the LFT509 permit is obtainable in some way (or will be in the future), otherwise, why bother adding convys in the system?

Is that March 10 2020 ?? or what year?
