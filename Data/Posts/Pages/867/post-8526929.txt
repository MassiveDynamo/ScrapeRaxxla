Please don't discuss information gained from data mining on the forums.

Apart from anything else it has lead many people down the wrong path throughout the years of Elite, and if there's one place that doesn't need misinformation spread then it's thise thread. There's enough wacky ideas here as it is

Wacky ideas???
Surely not here!!!
You must be thinking of the Alien archaeology and other mysteries: Breaking News, Theories and Tinfoil Hattery thread!!
