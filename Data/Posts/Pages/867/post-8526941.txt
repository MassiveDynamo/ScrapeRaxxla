Wacky ideas???
Surely not here!!!
You must be thinking of the Alien archaeology and other mysteries: Breaking News, Theories and Tinfoil Hattery thread!!
I hope @Ozric is not suggesting my idea of waiting for Oddessy, breaking down the door of Sure Cripple and Sneer and shooting the place up until they tell me how to find "A Friend" is in some way wacky! Wacky!? I'm deeply offended by the suggestion!!!!
