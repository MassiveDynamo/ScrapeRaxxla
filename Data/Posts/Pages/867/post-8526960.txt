My general rule for ED is.... if it feels grubby - dont do it! I even try to avoid rinse and repeat!

How would we REALLY feel, after hunting the unicorn for so long, if the mystery was solved, TDW joined and Raxxla found.....because someone exploited a bug, as opposed to solving the mystery?

I for one, would be a bit miffed.
If it's permit locked with no possible way to unlock that permit, there technically wouldn't be anything to find until the devs deemed it time.

I won't bring it up here anymore though. I can see how it is viewed an exploit.
