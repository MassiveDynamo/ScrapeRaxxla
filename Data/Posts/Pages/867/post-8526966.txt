Please don't discuss information gained from data mining on the forums.

Apart from anything else it has lead many people down the wrong path throughout the years of Elite, and if there's one place that doesn't need misinformation spread then it's thise thread. There's enough wacky ideas here as it is

is a Mod saying the map to LFT 509 was data-mined? LOL

I was skeptical already, but a mod physically saying that, would make me believe it more, that its not a valid map, no matter how it was supposedly obtained...

I asked my buddie who bought an FC to go out there and check it out, he hasnt gotten back to me, I dont know if hes made it or not, but im expecting a response today...

I know people like to say they did things a certain way, and claim to have done them personally, but i dont trust anything someone is not willing to back with with proof of some kind...

So far we have a system map img, and a story.... not even a video clip showing the CMDR going from the galmap to the system map in question... and no confrimation on EDSM, where the system map would sync had it been viewed by a player using EDSM (in my opinion)... just too suspicious for me personally....

NOT TO EVEN MENTION, without an FSS of the system, its unlikely the map would have shown all the planets/moons in the system, because absolutely NO PLAYERS have been there, so even purchasing the data should show nothing but the stars maybe, becuase the "Stellar Forge" does not generate the system contents until its "entered" for the first time (as far as Im aware), and if its a hand crafted system or if purchasing the map data counts as "entering" the system, than it should sync to EDSM...
