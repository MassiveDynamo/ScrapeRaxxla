i think the next big update will bring base building into the game (according to some leaks). fleet carriers being the first phase of it. so hold on tight... the galaxy wont be empty for so long anymore. meanwhile, find cool places you want to build your future bases on. i myself enjoy believing that there is many untaped mysteries and stories untold around the galaxy, waiting for someone to trigger them. even if they dont exist, at least they do in my mind. the game is like a canvas, for my imagination to run wild. ^^

now, where is that damn raxxla!
