one could only hope. But i gave up on fdev's follow thru with their narrative when the rift story fell flat on it's face (well, honestly, when they retconned their own story when their jaques event fell on it's face). There's no wind in their creative sails. Or more likely, no drive to put money into creating it like when the game was first released. I think when it started, the grand vision was completely disconnected from the reality of how much it costs to have writers and content creators needing to work constantly due to the way they created the game and without recurring revenue, that isn't sustainable. So fast forward to now, and it's hard to look at anything with the same eye that you had a couple years ago when everything could be a new mystery and plot... Now it's far more likely to just be filler, with the only narrative currently going is the primary one currently revolving around famine and crops.
