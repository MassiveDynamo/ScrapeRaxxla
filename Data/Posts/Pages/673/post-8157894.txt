I rather think next year’s big update will include legs and a first-person shooter. Don’t forget the leaked Thargoids in the flesh carapace pic showed them on the ground. So they’ll be attacking ground settlements/bases and pilots on foot. This is a logical commercial next step to rival the competition (Star Citizen +Citizen 42).

Im hoping for a First Person Raxxla game
