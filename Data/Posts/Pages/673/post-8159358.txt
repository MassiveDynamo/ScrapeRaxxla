I like your thinking Jorkiâ€¦.really enjoyed that tinfoil journey into your thinking. May have sparked a few ideas for me.

4 I's 2 C - have often wondered if this is how its read, a system with 4 x GG & 9 moons and 2 GG with 3 moons....or something....coordinates? (I may as well tinfoil about this I have nothing else to go on)

I too think DW station, if it still exists, is near Sol, has to be, was 'disused' when the DW took it over in the first place meaning it had been built, used and abandoned all in the early stages of interstellar travel, ideally somewhere near Lave et al. How many people travel straight up or down from the bubble rather than 'out' in a 'flat' direction, often wondered how unexplored the planes are around the bubble. If it was 2000 LY out from the bubble it should have a connected story as to why it was built in the first place, but that in no way excludes it, it just 'should' exclude it.

I have a nagging doubt most of it is time-locked, wont happen until a certain date regardless of what we do, but the hints from DB & MB that it is there lead me on....not complaining.

Has anybody from Fdev confirmed the existence of the DW as such and said that it is possible to do something that makes them initiate contact at the moment? I cant find anything as such, mentions of Raxxla but very little of the DW itself spoken about.

And I still don't know who the DW are. All these mentions of hidden, black ops, some kind of military outfit etc from the beacons all over - I think its supposed to read as The Club in various guises but Salome herself refers to a 'shadowy revolution' in a very strange grammatical way. Could Shadowy = Dark, Revolution = Wheel....maybe? So maybe its the DW and not The Club? Maybe that's the everything we know is a lie bit. But if it is, what do I do with that info, not a flipping clue!

Who knows, but aint it fun
