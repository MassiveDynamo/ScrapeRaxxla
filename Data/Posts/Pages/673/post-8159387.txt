One thought here. If Sol is the brightest star in Cassiopeia for Alpha Centauri, what is the brightest star for Tau Ceti? I should to check angles and distances.

The thing I found interesting to contemplate is why is that fact brought out so explicitly in the wiki, and who could have inserted it- seems to be a clue!
