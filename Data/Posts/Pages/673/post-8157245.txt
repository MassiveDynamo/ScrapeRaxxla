well the dark wheel did expand from shinrata to LFT 926. back in the days, it was exclusively present in shinrata alone if im not mistaken. was the expansion influenced by players or not? i dont know. but if it was, then it should be able to be expanded again.

That's new for 2019. Previously it was not responsive to the bgs. So it only is expanding because fdev wants them to.
