tinfoil off - the story got shelved or paused or put on hold or something happened. Not sure if the original story has been revived as something else or even more overarching but think the 2 year story coming is at least part of the old story again, so its catching up from where it left off and would have gone next. But the team have been writing for 12 weeks so its going elsewhere as well

tinfoil on - 5 years isnt long, political alliances come and go and ambitious people see info they could leak for their own benefit. Loyalties change or fear goes and witnesses start to speak up. Especially if there has been an official cover-up at the start.

or Someone or a group of someone see now as the right time to enact the next stage in their grand scheme. Trouble for the Empire, trouble for the Federation......trouble for who knows what or who or how or why or when?
