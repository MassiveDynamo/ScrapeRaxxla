It kind of fits in the plot of 'and here the wheel' where inra and the circle blew up some stations making it look like thargoids and then tried to assassinate an imperial prince.

Now we have 'terrorists' attacking stations with 'thargoid weaponry' and the assassination of an imperial prince. Seems too conveniently similar
