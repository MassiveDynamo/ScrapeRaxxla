Good, now that they got the so called alleged " perpetrator " something is going to happen.

1. He will be assassinated before courts.
2. He or his attorney will say something on his behalf.
3. Something big might happen possible break out.
4. He will suddenly just disappear

Fact of the matter if you are involved of StarShip One, no one wants this person to be heard under any circumstance. It's a bad dilemma either it can be a questionable just sentence some innocent person, or his involved with some organization. My Credits are this person is innocent and now they need to shift the narrative before he gets his time in court.
