Found two alternative interpretations for journey systems from the Argonautica yesterday. Visited them & returned to the end point. Still nothing happened. Perhaps you have to get allied at each? But couple of them are uninhabited....

In process to get allied at the end point & if that fails will go looking around the galactic centroid point. But saw a chained mission at one of the delivery points for promotion to vice admiral; be nice to get a pay raise, plus a little vice!
