Here’s an idea I had that fits a lot of the clues. Raxxla is a fuel. Some kind of exotic element that allows us to dramatically increase the jump range of our ship. It’s the key that’s also the door to a new level of exploration. That’s why The Dark Wheel, explorers, are super interested in it. It’s something you can lose or run out of and have to find again. It’s something each commander must find themselves as it’s not a place, but a tool.
