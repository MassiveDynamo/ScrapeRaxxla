Any chance your investigating the 4 "others"? see what they actually are...?
Might be a bug, might be new locations, who knows if you dont check
IMO, those "Others" are still the same "crashed ship" sites on this planet surface (i.e. some of already known crashed ships sites have changed their "cathegory" from "Human" to "Other"). At least for me and all my understandings there is no way to distinguish "human" sites from "other" "in situ" All of them still just "crashed" ships in the nav.panel.
