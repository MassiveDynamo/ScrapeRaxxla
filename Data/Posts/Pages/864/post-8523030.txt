IMO, those "Others" are still the same "crashed ship" sites on this planet surface (i.e. some of already known crashed ships sites have changed their "cathegory" from "Human" to "Other"). At least for me and all my understandings there is no way to distinguish "human" sites from "other" "in situ" All of them still just "crashed" ships in the nav.panel.

interesting... its probably a bug... idk.... guess we'll have too wait and see, but Im worried alot of the bugs wont ever get fixed...

I posted a bit back about a faction installation that was orbiting so fast around a planet you cant drop into its instance without it flying away on you... well i found out its an on going issue from a past update, and it has to be fixed, location by location, its not a universal fix, if someone doesnt report the issue, they dont know to fix it...

If these locations are like that, we might never get our game back to normal, and as someone else said, Raxxla may be lost for ever now if its disappered or changed labels or who knows, and no one is there to report it...
