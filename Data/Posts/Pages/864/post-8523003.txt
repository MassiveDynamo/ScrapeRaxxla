Hmm. A bit of "heads up", commanders! Even that I can be completely wrong
May be the universe have changed a bit, or this is just the aftermath of already known/reported issues and their stage-by-stage corrections
Thats's is the recent FSS response from the otherwise well known "mad planet" hand-vaviumed location:

4 "Other" signals.
There were only a big number of "human" signal types before the FC patch (refering to some crashed sip sites, some of the,m bugged). Just after the patch they have disappeared as many others. Now we have Human+Other sites there (some of Human are the Fleet Carriers as I suppose)
In brief this can signify that Human/Other/Guardian/Thargoid signal-site relation has been changed

Any chance your investigating the 4 "others"? see what they actually are...?
Might be a bug, might be new locations, who knows if you dont check
