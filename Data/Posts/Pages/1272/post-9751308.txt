And now I have another question.

Is there a version anywhere online of an ED Galaxy map similar in any way to the in game one?

I want to tray and triangulate positions relative to a number of systems, but if I zoom the ingame map out far enough to see them all, it becomes unreadable - ie too far out to see the systems in wuestion.
