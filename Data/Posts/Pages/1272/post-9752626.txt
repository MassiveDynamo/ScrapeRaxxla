Ok, having re-read the original post, I've been out to Struve 1694:



The system remains two white stars, dropped in at 1694 B, pressumably because its the more massive/centre of mass.

Doing a search on the galaxy map, searching HD 112028 brings you to Struve 1694.

Searching for Struve 1694 B, or Struve 1694B, turns up nothing.

I could've done that from anywhere in the map, but I'm chasing Explo Elite, so going out there helped

Yes however there used to be a second system named Struve 1694 B thet was about 60ly closer to the bubble that didnt show on galmap unless searched and bugged your game when you tried to jump to it, I presume they removed it but it was there since Gamma up until my last post about it, Look at my screenshot again and you will see the system you went to top left and the one Im talking about on the bottom right
