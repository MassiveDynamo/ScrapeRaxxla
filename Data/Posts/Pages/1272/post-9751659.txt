I don't even know what the jewel box is...

I do have a question of my own, though. As I've been floating around the bubble I've been absorbing a lot of Raxxla material on the yoochoobs.

The landscape signal comes up fairly often, and I've dug around the forums and elsewhere to find more.

My specific question though is - is ther a compeling reason to interpret the signal as a 'landscape image'?

Sure, it looks like a drawing of a mountain, but is it one? Is there any reason not to read it as something else? Like, say, lines on a map?

I don't know which map, or even if that's what it could be, just trying to figure out if I've missed something with this one.

Only thing I can think of is it may match up to some constellations
