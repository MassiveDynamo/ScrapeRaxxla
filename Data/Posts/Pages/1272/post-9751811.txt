Let necro an old post of mine, Struve 1694 Bug/miss system is now...missing

I dunno, looks like it might still be there!



Still, I'm in Khun having just unlocked Elvira, but I gotta go sleep now.

Maybe I'll check it out before heading on my 5k ly trip to unlock Palin and hopefully also hit Elite (Explo) so I can really start looking for Raaxla!
