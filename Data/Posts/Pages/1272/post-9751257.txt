Please note that the closest star from Lyrient+KK-C+d14-0 is 96.5Ly away.
On a side note: best scan (almost) date ever!

SPOILER: BEST SCAN DATE EVER
If you put the 0 in 02 and the 20 in 2022 and then present the date European style you get 22/02/2022.

Eliminate the / 's and you have the palindromic 22022022.

It's a sign!
