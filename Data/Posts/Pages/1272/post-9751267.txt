I don't even know what the jewel box is...

I do have a question of my own, though. As I've been floating around the bubble I've been absorbing a lot of Raxxla material on the yoochoobs.

The landscape signal comes up fairly often, and I've dug around the forums and elsewhere to find more.

My specific question though is - is ther a compeling reason to interpret the signal as a 'landscape image'?

Sure, it looks like a drawing of a mountain, but is it one? Is there any reason not to read it as something else? Like, say, lines on a map?

I don't know which map, or even if that's what it could be, just trying to figure out if I've missed something with this one.

Its one of the Voyager probes if you ask me.
Watch The Farthest documentary and it is very simillar to images they put on screen around half way through showing sound bars from one of the probes.
