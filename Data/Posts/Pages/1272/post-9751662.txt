My specific question though is - is ther a compeling reason to interpret the signal as a 'landscape image'?

Not that I'm aware of.... as well, I don't believe anything has ever come of it either

Edit: also I believe it's been suggested to overlay that signal on the galaxy map from EDSM or somthing, and it lines up, sort of, to Colonia and Sag A*.
Though I haven't seen a good version of it done and I don't believe it actually lines up, BUT it could be able too if its just a matter of having the right scale on the map and the signal... idk... but yea XD
