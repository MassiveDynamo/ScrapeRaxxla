Maybe I'll check it out before heading on my 5k ly trip to unlock Palin and hopefully also hit Elite (Explo) so I can really start looking for Raaxla!

Ok, having re-read the original post, I've been out to Struve 1694:



The system remains two white stars, dropped in at 1694 B, pressumably because its the more massive/centre of mass.

Doing a search on the galaxy map, searching HD 112028 brings you to Struve 1694.

Searching for Struve 1694 B, or Struve 1694B, turns up nothing.

I could've done that from anywhere in the map, but I'm chasing Explo Elite, so going out there helped
