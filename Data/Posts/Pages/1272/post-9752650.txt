Yes however there used to be a second system named Struve 1694 B thet was about 60ly closer to the bubble that didnt show on galmap unless searched and bugged your game when you tried to jump to it, I presume they removed it but it was there since Gamma up until my last post about it, Look at my screenshot again and you will see the system you went to top left and the one Im talking about on the bottom right
I gotcha, that's what I meant by saying I re-read your post, and why I included the search for Struve 1694 in the image.

I'm saying my observations support your conclusion that it's gone

I might not have been very articulate about it, though

Edit: for spelling.
