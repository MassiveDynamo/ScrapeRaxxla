First rate research Rochester! I feel like we are closing in even more on Raxxla, now.

Reading through everything you put in spoiler tags, the things that stood out to me most are the seven walls and seven gates of Aspu and the concept of needing to pass over water and mountains to reach lost realms. Having seven gates defines a clear path, in order (I wonder if those are named?) for us to traverse. Perhaps seven seas or mountains have to be visited?

Han Zen makes the spot-on point that any precondition has to have a reason for being there, as Raxxla is likely just a single, probably dormant, location. Raxxla is, however, obfuscated and, quite possibly (speculation), guarded. Therefore, a precondition has to lift that veil of obfuscation so that it can be found, then it may be necessary to fight a guardian of sorts. (This is all sounding a lot like using a Guardians beacon to locate a Guardians site!).

So the question is: how to lift that veil that obscures Raxxla?
Related: how is Raxxla obscured? Is it a cloaking device? Is it false-flagged as something else? Is it only apparent at certain times?

I still think we have to do something to lift that veil, else it might be found by accident. Maybe it can be found by accident but is, as Han Zen suggested, located somewhere that the probability is vanishingly small. I need to give this some thought!
