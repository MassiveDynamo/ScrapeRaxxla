Yep, that’s what I’m hankering for...


A storyline!!!
When you fill up your inventory and ship cargo in 2 mins.... just dump your stuff in your spaceship on the floor.... seems infinite cargo capacity and hilarious watching the NPC wade through it....

In terms of the game the space flight is arcadey compared to ED.... and you can fast travel from almost anywhere on foot and appear orbiting a planet immediately if you've been there before...

the story lines - not that far through to judge as yet....
