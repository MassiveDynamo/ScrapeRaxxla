I found a nice picture. This is a bronze print, published in "Flora, seu de florum cultura" by Ferrari 1646.


Luna is pointing to Scorpius / Libra and earth. Her passenger is pointing at his flower bulb.

This probably just means it's October / November and time to plant the bulbs. Nothing important, I just liked the picture.
