With all this talk of whether Raxxla could be in the bubble, I am reminded that the definition of 'rim' (no sing at the back) is "the upper or outer edge of an object, typically something circular or approximately circular". This to me suggests the edge of the galaxy and I don't see why that reference would have been used to describe a location on the surface of a 'sphere' (bubble).
