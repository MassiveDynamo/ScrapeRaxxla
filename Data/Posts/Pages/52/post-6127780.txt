I'm not aware of many of these things tbh. (myths about it being in another Galaxy?!?! The only reference to it not being found is not Lore, TDW short isn't Lore, so you an't use that as fact to prove/disprove, sadly.) There's no need for the PF's power to be explained by treasure, but that doesn't mean it's not

The name did come from a kicksterter backer, but it's unlikely Fdev let them pick whatever they wanted without oversight or it might have ended up Planet McPlanetface.

64ly from Sol is really far if you've got crappy slow hyperdrive. That people went further doesn't invalidate anything or you're saying Raxxla must be at Beagle Point



Me too.

Ah, ok, so stuff from the original Elite, including TDW the novella, is considered myths and legends from a lore perspective, so I thought that was what you meant. What other myths do we really have about Raxxla other than those myths?

TDW (the group) not finding Raxxla is from Out Of Darkness so can probably be treated as lore.

The distances are from ED so are definitely right.

And the distances/positions do invalidate something, specifically this point - "It was pretty far out from the Old Worlds, so it would have been quite a trek in the olden days - enough to keep the locations secret for a long time."

As a general travel distance reference point Achenar is 139ly from Sol. It was colonised in the 23rd century. Hyperspace was only discovered in the 22nd.

Something that's not far from half way between Sol and Lave really can't be construed as pretty far out. And that definitely does not mean that I'm saying it must be at Beagle Point!!
