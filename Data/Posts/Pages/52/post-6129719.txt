there's 1,174 star systems in the 57ly range from Lave
How did you find that out? Is it an estimate, a calculation, or can the map tell you?

Now it must be said that I thought roughly the same about the Rift mystery - that there was something mysterious to uncover - so my track record isn't great. However, if the other 'great mystery' of ED gets handed to us on a plate or turns out to be somewhere that has been visited countless times under a different name then I'm pretty sure I'm going to be hitting the uninstall option.
After an initial burst of enthusiasm when I did the Rift (even signed up to the Google Docs spreadsheet!) in an AspX that required jumponium jsut to cross it (before the drive ranges got dumbed-down and Engineers and all), I never found out what the "mystery"'s solution actually was. Was it just generation ships? Or those Alpha-Beta-Gamma-Delta abandoned outposts?
