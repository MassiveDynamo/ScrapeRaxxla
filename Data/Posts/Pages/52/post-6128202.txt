Simplest solution is that Raxxla is several thousand LY out and nobody has stumbled across it yet.

The longer this drags on, the more I think that the simplest solution is that it is hidden behind a permit locked system, waiting for end-game development cycles to complete. What good is Raxxla to us now, without the ability to land on it or, better yet, walk around it an interact with it? Even if it is a landable body, what do we have on it? Another version of some base or the other? In my mind, Raxxla becomes part of the utimate end game narrative, whereby having arrived after Elite Feet and Atmospheric Landings, you dock, get out and greet whomever it is that you greet and walk into the portal of Elite:Andromeda.

Whatever the case may be...I'll hold out hope, but that's my thought for now. Anything we find now would just be too underwhelming....and I know the "it's out there" comment was prior to Horizons, but that doesn't meant it was meant to be discovered prior to Horizons.
