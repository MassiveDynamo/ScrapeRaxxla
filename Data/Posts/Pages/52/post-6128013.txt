If it's findable now, it's probably Founder's World.

It makes sense and fits all the myths.

- It's one of the most heavily protected but accessible earth-like planets in the bubble that's not in one of the major faction's space.
- It's immune from PP.
- It was pretty far out from the Old Worlds, so it would have been quite a trek in the olden days - enough to keep the locations secret for a long time.
- It's got the best pilots in the galaxy living on it and around it.
- It's permit locked so only the Elite can get there.
- It's got the only known presence of The Dark Wheel in orbit
- The system name means "Life, she saw, hope" - which is in keeping with the cryptic nature of the Raxxla myth, and could be seen as an oblique reference to the doorway discovered there: "hope and Life" is not a million miles away from the old "gateway to other Universes, and all that’s in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life" quote.
- There's also the rare trade item, the Waters of Shinrarta, which apparently are a fountain of youth - maybe one of the treasures of the myth - I mean, what better treasure for Elite pilots than long life and good health?
- the PF "has grown into one of the dominant financial superpowers of the galaxy" and control most aspects of spaceflight (nav software and Galnet to name but two). It's not inconceivable that they got that power via treasures from other universes...
- Plus, we're meant to believe that Elite pilots "retire" there? I'm not sure that many Elite pilots would want to retire to a dirtball - but if "retiring there" means going through the portal...

I realise that's not a new theory, but I can't think of anywhere that fits better so far and I just can't see it being that far from the bubble, given when it was supposedly discovered and the state of human FTL technology back then.

But Founders World is not landable!

but might be worth a system search, as Han-Zen says it could be elsewhere in Shinrarta

not sure about the fit for “place that is not a place, door that is also a key”

edit- where does that saying come from? it’s not in the The Dark Wheel!
