How did you find that out? Is it an estimate, a calculation, or can the map tell you?

After an initial burst of enthusiasm when I did the Rift (even signed up to the Google Docs spreadsheet!) in an AspX that required jumponium jsut to cross it (before the drive ranges got dumbed-down and Engineers and all), I never found out what the "mystery"'s solution actually was. Was it just generation ships? Or those Alpha-Beta-Gamma-Delta abandoned outposts?

The concrete POI to be found was the Zurara derelict megaship (originally an Anaconda) with logs describing how they were on a mission deploying some form of secret cargo but when they’d dropped the last one the cargo handlers disabled the ship and killed themselves leaving everyone else to die. The mystery was actually the conspiracy behind that event & various other nefarious doings and that conspiracy was what Salomé was trying to uncover. If you haven’t already then I recommend reading Elite Reclamation and Elite Premonition books (in that order), and then Rebecca’s logs at the Teorge listening posts.

edit: and EDSM will tell you how many, and which, systems (that have been discovered &reported to EDSM) are within a defined radius from a start system. So there may alsways be a few others that haven’t been reported to EDSM.
