Oh that's really a really interesting idea!

I have literally zero to do with Canonn, so your guess is a good as mine! I've not seen anything on the Canonn site, that's really all I use because they keep a decent database of discoveries.

I actually don't know if anyone has done any investigation on the tourist beacons themselves (as opposed to the text content). That's probably worthwhile if it's not already been done, if you need a hand collecting recordings or anything let me know, happy to help out.
ahh I assumed you were in Cannon based on the signature and interest in landscape signal ;-)
