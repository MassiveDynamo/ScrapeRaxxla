What of Enkidu?

I’ve been pondering about Shamash, solely because it’s the deity prayed to by Gilgamesh to protect him and Enkidu. I do find it peculiar why so many of the characters from Gilgamesh’s story are in game, except that of Enkidu!

Enkidu was a sort of golem, a wild man, bull beast or sexless wild thing made by the gods from clay to fight Gilgamesh, but who ultimately becomes his best friend, and whom Gilgamesh goes upon his journeys to ultimately save, in some texts they may also have been interpreted as lovers?

Is Gilgamesh in game as a reference to Holdstocks Ragthorn. Is he the Vagabond, is Enkidu his heart’s desire? Are they star lovers?

Upon his death Enkidu curses the door he built for the temple of Enlil, made from the trees from the Cedar Forest a sacred otherworld only accessible via a secret passage through a mountain. Is this the door which is also a key?

Thinking of the term Shibboleth, in this regard, when the Gilgamesh text was translated, Enkidu was originally interpreted as Eabani?

I believe in the Hebrew Enkidu and his lover were Eabani and Ukhat, and could have been the prototype Adam and Eve? don’t quote me I’m simply tin-foiling off memory juice…where they met Seru may have also been interpreted as Edin. becoming Eden in the Hebrew reworking of this myth?
