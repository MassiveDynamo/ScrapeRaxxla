The thetis picks up the signal back there somewhere, and in modern times someone else finds it.

One small addition to the shamash/tethis:

Tethis signal said kill them all.
Shamash signal said kill them all for me.

Which implies a modification or evolution of the original signal.
I agree, that's exactly my point.

The Shemash signal is derived from the Thetis signal. As I said in my post, it's extremely likely it was a military/corporate test of a 'murder signal' - both times.

The Thetis signal originated some time around 2380-2450-ish, depending on Thetis speeds and relativity. There were plenty of HUMAN colonies around the Thetis at this point, 50ly from the launch point in Sol, and the Federation and Empire were at war/in a state of Cold War, we'd had Hyperdrive for 2-300 years.

There's not really any reason to suspect alien anything at all to fully explain the Thetis signal.

If I'm missing something that connects Raxxla and Shamash/Thetis, please let me know!
