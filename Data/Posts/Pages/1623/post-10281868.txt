One small addition to the shamash/tethis:

Tethis signal said kill them all.
Shamash signal said kill them all for me.

Which implies a modification or evolution of the original signal.
To me kill then all sounded like guardian ai. It found out that guardians are bad and decided to... kill them all.
2nd signal i fantasized to be infected by Salvation, who perhaps fiddled with some club tech and tried to turn it against goids. Kill them all for me. Inserting his ego to an advanced tech system seems to be on point Salvation...
If 22460 was his attempt in uploading himself (back?) to the monolith network, then whatever caused thetis could have been affected...
