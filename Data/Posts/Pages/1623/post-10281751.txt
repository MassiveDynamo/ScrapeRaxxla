A good hypothesis, but what the text says is they picked up the signal from a system 15 light years away.

When we look at the Thetis and Shemash and draw a 15 light year bubble around each, they are inside each otherâ€™s sphere of influence.

View attachment 377614
The Thetis logs say:
"The signal originates from an uninhabited planet we passed 15 light years ago"

When the Thetis crewmember says this they mean "The signal originates from a planet that was uninhabited when my grandparents passed it 75 years ago".

I also pointed out that the alignments don't make sense. If The Thetis passed Shamash "15 light years ago" they why is Shamash further away from Sol than the Thetis is?
Shamash is 56ly from Sol.
Nefertem is 53ly from Sol.

And there's all the other stuff I said about how the Shamash/Thetis signal doesn't seem to match with anything in the Codex, and all the stuff about relativity and the Thetis being overtaken by FTL-capable ships as per the lore, etc.

I think the rest of your idea is really interesting Just can't see how Shamash/Thetis fits in with Raxxla at all, never have. If you have other ideas, I'd love to be wrong about this, a lead like this would rock
