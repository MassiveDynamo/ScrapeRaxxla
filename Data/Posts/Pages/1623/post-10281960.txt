@Louis Calvert - Anyone at Cannon done analysis on the MB Memorial Tourist Beacons audio when in FSS?

I was poking around at Artemis having mapped "The Underworld" and seeing if there were any unusual transmissions from Col 70 sector fy-n c21-3 and towards Barnard's loop (as well as other directions) and noticed the tourist beacon was quite noisy...

I haven't checked any other's yet to see if it's a std audio for MB tourist beacons (or other beacons), but thought I would ask before I do as there's nothing on the Cannon page I could see (https://canonn.science/codex/brooks-galactic-tours-beacon/)

I did have a quick play in Audacity... Which based on the sound the spectrogram turned out how I expected...
I am thinking binary in there with the diff heights of the bars or something similar...
I did apply a few settings spectrogram setting (including the old Tharg ones for Col 70).... but couldn't see any Raxxla picture though!




Here's a recording, while it's 3 mins long the audio message is short so lots of looping...

Oh that's really a really interesting idea!

I have literally zero to do with Canonn, so your guess is a good as mine! I've not seen anything on the Canonn site, that's really all I use because they keep a decent database of discoveries.

I actually don't know if anyone has done any investigation on the tourist beacons themselves (as opposed to the text content). That's probably worthwhile if it's not already been done, if you need a hand collecting recordings or anything let me know, happy to help out.
