I also pointed out that the alignments don't make sense. If The Thetis passed Shamash "15 light years ago" they why is Shamash further away from Sol than the Thetis is?
Shamash is 56ly from Sol.
Nefertem is 53ly from Sol.
Thetis doesn't need any trajectory overlap with Shamash. A simple solution would be an overlap of the lines Sol>Nefertem & Sol>Shamash, no?

The thetis picks up the signal back there somewhere, and in modern times someone else finds it.
Modern jump tech makes the Shamash location more or less meaningless, but in a meta interpretation FDev used Shamash intentionally. So a coincident trajectory would be a way to expect players to solve it.

I might be interpreting something wrong, but don't we just need to go to this overlap?

Edit: I see that they might not overlap, but that's ok. It's the overlap of the Sol>Thetis trajectory & a reasonable sphere of influence from Shamash which matters.
