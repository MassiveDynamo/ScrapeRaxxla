I've just returned to game to do the Michael Brookes (author of Elite: Legacy) Galactic Memorial Tour & find it strange that it starts in Artemis with a megaship named "Legacy" (with a decal saying "Raxxla Ho!") and ends in PMD2009 48 at the TB by the Orion Nebula Tourist Centre....there is a system named "Legacy" only 20ly further on- one might say "And fast by"!
the golden chain might be the string of 2Mass stars pointing back towards Sol?

I've spent the day exploring that system, especially the large rayed crater (resembling an omphalos?) on the moon (only one in system) Legacy B5a, but found nothing.
Jewel on the brow of the Mother of Galaxies- Barnards Loop/Orion Nebula? It is spectacular!
Whisperer in Witchspace Siren of the deepest void - Witchhead Nebula? also spectacular!
Parent's Grief Lover's Woe - singular parent & lover! death of a spouse...leaving a Legacy?

Yours stumped of Deep Fernweh (my ship name ) !
