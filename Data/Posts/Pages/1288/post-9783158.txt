Well, that is why I want to know origin of this picture. I know it is not Astrophel and Stella. This pic have the clue "eyes to see" and I know what it is. I will be busy for next few days fighting against Sirius invasion of Old Worlds but once I'm done I will find something, I already checked and I definitely have something.

I think i picked up from a lending library on reorte ...
