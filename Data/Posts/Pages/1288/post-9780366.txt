Mmm
And now my ipad (at least Safari) is not displaying the forum threads! Just get a blank page!
Hardware slowing down? Russian hackers? Because I refused cookies??
Just had to move to Opera to get to this thread to show, & this is also playing up....

Edit: Mmm, done various things via Safari settings & seems to have improved a bit, but still occasionally thinks I’m not logged in & then decides I am. Weird!

Also, if I open a Reddit page with Safari it’s shifted over so I can’t see the left edge of the text. More weird!
