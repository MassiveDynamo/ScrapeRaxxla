Sigh
I've been chasing down a distant cloud I saw in the skymap in Shinrarta.

Its NGC 7822!!

Space Madness!!!
I have mapped and scanned every body in and around this nebula, asteroid belts dropped into also if this helps, it was one of the first places I explored as it was always my "jewel of the mother of galaxys" as it shines so bright pretty much from anywhere that side of the galaxy, if anything is there it was added after Horizons and is well hidden just to help
