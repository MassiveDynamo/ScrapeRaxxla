I know it is Peaches from Mario Bros but that is strange because I did found something. Clue or a lead and a good one too.
Simulacrae is a frequent contributor to this thread. He has a sense of humour and a talent for drawing, and often combines the two in pictures for our enjoyment, they are not clues and he knows no more than we do!

(Unless he’s David Braben in disguise , though from his post times I think he’s American and not in Cambridge, England

IIRC he caught me out several years ago with a diagram relating to Unknown Artefacts.....
