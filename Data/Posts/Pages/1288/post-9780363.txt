I have mapped and scanned every body in and around this nebula, asteroid belts dropped into also if this helps, it was one of the first places I explored as it was always my "jewel of the mother of galaxys" as it shines so bright pretty much from anywhere that side of the galaxy, if anything is there it was added after Horizons and is well hidden just to help
You misunderstand! Oh, I know NGC 7822 is likely nothing to do with Raxxla. Iâ€™ve been out that way half a dozen times exploring & surveying.

What I was commenting on was my apparent difficulty in mapping what I see through the cockpit window to what I see on the galmap.
