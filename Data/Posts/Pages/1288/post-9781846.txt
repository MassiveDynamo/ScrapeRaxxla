right, iv a slight problem, I havnt been keeping track of my exploration rank in a long time, however noticed something strange, When Odyssey landed I was brought straight to around 50% of Elite 1.....however it has not moved since, I have looked around and it has been said alot of places that Elite 5 would take approximitly 1,900,000,000 credits of exploration data to reach from the very first starting rank since odyssey i have racked up about 500m+ and not one bit of progress, I should adleats be at the end of Elite 3.........

So far my exploration earnings are 1,415,442,735 at Elite 1, somethings not right, iv been around the galaxy with thousands of first mapped including Metal rich, neutrons, black holes also, I have a friend who is Elite 3 with a little less earned and hardly any first discovery's
