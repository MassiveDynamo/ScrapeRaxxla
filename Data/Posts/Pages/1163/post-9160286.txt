The codex also hints that the children's story Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars is the place to look for concealed facts about Raxxla's whereabouts.

Im still miffed about that - The Parijat story fit the bill and was sufficiently obscure.... Not making much of it beyond possible connection to the sacred trees.... gerrrr

We of course don't have access to PAaSS, but it does hint to an external source. That cold be TDW, Astrophel and Stella or something else.
When making the Raxxla mystery in ED, FD had the advantage of no pre defined location. That means that they could have taken any text, extracted some numbers and put Raxxla there.

Ya always thought this aspect made ED a great playground for these kind of mysteries... Foucaults Pendulum in space - taking a scrap of ancient myth and weaving a tale in the stars based on it

I'm sure it's no coincidence that Lave was placed at R: 13h 37m.

hmmmmm really? would be cool
