Well, logically Pharmasapien took over Azimuth Biochemicals and by their description was probably a forerunner/adjunct of INRA (we really ought to put together a timeline of all these actors!). So Im guessing Salvation is a scientist with an insight into INRA. Alba could fit that (doesnt she work for AEGIS, who always reminded me of INRA), but possibly also Palin. Especially if he is Club and has access to their records, and they have the arrogance to think their actions are all aimed at the salvation of humanity (despite the Dynasty plot details).

Still hoping to have a continuation of the Sarasvati story though!!

Some thoughts on Saraswati....

Izzy - could be short for Ishmael... Palin? How old is he?

Julian Lion... could be a reference to Ceasar's Lion...
Caesar's legion with which he crossed the Rubicon was ... Legion XIII Gemina's (their symbol the lion).... Gemina is of course the twins Gemini

Maybe Thunderchild is in Gemini ?

Or it could just be a reference to sheeple again:
"...I know he would not be a wolf,
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds." (JC 1.3.532)
