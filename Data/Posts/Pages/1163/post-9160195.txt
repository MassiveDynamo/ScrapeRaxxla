The greatest fear of all hunters Anybody else thought Salvation might be the DW invite? Im thinking less so now coz of latest Twitter message posted here by @Factabulous but at first seemed to tick all the boxes

Which isnt in game is it? Just a System description that hints at it....hmmm. Why not put it in as abandoned or something? Waiting for something else to happen first like legs maybe? Or just left to the imagination to work out what happened.

Salvation? Iwas thinking it might be Jaques (who I suspect of being DW member) since there seemed to be a hint of long/deep historical knowledge (how did s/he know about Hesperus??) but with the latest hint of scientific expertise I’m now thinking more along the lines of Palin (Club! A member of Elvira Martuk’s group and we know she’s a Club supporter) or maybe Prof Alba whatshername?? May also be a link back to the Sarasvati mystery/missing data archive etc....

Or CLDLL
CL, DL,L
150, 550, 50? Quick coordinate check anyone??
