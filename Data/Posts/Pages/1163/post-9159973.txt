Ohh, I managed 2 jumps before thinking to search for this.

I'm not sure I understand if this is some past CG / exploration or similar, still only about 500-600 jumps each way to try and shed any light on it

EDIT: & just noticed the link in Jorki's reply. Oh well. I'd be gutted if I hadn't fully expected something like this based on the last nn( n ) dead-certs I've crossed off.
