Was there a system to go to in the text? Slightly baffled.

I didn't screenshot the second image destination but a system was specified and sufficient distance away to not want to go there without being able to accept the mission. This is what was present for the first destination and a lot closer.

I'm not getting anything similar now, even after storing passenger cabins so guess it was just a blip or random mission with whatever chance of occurrence. Station is Malthus Terminal in Pleiades Sector HR-W D1-41, faction Anti Xeno Initiative and I had been hyperdicted a couple of times between Celaeno, Asterope and this system.
