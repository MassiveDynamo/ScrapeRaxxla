I didn't screenshot the second image destination but a system was specified and sufficient distance away to not want to go there without being able to accept the mission. This is what was present for the first destination and a lot closer.View attachment 226172

I'm not getting anything similar now, even after storing passenger cabins so guess it was just a blip or random mission with whatever chance of occurrence. Station is Malthus Terminal in Pleiades Sector HR-W D1-41, faction Anti Xeno Initiative and I had been hyperdicted a couple of times between Celaeno, Asterope and this system.
Ah, clearly you blew the DW invitation!

Edit: Iâ€™m currently trying to Fed rank up my second account and getting buggy scan planet missions-search zone that didnt collapse down until target 35km away, another where datalink scanner wouldnt read the data terminal, then return station name not instantiated properly.
