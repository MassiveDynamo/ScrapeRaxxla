I just stumbled upon this topic and find it very interesting. Now you guys probably are much smarter in this than I am, and you reasearch the topic for a long time, so this probably popped up already a million times, but my first thought as a returning player is that Raxxala could be a wormhole?

"Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth" - For me its a description that fits a wormhole perfectly.

And the Dark Wheel thing, not sure... but doesn`t a wormhole look a bit like a Dark Wheel from a humans eye perspective?

I re-watched Interstellar and this was my first thought, when i saw this topic. Anyway, just my 2 cents.

We may be smart, but not smart enough to find it yet after years of searching!
So any ideas are welcomed!
