or maybe Prof Alba whatshername??

Im leaning more towards her as well now especially after her recent unwarranted appearance in GalNet (almost to remind us who she was)....but it could also be a Scrivener / Dredger clan as that would make sense too. But yes how did Salvation get the codes to decode the LP in the Adamastor that had apparently been lost as the Alliance salvagers had no clue how to decode it? Seems like its an inherited code passed down from Azimuth originally but through who or which company is unknown.

But Im still hoping it is the start of the DW story / invite / something...a long drawn out start that takes years and keeps us going but at least gets started. I know they know we know that the DW will first appear in disguise (Codex) so they either just again deliberately making this similar and 'might be' or it is actually true this time. But the message seems maybe out of character for DW (Thargs solution one) and could go 2 ways, either a new Mycoid type solution to wipe them out or communications opened up with them to prevent the attacks...probably just new Guardian weapons though.

This is the most interesting time / story Ive had in ED so far since joining either way. Plenty of things could go plenty of ways. Loving it
