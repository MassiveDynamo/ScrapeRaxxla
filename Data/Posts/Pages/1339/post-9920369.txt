I recall the same however I seem to recall that related to missions, but maybe wrong. NPCs certainly behave differently if you have cargo, eg pirates and security can scan you and they change their behaviour. Some say Trinkets illicit a certain behaviour too, or offer some form of protection but Iâ€™ve never seen it confirmed scientifically, worth a shot nevertheless.
i mentioned this to members of the IRH, i have had more than a few bits of evidence pop up, you can only ask!
also they make your ship make weird noises, if you want the science, im all here for it, i keep a trinket on me at all times and after a few years playing ive definitely noticed a change in RNG, which is funny considering the fact those trinkets were for worshipping randomius factoria, or the lady of fate
