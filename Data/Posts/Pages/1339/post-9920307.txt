Apologies if this has been previously addressed.

Could it be in hyperspace?

Thargoids seem to have some sustainable capacity to hang out in hyperspace, and normal physics don't seem to apply in many ways in that domain.

All pilots have passed through hyperspace so the "commanders have been through the system" rumor would apply to all players.

In the same way an individual system can be permit locked, the game mechanics simply won't permit us to stops and look around within hyperspace.
