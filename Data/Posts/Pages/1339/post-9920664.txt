Yes the way back is a great tool, but if you know what your doing even that can get scrubbed.

It would just be very useful to learn the context, in full, as on its own it doesn’t directly quote Raxxla, and the mentioning of a ‘thing or item’ might have context if said ‘object’ is described elsewhere in that thread as necessary in finding Raxxla, if indeed they are talking about an object, but it seem they are, it’s a very interesting communication indicating a potential action needs to be performed; but that’s only from reading between the lines…
