The questioner referred to Raxxla as an “item, whatever it is”, Michael referred to it as a “thing” & “it”; don’t think any indication is given as to what “it” is by the phrasing.

Those screenpics were provided with no source information. I did try googling for the originals, but my googlefu is weak and the sources may have been removed by FD. If anyone can find the sources, or anything else that’s relevant, I’d be very happy to update the quotes thread.

P.s. you might have to use the Wayback machine.
