MB said Raxxla can be found, and more than once, and it’s not a random thing (see my FD Quotes thread).
He’s an author and careful with phrasing.
Since players can’t “stop” in hyperspace we could not “find” Raxxla if it was there, I think we would instead “pass” it.
So I discount hyperspace as a hiding place, on grammatical grounds
Even if it’s “not a place”
