I recall the same however I seem to recall that related to missions, but maybe wrong. NPCs certainly behave differently if you have cargo, eg pirates and security can scan you and they change their behaviour. Some say Trinkets illicit a certain behaviour too, or offer some form of protection but Iâ€™ve never seen it confirmed scientifically, worth a shot nevertheless.
