1. We've been told that Raxxla has been in-game since release. This means that it pre-dates Horizons. It very possible that it will NOT be a planet that we can currently land on. If there is anything near Raxxla that we can interact with then I (personally) expect it to be some sort of starport.

2. There is no reason to believe that The Dark Wheel have found Raxxla. Alex Ryder apparently discovered evidence that Raxxla was real but apparently died before he could pass on the details. The Dark Wheel, led by the Ryder family, continued to look for it until the quest tore The Dark Wheel apart and Neptune Ryder formed The Circle of Independent Elite Pilots and went looking for Soontill instead.

3. According to Rafe Zetter if Raxxla does exist then it is currently occupied by a group of élite's, twisted men, who are using Raxxla for their own benefit. These élite's are NOT The Dark Wheel however.





I always considered The Formidine Rift to be "training wheels" for the real show: Finding Raxxla. We pretty much failed to find the Zurara without someone finally pointing directly at the target. We've got to do much better on this one.

Or maybe it tells us to down grade to a kiddie car and search for something promised to be in game by 2.4,
the hunt for the mysteriously invisible Tionisla Graveyard?

As for Raxxla, would have better luck truffle hunting with a blind pig in Antartica.

SPOILER

That's a bit of narrative from Premonition the Canonn thread seems to have forgotten.
