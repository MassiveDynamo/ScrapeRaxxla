Any one noticed in Shinrarta Dezhra, Jameson Memorial, Pilots Federation faction has moved out two days ago. I sent a bug report in to see if it is a bug, or a planned move after the main patch and after the last fix patch nothing changed. If it was planned, it opens the door for The Dark wheel to take control, may be what FD are pushing for. Have to wait to see after the next fix if anything changes to confirm this is a planned move.
