MB we believe was the one that said: Yes Raxxla is in game, No you will not be given any hints.

Also hello, we do not like this sudden and unexplained locking of threads either. We will never forgive you Ian, you are the first one we will probe when we get there! Jerk.

Our base of operations on Earth went through the eye of Irma, so we have been down almost a month, but Our Human Cable Company says it will try to have us back online and in game by October 5th.

Glad to see you back safe and sound
