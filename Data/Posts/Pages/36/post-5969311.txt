I was reading through the op and was thinking about the assumptions about Raxxla. Do we assume anything about how we will know if we have found it? It will be named Raxxla? We will or will not be able to land on it?
One would imagine it to have structures on it, perhaps even visible from space. If The Dark Wheel is there now, we should be attacked upon entering the system.

1. We've been told that Raxxla has been in-game since release. This means that it pre-dates Horizons. It very possible that it will NOT be a planet that we can currently land on. If there is anything near Raxxla that we can interact with then I (personally) expect it to be some sort of starport.

2. There is no reason to believe that The Dark Wheel have found Raxxla. Alex Ryder apparently discovered evidence that Raxxla was real but apparently died before he could pass on the details. The Dark Wheel, led by the Ryder family, continued to look for it until the quest tore The Dark Wheel apart and Neptune Ryder formed The Circle of Independent Elite Pilots and went looking for Soontill instead.

3. According to Rafe Zetter if Raxxla does exist then it is currently occupied by a group of élite's, twisted men, who are using Raxxla for their own benefit. These élite's are NOT The Dark Wheel however.

Oh no! We'll have to talk about Raxxla in this thread instead of the Formidine Rift!

My name is Macros Black and I support this message.

I always considered The Formidine Rift to be "training wheels" for the real show: Finding Raxxla. We pretty much failed to find the Zurara without someone finally pointing directly at the target. We've got to do much better on this one.
