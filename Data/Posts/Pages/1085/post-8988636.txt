According to DW's history videos, they were added as a nod to Erimus' galaxy mapping initiative, and drew (no pun intended) from both it and Frontier's own conceptions of regions. Whether these were new conceptions or old conceptions, or a mix of both, who knows.
That’s not the case to the best of my knowledge.

IIRC when FD were originally adding the regions they were all just numbered (or had names from FD. It was suggested to them that rather than using that, they should adopt the names the playerbase had been using for various areas of space. They did for quite a few. Not all though, and there wasn’t an exact match of FD’s regions to the areas the playerbase’s names applied to.

(Maybe Drew has some inside info on this but as far as I know it’s as above.)
