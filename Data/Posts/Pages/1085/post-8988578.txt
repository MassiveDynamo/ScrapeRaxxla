I might argue this is the opposite of tunnel vision though.... It begins strictly as big picture scenario, with all things being fairly considered. If you look at the sum of the parts, they take you in a clear direction. For me, the big sign is that there is no other solid direction! And if you ignore the signs completely, for lack of 100% scientific proof, you are doooooomed to sweeping the galaxy forevah!

I think people have a bit of a stigma with Raxxla in terms of Scientific Method. This is not the same as scientific research in the real world. There can be errors on Fdev's part, whereas physics can't technically make any errors. Man created this sandbox without any set rules on what they can or cannot do, and we are setting ourselves up if we completely apply scientific method. While I would never make these kinds of leaps in the real world, we actually need to make them here. Maybe not right from the start, but how many years are we into this thing? The trouble with a theory instead of a straight out accusation (in this case) is that it doesn't motivate everyone... in fact, very few. A theory in this game is synonymous with a light suggestion... and that is not how we are going to solve this.

Fdev did not set out to make an unsolvable mystery. And based on the scope of this game, that's exactly what it would be if they didn't "make it a tiny little bit obvious". At some point you need to commit to something. Take it as a challenge to disprove, I actually welcome that, but this is the point:
