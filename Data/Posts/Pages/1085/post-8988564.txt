I understand that it is the sign of the solar system, but I can say that it also looks like the whole galaxy.
After all, there were 8 galaxies in Elite 1 and there was no way to move between
them.
(But this has already been discussed)

By the way who can remind me, before the introduction of the Codex into the game, was there a division of the galaxy into sectors ?
No, other than the sectors which appear as part of the proc gen planet names,(i.e. COL 285 SECTOR etc.) not the regions that we have now.
