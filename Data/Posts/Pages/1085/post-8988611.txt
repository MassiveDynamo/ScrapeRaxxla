They also have the advantage that if correct, Raxxla could be found with the original game's 7LY hyperdrive, which usually is seen as a constraint.
As much as it often is, it really shouldn’t be.

While on the topic, for info, a 7ly jump range isn’t enough for the route plotter to plot a route between Sol and Lave.

I can’t say for sure whether a route can be found manually or not.

(7ly also isn’t enough to plot a route to Achenar either, while I’m recapping this info. )
