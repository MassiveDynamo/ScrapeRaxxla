Yeah, I mean DD is still busy itself, but some of what were the really busy places aren’t so any more. The FR threads, well, that chunk of FR mystery stuff was concluded. The Canonn megathread slowly ebbed off, partly as a result of being split into it’s own subforum, with loads of stickies and threads, plus a gap in new mystery content. (Adding module/weapons carrots to chase to the Guardian stuff didn’t help either, as that just diverted the major focus onto them rather than the wider Guardian content. Thargoid stuff becoming less mystery focused probably had an impact too.)
Yeah, the end of the FR search and Salome et al was pretty much the last time I played seriously until this week. (although I may have been hexedited so not 100% sure about that. In fact it is quite possible I found Raxxla, and just can't remember). Noticed that most of the aliens forums seem to have stopped some months ago for the most part. Too bad.
