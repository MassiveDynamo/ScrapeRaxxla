Nah, just pulling your leg. Getting a lot of forum reading in on the way to Sag A*. Nice to see some familiar faces, place is pretty dead overall (all the forums, not here specifically).


Yeah, I mean DD is still busy itself, but some of what were the really busy places aren’t so any more. The FR threads, well, that chunk of FR mystery stuff was concluded. The Canonn megathread slowly ebbed off, partly as a result of being split into it’s own subforum, with loads of stickies and threads, plus a gap in new mystery content. (Adding module/weapons carrots to chase to the Guardian stuff didn’t help either, as that just diverted the major focus onto them rather than the wider Guardian content. Thargoid stuff becoming less mystery focused probably had an impact too.)
