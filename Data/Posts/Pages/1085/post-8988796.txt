Yeah I noticed his old account doesn't exist anymore. I know he is working on a new book (Sci Fi but not Elite related I believe). Will ping him by other means and see if he has a new account.
Just heard back from him. He hasn't been around for a while either in-game or on the forums. Someone contacted him directly via other means recently about something or other, but that was it. He thinks his old account should still be around but he hasn't checked recently.
