well, checked out L4 & L5 (the stable Lagrangian points) for Sol-Pluto and Sol-Mars, nothing to report!
Also tried a quick test at Saturn's rings, meh

mmm, back to the missing asteroid belt!
I'm on my way to Sag A* and maybe Beagle Point for posterity's sake, or I'd be tempted to come poke around as well. Maybe in another 40K LY or so. Flew all the way to Colonia to finally check it out and didn't even get a lousy mug, so thought I'd best try and get something out of the trip.
