As much as it often is, it really shouldn’t be.

While on the topic, for info, a 7ly jump range isn’t enough for the route plotter to plot a route between Sol and Lave.

I can’t say for sure whether a route can be found manually or not.

(7ly also isn’t enough to plot a route to Achenar either, while I’m recapping this info. )
You have a lot of recapping to do, I haven't been paying attention for at least three years. Could you answer all my questions for me? I was going to ask Han Zen but since you popped in first... ;-)
