@thatchino ha - you weren't expecting a question were you! I thought I saw somewhere upstream that someone mentioned that John Harper had been kicking around the forums again recently also - do you know if he has?
Ha ha! Wasn’t expecting this one at least!

Honestly don’t know on this one. Think I heard that mentioned as well, but if he has been then it’s under a different forum account to the one he used to use.

Regardless, I hope he’s doing well. Always seemed like a good guy, and if the sequel to AHTW ever happens I’d definitely be buying a copy!
