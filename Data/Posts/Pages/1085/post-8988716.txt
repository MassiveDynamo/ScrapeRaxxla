Yes, I wasnt here for all that but it does appear that the actual Salome event and the Gnosis led to the '10 foot pole' defensive nature of Fdev for a while.....even until the new CMs came along maybe but things are starting to spice up now. Weve had one genuine 'mystery' at Halloween that was just awesome although sadly over too quick it was still awesome, and one mini mystery with a signal and an 80LY range. Both have gone down well so hopefully more is to come.

FR is still a must do for new lore players though, thats always 'current'.
