That’s not the case to the best of my knowledge.

IIRC when FD were originally adding the regions they were all just numbered (or had names from FD. It was suggested to them that rather than using that, they should adopt the names the playerbase had been using for various areas of space. They did for quite a few. Not all though, and there wasn’t an exact match of FD’s regions to the areas the playerbase’s names applied to.

(Maybe Drew has some inside info on this but as far as I know it’s as above.)
Yeah they definitely did not use all, did not mean to imply that - I think it was more cherry-picking after voluble protests. I may be mis-paraphrasing what he said in the video also, it has been a couple of weeks since I watched it. I am sure he will appear and let us know at some point, after slapping me.
