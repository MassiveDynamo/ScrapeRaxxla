One thing worth considering is whether the regions where already there for FD’s purposes but just never ‘published’ out to the playerbase.

Bio’s appear to be tied to specific regions. The question is whether that was always the case or was only introduced in 3.3. I don’t think there’s any way we’d actually be able to determine for sure though. Maybe one for the AMAs when/if they restart.
According to DW's history videos, they were added as a nod to Erimus' galaxy mapping initiative, and drew (no pun intended) from both it and Frontier's own conceptions of regions. Whether these were new conceptions or old conceptions, or a mix of both, who knows.
