Ha ha! Wasn’t expecting this one at least!

Honestly don’t know on this one. Think I heard that mentioned as well, but if he has been then it’s under a different forum account to the one he used to use.

Regardless, I hope he’s doing well. Always seemed like a good guy, and if the sequel to AHTW ever happens I’d definitely be buying a copy!
Yeah I noticed his old account doesn't exist anymore (or at least I couldn't find it if it does). I know he is working on a new book (Sci Fi but not Elite related I believe). Will ping him by other means and see if he has a new account.
