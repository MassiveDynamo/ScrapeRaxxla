No, other than the sectors which appear as part of the proc gen planet names,(i.e. COL 285 SECTOR etc.) not the regions that we have now.
One thing worth considering is whether the regions were already there for FD’s purposes but just never ‘published’ out to the playerbase.

Bio’s appear to be tied to specific regions. The question is whether that was always the case or was only introduced in 3.3. I don’t think there’s any way we’d actually be able to determine for sure though. Maybe one for the AMAs when/if they restart.
