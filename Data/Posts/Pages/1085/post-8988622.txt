You have a lot of recapping to do, I haven't been paying attention for at least three years. Could you answer all my questions for me? I was going to ask Han Zen but since you popped in first... ;-)


Anything in particular?

(I was mainly recapping stuff Iâ€™d posted ages back and that was lost in the depths of the thread with that last bit, but will try and answer anything else if I can!)
