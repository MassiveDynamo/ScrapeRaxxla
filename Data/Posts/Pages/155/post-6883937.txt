It is a common trope in science fiction to talk about mankind making contact with another sentient species ... but sentience isn't all that it is cracked up to be. Lots of species are sentient. My dogs are sentient.

When people think of sentience what they are actually thinking of is sapience. Maybe the SAP in SAP-8 is for sapient and they could be related to that much rumored rogue-AI.

Wish my dog was either sapient or sentient.
Chocolate Labrador- there’s a reason you never see them used as guide dogs!

His latest trick is to stand on his hind legs like a kangaroo in order to eat apples higher up the tree (since he’s stripped the lower branches); it might be cunning but it doen’t say much for any sense of self-preservation......

SAP stands for ‘Socially Awkward Penguin’.

I’m Not sure about the rest.

Careful he’s an axe-wielding ninja & will sneak up behind you unawares. You’ll never see him in that black pyjama suit; unless the smell of fish gives him away



Still suspect Sirius Antimatter Propulsion core; seem to vaguely remember a galnet article about Sirius & Antimatter Propulsion, which I interpreted as a (rare) clue...
