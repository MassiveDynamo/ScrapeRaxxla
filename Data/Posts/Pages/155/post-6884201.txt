Quick question...as the rabbit hole gets deeper. Did the comment "it's in the game and we know where it is" come before or after Ed came onboard as Community Manager?

Fairly sure it came long before, & in the chapter 2 livestream interview DB seemed to indicate that Ed doesnâ€™t know anything about Raxxla.
I imagine only DB, MB, & maybe a small handful of others are in the know on this. Anyone planning on taking some truth drug to the next conference?
