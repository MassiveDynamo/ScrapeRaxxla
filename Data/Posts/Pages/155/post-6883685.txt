Standard, Sentient, Significant, Serious, Sirius...

It is a common trope in science fiction to talk about mankind making contact with another sentient species ... but sentience isn't all that it is cracked up to be. Lots of species are sentient. My dogs are sentient.

When people think of sentience what they are actually thinking of is sapience. Maybe the SAP in SAP-8 is for sapient and they could be related to that much rumored rogue-AI.
