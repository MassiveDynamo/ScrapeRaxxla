SAP = Sound Amplifying Pedal?

On a more serious note, did this ever happen (taken from the DJTruthSayer Twitch stream that Scytale linked)?

I PMed him several times about it. Never got a response.

I asked MB about Raxxla when I met the FD team in the hotel lobby when I was at FX17. Unsurprisingly, he refused to give an answer.

They could, at least, tell us what "Raxxla" is. Or if it follows RH's original lore... [mad]
Which brings me back to past times where these few excellent pages of posts, (and specially Doc's and DW's,) may come in hand to the new arrived threaders. If they didn't already read them.

Did the comment "it's in the game and we know where it is" come before or after Ed came onboard as Community Manager?


Iirc, this was not a comment adressed directly to the community by the FDev's. DW asked some FDev (DB I think) who gave him this answer. Then DW made the comment.
EDIT: got it. Memory still works...a bit.
