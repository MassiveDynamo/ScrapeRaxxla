Yep! But something really has me thinking "unidentified signal source." But either way it just reinforced my belief that you can hide anything within signal source location. We take them for granted and only tend to want to notice them when we're looking for materials, or the like.

Hi

I have noticed that there have been for me; a few weird occurrences in USS's very recently (can't be more specific as to time-frame):

On three occasions (separated by multiple hours play) I have entered the "Degraded Emissions Detected" USS (all in Open):

1. At least four ships were present, I arrived right in the middle of their globe, they opened fire immediately without comms. (The incident was too fast/violent to garner any concrete observations)
2. There was absolutely nothing in this USS. (well scouted.... even looked behind the sofa )
3. There was only one object floating way off (I'm frequently on the salvage for materials) when targeted there was NO description of the object, I scooped it perfectly HOWEVER it exploded as it reached my scoop. (?Player/Game criteria for identification and then successful salvage NOT met?)

There's some weird stuff out there... fly safe commanders o7
