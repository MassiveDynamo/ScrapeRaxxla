I found this today... Little strange to me but probably nothing. It's a Russian guitar effects pedal released in 2015. It includes a pulsar map. Probably just meaningless graphic design, but it could also be the location of Raxxla if it somehow someway was related or meaningful. Raxxla is not a word in Russian or any other language so its a strange connection. Maybe the company is just a fan of the game.

Russian chorus effect pedal marketed around 2015. Designer presumably was into both Elite and guitar!
