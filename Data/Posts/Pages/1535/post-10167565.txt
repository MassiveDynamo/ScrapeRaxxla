You may want to use INARA's Data > Search Nearest functionality and search for either station type "Installation (Unauthorized)" or "Outpost (Unsanctioned)". The unauthorized installations especially have Lovecraftian naming schemes. That said, I believe a number of the older non-dockable surface sites have varying states such as abandoned and varying states of use or disuse. That said, there is very much a secret underworld of sites right under our noses. Also, pay attention when docking at outposts if you are in the Bubble. There are some that have a red pirate insignia on the large antenna for the outposts. Details matter. I have sadly not done a terribly thorough deep dive into these given a lot of the initial research was just establishing how much of the older lore was directly or indirectly included.

NOTE: The Hermit bases (aka asteroid bases) are themselves a part of that underworld. Keep in mind, they were most likely created by whomever built the Dredgers. This also has the implication that humans were way the hell out by the 2800s (earliest date on Dredgers).
I think on Inara only those data where there were commanders.
