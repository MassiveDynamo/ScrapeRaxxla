I trust Salome less (I don't even trust her to be dead)
Consequently I REALLY don't trust what Salome says the Feds said



FDev don't always acknowledge a bug as a bug.
It took them a looong time to admit that the disappearing Heart/Soul nebulae issue was a bug.

Salom√© would never plain lie, without being all obtuse and mysterious about it.

The Feds would Lie about anything, but they are serious when it commes to protocol.

The reporting date may be a bit late compared to the discovery though.
