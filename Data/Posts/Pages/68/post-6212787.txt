Is this the new information that comes from the crashed Cobra MkIII? The mycoid storyline originated in FFE which starts in 3250, I think the missions involving INRA, the mycoid vaccine and the Thargoids are in 3252 or 3253..

I see what you mean, but the Mycoid storyline ends in FFE, not starts - in FFE it's revealed that Mycoid was used to end the war which took place over 100 years earlier than FFE.

SPOILER













Dr Innitu's assassination (from FFE) and his book is also mentioned in ED Lore at one of the tourist beacons (can't remember which offhand).

The Thargoid war ran from around 3125 to 3150/51. (Lave Tourist beacon gives the start data, and GCS Sarasvati logs give the end date). The logs state that the Thargoids just vanished for some reason - because no-one knew about the use of Mycoid at that point.

INRA was created during that war, and developed the Mycoid as one of the projects (Source, INRA bases).

Remember FFE stuff isn't Lore until it appears in ED Lore - but since there's a reference to the Thargoid/Alliance meeting in Out of the Darknes, and the reference to the Quest class ships in Premonition, then it's very probable that there's some elements of FFE in ED in a way we'd recognise on the way - and DB said (I think it was during FX17) that in ED we'd get to see "what became of INRA" or words to that effect, so I imagine ultimately the ED storyline will include the events of FFE
