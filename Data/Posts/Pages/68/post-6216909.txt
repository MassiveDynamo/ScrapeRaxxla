My Theory (Tin Foil Hattery Ahead!) My Search and My Thoughts

So I am still reading through this thread (on Page 18 at the time of writing this) but there are many things that have been bugging me about Raxxla. It is right infront of us but is hard to find. It is a place that isn't a place. All these lore messages but what if perhaps it is just something we are overlooking. Now I have to label some of this as a spoiler because I am using And Here The Wheel and later events in the story as a basis. I have a couple of theories some are thin....very thin and others a bits of information that I have learned.

Now for some things that I have thought of.

SPOILER




Well there is grasping at straws right? I'm thinking it might be but here we go grasping at small strings! Huh? Well lets go even further

SPOILER


Hmm.....get your tinfoil hats off now.....so what does it mean the Dark Wheel lost it? To me it could mean varous things honestly. Perhaps they lost it due to politics. Perhaps it was taken from them from a group like CIEP? Or perhaps they really did loose it. But none the less I think that people are reading way more into it than needed. There are some simple clues/cues or something else right infront of us. I have begun my search for Raxxla using lore, clues and the ED books. I'm also positive that FDEV are enjoying us hunting for this.

I'm currently so far out in the black that just doing old fashioned research and digging is all I have right now.

Where is Soontil located? Or do we not know that yet either?
