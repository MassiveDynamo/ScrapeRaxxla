Thanks for the update Moribus: I've not been keeping up with new discoveries and how they affect the ED historyline as much as I'd like - mainly because I'd actually like to find these things out for myself! But in this instance the info you give is welcome, thanks.

And Here The Wheel confirms the FFE storyline in an implicit way in the first scene on the Bohemoth where the Admiral talks about Mic Turner being a traitor to humanity and the interspecies convention with the Thargoids.

PS - please excuse me going off topic, I don't think any of the INRA stuff is related to Raxxla - in AHTW they don't know where it is either!
