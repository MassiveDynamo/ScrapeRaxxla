I headed to Sirius to do some deep space poking, when I got that weird "frame shift drive operating beyond safety limits"... Is it just a bug?

It's been reported multiple times to FDev, so they know, but have never acknowledged it as a bug (that I can find).

What if it's a "little bit obvious" hint that something is nearby? Dark matter / rogue planets / etc?

I'll spend a little more time criss-crossing space looking into these FSD anomalies...

I’ve had it a few times my self. Mostly when going from Sirius A to Sirius B.
Don’t know If that happens in other white dwarf system?
No idea if it’s bug.
