... my post about a potential Raxxla / Sirius connection:

I headed to Sirius to do some deep space poking, when I got that weird "frame shift drive operating beyond safety limits"... Is it just a bug?

It's been reported multiple times to FDev, so they know, but have never acknowledged it as a bug (that I can find).

What if it's a "little bit obvious" hint that something is nearby? Dark matter / rogue planets / etc?

I'll spend a little more time criss-crossing space looking into these FSD anomalies...
