No probs, thanks for the info from AHTW, I haven't read that one yet, nice to have extra confirmation! I need to knuckle down someday and just read all the books.
Ah, I assumed you had read that. There's nothing really about Raxxla in there (except nobody's found it). Overall, it's my favourite ED book of the ones I've read so far (just 3 to go) and if you're an FFE fan then you'll love it! (at least I did)
