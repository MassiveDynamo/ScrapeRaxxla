I don't trust the Feds
I trust Salome less (I don't even trust her to be dead)
Consequently I REALLY don't trust what Salome says the Feds said

I headed to Sirius to do some deep space poking, when I got that weird "frame shift drive operating beyond safety limits"... Is it just a bug?

It's been reported multiple times to FDev, so they know, but have never acknowledged it as a bug (that I can find).

What if it's a "little bit obvious" hint that something is nearby? Dark matter / rogue planets / etc?

I'll spend a little more time criss-crossing space looking into these FSD anomalies...

FDev don't always acknowledge a bug as a bug.
It took them a looong time to admit that the disappearing Heart/Soul nebulae issue was a bug.
