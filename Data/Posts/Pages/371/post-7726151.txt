Haven't seen Skytale for a while - must be off negotiating the manufacture of more t-shirts..

I'm here. Just waiting for late 2020 (with ED shelved, playing cool STALKER mods !) to see how badly the Devs are going to spoil a new section of the game, just like they did with Exploration and that crappy FSS.
For now, April patch, they keep going on with converting ED in an arcade-ish game....
And still no story teller at FD...
Anyway, good point that Fibonacci spiral thing !
