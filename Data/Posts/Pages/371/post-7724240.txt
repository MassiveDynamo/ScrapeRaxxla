So the omphalos rift might be a dust lane near the core?

It's not near the core. The dust lane is about 3000ly out.

I have been out there quite a bit. Mostly around Deneb(Alpha Cygni in ED), as it's considered to mark the start of the rift in some cultures. The place the universe was born form the cosmic egg.

There is a strange effect in the system map, that seem to only occur in giant stars in Cygnus. I made a few posts about the subject, around January.
