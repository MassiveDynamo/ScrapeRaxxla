These fit well with the idea that Aridane is Princess Astrophel and may also indicate that the Minotaur is Stella (the star).

Alphekka is supposed to be an eclipsing binary star. In ED the Sun like secondary star is missing. I don't know if this is significant or just an oversight in Stellar forge?
