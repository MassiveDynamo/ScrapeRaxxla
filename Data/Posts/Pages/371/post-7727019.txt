I meant that filled squares on the radar similar to other ships. I found one old video. Some CMDR jumped to Betelgeuse, and then going near around 2.4k l.s. Then message appeared on the the panel about new contact and the marker on the radar too. May it was other CMDR or NPC? Or some object inside or other side of the star? I fear it may be offtop here to post link
