Funny thing: to me, that looks like someone's left hand index finger touching a broken bottle. Except it's more like an hourglass shape than a broken bottle.

And the only vaguely hourglass-shaped constellation I can think of is Orion. Which means that the finger is touching Betelgeuse.

And another funny thing:

Map of Betelgeuse - 4 planets. This matches what you see flying in space, orbit lines and all.

However, in FSS exploration mode... 5 orbit lines!!!


I've been flying around trying to use the parallax effect to hopefully detect a hidden anything that would be in that orbit, but no luck so far. The orbit line doesn't appear in space, so it's kinda hard to follow it.

AFAIK that's normal and very common, although I don't see the reason behind that oddball "surplus line".

Here's a generic example from a random System with an additional "Orbit 2.5" between a 2nd and 3rd Planet line :
