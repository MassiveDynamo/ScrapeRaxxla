How can Astrophil and Stella contain a hidden language that refers specifically to Raxxla in Elite Dangerous, given the dates of publication / release?

If there is a cipher, Astrophil and Stella may contain the bulk text, but the keycode must be in-game.

You guys are analyzing all these external sources completely independently / on their own merit, and then expecting to see "RAXXLA" in there, somehow.

Apologies I thought I had alluded to that but to clarify, I was looking for patterns in text the game is referring to. Raxxla doesn't and won't be appearing in any text outside the game that's pretty obvious as its a fiction only existent to this game, but references to astrological or astronomical entities or objects they may, or sequences of important numbers. E.g. constellation names; number of sonnets etc.

What I am doing is looking for both obvious answers to the text and obscure ones - anything really to understand how Astrophel is relevant within the game.

The text (in game) is likely a cipher, the way to read it could well be something referenced in the text of Astrophel, as it does reference both openly and obscurely various things not simply romantic prose.

'cunningly concealed facts about the mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to seeâ€™.

The above analysis is to look for any method of hiding meaning, the Elizabethans were quite good at it...
