Now if we are to look for a ‘hidden language’ within Astrophel I could not think of one better than Hermetic alchemy, and an example does present itself within sonnet 108:

How can Astrophil and Stella contain a hidden language that refers specifically to Raxxla in Elite Dangerous, given the dates of publication / release?

If there is a cipher, Astrophil and Stella may contain the bulk text, but the keycode must be in-game.

You guys are analyzing all these external sources completely independently / on their own merit, and then expecting to see "RAXXLA" in there, somehow.
