Ok for the sheer fun of it i will make a case for Lyra and Orphic/Chthonic connections

To the Jewel that burns on the Brow of the Mother of Galaxies ! - While Cassiopeia sounds good for this ... what if this is like the Orphic Hymns
SPOILER: NYX
































, The Mother of Galaxies could possibly be Nyx who according to the Derveni Papyrus gave birth to Uranus (the heavens). I also found this poem interesting ... The Brow of Night

The second bit about Whispers in Witchspace "to me" still sounds like Eurydices whisper of "farewell" in the tunnel to the Underworld. With the bit about Siren of the Deepest Void probably referencing Orpheus in the Underworld.

The epitome of Parents Grief is the tale of Niobe whos husband Amphion is also associated with Lyra.

I cant say much for the "lovers woe" other than it sounds like star crossed lovers ... which would be Pyramus and Thisbe (which have no Orphic connotations...drat) or even Astrophil and Stella (This Sidney fella really annoys me... but he like Eros who has been associated with Phanes who was born from a cosmic egg? mother ... Nyx )... or maybe the star crossed lovers were just Orpheus and Eurydice? Meh oh well

"Yearning of our Vagabond hearts" Travel ... Patron god - Hermes : Ruler of the Gate, Patron of Travelers ... and wait for it ... inventor of the Lyre

Music of the Spheres ... Lyre
