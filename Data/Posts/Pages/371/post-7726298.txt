Raxxla Codex ramblings
‘Undaunted, some Raxxla seekers insisted that the story's author had cunningly concealed facts about the mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to see’.

It is becoming apparent the FD may have alluded to a hidden language (or not, tis could all be carmine fish), as within my reading of Astrohpel and Stella out of context is seems apparent that there is more to the text than meets the eye.

Looking for some use of hidden language within Sidney’s work it became apparent he was a student of John Dee a notable mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, occult philosopher, and advisor to Queen Elizabeth I. Dee was also a noted follower of Hermeticism and of Alchemy as was Sidney.

Now if we are to look for a ‘hidden language’ within Astrophel I could not think of one better than Hermetic alchemy, and an example does present itself within sonnet 108:

'When sorrow, using mine own fire's might, Melts down his lead into my boiling breast, Through that dark furnace to my heart oppressed There shines a joy from thee, my only light; But soon as thought of thee breeds my delight; And my young soul flutters to thee, his nest; Most rude despair, my daily unbidden guest, Clips straight my wings, straight wraps me in his night, And makes me then bow down my head, and say: "Ah, what doth Phoebus' gold that wretch avail Whom iron doors do keep from use of day?" So strangely, alas, thy works in me prevail, That in my woes for thee thou art my joy, And in my joys for thee my only annoy.'

What could this all be towards I can’t tell at present, either a different way to read the text or even the codex - who knows but another thing sticks out from the text and that’s certain similarities with the Omphalos.

Now there doesn’t seem to be any reference to the Omphalos stone in Astrophel but within Hermetic alchemy this could be construed as the Philosopher's stone. Again I don’t at present see any reference either but the 108 sonnets similarity to the 108 suitors of Homers Odyessy brought out a curious quote about something called the Penelope Game or Penelope Stone Game:

'The 108 sonnets in Sidneys sequence allude satirically to the 108 stones, each representing what Thomas Browne calls Prodigal paramour in the ancient Penelope game.'

Is the Omphalos the Philosopher's stone / Penelope Stone?
Is there a way to read the texts (both Codex and Astrophel) Hermeticially?

Edit: An additional point of interest is that the nova within Cassiopeia had occurred within only 2 years of Philip creating Astrophel and as a student of astronomy he would have been very aware of it.

Stella's eyes are often referred as stars and could the 'with eyes to see' relate to the stars of Cassiopeia and or the nova?
