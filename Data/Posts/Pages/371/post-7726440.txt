108 is a significant number as the angles (angels) in a pentagon, the sum of 72 (years in one degree of precession) plus 36 (6x6 minor gods of Babylon) and may be worth following up for many other cross discipline concepts in arithmetic, (sacred) geometry, cosmology and music (frequency) (aka the Quadrivium).

A lot of the alchemical references you'll find relate only to this Solar system and raising the vibration of metals from Royal Saturnia (lead) through Jupiter (tin) to Mars (iron), Venus (copper) and eventually Moon (silver) then good and pure Sol (gold) with mercury as the thief that unbinds for the major works to be conducted.

The planets (gods) also have representatives in the animal and vegetable kingdoms but from what I've reviewed in the depths of the dev diaries and other DB interviews I'm not entirely sure his thinking has gone too far down that path or we'd be detecting more corroborating evidence hidden in plain sight, taunting us.

Keep digging for sure, we still have a distinct connection between many of the game assets and the platonic solids, and a mention of the Fibonacci sequence / Golden Ratio as the basis for procedural generation but DB seems to have been influenced more by science fiction on TV than the occult philosophical sciences.

It's a combined effort, keep throwing up ideas until a pattern is discerned...
