Oh I love good tinfoil.

This here is Avalonia, a microcontinent in Paleozoic Era. That's when Earth (that ELW in Sol system) had huge lizards, conifer forests, trilobites. Era ended in Permianâ€“Triassic extinction event, caused by volcanoes or whatever. Big contributor into fossil fuels.


This is Cassini before crashing into Saturn. Saturn had that weird hexagon thingy at the pole, and was called a "black star" in some ancient religions. I like it when things are connected to really old stuff, like Indus Valley Civilization. Also that spacecraft is responsible for many space-themed wallpapers.
I think it kinda makes perfect sense maybe
Do these sort of things happen often in the Canonn social media?

LARPers/hoaxers are irritating is what it is.

TLDR summary:

Guy's name decrypts to "Jason Ryder".

First ciphertext decrypts to references to Avalonia, Rhea, Iapetus, "Lens will reveal all".
Avalonia as some might recall was Jason's ship.
Rhea & Iapetus are moons around Saturn. Smack in between is Titan and Titan City.

Anyway its probably someone familiar with occult conspiracies or the black cube/Saturn/hexagon mythology.

Hitchens' Razor: What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.
