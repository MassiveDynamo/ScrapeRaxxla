That's the weird thing. It's not just one frame, it's definitely something visible as you pass it. At the time I confirmed it to only show up in a certain few systems in the same area. I tried finding it again at the same system a couple weeks ago and it wasn't showing up. At the very least, this means that the witch space animation DOES change and I think that could be a clue.

Well we already know the witch-space animation changes, just the like "painted-backdrop" when your in a system.... everything you see on the screen, in regular or witchspace, is supposed to be reachable in-game, and it always shows you what your looking at....

That said, again, without a video, or knowing forsure which systems and which direction of travel, there is no way to confirm what exactly this img shows...
