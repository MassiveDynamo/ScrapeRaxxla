Lens? I thought somebody said it was Ens. Cause of Causes! Ens Entium! Must have been reading "The Temple of Nature" by Erasmus Darwin.

"Organic Life beneath the shoreless waves
Was born and nurs'd in Ocean's pearly caves;
First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;
These, as successive generations bloom,
New powers acquire, and larger limbs assume;
Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,
And breathing realms of fin, and feet, and wing."

"Hear, O ye Sons of Time! the powers of Life
Arrest the elements, and stay their strife;
From wandering atoms, ethers, airs, and gas,
By combination form the organic mass;
And,—as they seize, digest, secrete,—dispense
The bliss of Being to the vital Ens.
Hence in bright groups from Irritation rise
Young Pleasure's trains, and roll their azure eyes."


Great stuff

Ah no, it was decrypted with an error due to reasons I'm too lazy to type out here (which the larper had to come back to correct). The actual decryption was Lens.

Edit: Just another hoaxer unless shown otherwise.
