Machina Ergo Sum said:
LARPers are irritating is what it is.

TLDR summary:

Guy's name decrypts to "Jason Ryder".

First ciphertext decrypts to references to Avalonia, Rhea, Iapetus, "Lens will reveal all".
Avalonia as some might recall was Jason's ship.
Rhea & Iapetus are moons around Saturn. Smack in between is Titan and Titan City.

Anyway its probably someone familiar with occult conspiracies or the black cube/Saturn/hexagon mythology.

Anyway Hitchens' Razor: What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.

Lens? I thought somebody said it was Ens. Cause of Causes! Ens Entium! Must have been reading "The Temple of Nature" by Erasmus Darwin.

"Organic Life beneath the shoreless waves
Was born and nurs'd in Ocean's pearly caves;
First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;
These, as successive generations bloom,
New powers acquire, and larger limbs assume;
Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,
And breathing realms of fin, and feet, and wing."

"Hear, O ye Sons of Time! the powers of Life
Arrest the elements, and stay their strife;
From wandering atoms, ethers, airs, and gas,
By combination form the organic mass;
And,—as they seize, digest, secrete,—dispense
The bliss of Being to the vital Ens.
Hence in bright groups from Irritation rise
Young Pleasure's trains, and roll their azure eyes."
