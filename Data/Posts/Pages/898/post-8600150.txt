Good spot...But UA showed Merope, but this is the UP side and can’t find any references to the UP system being named from the spectral analysis...

on my phone at the moment so attaching a crappy image from an old Obsidian Ant vid, but the left system is merope... right system would be my picture...

Did some googling earlier and can’t find any sign of which system it is...View attachment 181387

Did it stop with people assuming it’sCol 70 Sector FY-N C21-3?

Solved about 4 years ago. see Canonn site & old threads
