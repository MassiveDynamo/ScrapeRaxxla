BTW, the link was very interesting, but despite the map and information in the article, we're no closer to finding Raxxla, despite investors pumping hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars into the Canonn Interstellar Resource Group. Sheesh you'd think you'd have Mega-computers, labs and plenty of coffee to have figured it out by now.
My company is pulling its funding. We'll reinvest in the clothes hangar industry.
