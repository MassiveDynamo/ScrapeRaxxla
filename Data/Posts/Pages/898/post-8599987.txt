Oh on 7... If “-“ = 0 and “|” = 1 (binary) then it’s 1,2,3 in decimal... the order you have to do something.....?

there are thoughts that Thargs work in octal due to the eight sided nature of their ships...

By the way, was this image ever decoded (it's the spectrum of the noise emitted by the Tharg Probe / UP)? I can't remember what became of it.



I have a few grinds to finish before i get back to mystery stuff, but seeing as we're given steps here too, i'd be curious to see what happens if you take a ship to Merope 5C and try some stuff. Here's what i see :

Step 1 : Fly (below blue line) from 0°N/0°E to 45°S/90°E
[get back above blue line]
Step 2 : Fly (below blue line) from 0°N/90°W to 90°N
Step 3 : Honk from 45°N/90°E
Step 4 : Go to 45°S/90°W and see if something is now "open" ?
