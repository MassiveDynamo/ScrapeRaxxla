By the way, was this image ever decoded (it's the spectrum of the noise emitted by the Tharg Probe / UP)? I can't remember what became of it.

I have a few grinds to finish before i get back to mystery stuff, but seeing as we're given steps here too, i'd be curious to see what happens if you take a ship to Merope 5C and try some stuff. Here's what i see :

Step 1 : Fly (below blue line) from 0°N/0°E to 45°S/90°E
[get back above blue line]
Step 2 : Fly (below blue line) from 0°N/90°W to 90°N
Step 3 : Honk from 45°N/90°E
Step 4 : Go to 45°S/90°W and see if something is now "open" ?
