1 = UA
2 = US
3 = Sag-A??
4 = Direction the Tharg items point
5 = UP
6 = Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3
7 = coordinates to somewhere (Raxxla?)
8 = Thargoids go this way
9 = Raxxla or something else interesting!

Youâ€™ve missed the system on the left which is Merope!

One quick thought before going to bed: 3 and 9 remind me of the relative position indicator on the ship's dashboard. 3 could be something "in front of the ship" while 9 could be something "behind the ship"?
