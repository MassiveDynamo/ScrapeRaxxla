But since neither thargoids nor humanity (apart from DB and MB) know where Raxxla is located, then it’s not relevant here

I've seen the interviews with MB and DB... can you point me to the Tharg one or the Guardian one where they confirm they don't know anything about Raxxla? ;-)

P.S. just re-reading the Cannon site on Guardians, see if I can put this one out of my head too and return to other thoughts! ;-)


2/28 : Thargoid Log – The War Begins This data details the start of the conﬂict between the Guardians and the Thargoids. Several thousand years after they seeded planets in Guardian space with barnacles. the Thargoids returned. Of course, they discovered that the planets they had seeded were now occupied by the Guardians! The Thargoids immediately launched an assault. making no effort to communicate with the Guardians, which tallies with the Thargoids’ behaviour in human space.

Not very quick at exploring! ;-)

And doesn't necessarily rule out the theory.... damn....
