UA spectrogram map points to first barnacles on Merope5c, though they were found manually before that was found & decoded
UP spectrogram map shows how to find Thargoid Surface Sites (Motherships) using UP+UA+UL.

It’s all explained on the Canonn pages.

sorry that was me attempting (badly - still on my first coffee of the day!) to let the other’s know!

I am still thinking about why the Thargs and Guardians fought each other tho... And why the Thargs suddenly appeared again... getting to close... or somebody did actually go through that system again...
