Yeh, limpets show nothing .. 1 rock shines in pulse wave because it has surface depo for blaster. That what I see in chunk 3.
In chunk 2:

So it is possible that sound marks this stone ...
Upd: scanned all rocks in belt by limpets. Well, that was only 1 which can be exploded. Nothing more extra found.
Upd2: returned back to chunk 2, that rock is still there. So they're +/- persistent. Gona explode & mine it. Then maybe signal will be gone.
Upd3: just normal miner. Nothing dropped out except LTD chunks. Made high wake after as system is anarchy ...
