Darn it, all those nice young ladies from Lave sacrificed for nothing

Currently in Celaeno & 9% Deadly, wrist strapped, OBS deleted & using Windows Game Bar. Seems ok but I cant set it to use the function key shortcuts I’ve used for the last 5 years for screenshot/video recording.

Sigh, it’s a cruel world!
