Damn ...how u get rank so fast? You don't use co-pilot? Because mine will be elite soon and i'm expert yet...

Just logged off for today & currently 15% Deadly!
Well you told me about it!
I came out here at 0% Deadly, having ranked up at from 30% Dangerous over a couple of weeks at a CNB near Shinrarta in my engineered Corvette.
No! absolutely no co-pilot since they reduce your rate of rank increase as they'll take some of the credit!
Hit Celaeno with an AX Krait2! NHSS Threat 4 (often spawn within 30 ls of the station) gives you 4 goid scouts to kill, fairly easy but they each produce corrosive clouds to avoid when they expire & of course some of them fire caustic missiles. But I have been doing 3 or 4 NHSS threat4 at a time before returning to Artemis Lodge (it has a shipyard- I've moved my exploration Phantom out here for a wander around the 'verse when my wrists hurt too much) to hand in bonds & repair/rearm. I end the trip when I'm down to around 20 guass canon rounds or hull down to 60%. 16 scouts gives 1% rank increase since theyâ€™re all Elite.

Mind I'm playing around 6 hours a day (no wonder my wrists hurt!).
I have also become Allied with Pilot's Federation; I got a message to tell me so, though I can't see it in the stats, mind a while ago I did rescue an awful lot of passengers from damaged stations!
However on four occasions now those threat 4 have held two transport ships when I dropped in, which I guess from their chat (no time to scan & no cargo scanner!) were carrying UA, then 8 scouts spawn in and they're a nasty mix of Berserker/Regenerator/Marauder & Inciter scouts. I have survived so far but twice got a big repair bill!

I'm using the AX Rapid build as described here:
