Ok, visited each of 4 chunks in belt-b ... nothing except 4-10 rocks into .. did you try to scan it using pulse wave/recon limpets ? Maybe something is frozen into rock ...
Each chunk has 1 almost ideal sphere stone btw.. >:
That beep could be indication of deep mining possible btw, I see 1 rock I think which can be exploded ...
Need to comeback with miner and check what is it ...
