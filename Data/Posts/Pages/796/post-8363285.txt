I think a lot of its importance lies in the fact that it hasn't been found and I think fdev know this. There will be no clues as they don't really want it found, its much better as a mystery, they've even written the Codex entries like that.

The conversation with DB has been quoted by the source as 2 slightly different versions in this Forum and one on the blog, in only one does the 'we know why people haven't been able to find it' exist. Its also the same conversation referred to in the video. Its one conversation reported 3 times.

Guardians & Thargoids are meant to be 'solved' in time, maybe across the original 10 year plan, Raxxla is meant be a mystery so I dont think its connected to a Guardian or Thargoid mother ship plus theres no actual real or theoretic link in game (that I know of). The Club is meant to be 'solved', the DW maybe or maybe we just get further with it.

That's the fun though, if we all thought the same thing it would be a cult like some Raxxla forums have become and on more humorous days I wonder if DB reads this forum and says 'They've worked it out, change it' just to make sure we are always one step behind.....(one step behind indeed, one step forward would be nice)
