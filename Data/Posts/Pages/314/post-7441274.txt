how about looking here in our favourite constellation? Only current (2019) candidate for an exotic star..

only a short 10k ly trip

edit:

as is so often the way, system not in game (at least not navigable to under any of it names) . Also checked out any other mentioned candidate quark stars - either far too far away or not in game either.. <sigh>
