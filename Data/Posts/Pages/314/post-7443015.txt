Are you joking or do you have any proof?

No, we have no proof it's anywhere in mutter's spiral!! 8\

And I found this if it's interesting. The ship is named Trial... It's in Hera system which has been stated as a god related to various things of interest... I didn't follow and I wish I had now. But this ship may be floating around in the game. It just flew past me and left. I think it wanted me to follow it!! 8o
