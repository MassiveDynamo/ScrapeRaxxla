I like the idea of a bridge between systems, or something situational (like time of year) that opens up a gateway. I checked Vega (again, I'd visited it a few weeks back checking permit-locked systems for clues) and Altair but nothing on the outskirts of the systems except regular signal sources, of which I dropped into a couple of High Grades, but nothing relevant. Altair has three Installations and there was also a visiting megaship and it has the Tourist Beacon 0127 'New Agreements' about colonies agreeing to respect indigenous life. There is also a Niu Lang system but I have not checked that yet, however it is inhabited with two outposts and one landable surface port according to EDSM.
