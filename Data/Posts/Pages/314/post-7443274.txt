Hello everyone. I am new to the game and am interested in seeing Raxxla. Can someone point me to the clues and the current thought process to where it might be, and lastly places already searched.

Welcome to the quest, CMDR.

The most recent clues seems to revolve around the information from the Codex about Raxxla itself and the Dark Wheel entries, also transcribed in the very first journal entry in this log. As to the actual whereabouts, I suppose your guess is as good as the ones already brought forth here.

The collective infobank for already searched locations can be found scattered throughout the log. Sorry.
