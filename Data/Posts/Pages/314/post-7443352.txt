Small find after entering "place that is no place" into a google search. There is actually a place called "no place" in Durham COunty UK. Mr. Wiki told me the name could refer to greek "Utopia" which means "no place" (didn't know that before). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Place

EDDB lists no bodies or systems with that name, but there are three minor factions that have Utopia in their name. I deem Starlight Utopia the most interesting. Presen in three systems butt currently up to nothing much in powerplay (BD+38 2037. Jarowair & MCC 549). Might be visiting there when I have made enough money to again be able to survive one or the other Conda accident.

Well there is a utopia in the game. I thought it was a system. I still think I saw a system name utopia. Maybe if you get allied with utopia you have found raxxla?!
