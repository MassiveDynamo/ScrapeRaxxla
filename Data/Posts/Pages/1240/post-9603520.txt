Now, how do we know that TDW never found Raxxla? As far as I’m aware we only have the statement of the Admiral in one book, and I’m not convinced that is necessarily canon.
Mind I’m also coming around to the belief that TDW is a total red herring and is not the secret society DB said we can join. PF are said to be pretty secretive and we are all members.
Oh, I think there are clues in the codex. I’m currently working some possibilities, but my hands have got worse over the last few days (thanks to son’s diy and dog’s seizures) so not progressing very fast.
The pre game writers guides told that TDW hadn’t found Raxxla.
They could have found it after 3301, but I don’t see the point of that.
