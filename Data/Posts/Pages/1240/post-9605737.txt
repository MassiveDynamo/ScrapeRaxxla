Ah, thanks! Never played FFE
But “
The second scene on the Behemoth confirms the FFE main storyline and that the Dark Wheel didn't find Raxxla.

WHILE AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS WAS TRUE AS PER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY FD, THE FIRST ENCOUNTERS STORYLINE WAS LATER REDACTED.
”
So, sounds like TDW did find Raxxla?
The FFE storyline and TDW / Raxxla are two separate subjects.

The solid part of the FFE storyline has not been redacted. It's only the open end of FFE that has been kept open in ED, as well. The rest has been copied to ED, almost word for word. Even system names that don't exist have been kept in the TB texts.
