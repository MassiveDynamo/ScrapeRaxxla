Seven it's probably not about Raxxla, but about the Targoids...
Raxxla is six.
Your thinking of the logo in the codex however read up on Elite lore and you will see 7 is a number used in more than just Thargoid lore and is a very prominent number to also be considered within Raxxla, in real life it is a very symbolic number in many cultures and religions which is why i think Fdev/Braben have used it along with a lot of trow backs to mythology
