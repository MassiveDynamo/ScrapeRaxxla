An unknown body orbiting between Saturn and Uranus???????


Mmmmmmm!!!

“2060 Chiron /ˈkaɪərɒn/ is a small Solar System body in the outer Solar System, orbiting the Sun between Saturn and Uranus.” https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2060_Chiron


I’ve already posited that Chiron might be , but then why doesnt it show on scans? Maybe its the Omphalos Rift?

Sadly I have been at the point where 2060 Chiron should according to stellarium. And no .. there is nothing there.. my guess is that EDs orbits are not correct in direction or in time. Something is very wrong in ED... even the Raxxla search is buggy and with that my Raxxla search ended
