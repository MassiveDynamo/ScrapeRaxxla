Since my hands are too painful to fly I’m re-reading OOTD at the moment. Anyone else noticed that EDSM seems to have this wrong. On the system description for Peregrina it says “
Habitable zone:
Metal-rich body (2 to 34 ls), Earth-like world (541 to 811 ls), Water world (444 to 1,718 ls), Ammonia world (1,122 to 3,054 ls), Terraformable (421 to 841 ls)”

But that doesnt tie in with the system bodies tab descriptions. Yes, there’s one ELW and one MRB, but the others don’t match. From what I remember of the story there’s nothing to explain this difference.

Ages ago, was it Yorkshire where various persons were believed to have tails? Not where the tailed themselves were present in Yorkshire, but wherein they were believed to be present in nearby precincts by local tradition?

...I see how this might be offensive to you, but it's the first thing that came to mind with your mention of Yorkshire Day, and I am a creature of strict habit when it comes to sharing things that come to mind. Also, five days should be devoted to the celebration of any such county, and a toast to this day August 1st and not least for the cheering of Yorkshire!
