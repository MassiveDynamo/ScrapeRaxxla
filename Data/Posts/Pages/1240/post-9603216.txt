I think it was locked as soon as Horizons was released. Before Horizon there were no planets/moons with a permit. We couldn't land anyway.
Was Diso 5c the same where it was locked after Horizons but not landable prior? I ask as at least according to the older lore it may be locked due to Thargoid research. It interestingly is very near Uszaa where I believe the Thargoid incursion in GalCop started (related to the fact that gas giants with Ammonia-life seem to correlate much more closely to Thargoid activity in an area than terresterial ammonia-worlds). Worth noting Uszaa is Federal, and this may have been a deliberate act to destabilize GalCop. All signs from digging around prior Thargoid hot spots seems to indicate humans caused this but still working on who and motives with each case. First working to make sure the idea is solid and cannot be explained better another way. I really think we need to be playing a lot closer attention to where gas giants with ammonia-based life are located.
