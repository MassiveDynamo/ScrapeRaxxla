Yes, checking orbits of the planets in Sol themselves some time ago, they didn't match Stellarium's positions at any date I could find. Stellarium's modelling is sophisticated. They use VSOP87 which should give 1 arc second accuracy over the interval we are considering for the major bodies. Things like Charon, we're pushing even Stellarium's accuracy by 3307.

The models in E: D are, I think quite simple ellipsoidal models with no adjustments for multi-body interactions, which is not surprising really.

Stellarium also accounts for the motion of the galaxy, something which is not modelled in E: D at all, so the skybox in E: D wont match Stellarium accurately either. Elite has the star positions as they were in the year 2000, apart from nebulas which are as per 1950

[edit: must say I prefer the other VSOP ]
