Based on the 2296 start of the rumor, based on the Tau Ceti tourist beacon discovery happened sometime between 2159 (Tau Ceti self-sufficiency) and 2296. Now this was the slow expansion period (generation ships and the beginning of megaships from large corporations and governments with the very first "slow hyperspace" drives (hours to weeks between systems). So, it is near Sol and there are few options that allow for much else. Even hyperspace probes would get so far they couldn't retransmit in time for the rumor to get going by 2296 unless you invoke faster than light communications. We didn't Faraway until 2800 (which is centuries after Raxxla myth goes mainstream).

This is not true.. read again... the FSD was discovered somewhere in 23th century, but the first commerical use was in 28th century with faraway system. If there one of the first test of FSD that discovered Raxxla then my guess it would not been secret so long.(Raxxla is mentioned in 2296) Most likely was on of the generationships , first was launched in 2097. So that if what we have ... one of the first FSD testflight or one of the many generationships that had been sent out. Seems more likely that it was generationships that discovered it. OR if it was a FSD exprimental craft.... would explain why it took 600years to it became widley used because someone was scared that Raxxla was to be found by others that used FSD and it was Faraway system that didnt allow direct access to Raxxla and there for it was allowed.
