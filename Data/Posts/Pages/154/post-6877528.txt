In a lot of video games it is possible to sort of 'exit the game' via a no-clip option or by finding a glitch that lets you access unused portions of the game map. Good examples can be found in a lot of first-person games. Anybody ever play Portal and access the 'cake room'? I wonder if finding Raxxla might mean finding a way to 'break the game' and access an area of the game that is outside the normal game-play area. Example: Anybody other then me ever fly too fast toward a planet and wind up inside the planet's frame?
SPOILER
Back when the game was in Beta I used to try all kinds of crazy things just to see what the results would be, though I never did find a way inside one of those habitation rings at one of the larger stations. Since the game has been in full release I've always been a bit more risk adverse. Maybe I should start trying crazy stunts again to see if there are any interesting results.
