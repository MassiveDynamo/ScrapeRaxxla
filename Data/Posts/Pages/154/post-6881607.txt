Wouldn't be unheard of!
I've played in quite a few games where secret areas were accessed like this. A popular one was in Destiny. You can wall clip into a new DLC part of the game by exiting your vehicle/ speed when positioned in a particular fashion near the wall. The dismount animation would create a clip(?) entrance into the room, where you can destroy a high level Vanguard thingy. I have also seen underneath the planetary surface, in Elite, by messing around and detaching the camera while in the SRV. In the console version of the game the textures for planets don't always load right away, so it's not uncommon, when loading your game for the first time, to yourself spawn on top of invisible surface.

Reminds me of the game Shadow of the Colossus, there was rumoured to be a 17th Colossi hidden somewhere in the map. People searched everywhere, even phased through the map with free roam (I believe it was some sort of debug camera) and used that to search. Just as i was writing that I recall somehow accessing the debug camera in Elite Dangerous, while I was in witch space and I could see my Sidewinder, the flashing lights on the ship made for an epic shot in video montages.

I wasn't aware that was possible in the console version. Even to this day I don't know how I did that. Back to the point of this topic, I've always been interested in the horse head nebula. It's not to far from the bubble, it's a large area that's permit locked, and they know people love to explore nebulas and that sector has been locked since launch. Curious if anyone's tried to glitch their way into that sector. Or maybe there's is no way of to get in yet, unless there's a secret to gaining the permit.
