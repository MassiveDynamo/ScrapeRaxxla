Also related to the abandoned missions - has someone already investigated whether the name 'SAP 8' itself holds coordinates?

Like the center (or centroid) of e.g Sirius*, Alioth*, Polaris* ... maybe times 8 [noob]
Or system at X coordinate from Sirius*, Y from Alioth* and Z from Polaris*, planet 8?

* just as an example ... could be other systems (Sag A, Achenar, Peregrina or similar) or areas in space e.g (the Pleiades).
