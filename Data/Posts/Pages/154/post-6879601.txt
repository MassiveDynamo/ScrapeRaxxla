I'm not having much luck in finding SAP 8 Core container couriers post 3.1.3 in civil war systems, anybody had any luck?

Yes, found some Military Vessels around Sol last night. You have to look for system in war, not civil war!
Was unlucky to get Sap 8 containers, though. Wanted to collect at least 8 of them, but just managed to get Hafnium and the Antimatter Conainment out of the Vessels.

Thatâ€™s bad new. I was planning to get one after my holliday and do some testing.

Just one? Why so modest? [smile]

In the abandoned mission "Answering the call of adventure" the reveiver of the SAP 8 Core Containers asked for more of them(!), for any real answer.

My current theory is, that maybe the shards in the SAP 8 Core Containers get self-sustaining (possibly if you visit a certain system/station, or e.g with Hafnium as catalyst).
If you just carry enough of them, either the crystal shards can be freed safely, or they combine themselves into a single crystal, so the idea.
