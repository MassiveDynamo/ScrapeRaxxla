In a lot of video games it is possible to sort of 'exit the game' via a no-clip option or by finding a glitch that lets you access unused portions of the game map. Good examples can be found in a lot of first-person games. Anybody ever play Portal and access the 'cake room'? I wonder if finding Raxxla might mean finding a way to 'break the game' and access an area of the game that is outside the normal game-play area. Example: Anybody other then me ever fly too fast toward a planet and wind up inside the planet's frame?
Back when the game was in Beta I used to try all kinds of crazy things just to see what the results would be, though I never did find a way inside one of those habitation rings at one of the larger stations. Since the game has been in full release I've always been a bit more risk adverse. Maybe I should start trying crazy stunts again to see if there are any interesting results.

Wouldn't be unheard of!
I've played in quite a few games where secret areas were accessed like this. A popular one was in Destiny. You can wall clip into a new DLC part of the game by exiting your vehicle/ speed when positioned in a particular fashion near the wall. The dismount animation would create a clip(?) entrance into the room, where you can destroy a high level Vanguard thingy. I have also seen underneath the planetary surface, in Elite, by messing around and detaching the camera while in the SRV. In the console version of the game the textures for planets don't always load right away, so it's not uncommon, when loading your game for the first time, to yourself spawn on top of invisible surface.
