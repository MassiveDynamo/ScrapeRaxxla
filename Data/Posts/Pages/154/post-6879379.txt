Has it been considered that it may be part of a belt cluster? Out of all of the systems in the bubble I would think the majority of these remain unexplored due to their lack of financial reward.

Yep! But something really has me thinking "unidentified signal source." That's the one true thing that every player doesn't know what it is until a.) scanned b.) entered. Even when you see it says something lite "Encoded Emissions" you don't know exactly what will be in it. You know salvage will be there, but not necessarily what. Thargoids are another example. Threat level 5 might mean a cyclops, or it might mean a ton of scouts." The reason I think the Raxxla means of access will be a signal, though, is because I was messing around Sol and had gone way out past the last dwarf planet and sort of flying around the outside of the system and glimpsed a strange signal and thought maybe my mind was just playing tricks on me. I thought it said "alien signal source..." but I might have had my cursor over the "alien object (sight seeing POI)," far off in the distance, at the time I seen a signal source pop up. I immediately hit the space breaks, but the signal was gone. I was travelling way too fast for a "wait..hold up" moment. You start to see funny thing when you're playing, tired at midnight (lol). But either way it just reinforced my belief that you can hide anything within signal source location. We take them for granted and only tend to want to notice them when we're looking for materials, or the like.

apologies I should hit the quote on the bottom, not the top of the comment. LOL
