Remember, my theories were forged in the kiln of Canonn Science. Not even they could find an effective way to kill them off. Trust me, it was attempted many times, but I was better at finding critical holes than they were (even in my own theories). I used to be their golden boy. Your going to have to try harder if you don't want this revived. Because, I am coming for the emperor if Marlin's brother had anything to do with keeping Raxxla a secret. I then intend to use the Empire's own genetic tech revive the menagerie of old via genetic sampling (when we get access to ever more more worlds as Odyssey expands). None of the other generation ships were even capable of reaching Achenar within the 199 years required (2097-2296) let alone by 2250 when Marlin's Republic was founded. From, the looks of things, Mayflower 97 went to Tau Ceti then Achenar but I am going to have use current IRL distances (2022) as opposed to 3308 distances because the 3308 distances exceed the 119.4 maximum lightyears the Mayflower 97 could have gotten within that timeframe. If this is indeed the case, we have a route and known distance the Mayflower 97 could be in modern times (assuming Marlin Duval and her remaining crew abandoned ship in Achenar).
