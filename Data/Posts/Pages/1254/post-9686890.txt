Marlin Duval and her crews would have had access to hyperscpace travel during the migration to Achenar. Hyperspace travel was no publicly available at that time, but the technology had been around for 150 years.

It is not practically possible to reach Achenar in that time, by sub light travel. Sub light vessels don't travel at a set max velocity. They accelerate as long as the engines runs. The Mayflower is traveling at 0.6 light speed in the 3250s, because it has been accelerating slowly for more than 1100 years.

I also doubt that Raxxla was discovered in exactly 2296. If a random spacer mentioned it casually, the name would have been relatively common knowledge.

This does not mean that Raxxla isn't connected to the colonisation of Achenar. The time frame is valid, just like with the discovery of the non human relic.
Achenar did have sentient Mudlarks, at the time of discovery. If Raxxla was used by an advanced space traveling species to oversee or manipulate the development of primitive sentient beings, it may have been moved from Sol to Achenar when 'project humans' was finished.
If so, Raxxla was possibly moved again when the Mudlarks went extinct.

Not saying Raxxla is Guardian...
But it’s Guardian!!
I think humanity was a bio-engineered prey species!
Biology 13 “Non-indigenous animals were considered a particular delicacy. The Guardians expansion into space introduced them to new ecologies and, consequently, to new food. So far I’ve had little success in determining the details of these alien creatures or where they were obtained, but it was certainly a valuable trade for the Guardians. Huge parks and reserves were constructed on their worlds where they could hunt both local and imported animals.”

Raxxla is either a Guardian ark ship, or a meat processing plant!

Git yorrr Boris Burger 'ere!
