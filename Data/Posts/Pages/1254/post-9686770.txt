Unfortunately, that isn't all that is at stake here. The theory for Raxxla also must be able to explain the following:

-Sol is government center of humanity at this point so why in the heck does the first mention of Raxxla show up in Tau Ceti?
-Why does Tau Ceti declare independence almost immediately per tourist beacons and not rejoin until the Federation government of the United States transforms into the modern Federation when the Federal Founders sign the document that created the modern Federation?
-What makes Sol, Tau Ceti, Beti Hydri, and Achenar so important that they have special white stations that are not tourism stations? The best known of these is Black Mausoleum in Beta Hydri and is ultimately built by the fledgling Marlin's Republic or the very first Emperor per the Wanted official novel at some point before 3250.

There is more at stake here than meets the eye. I think we ultimately need Marlin Duval to have been directly involved in Tau Ceti to explain why the rumor surfaces in Tau Ceti itself and not elsewhere. Also, the Interplanetary Road Trip tourist beacon in Sol is going to be quite important here, too (see

).

Hint: Go read/listen to The Dark Wheel codex entry. I think Starman is but one proof that will be eventually found at a long disused starport orbiting the 8th moon of a unnamed gas giant. I am 99.99% sure that The Dark Wheel forms in Sol, itself.
