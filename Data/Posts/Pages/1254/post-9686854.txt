The ED books are also canon. There are details in them that are off after the retcon, but not much. Basically only the Thargoid / Alliance diplomacy from the 3250s.
Makes sense for the books to be canon, else why proof read and push them, supported with some in-game “facts”. Pity they didnt do a better job of that support (e.g. where are all the Dynasty ELW beacons). I’d just like an FD quote on what is canon so I can update my FDQuotes thread!
