I believe someone at FD said it’s not canon if it’s not in Galnet, Tourist Beacons or Codex.
If someone can give me that reference I’ll put it in my FD Quotes thread.
The ED books are also canon. There are details in them that are off after the retcon, but not much. Basically only the Thargoid / Alliance diplomacy from the 3250s.
