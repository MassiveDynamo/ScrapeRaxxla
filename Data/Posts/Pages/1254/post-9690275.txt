Humanity always has the highest hopes for our actions and responses, despite the vast history proving that our species is not only violent by nature, but also possibly a warring species. As a collective it is far too easy to guide the masses by those in positions of power and status. It should be no surprise to any of us that humanity would choose the destructive paths yet again. The lack of understanding the Thargoids motives is one of the largest chasms in our understanding of what's going on with them.
I get asked repeatedly "What are their motives?" My answer remains the same the whole time, "I do not know."

Wonderful video.
