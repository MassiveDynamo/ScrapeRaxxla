Not me!! Don’t believe a word of it!!

Codex says “According to self-professed Dark Wheel expert Lyta Crane ... ... ... rival experts have accused Crane of forging her evidence in order to maintain the revenue from her billions of followers.”

And there is no evidence that TDW and Raxxla are linked. And you are confused- that bit about 8th moon is in the TDW codex, not the Raxxla codex.
