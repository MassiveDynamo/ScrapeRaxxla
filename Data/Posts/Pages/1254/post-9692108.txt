Body 21 should be charon but since it is impossible to know exactly where it regarding which REAL date current sol orrey has been set to. I has flown to the exact location where charon aka the key should be in the year 3308, and there was none. As discussed before, it hard to make the location of it in orbit exact for many 100 years since our data today is not as exakt. Even Stellarium has some discrepancies in it orbits regarding charon.
Thought #21 is Halleyâ€™s Comet?
