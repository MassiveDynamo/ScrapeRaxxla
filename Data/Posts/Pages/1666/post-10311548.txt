Anyway, Jaques may be the oldest character in the series.
I don't think there's even the slightest competition among human [1] characters. He's over 300 (but probably not much older, since he got drafted due to persistent unemployment) at the time of the FE2 story, which seems to be set in general around the time of FE2 itself (given its links to the other stories in the book). I would guess 450ish for his current age.

Wycherley was maybe around 200 years old when he died, and even if he's still around in some form that's clearly a lot younger; he believed himself to be the oldest and had taken extreme measures to even get that far ... Zemina Torval is old at 137 and starting to reach the limits of more conventionally-available life extensions.

[1] Well, human-origin, anyway. I don't think Jaques is even sure any more.

As the first mentions of it is from a time where FSDs were much less capable, that is highly likely.
As a counterpoint, the legendary comparisons in the Codex - Atlantis, El Dorado, etc. - didn't become legends because people had found them, but because they were sufficiently far away either in terms of raw distance or other factors that searching for them wasn't trivial and disproving their existence was really tough no matter how many expeditions came back with "well, we know more about where it isn't" or never came back at all.

The closer it is to Sol, the bigger the explanation for "why has no-one even found the slightest trace of it in a thousand years of looking / stumbled across it by pure dumb luck?" has to get. At some point even the "it's defended by ruthless killers who ensure no-one who gets close to it lives to tell the tale" explanation is going to start showing up as an odd anomaly on ship losses reports and "Raxxla is in the neo-Bermuda Triangle" would at least get some speculation.
