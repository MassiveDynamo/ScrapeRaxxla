rabbit holes are way too deep, its simple on the surface.
"Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" -- Star-lover and the Spiraling Stars, so we're talking stars. Particularly spiraling stars.
Star 1: Jewel that burns on the brow of mother of galaxies. So what's a star with a high temp that is just short becoming a black hole?
Star 2: Whisper in witch space, siren of deepest void. What star gives off sounds that sound like whispers in SC, and entices sailors to make a dangerous journey that may strand them?

I know two of the things I'm looking for....
Tbf almost all of my non-raxxla related exploration is specifically to NS and BH (and CS if they're relatively close). Would suggest they have an allure, calling explorers out, regardless of writers romanticizing the way words are spun.
