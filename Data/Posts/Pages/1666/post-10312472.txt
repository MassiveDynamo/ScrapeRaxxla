Its not an allure, the siren is a term used by sailors that lured their ships to become marooned.
So I can think of a couple basic ways.
1) a hyper jump that requires you to jump with low fuel to get there making the return jump a risky bet.
2) a designation in a star system that requires so much fuel during SC that, once there, a jump out to the nearest star is a risky bet.

In both cases you could die yourself back to your last dock though.
