Milton utilised various deities as fallen archangels, he used them to convey various classical allusions.

Nisroch I understand pops up in Paradise Lost briefly, questioning how the war might be unfair, as the fallen angels had the disadvantage, because they were given the ability to feel pain. Milton probably was not being historically literal, instead he was likely being literary, associating the name negatively, based upon the cultural references to that name within his time.

Thereâ€™s no actual system in game with that name.
