As a counterpoint, the legendary comparisons in the Codex - Atlantis, El Dorado, etc. - didn't become legends because people had found them, but because they were sufficiently far away either in terms of raw distance or other factors that searching for them wasn't trivial and disproving their existence was really tough no matter how many expeditions came back with "well, we know more about where it isn't" or never came back at all.
Point taken, all i've got is "The mother of galaxies" which i interpret as Cobra, AKA Serpentis. (someone claimed there is a constellation that looks like a cobra)

Also while legends and myths have different origins, their common denominator is a grain of truth.
-ie a myth may very well not be true, whereas legends are often rooted in reality.

Seeing as it has been confirmed as being in the game it is a legend.
-this is when taking it literal obviously.
