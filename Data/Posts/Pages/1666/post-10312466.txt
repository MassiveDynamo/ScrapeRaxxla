I like the idea though. This was kind of the same thing I was thinking but To position my ship jumping into/ through the black hole. Most likely a specific origin and destination system required to bypass rebuy screen. Potentially a prerequisite set of accomplishments and perhaps key systems visited also, just because the game can track all that easily and I'm also trying to think like a game Easter egg at this point lol
