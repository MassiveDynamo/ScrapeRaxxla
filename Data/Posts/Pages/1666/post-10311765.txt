Point taken, all i've got is "The mother of galaxies" which i interpret as Cobra, AKA Serpentis. (someone claimed there is a constellation that looks like a cobra)

Also while legends and myths have different origins, their common denominator is a grain of truth.
-ie a myth may very well not be true, whereas legends are often rooted in reality.

Seeing as it has been confirmed as being in the game it is a legend.
-this is when taking it literal obviously.
Serpens is an unusual constellation in that it's split in half by Ophiuchus (which represents Asclepius holding it).
The best candidates for its brow are somewhere in the "head" area, but the varied depictions on charts don't help matters...
