I keep talking about Hoag's Object track in game music being some kind of clue or potentially relevant. The only IRL Hoag's object are outside of the milky way, yes, but are viewd in the Serpentis constellation, specifically near Serpens Caput.

I may have previously suggested the sound analysis gurus try listening to the Hoag's object track in audacity for any type of breadcrumbs but perhaps listening to the skybox in the area of Hoag's Object/ Serpentis/ Serpens Caput.
