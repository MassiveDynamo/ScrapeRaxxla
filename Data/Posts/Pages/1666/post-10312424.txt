Tbf almost all of my non-raxxla related exploration is specifically to NS and BH (and CS if they're relatively close). Would suggest they have an allure, calling explorers out, regardless of writers romanticizing the way words are spun.
Its not an allure, the siren is a term used by sailors that lured their ships to become marooned.
