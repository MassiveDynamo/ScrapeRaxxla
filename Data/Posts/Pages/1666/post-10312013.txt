I keep talking about Hoag's Object track in game music being some kind of clue or potentially relevant. The only IRL Hoag's object are outside of the milky way, yes, but are viewd in the Serpentis constellation, specifically near Serpens Caput.

I may have previously suggested the sound analysis gurus try listening to the Hoag's object track in audacity for any type of breadcrumbs but perhaps listening to the skybox in the area of Hoag's Object/ Serpentis/ Serpens Caput.
Might not be much, but that is beginning to look like a trend especially when coupled with the "whispers in witchspace".
-it also has a symbol of sorts in the spectrum, the only question is what it is supposed to show.


Ie, serpentis, graphic in witchspace and if possible a combination. Could be three solid leads maybe.
