Agreed, but if any author gave out clues it was MB- I'm still pondering if Raxxla is in Alliance space -from Legacy:
"As a girl Julia grew up without toys with a single possession, a book “about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon” (a clue??) locked alone each day in the tiny family cell while her parents slaved in the mines. She hoped to keep her Eagle as she’d grown accustomed to its idiosyncrasies...”whether it was a suitable ship for travelling all the way to Alliance space (another clue?) was another matter”.
I always had a feeling that the princess and the dragon has something to do with Polaris and the surrounding region of the sky. Draco the dragon is curled around Ursa Minor and Polaris.
The story could be a variant of the Cupid and Psyche story: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid_and_Psyche
This type story is classified as "The Animal (Monster / dragon) as Bridegroom". Similar to Beauty and the Beast.

The theme of the story is common in folk tales like 'White-Bear-King-Valemon': https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-Bear-King-Valemon
and "East of the Sun and West of the Moon": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_the_Sun_and_West_of_the_Moon

In these two stories, the animal is represented by a white bear. Ursa Minor is the polar bear of the sky.

The path "North" from Aquilla (the Eagle) on the horizon, across the magpie bridge past Vega and Draco, to Ursa Minor and Polaris, could be significant in some way?
