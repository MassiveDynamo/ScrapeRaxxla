The closer it is to Sol, the bigger the explanation for "why has no-one even found the slightest trace of it in a thousand years of looking / stumbled across it by pure dumb luck?" has to get. At some point even the "it's defended by ruthless killers who ensure no-one who gets close to it lives to tell the tale" explanation is going to start showing up as an odd anomaly on ship losses reports and "Raxxla is in the neo-Bermuda Triangle" would at least get some speculation.

So, look for the Bermuda Triangle of the galaxy and there it is? Bold strategy there, shouldn't be hard to track it down! If we never see you again we know you found it!
