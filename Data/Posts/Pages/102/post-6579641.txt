Well that's optimistic.
Yes ... I am quite the Debby Downer where Galnet and Frontier's missing narrative focus are concerned.

My impression is that all that story telling was leading up to the introduction of Powerplay which would then become the player driven story.
Possibly. The narrative appeared to continue, at least somewhat, after PP was introduced though. Halsey's return and Jaques going missing didn't seem to have much of a PP connection.

After that it was Formidine or nothing.
And now it seems to be Thargoids or nothing.

... What to choose today, evacuation run,,, what no material rewards,,, great no cif's and efc's,, frak!
To be honest most of my "playing" Elite: Dangerous has boiled down to re-reading the official novels looking for clues about Raxxla or reading books by Robert Holdstock (again, looking for clues about Raxxla). I've been so busy this last year with renovating my house that game-time has become a rare luxury.
