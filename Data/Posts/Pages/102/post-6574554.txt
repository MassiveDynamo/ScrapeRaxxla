That's the assumption ... IF those missions were truly about Raxxla. If we take that as gospel the next question is "what is the outer rim?"

Outer rim of the Galaxy? Outer rim of a wheel? It's obfuscated so don't assume that the meaning of "outer rim" will be obvious.

It's on the other side of the galaxy, but a circle has no end! (points to anyone who get's this reference)
