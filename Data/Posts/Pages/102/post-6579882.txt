Lets try Galnet Connections possibly then. What about trying to rationalize and connect Halsey to the Mystery. Or anything else for that matter.

I think the most likely connection are the Guardians.
They have bases with artefacts, network portals and seem to be in to crystalls.

They are probably in some way connected to Halseyâ€™s caretakers(constructs) and the Mars relic(implant).

If there is a planet out there, hidden from normal detection methods, they may well have putten something important there.
