No. While it can't be ruled out the concept of Raxxla as "Rogue Planet" comes from Drew Wagar's Oolite Saga which is fan fiction. I wouldn't put any weight behind any of Drew's description of Raxxla from those books. While I enjoyed the Oolite Saga as much as anyone it's important to recognize Canon from non-canon and, since even The Dark Wheel novella is considered non-canon that leaves us with very little to go on.

The thing is, Drew Wager is a writer for Elite now, yeah? What type of body Raxxla was, hasn't been discussed elsewhere and Lave 2 (where Oolite's Raxxla was) is locked off. It would seem that DB has taken into account these 'legends' and incorporated them into the ever evolving myth.

The other thing to consider is that parts of other Elite games were changed in the new lore making them 'non-cannon'. I doubt that Holdstock's book was thrown out totally as we still see its influence in Elite Dangerous.

What I'm saying is, DB hasn't fully said what the canon is. We don't even have (as far as I can tell) a canon timeline of events from DB. This is deliberately done to get us to find out what really happened. With Braben, you never know if Wager's 'legend' was incorporated. This isn't the first time that the community influenced Elite lore.
