New thoughts regarding Raxxla.

It is supposedly a rouge planet, yeah?

No. While it can't be ruled out the concept of Raxxla as "Rogue Planet" comes from Drew Wagar's Oolite Saga which is fan fiction. I wouldn't put any weight behind any of Drew's description of Raxxla from those books. While I enjoyed the Oolite Saga as much as anyone it's important to recognize Canon from non-canon and, since even The Dark Wheel novella is considered non-canon that leaves us with very little to go on.
