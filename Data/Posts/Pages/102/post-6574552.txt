New thoughts regarding Raxxla.

It is supposedly a rouge planet, yeah? Stellar Forge supports all kinds of anomalies in it's system, most oddballs are just not rendered (I.E. Comets and Rouge Bodies). I'm beginning to think that Raxxla isn't rendered... However, 3.4 adds more anomalies for us to find!

So, instead of trying to pinpoint the exact planet, we need to find a system that Raxxla would be in!

Qualifications for the system:

1. Accessible with 2b and Quirium tech.
2. Within a reasonable amount of distance from Lave (where most groups got their roots) using Quirium drives.
3. Able to safely house a rouge body.

Remember, The Dark Wheel were searching for this place well before J. Jameson became a pilot. Possibly before the PFs inception... We also (feel free to correct me here) don't know exactly when The Dark Wheel was founded, if it was once a different group, and more importantly, if Raxxla was the original goal.

It also remains to be seen if knowledge about Raxxla actually exists. What is myth, and what is real? How did the Raxxla myth start? How did The Dark Wheel find out about Raxxla? Where did they get that information?
