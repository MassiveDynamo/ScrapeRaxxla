Since Sirius is a possible contender for involvement in Raxxla, I was wondering whatever happened to Sothis Crystalline Gold. I know the commodity is still available as a Rare but ... when it was introduced into the game Galnet made it sound like this stuff was going to be a major scientific advancement. Is there any in-game use for Sothis Gold other than selling as a rare commodity? Is it in use by any of the engineers?
