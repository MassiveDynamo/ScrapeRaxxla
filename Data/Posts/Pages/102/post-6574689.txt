Correct me if I'm wrong, but all we have to go on, in terms of concrete information, is the fact that FDev said Raxxla's in the Milky Way and that they know where it is, correct?

That is pretty much it.

A while back Drew had a page up on his site that supposedly contained all the related lore on Raxxla that he could reveal without breaching his NDA. The page has been pulled but others have archived it.

The only real Canon references I know of are the brief mention in And Here the Wheel and the existence of CoR in Premonition (CoR can't exist unless the belief in the existence of Raxxla is part of the Elite universe)
