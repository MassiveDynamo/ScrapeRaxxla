The real issue here is that locating post-FTL generation ships without knowing the exact method of travel gets quite fuzzy.

Generation ships by design are ment to house a base number of individuals with room for many future generations to live, learn, and crew the vessels as the time it would take to reach the intended destination would far outstrip the human lifespan.

With FTL driven vessels, Generation Ships would ony be considered if the fastest mode of travel wouldn't allow a crew to survive the trip in their lifetime. Of course this doesn't take into account relativity.
Yeah, we're very much in the dark about how FTL tech worked for a long time.

I think it's always worth bearing in mind that between 3100 and now there's been at least 4 different hyperspace drives, probably more. Plus Supercruise. Potentially something else to throw in from the early 3100s, though the space-skip tech from Elite probably isn't actually canon for ED.

Even in the early 3100s it's not clear if everyone was using the same hyperspace tech, in which case Galcop had a complete monopoly of it, or whether other tech was in use elsewhere.

And things just get murkier as we go further back in to the past.
