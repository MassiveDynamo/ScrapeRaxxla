Yep readed what i wrote and i see the issue.

Basically in the systems i had this was basically, honk it says there is X bodies, i then use FSS and find the ones it had said in the honk, and them i go for the mapping part and in the case of the one that had a gas giant 561k from me, i selected it in the nav panel, used supercruise assist and let the ship do the route, when i was really close to it i honked again and the result was diferent, using the FSS it revealed the other bodies that previously i couldnt see even using the FSS. (the 1st time when i entered the system)

Not the 1st system i get this, i have already quite the number of systems that at 1st glance was already discovered and mapped by other commanders, that had left 1 or 2 bodies unmapped cause of their distance, and when i got there i not only mapped those as i discovered more of them.

Basically what i stated and am telling with all this is, if u see a sun that is 500K or more away from u, its worth flying out there and using the FSS again, cause i can say in 5 of this situations only 1 of them didnt had nothing new to discover...

Thanks!

Were you getting the 'System scan completed' message when you'd FSS'd all the bodies from the first honk?

Also, are you on PC? It'd be very interesting to see what your journal file shows for those occasions!
