uh The dark wheel in game faction in shinera is also based in a different system
LFT 926
Anything been mentioned boutâ€™ this before

Yep! Macros, the originator of this thread, is currently on a huge campaign to document all of the DW's faction interactions (via missions), which is somewhat relevant to their influence outside of ShinDez. IIRC, the DW has even been the controlling faction of LFT 926 within the last year, and i'm pretty sure they've even had influence in other systems in the past. It's hard to tell if this is significant info, but Macros is on the hunt to find out.
