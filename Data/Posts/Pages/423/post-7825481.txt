Also, i would like to note for the newer guys that in previous versions of the player log journal, there was a celestial body classification of "Rogue Planet". This has been taken out since 2.4 (i think), and to my knowledge, no body was ever found that fit this category.
Just checked - it's still there, according to the manual at least. As is X (=exotic)

Just to note, they're under Star Descriptions not Planet Classes.

Also under of Star Desciptions in addition to the above, and the normal star classes are:
Nebula
StellarRemnantNebula

Make of all that what you will!
