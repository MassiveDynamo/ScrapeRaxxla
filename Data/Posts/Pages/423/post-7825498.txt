Just checked the newest journal manual, and indeed it is still there! Weird, i remember people saying it was no longer in the journal about a year ago, but never checked to confirm. I wonder if it was removed from the journal at some point? Will check previous journal manuals and report back.
Is there a development list where you frontier state what they did to the game so we can identify when and if they took those out and if they did when did they put them back in?
