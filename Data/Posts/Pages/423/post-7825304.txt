Well light can travel through the worm hole can’t it? Therefore if you go through it at sub light speed and light is also going through it then technically you’ve not gotten there quicker than light as light also went though it and just so happened to do it first

Okay but, hear me out, if light travels through the worm hole with you then it would arrive at the same time as you or even faster than you? Yeah you’ve said standard space time bla bla etc but if you created a wormhole and light went through it
and then YOU went through it that light would arrive sooner than you and therefore you’d be travelling at sublight speeds.
Hypothetical I know but still it’s possible
Ah, ok, I wasn't ignoring this point, it's taken into account in what I was saying.

To explain further...

Light's an expression of the ElectroMagnetic force, which essentially we're also expressions of*. Can't really disentangle the two. For us (or any object) to be able to travel, light also has to be able to.

In other words, inherently, you can never get there 'before' light.

So we're left with two choices:

- We can't class anything as FTL

- We use a definition of FTL which is done in comparison to the minimum time taken for light to travel a distance without wormholes or anything else exotic.

The latter is a more useful approach IMO.

*with apologies if that sounds like it's straying over into mysticism. There's not mysticism or anything there, it's just trying to summarise a lot of stuff into a short sentence.
