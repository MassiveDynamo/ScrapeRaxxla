Also, i would like to note for the newer guys that in previous versions of the player log journal, there was a celestial body classification of "Rogue Planet". This has been taken out since 2.4 (i think), and to my knowledge, no body was ever found that fit this category.

Edit: went back to double check. Interestingly, "RoguePlanet" was a listed category of star type, which might suggest it is something outside of the bounds of any system that one might be able to jump to, given the right circumstance.
Now that is a really interesting piece of information
