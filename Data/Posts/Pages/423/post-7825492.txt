Just checked - it's still there, according to the manual at least. As is X (=exotic)

Just to note, they're under Star Descriptions not Planet Classes.

Also under of Star Desciptions in addition to the above, and the normal star classes are:
Nebula
StellarRemnantNebula
Make of all that what you will!

Just checked the newest journal manual, and indeed it is still there! Weird, i remember people saying it was no longer in the journal about a year ago, but never checked to confirm. I wonder if it was removed from the journal at some point? Will check previous journal manuals and report back.
