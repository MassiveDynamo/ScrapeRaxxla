One thing from all i read around here (alot more since i last took a look at the post), the possibilty of Raxxla been a rogue planet as been brought up several times and its not without good reason, and who knows we could actually have them and be one...

But, as FSS goes, and honking a system and all bodies appear... Let me tell u, they dont sometimes!

And i stand by this claim i made now, since i already experienced that myself, get into a system, honk and get 24 bodies, go to all but one that was more than 500k away, i decided to go there, and guess what happened when i got there? I honked again just to find out there was another 11 bodies out there, that werent spotted by the FSS in the 1st honk...

Now a rogue planet, if it was to exist, well... That is something that would definatly be very dificult to pick up and to get to...

One thing i have been doing, everytime im in the bubble mapping all i can to get as much knowledge i can of the bubble area, is to travel to the distance stars and honk again, lets say for instance i find a system with 4 stars and furthest away is 500k +... I found one like that, went to it and honked, found a gas giant and a small ice body, that initial honk didnt pick up, so yes, there is stuff u dont get when u honk a system, even doe they say "all appears" immediatly it doesnt!

And this my fellow Raxxla thinfoild hats commanders, is kinda of a secret that i picked up while exploring in this game that i hadnt revealed yet and im doing now.

Hmm... Need to do a slight process of elimination here to check a few things...

When you say honk and go to, are you talking in the sense of honking, then selecting things in the navpanel/sysmap and flying to them?
