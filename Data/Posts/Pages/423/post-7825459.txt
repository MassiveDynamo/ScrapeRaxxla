Also, i would like to note for the newer guys that in previous versions of the player log journal, there was a celestial body classification of "Rogue Planet". This has been taken out since 2.4 (i think), and to my knowledge, no body was ever found that fit this category.

Edit: went back to double check. Interestingly, "RoguePlanet" was a listed category of star type, which might suggest it is something outside of the bounds of any system that one might be able to jump to, given the right circumstance.
