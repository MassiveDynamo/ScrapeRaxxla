Well, I suspect TDW station is in a system with twin stars...Think Iâ€™m going to Shinrarta to get an exploration ship but cant decide between Anaconda, Python or Phantom
Why twin stars?

Also, with GFSD's in the game now, a Phantom jumps almost as far as an Anaconda that isn't stripped down for super jumping. Phantom is a -ahem- Krait exploration ship.
