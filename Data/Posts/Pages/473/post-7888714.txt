Some close ups of the orb might be interesting. Also some close ups of the key, particularly what can be seen inside it.
i'll try to take some shots later. the Ancient Key itself is just a blue-green swirling ball of energy, sort of nebulous and without form. the orb is a bit more interesting. when activated, it separates into several pieces to reveal some nice internal machination.

these are not my pictures, just ones i quickly googled for reference, but i will be back with more angles/videos at some point.
SPOILER



edit: i also have noticed the 3d cube pattern texture shown on the bottom of the orb for a couple years. this texture can be found in small patches at most Guardian architecture, except the Ancient Ruins (to my knowledge). this pattern doesnt really fit with their design motif of threes and sixes (which is why it always stood out to me), except that it it sort of represents 3 vectors in 3d space, and starts to edge along tesseract geometry.

edit2: oh wow, i never even noticed that the key appears to have an Ancient Relic inside of it....
