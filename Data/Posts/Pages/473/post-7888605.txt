Wasn't there that system around Heart and Soul nebulae that would act jumpy and disappear in galactic map? It was long time ago but I saw it myself too back then. I suppose it was later accepted to be a bug and fixed.
Yes, I noticed on this trip that the Heart neb disappeared once; but I remembered that bug from the FRifting days so didnâ€™t get excited about it.
