I think that they are visually similar...but I wouldn't put much effort into it. The Guardian Beacons bug me anyhow...they're a bit too "hand wavey" for me. Besides, the Guardians have been "extinct" long before Raxxla was ever a thing.
The guardians have only been extinct longer than we've known about raxxla, this says nothing about the length of its existence
