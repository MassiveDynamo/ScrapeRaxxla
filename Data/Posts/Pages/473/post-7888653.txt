I'm in NGC 7822 right now. I'm in s171 8 to be exact. You guys know what you're talking about and looking for a lot more than me, but by all means tell me what to look for.

Well, I suspect TDW station is in a system with twin stars, at least one gas giant; a GG will have 8 or more moons. The station will be orbiting the 8th moon and won’t be detectable by FSS; it might have to be detected visually once up very close (though night vision might just help). I suspect the twin stars will be hot blue, so type O, B or A, most likely B. It might be near NGC 7822, or near Zeta Cassiopeia. This is just hypothetical though, may be wrong, but all we can do is follow the few potential leads we have.

If you want to have a search then it would be helpful, Tyko’s a bit too far away to make going back very attractive. Think I’m going to Shinrarta to get an exploration ship but cant decide between Anaconda, Python or Phantom
