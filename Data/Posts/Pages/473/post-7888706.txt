Well, I do play on a potato laptop with a Dell Intel Graphics card (takes the game 10+ minutes to boot Horizons) so there is that. On console, though, I do see it occasionally....also occasionally see a distinct white circle in the center about the circumference where the bluish wavy things stop. Like I said, I wouldn't attribute to anything other than a graphics hiccup.

My PC is fairly powerful, with an NVIDIA 1060 gpu, 16Gb, SSD for C drive and couple of hard discs for capacity, psu oversized, water cooled...
Never had a problem with it, until this CTD. Which is what is frustrating me. Might have been a power line spike, but I doubt it.

Why twin stars?

Also, with GFSD's in the game now, a Phantom jumps almost as far as an Anaconda that isn't stripped down for super jumping. Phantom is a -ahem- Krait exploration ship.

The twin stars idea comes from two things- verse 22 of Astrophil says “Progressing then from fair Twinnes golden place”; but the principal source is the image from the Horizons menu screen. It may just be a marketing concept graphic (many people have said the station is orbiting too low, and the moons are too close, and the moon is Arial) but I suspect it’s an FD hint.

Oh I know. I did DW2 in a phantom! 56ly range but I was armed with beam and PA, just in case.
