the circle in the center is actually a sphere. when you activate the beacon by shooting it's pylons (3 structures floating outside of the main structure), this spherical orb projects out of the structure and glows with blue energy, just like the orbs that one would scan for blueprints at guardian sites. upon hitting the beacon orb with the data link scanner, you are given an ancient key from the "bottom" of the structure, those three small fins at the bottom. my original pictures were taken looking straight down while in between the larger top fins. here's some external pictures for reference.


SPOILER



my ship is still parked at the beacon, and i intend on doing a few more activations of the device to see if the ensuing transformations reveal any more interesting geometry.

Some close ups of the orb might be interesting. Also some close ups of the key, particularly what can be seen inside it.
