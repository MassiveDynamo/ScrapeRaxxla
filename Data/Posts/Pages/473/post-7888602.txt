The Exodus Base crashes were repeatable.
A one-off crash that isn't repeatable is probably just a one-off crash.

Ah, don’t be sorry! It was your remarks about the duplication that set me on this path, and on the whole it has been fun.
The annoyance came from the CTD which I’ve never had before, and the non-repeatability. I hate loose ends!
