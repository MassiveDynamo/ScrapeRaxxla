Ah, that’s interesting. It has never happened to me before, and I can’t remember any reports of it (though advancing years...!)
Well, I do play on a potato laptop with a Dell Intel Graphics card (takes the game 10+ minutes to boot Horizons) so there is that. On console, though, I do see it occasionally....also occasionally see a distinct white circle in the center about the circumference where the bluish wavy things stop. Like I said, I wouldn't attribute to anything other than a graphics hiccup.
