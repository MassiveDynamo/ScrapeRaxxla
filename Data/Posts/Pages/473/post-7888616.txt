The tower of stars or white blue thing you experienced just before jumping happens to me somewhat regularly. I've always attributed it to a performance hit of some kind. I see it on both PC and XBox.

Props for the search, though.

Ah, that’s interesting. It has never happened to me before, and I can’t remember any reports of it (though advancing years...!)
