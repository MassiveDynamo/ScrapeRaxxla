Could not repro the CTD.


Numerous systems have appeared in various patch notes for CTD fixes for one reason or another.
Edit: Not all for naught though, found an untagged main catalog star.

I think if “it” is really there then to trigger it you’ll need to visit Zeta Cass and NGC 7822 (probably S171 37, I was surprised (& suspicious) to find a tourist beacon there!) first, and possibly find TDW station too, which I reason is in the vicinity of either Zeta Cass or NGC 7822. I suspect the CTD was triggered by something/some sequence which I couldn’t repeat. Frustrating!

Edit: I suspect my hypothesis was on the right lines. It seemed to fit all but one of the “clues”. The “door that is also the key” is the one that I couldn’t fulfill; that may be where TDW station comes in.

Edit: doubly frustrating since Scytale promised me a bottle of brandy if I found Raxxla!
