I'm sorry, I didn't quite get that. By selecting the Test system, you could jump in there no matter how far away you were from it ? Or is it always 0 distance away?
If they behaved like the broken Ross 54, the distance was shown but plotting would always fail.

There is the oft-overlooked Set Target button (right side of GalMap, above the add/remove bookmark one), but then any attempt to jump only presents you with a crash to desktop.
