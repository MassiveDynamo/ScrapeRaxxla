Yes these are god-modes the Devs use, there are hackers out there who’ve accessed them to exploit infinite jumps or fly Thargoids etc.

The ‘galaxy’ is not really a spacial entity, we don’t physically travel anywhere, Cmdrs dial up that data and it loads into an instance. So logically ‘distance’ or ‘fuel’ are simply game-logic limitations. If there were a mechanism to hide Raxxla, there are any number of ways to hide it. But honestly if there were I believe we ought to have found it by now, or its narrative, or more likely bugged.

I believe it’s more likely ‘just out there’ but it either doesn’t show up on scans initially, or it’s so obvious we likely ignore it regularly out of hand, or is in the most mundane boring system imaginable.

But I do wholeheartedly believe Michael Brookes ‘did’ provide clues, and these are written into the game currently. His quote of ‘there will be no clues’ is historical, and more likely related to the archived DW storyline. The architecture we’re seeing only now obviously existed during that time, any narrative could have progressed through it, culminating into a particular area… if it were narrative.

Since that narrative (if linked to Raxxla) was scrubbed, that architecture would still exist in game.

I don’t believe there is any ‘magic’ behind unlocking Raxxla, I suspect after the DW missions were found bugged, I suspect they were paused, then the Codex built, as a way to tie that narrative together, then (hypothetically) the objective/s simply put in place for discovery.

Love your theories and thoughts and investigations... Where do you stand on the you can find it more than once statement?

You don't have to find a star system, planet, moon, etc more than once?
