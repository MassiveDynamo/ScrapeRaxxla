I do find this interesting . .. I never noticed the "breathing" before now....

I also was able to find the work done by another CMDR about trying to find where that signal is coming from, it was narrowed down quite well....
perhaps its worth a re-look in these systems for any possible escape pods floating off far in a system, not detectable until much closer to it...

here's that work;
