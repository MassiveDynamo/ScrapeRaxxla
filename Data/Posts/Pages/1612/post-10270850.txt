SD makes a lot of sense for location of the Omphalos Rift ....but how to find it??
Edit
Has anyone tried jumping from/to SD with Ancient Keys or Trinkets in their hold?
Is there any lore information that might shed light on the mechanism?
Brookes said Shinrarta Dezhra isn't Raxxla, and it's open to interpretation since he might have been referring to Founder's World specifically, but... I assume he meant all of it.

Shinrarta seems to fit a lot of the clues, and it makes perfect sense from a lot of angles that Shinrarta Dezhra contains Raxxla, or is somehow significant to it, but no-one has ever found anything and many have looked. If anyone is going to find anything there I suspect you're going to have to really, really think outside the box.
