I keep thinking... do we have the tools to find out which faction the convoy in Witches Reach belongs to (locked system near Sol)?

The theory is that previously this system required a “key” (the FD was not closed for further content). There are no factions in the system, but judging by the old patch note, a convoy was placed there. And.. for example... if you find out which faction the convoy belongs to, then access to the system may be located somewhere nearby with some faction
