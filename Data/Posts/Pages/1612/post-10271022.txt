The FLAC from the Canonn page
I'm surprised it's not recognisable. Imagine slow breaths as though a person is in deep sleep and breathing through a mask.
Here's how I hear it.

I can sort of hear what you say... but I wouldn't say it's a breath sound as there's other frequencies being played too.... just noise that you might interpret as a breath.... I guess playing blind to someone or two and ask them what they can hear would be a test...

I've listened to the racket planets play in FSS and convinced myself there's voices in them.... looking for something that might not be there? ;-)

and have you tried slowing it down?
