I asked why, for example if there is a system outside the galaxy with 0 distance.
We could jump there from anywhere and back to anywhere in the galaxy.
So this system is like a place without a specific location. It's basically a key and a door.
The test systems arenâ€™t possible to jump to, but they are in the game. Dev. test pilots can probably jump to these systems. If not, it would limit the usefullnes of the test systems.

If they can put hidden test systems in the galaxy, they can put in other hiden systems as well.
