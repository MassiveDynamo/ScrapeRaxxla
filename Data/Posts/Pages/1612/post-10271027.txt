The test systems arenâ€™t possible to jump to, but they are in the game. Dev. test pilots can probably jump to these systems. If not, it would limit the usefullnes of the test systems.

If they can put hidden test systems in the galaxy, they can put in other hiden systems as well.
Pretty sure some of the Live streams showed the Frontier guys messing about with their test systems (whilst turning off the feed from the game) then hopping back in to show the new functionality.... from memory they can hop about without jumping and some of the vids they explained they had infinite credits, etc...
