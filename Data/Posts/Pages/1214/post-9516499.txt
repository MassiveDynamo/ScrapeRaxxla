Bummed to see the Dr. leaving us.
Today is the Harvest Moon, and Elite's 37th Birthday.

"Magic visions stirring
Kindled by and burning flames rise in her eyes
The doorway stands ajar
The walls that once were high
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band"
-Pink Floyd, Burning Bridges.
