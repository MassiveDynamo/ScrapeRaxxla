Thanks! looks like it is dead though and wasnt kept up. Oh well i was just remembering some posts they made that i seem to remember having lore or galnet content that i didnt see in game… and of course i deleted mine
Oh, that’s a shame! I found it useful background reading, though I dont remember any lore from them. Have you tried to pm the originator to get the links updated? I think the later ones were available from ... somewhere else
