Everyone's so quiet nowadays eh?
Just caught the new Dune (2021) movie and some of the same symbols.
Don't read further if you don't like minor spoilers.


1. The black green of Raxxla as per wiki.
2. The falcon/hawk design same as ED.
3. The logo of House Atreides in the movie is almost exactly the same as the Imperial falcon logo of Arissa et al. I guess there's only so many ways to draw a hawk logo.

4. The Minotaur/Bull symbology makes an appearance . Will update with pics later.
5. Spider creature... there is always 1 creepy ass spider reference re: Dredger
6. Same messiah/hero's story as per so many other pop culture movies/ref. Osiris dies to Set, leaving behind Isis and Horus to carry on the journey.
7. Desert environment with structures like necropolis/guardian sites + some blood sacrifice on Salusa Secundus?
