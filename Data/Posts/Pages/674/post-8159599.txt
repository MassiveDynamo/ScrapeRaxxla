As soon as I read your thoughts I latched onto the trojan boy spying her naked form- uncloaked station? From wikipedia “The Jupiter trojans, commonly called Trojan asteroids or simply Trojans, are a large group of asteroids that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the Sun. Relative to Jupiter, each Trojan librates around one of Jupiter's two stable Lagrange points: L4, lying 60° ahead of the planet in its orbit, and L5, 60° behind.”

I don’t think these asteroids are actually in-game, but it’s interesting speculation
No, they're not. I went and looked already. In game we only see the four Galilean, of Jupiter's 79 moons.
