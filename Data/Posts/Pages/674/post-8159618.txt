Hmm and now you mention it I do believe there are a couple of Jupiters smaller moons that are named after sirens, but they are also not in the game as far as I know. Unless they are hidden somewhere in Jupiters ring?

the trouble with the Sol hypothesis is that it doesn't match the codex pic of TDW station, the star type is wrong for Sol.
