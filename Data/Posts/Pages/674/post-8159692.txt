Nicely done Jorki, but I'm concerned about the rolling together of TDW and Raxxla. TDW is meant to on an 8th moon etc. The toast is for raxxla. The pic of the red star is TDW related.

On the subject of Salome - although a drak wheel emblem is found in her ship, was it not planted there to incriminate her? What evidence do we have of her membership?

The club /= TDW - The club works against the likes of TDW - if anything TDW is out to expose them. TDW seem to me to be a small organisation who must hide to survive, not some all powerful group. They are the under-dogs seeking to discover the truth.
