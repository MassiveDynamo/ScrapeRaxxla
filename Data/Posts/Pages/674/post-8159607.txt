Like a full head of hair and thin waistline?
Slightly OT, but you might like to look up the farmer's almanac for specific timing if you're trying to grow something. As above, so below. Macrocosm, microcosm. Plants in the Earth follow the same influences as things that grow on the body. Better yet, go straight to the source and consult the King and Queen.

As for the waistline, there appears to be validity in the idea of not breaking fast until much later in the day.
