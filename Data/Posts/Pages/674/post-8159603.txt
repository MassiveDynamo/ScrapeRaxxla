As soon as I read your thoughts I latched onto the trojan boy spying her naked form- uncloaked station? From wikipedia “The Jupiter trojans, commonly called Trojan asteroids or simply Trojans, are a large group of asteroids that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the Sun. Relative to Jupiter, each Trojan librates around one of Jupiter's two stable Lagrange points: L4, lying 60° ahead of the planet in its orbit, and L5, 60° behind.”

I don’t think these asteroids are actually in-game, but it’s interesting speculation; might also represent the vagabond heart??
Hmm and now you mention it I do believe there are a couple of Jupiters smaller moons that are named after sirens, but they are also not in the game as far as I know. Unless they are hidden somewhere in Jupiters ring?
