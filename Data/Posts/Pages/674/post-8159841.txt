Nicely done Jorki, but I'm concerned about the rolling together of TDW and Raxxla. TDW is meant to on an 8th moon etc. The toast is for raxxla. The pic of the red star is TDW related.

On the subject of Salome - although a drak wheel emblem is found in her ship, was it not planted there to incriminate her? What evidence do we have of her membership?

The club /= TDW - The club works against the likes of TDW - if anything TDW is out to expose them. TDW seem to me to be a small organisation who must hide to survive, not some all powerful group. They are the under-dogs seeking to discover the truth.

I don’t think it’s that separate. I think the two are linked (since it is TDW’s toast!), but of course they may not be. I’m looking for both, in the expectation that finding the one will lead to the other.

That the station orbits the 8th moon of a GG is an assertion by Lyta Crane, and the codex itself says “rival experts have accused Crane of forging her evidence in order to maintain the revenue from her billions of followers” while her name is LYT Arcane, which suggests some doubt about her creditability. Though I think the rest of the codex on the dark station etc is likely to be correct. The reason I think 8th moon is wrong is the codex pic that shows an orbis station, planet and red subdwarf star; I don’t think a GG would form that close to a red subdwarf (though, as always, I may be wrong).

I can’t remember where I got the idea that Salomé et al were all part of TDW, but it was probably Drew Wagar’s lore thread. Certainly in Premonition the spiky haired woman (Elyssia?) represented TDW, and was closely associated with Rebecca, who got Salomé started on her Dynasty quest. Hence TDW are antagonistic to The Club.
