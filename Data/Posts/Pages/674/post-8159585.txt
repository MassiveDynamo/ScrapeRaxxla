Possibly, but what is the yearning of a Thargoid heart?

I am kind of stuck on that line of the toast. I just don’t know how to interpret it properly. The vagabonds May be TDW themselves, and the yearning are riches and wealth (Hades/Pluto was also the god of the hidden wealth of the earth) or it could be trying to express a desire that a vagabond would have like for wandering or even a home.

Edit: Also, Planets used to be known as “Wandering Stars” by ancient astronomers before they were properly understood to actually be planets ¯\(ツ)/¯
yearning (noun)
a strong feeling of wishing for something, especially something you cannot have or get easily
