the trouble with the Sol hypothesis is that it doesn't match the codex pic of TDW station, the star type is wrong for Sol.
It is more than likely the station itself is not in Sol, the picture in the codex shows it quite close to the star and it I agree it looks like a different star class.

I don’t know mate, from what you have pointed out in relation to the first line of the toast, I am pretty convinced the first line is referring to Sol. I would be surprised if it wasn’t, but I can never be 100% sure about anything. I will say I am about 90% sure at the moment.

The rest I am not so sure about. It could be a path going outwards to other systems, or it could be a path within Sol to follow.

That is of course if the toast is a clue for a path to follow, which we can’t say for sure.
