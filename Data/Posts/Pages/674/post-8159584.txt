Possibly, but what is the yearning of a Thargoid heart?

I am kind of stuck on that line of the toast. I just don’t know how to interpret it properly. The vagabonds May be TDW themselves, and the yearning are riches and wealth (Hades/Pluto was also the god of the hidden wealth of the earth) or it could be trying to express a desire that a vagabond would have like for wandering or even a home.

Edit: Also, Planets used to be known as “Wandering Stars” by ancient astronomers before they were properly understood to actually be planets ¯\(ツ)/¯

As soon as I read your thoughts I latched onto the trojan boy spying her naked form- uncloaked station? From wikipedia “The Jupiter trojans, commonly called Trojan asteroids or simply Trojans, are a large group of asteroids that share the planet Jupiter's orbit around the Sun. Relative to Jupiter, each Trojan librates around one of Jupiter's two stable Lagrange points: L4, lying 60° ahead of the planet in its orbit, and L5, 60° behind.”

I don’t think these asteroids are actually in-game, but it’s interesting speculation; might also represent the vagabond heart??
