The thing I found interesting to contemplate is why is that fact brought out so explicitly in the wiki, and who could have inserted it- seems to be a clue!
I don't know now. The picture was added by one user in 2009, but I can't find any authors of this text. Some text was there since start in 2003

P.S. First dedicated text (with the heading) about it was added in July 2009.

P.S.S. The heading was changed to "Pattern..." in November 2011

P.S.S.S. And "...far brighter than any of the other stars of the constellation" was added in December 2016 by user Lithopsian (probably, I'm not skilled in Wiki digging)
