It is more than likely the station itself is not in Sol, the picture in the codex shows it quite close to the star and it I agree it looks like a different star class.

I don’t know mate, from what you have pointed out in relation to the first line of the toast, I am pretty convinced the first line is referring to Sol. I would be surprised if it wasn’t, but I can never be 100% sure about anything. I will say I am about 90% sure at the moment.

The rest I am not so sure about. It could be a path going outwards to other systems, or it could be a path within Sol to follow.

That is of course if the toast is a clue for a path to follow, which we can’t say for sure.

I agree this seems to be a treasure trail. As far as I can see the station isnt in Alpha Cent so the toast clues may be the start of the trail, the problem is how to interpret them correctly. I suspect the unknown permit locked system LFT 509 as I think the star type from galmap may be correct for the pic. Maybe the next step is to gain a permit, but how?
