Given all this, it may well be advisable to check into Janus Incorporated in Delphi even if it may potentially be non-canonical. The faction is an NPC faction in the heart of region where "Thargoids" were rediscovered. Delphi also may well be the most important system in the region. This becomes especially evident given that the official narrative seems highly suspect.
I used to hang around in Goya Landing a lot when Pleiades sector was all the rage and soloing a Cyclops class interceptor using flak launchers was the cool thing to do. The place used to be controlled by Janus Incorporated for a long time, but I never witnessed any of those kidnappings and medical experiments that presumably happened during those times. Pleiades Resource Enterprise was another interesting faction during those times, and visiting Blackmount Orbital was always exciting. Ceres Tarn was controlled by Imperials, I think, and landing there was a serious matter.

I think the first FSD came about when some people discovered a Thargoid Sensor for a first time. Perhaps an Orthrus had dropped it. FSD technology even looks like something created by Thargoids, all those wakes and tendrils coming from your thrusters really isn't that human. Thargoids themselves really are such a marvellous race, imagine evolving up to a point you are merely considered cargo by your own technology. Or is that really so different from us and our escape pods, only that ours won't do anything that interesting.
