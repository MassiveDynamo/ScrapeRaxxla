Also, I guess after I finish mining I am going to Pleiades Nebula and more specifically Delphi so we can finally end this notion that Jaques is just a "nice old man". Mark my words, a lot of bad stuff that went down has connections to Facece. Also, Jaques is very likely not his real name, he is likely much older, and you really should be far more ticked off at what happened to John Jameson. It isn't just that he was setup. It is who set all this in motion and personally did that to him (this is of course assuming that wasn't a cyborg which got destroyed by the Mycoid). Not that it really makes it any better. But, yes, after I unload the carrier from mining going to poke around Janus Incorporated and Merope Expeditionary Fleet and see what dirt shows up. Not that the Feds aren't absolutely awful in their own ways.
