Any reason not to focus on the alleged TDW station as it might give us some answers in regards to Raxxla?
No reason to exclude it. However, there are multiple at least of the design that was abandoned in Tau Ceti (see Brewer Corporation codex last paragraph). The one in Tau Ceti was interestingly enough seemingly repaired and brought back online - Ortiz Moreno City. This list is very incomplete. See
White/Palm Tree Stations and Frontiers gazettes

I kind of suspect that the mythical abandoned station (in other words TDW HQ) is located directly above Raxxla and may be part of the Omphalos Rift. The problem is there are a lot of officially abandoned stations in the game where due to disasters or lack of resources or political upheaval were abandoned. Black Mausoleum is another as it was originally Imperial built and is presently a legal no-man's land as it was excluded on the treaty in 3250. (source: Wanted).
