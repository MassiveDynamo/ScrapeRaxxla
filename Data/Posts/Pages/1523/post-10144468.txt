I wonder if that is why they choose the Shibboleth game mechanic whereby things are hidden by name changes. Also, I am beginning to wonder if StellarForge can account for gravitational theft of bodies especially if systems are in close proximity to one or more systems.
There are a lot of systems in ED. There were lots in the old games as well.
At release there were limited resources for custom systems. Most were generated or based on catalogue data.
When a systems have had a 'name change', it's usually because the old system was forgotten. If FD need the history from a forgotten system, they just insert it in another system.
