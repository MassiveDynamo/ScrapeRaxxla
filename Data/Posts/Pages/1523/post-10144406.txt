This actually gave me an idea. There is a story in Tales from the Frontier called The Fiercest Creature on Altair which contains this ... Frontier Stories Altair 4a Orbital. There's just one tiny problem the Frontier gazetteer DOES NOT describe Altair. It describes a system with 20 bodies. The real Altair contains five planets plus the star. There are no moons in Altair.

Find the place this actually describes and you likely find The Dark Wheel station. There are a handful of systems noted for exceptionally dangerous wildlife. Weirdly, the hilariously bad description name pairing may be a clue. Altair Biggs Colony, Ackanphi, and Exbeur all mention Biggs. Meanwhile Enaness has mentioned of body 4 being home to alien civilization. The image with the station mentioned 4a as location of the station.

Note: I am keenly aware only Altair and Exbeur are confirmed. The others are unsolved mysteries of the lore.

Altair used to have more bodies.


Almost all RL stars and historical systems in ED has very different layout than they had in FE2/FFE. The system generation function in ED is much more realistic, than it was in FE2.
The RL stars in FE2 and FFE are also not in the correct position. There was a sign error in the import from the star catalogues. This makes it very difficult to compare stellar data from those games.
