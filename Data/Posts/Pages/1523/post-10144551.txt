While, I certainly agree there are other pathways, we at least have this weird as heck little POI in the Shibboleth system:

The Church Of The Path | Canonn Research Group

Yeah itâ€™s very peculiar.

Personally I suspect it could be environmental storytelling foreshadowing the Thargod narrative?

Another hypothesis is the naming of the planet is equally suspicious, if intentional it could be linked o the Finnish myth of the Sampo, a world tree/trinket of fortune, lost at sea?
