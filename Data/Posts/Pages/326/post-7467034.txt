I’m also of the opinion that Delphi is prolly connected in some way. Idk how, having been to the system a lot and not finding anything in system that might point us elsewhere, but i suspect there is something. But Omphalos being the “center” or “navel” I just discovered (for myself I suspect prolly everyone knew this) that coordnance 0:0:0 on the galmap ISNT Sag A*, it’s Sol. Sol is the center of the galmap even tho it’s not centrally locates. Idk if that might be of any significance.
