So has anyone checked out the Station (Steelhook Hold) that is orbiting Ra 13 H? Ra 13 is a Gas Giant and H is the 8th moon. I was attacked immediately upon dropping in there on Saturday night.
Yes, I checked at the weekend. It does not have ship's log uplinks, which is where any logs it might have would be kept. There are hackable comms relays but these only give data materials (for which you need recon limpets to access, and it's considered a criminal act, unless you are in an anarchy jurisdiction). Installations and megaships are often the sites of attack/defend scenarios in 3.3, depending upon the state of the Background Simulation in that system, so you were unlucky to be attacked - I was not threatened (but I got out of there before I could even be scanned).
