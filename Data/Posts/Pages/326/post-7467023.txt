Was thinking on Astrophel and The Spiriling Stars. The thing in the sonnets that I think would be most likely to be connected to the Toast and in game mechanics was Stella’s lure. Which was her Black yet paradoxically bright eyes she lured men in with, which lead to their demise.
But, as far as Astrophel (star lover) and the spiriling stars I think this is possibly Perseus (andromeda’s lover) and the Andromeda galaxy (spiriling stars). IF “the brow of the mother of (all) galaxies” is reference to the galactic plane, then the galactic plane does cut straight through the Perseus constellation. Which does House a number of interesting systems, some of which also contain BH’s (Black yet paradoxically bright).
