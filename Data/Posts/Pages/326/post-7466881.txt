Still don't really see a purpose in getting invited by TDW as they're not the ones guarding Raxxla, but seeking it.

According to the codex, visiting their station will let you access all their clues and accumulated knowledge on the topic.
Considering that all that is currently known about Raxxla is "it exists" and "it's a thing", more in-game hints could be very helpful.
