I hadn't noticed before that the source of the communication is:

'Sue,Cripple & Sneer Solicitors'[haha]

I wonder if the reference number is of any use for anything...

'JAS 161200/42'
That reference number includes the date of ED's release: 16th December 3300. Not sure if that helps, though. If TDW invites were given purely by 'watching what we do' then I'm sure some people would have been invited by now. I think we have to do something more specific, if it is possible at all to be invited as a result of in-game activity.
