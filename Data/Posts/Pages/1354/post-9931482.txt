I'm never completely gone, but I do have to take breaks from ED because I never want to do anything else when I'm in an in period. I finished my time in The Void and returned to the bubble for Odyssey launch.

I'm back out on another exploration trip. Followed orion arm to the centre, now heading to Colonia. Still not decided whether to head straight back to bubble from there, or whether to follow outer arm to the tip, then return via the Formidine Rift. If I do that, there would only be the Persues Arm that I haven't travelled the length of.

Some years ago, I decided I wouldn't get a fleet carrier until I'd travelled the length of each arm.

As for Raxxla, well, I'm happy enough to just read theories on here for now. When did we start finding the empty signal sources for comets btw?

I started hunting them when Pyroboros reported on this thread a method to find them, so just this summer really. I like that the concept fits “a tiny little bit obvious” (that tautology has always worried me)- they’re datatype SmallBody! And they're hard to find without that search mechanism, can be visited multiple times, and by any commander. The system Raxxla is in, if hidden as a comet, could easily be visited and Raxxla not noticed-they’re not located by a honk or fss scan. And Pareco system seems explicitly designed to highlight their existence!

Edit: and since (in Sol, & it seems similar from other systems Ive looked in) they originate in the Oort Cloud , they also fit “obfuscated on the outer rim”

Edit2: and that old MB remark about looking off the ecliptic etc
