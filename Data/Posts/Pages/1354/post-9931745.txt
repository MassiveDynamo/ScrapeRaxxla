Currently not in game to check, and I seem to have lost a planet in my search matrix, I have its x,y,z plotted in my spreadsheet but not it’s name; what stars are in this area: 126.84; -13.28; 75.72?
Ahh that’s the fella!

Been doing some editing of my Yggdrasil data after finding several new Norse systems via alternative spellings, and I had this location pinned but my notes were not updated with its name, so I clear forgot the relationship, now it rings a bell.

I was looking for a Norse equivalent to Fortuna and found Njoerd (Njoror).

“In Norse mythology, Njörðr (Old Norse: Njǫrðr[ˈnjɔrðz̠]) is a god among the Vanir. Njörðr, father of the deities Freyr and Freyja by his unnamed sister, was in an ill-fated marriage with the goddess Skaði, lives in Nóatún and is associated with the sea, seafaring, wind, fishing, wealth, and crop fertility”.

In relation to the Yggdrasil tree in game this system falls just outside the sphere of influence I’ve identified, and very close to a bunch of other systems of interest and a potential buffer zone or ‘outer rim’?

Can’t presume it all points to Raxxla, but on its own the Tree of Yggdrasil is certainly in game, what it all relates to is something yet to be understood. But the relevance of ‘Donars Oak’ at Delphi is just too suspicious and there are a few correlations which is just too tantalising.
