Greetings stranger! good to see you back in the thread again! Thought youâ€™d abandoned us after DW2 for journeys around the outer rim (of the galaxy)
I'm never completely gone, but I do have to take breaks from ED because I never want to do anything else when I'm in an in period. I finished my time in The Void and returned to the bubble for Odyssey launch.

I'm back out on another exploration trip. Followed orion arm to the centre, now heading to Colonia. Still not decided whether to head straight back to bubble from there, or whether to follow outer arm to the tip, then return via the Formidine Rift. If I do that, there would only be the Persues Arm that I haven't travelled the length of.

Some years ago, I decided I wouldn't get a fleet carrier until I'd travelled the length of each arm.

As for Raxxla, well, I'm happy enough to just read theories on here for now. When did we start finding the empty signal sources for comets btw?
