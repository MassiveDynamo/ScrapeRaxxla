The new body type reminds me of this missive, granted it’s conjecture that the spelling mistake was intentional but if it were the use of ‘plane’, as in Planet, may fit, in regards to ‘orbital plane’… however upon reflection this could well have been an automated response hence the reference points in brackets, it’s more likely a typo… but still no closer to where…
