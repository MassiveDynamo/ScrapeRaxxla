It can't be Raxxla, that would be such a downer Fdev would never do that.
It is a guarantee that if ever "Raxxla" is found .... It will be a downer... could never live up to expectations. This however in my estimation would be far better than some random Icy Rock turning out to be "Raxxla"... Though ya I would much rather find the Dark Wheel station first ... and follow some sort of logical path than have a swirlly thing out past Barnards Loop be it.
