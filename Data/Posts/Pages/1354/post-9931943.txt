Nobody had a clue toward the real Dark Wheel station after 10 years?
Frankly for me the simple fact of FINDING it after all this time and with so few clues would be a reward in itself. That, and I expect some interesting text logs at least.. or something a bit unique.
2014 to now? 8 going on 9
and just where were you during all this?
and fwiw
dark wheel station
raxxla
omphalos rift
might all be related, but not the same chase.
2 I am sure are related
1 according to what I have read is just doing what we are doing and keeping secrets and keeping hidden.
there are soo many clues in the forums, and THIS thread.
but getting the result.
space..good place to hide stuff.

follow one or follow many clues, test and test and test...

you know, a thought I had, once mentioned in here.
but just to show how hard it can be
know that nav beacons are big brother
know that they can be turned into a cnb and reverse at will
know that things in a system change when you do this.
know how?
try this on every system you think might have a hidden clue.

I use this example because , sure, maybe it is an obvious clue, but what a lot of effort to go to, to find something.

1 of many, many theories.

the fun is in never giving up
or as my fav factions say, 'Never Surrender'

hopefully before the servers go off-line, years from now we get it figured out.

I can test a theory for months and get nowhere.
Another person can get that thought test it and learn something new. Or write it off. Each perspective gives off different thoughts to each person.
not a binary task.
then there is focus...
I play the BGS, mostly. a thing we weren't meant to do.
and I play with theories in my spare time between and during.
