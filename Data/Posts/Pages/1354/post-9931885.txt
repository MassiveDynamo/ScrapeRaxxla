For anyone hoping to fly out to the "Stargoid" Ive got some rough estimates of distance between it and oochorrs uf-j c11-0 and oochorrs cs-f c13-0
It looks like its closer to c-13

SPOILER: STARGOID


This does kind of fit alot of what Raxxla could be... Or it could just be a Thargoid mothership.... It is awfuly close to the Galactic Meridian as drawn in the Codex though...
