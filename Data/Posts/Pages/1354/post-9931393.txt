The new body type reminds me of this missive, granted it’s conjecture that the spelling mistake was intentional but if it were the use of ‘plane’, may fit, but still no closer to where…

I was wondering what you were talking about then spotted “plane” in planet was italicised but the “t” wasn't.
Mmm, might be meaningful (Raxxla as a plane of existence? Witchspace? Nooooooo! I don’t believe it!)...
But this is from FD Support...as you remarked the other day “what do they know!”

Oo, read it the other way, Raxxla as a T merchant?
