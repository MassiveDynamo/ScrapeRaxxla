Cool post on reddit by u/Dominik_1102 here:
Hey have found a Secret Message in the Raxxla Codex Entry.

We may [wanna] have a closer [look] here i guess.

Z3non_RAXXLA_Bj5 WE-A H17-6


When you enter that in the galmap these coordinates take you to Maia. When you change the 6 at the end it moves the system to one often located in the middle of a nebula. Maybe its a lead? Has anyone seen this before?


EDIT:
u/Dynamite56 just posted in the same thread

edit 2: I have the full list here

Z3non_RAXXLA_Bj5 WE-A H17-0: HIP 9221

Interesting find, Where in the codex was it found though We should get a person in each system to sit until server tick and see if anything appears, My guess is RAXXLA is some sort of ship that passes between these places if this is a confirmed thing, are any of these systems witch head by the way or cone? A theory could be it is also a Thargoid mothership that brings them from galaxy to galaxy and sistuates itself in areas they are using so these placemarkers (thin foil hat spinning)
