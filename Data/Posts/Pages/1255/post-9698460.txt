Interesting find, Where in the codex was it found though We should get a person in each system to sit until server tick and see if anything appears, My guess is RAXXLA is some sort of ship that passes between these places if this is a confirmed thing, are any of these systems witch head by the way or cone? A theory could be it is also a Thargoid mothership that brings them from galaxy to galaxy and sistuates itself in areas they are using so these placemarkers (thin foil hat spinning)
This is what should have been from the very launch of Elite Dangerous. Thargoids appeared later
