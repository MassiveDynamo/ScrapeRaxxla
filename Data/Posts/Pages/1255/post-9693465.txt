Well, as a well-known stellar constructor said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know what it is‚Äù, however we can always hazard a guess or twenty....
If Raxxla is 2060 Chiron (my hypothesis based on its orbital period of 50 years which matched what Allan Stroud mooted for the periodic reappearance of Raxxla, though that could also match up with the in-game start of the various game versions), or another asteroid (or even Halley‚Äôs Comet which we know is in Sol but hasn't been intercepted yet) then that could explain the three arcs in the Raxxla logo-it would be an asteroid base! presumably Guardian since we know Raxxla relates to the alien lore book. Though I remember Thargoids were supposed to have ships the size of moons so I don‚Äôt discount that as a possibility.

My co-pawlot had fits at 03:50 and 07:30, so I think I‚Äôll be snoozing this afternoon instead of flying to test out my current theory. So I‚Äôll present my previous one, it is based on analysis of the Raxxla codex entry which I‚Äôll post below with my annotated thoughts:
