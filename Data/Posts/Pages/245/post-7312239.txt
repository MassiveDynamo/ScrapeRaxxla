I have completed my survey of permit-locked systems ( https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=7300892&viewfull=1#post7300892 ) with a null result regarding clues relating to Raxxla or the whereabouts of The Dark Wheel. It was nevertheless an educational experience and I have learned plenty about the history of the superpowers and a few other events of significance. I also got to see Majestic class Interdictors emerging from hyperspace on two occasions, one of which was set against the background of the star Facece (the POI is within the fuel scoop zone!) which was highly impressive, and finally visited New Horizons and Voyager 1. I also encountered two Q-type anomalies in HIP 15310 (which was on my plotted route from Peregrina to Jotun) during my journey.

I'll take a break for a bit, now, as I'm out of ideas. I might pay the home system of Mic Turner a visit, also the system from which Meredith Argent's ancestors came from, in case there's more history there to learn. I might look back over the Tourist Beacon text and see if anything else comes to mind. Fly safe! o7
