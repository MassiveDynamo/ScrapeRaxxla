As in if you know what a pattern of stars looks like and you know the name of them but are trying to work out from which system they are being viewed from.

Its probably a long shot to think such a thing is even possible.

Its just trial and error, until you find the system that matches. It's doable.

The first Guardian ruin was found that way.

It helps if you can identify some other star outside your pattern. You may need this to determine the distance and angle. if you only have a tight pattern of stars, it will look similar in a bunch of systems.
