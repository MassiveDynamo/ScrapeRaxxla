Iâ€™m triple Elite, allied with TDW and have been doing missions for them for 2 weeks now. Nothing usually has turned up.

Let us know if you get any results after making quadruple Elite. I honestly believe that if Elite ranking is a requirement to unlocking Raxxla then it has something to do with Shinrarta Dhezra and therefore only requires a single Elite ranking. If multiple Elite rankings are required then there is no reason to assume that such a requirement would exclude CQC/Arena rank so ... time to get cracking!
