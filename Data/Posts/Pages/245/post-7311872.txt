I'm almost at the Heart and Soul nebula. You know "lovers woe = heart" "parent's grief = soul". Well, "vagabond hearts" would just be the wanderer, without a home, explorer. So I think the riddle litterly says "go explore the heart and soul nebula". That's what I'm doing. To Raxxla!

Addition to post: From the nebula's perspective, there is a 'jewel on the brow' visible. The Bubble Nebula is litterly a jewel shaped object on the 'brow' of the galaxy. That could be of interest too.
