Not too sure how EDSM works, but I'll be heading that way in a few hours to check it out. Good excuse to check out the Zurara again.

I randomly did a YouTube search, and found a CMDR that had some footage of his/her travels to there, (Alluring Siren) but it was from 2016, and pretty obvious they were just passing through.
