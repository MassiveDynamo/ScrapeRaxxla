After a failed thread search, I thought I would throw in that Boötes Void is the deepest void, as far as microwave background is concerned. I don't see Boötes Constellation, or a siren where it's supposed to be, but I'm still trying to convert RA/Dec to GalMap coords.

Merga is pretty much in the direction of the Boötes Void. If you are in Sol, that is.
