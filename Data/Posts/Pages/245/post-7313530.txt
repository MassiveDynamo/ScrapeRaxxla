Heres my take, from what I've gathered.

"Whisperer in witchspace, Siren of the deepest void"

The constellation Lyra: "The constellation is associated with the myth of the Greek musician and poet Orpheus. Lyra constellation lies in the northern sky. It represents the lyre, a musical instrument with strings used in antiquity and later times."

"Without Orpheus and his music, the Argonauts would not have been able to make it past the Sirens, whose song enticed sailors to come to them, which usually resulted in sailors crashing their ships into the islands on which the Sirens lived. When the Argonauts approached the islands, Orpheus drew his lyre and played music that drowned out the Sirens’ calls."

and theres the listing of the stars aswell.

Kinda makes you wonder, since they stay that Raxxla is somewhere near SOL.

Good shout CMDR. I'll add the stars to my list of places to check out.
