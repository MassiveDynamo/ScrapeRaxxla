So...i decided to read codex again, it has date 2296.
Timeline: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Dangerous_Timeline#23rd_century
So 2296 fits to use https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive

So it's a bit mess there ...it says 1st was quirum drive, but not clear how they could meet thargoids before invention of this drive.
Any way, they had very limited capabilities at that times, even generation ship could cover 199 ly till then yet.
That timeline is not offical. It has been made from the original FE2 timeline and merged with stuff from the old books and manuals. Non of that is actual lore. The Quirium drive was probably not the first generation. It was probably only used by Galcop pilots.
