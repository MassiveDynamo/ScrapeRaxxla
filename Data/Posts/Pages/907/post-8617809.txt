Crane is simple. Itâ€™s the Grus constellation.
Grus (constellation) - Wikipedia

I did spend some time searching the Grus constellation along with some other CMDRs but alas nothing was found. There was one S class star in that constellation (pi-1 Gruis), but no GG with 8 moons. Think it's in this thread somewhere..

LYTA - I made a list of all systems with that combination of stars in but it seems to be lost to the winds of time. All of them have 'A' primary due to the way stellar forge works. I recall that there was quite a few of them - time to brush of the searching scripts again...

I know there are no LYTAs in the Grus constellation though..

Other S-class stars of interest, HD 110813 and Flyua Dryoae MD-Q d6-10 which have GG8's by some definition of GG8 but both are a little far out by DW standards.

That's enough rummaging through old notes
