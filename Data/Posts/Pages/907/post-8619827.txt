Ok...I lost that, yday somebody said on forums.
If you come close in 40ly to rogue planet it will appear on left pane but not on map as jump destination. And many raxxla searchers assume that.
Do you?
Because I 1st time heard it. However I started to check that left pane.
What I see, near SoL I see 11ly jumps around. Near Schizam I see 17ly jumps. Not sure why.

Also I got idea because of that fact. What is toast is direction in this list? As it is limited, you have limited options to chose. Once you jump you have updated list there.
