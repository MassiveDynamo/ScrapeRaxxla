Hi do you remember who are the 2 who recanted and is there a source? I understand that Souvarine recanted in this thread https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/turning-the-wheel.546088/page-10#post-8490413 . Who's the 2nd person?

Not offhand. This was highlighted on the Turning the Wheel thread, that’s all I know. I did watch the clip of Cmdr Ascorbius’ stream that someone posted here a day or so ago. Other than that I know nuthink, Nuthink!!
