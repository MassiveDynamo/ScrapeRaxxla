Ok...so raxxla can be rogue planet. Or DW station orbits rogue planet... it is possible.
But 1st need to confirm presence of rogue planets. I would suggest everybody to get a habbit check left panel EACH jump, especially in deep space where it is not flooded by stations.
Also I suspect ... if any system has planet with high inclination, then chances to get rogue around should be bigger.
Planetary nebulas may have a rogues, as explosion / consumption of 1 star could release planets from orbit. Same for binaries with black hole.
Basically any cataclysm where stars are involved could release planets. Because momentum remains same and if 1 of 2 stars gone, planets could fly away.
