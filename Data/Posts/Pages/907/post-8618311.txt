I had a Tip Off mission in Carcosa, it was multi-staged too.

Stage One; a site with several crashed ships with several data scan points, mats and some cargo. Upon scanning the data, the mission gave another message and target search location, that the ‘survivors’ had headed towards in their SRV’s. But the distance was too far for me to attempt in my SRV.

So, rather unfortunately the second stage broke, and would not work once I decided to head to it in my ship. Upon landing and trying again, the second target location would not show up again and scanning one of the crashed data points would not work: I was warned that the “Data point already scanned”
