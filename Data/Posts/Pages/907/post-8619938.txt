Regardless how you want to use that information, the statement "the system has been visited" being true or false, where does it take you?
I'm not trying to be antagonistic here, just rather practical.

Problem 1: "System has been visited. When was it? 2015? 2016?". We can't tell if a system was discovered in 2015 vs 2020 if it's not registered in EDSM at the same time.
Problem 2: Do we have a record of it as well? EDSM may not have the record, only 10-20% contribute to EDSM perhaps (I'm guessing, trying to make a point).
Now you have it in EDSM and on record. Now what?

1. Is it (one of the) permit locked (quite likely) one?
2. Search all non-permit locked. For what? Where? For a rogue planet? For Com-beacons? For any other clues?
Are we really sure it's there, visible for all to see, in full view?

No, I don't think this gets us anywhere.
We still need to correlate the other information we have and put together some of the pieces of information and at least get a general direction.
Perhaps then, at a later the information be useful. Or perhaps in retrospect.

I don't see how it's useful at this stage. It being this dubious I would put it at the very lowest tier of information I would use some time in the future.

Furthermore, on the topic of rogue planet I'm just using a couple of images from DB & MB statements from 2014. Whether this still hold any truth at all anymore (2020) is hard to say.
I hope you can see them even if they are coming from the Canonn discord:
