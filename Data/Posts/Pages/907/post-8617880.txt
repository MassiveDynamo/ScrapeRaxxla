Just a quick comment before i launch ED (and finally get that Cutter ): The other day while doing the rounds in the Bubble for mining i noted down in my "to do later" file a strange witchspace while jumping from Lawd 49 to Sharru Sector DG-X B1-1. Just before the destinqtion popped upm it looked like mini-galaxies flying past the ship rather than the usual stars. At least it looked unfamiliar enough to me that i noted it down. I wasn't recording at the time, and haven't gone back to it, but i intend to do some testing later this week: is it replicable and does it appear in all graphics settings? If yes, is it really unusual or was it just me paying attention for once?

But as far as i recall, previous attempts at analyzing the visuals and sounds of witchspace often came to the conclusion that it's just a fancy loading screen and nothing much should be read into it. Still, we know that FDev have at least created one special version of it (the one for hyperdictions), so in the end it might still be worth investigating.

And now i'll go back to mining for realz.

I’ve posted multiple times about seeing a unique planet looking thing during hyperspace jumps. At the time I was able to replicate it consistently and repeat multiple times that it would only happen between a few star systems in between bubble and Pleiades. I went back a few months later to the system and did the same jumps, however the same visual was not there. This could be evidence of a rogue planet. It’s certainly proof that the jump animation does change depending on your location. I remember that when jumping through systems that have a high thargoid presence, the jump animation features a bunch of thargoid looking discs.

The codex does say “whisperer in witchspace”, so it’s not irrational to me to be looking in witchspace for clues.
