o7 Commanders,

I'm back from the futile attempt to find the remains of the thargoid hive ship.
..no joy. ..what a surprise.

So I turned my expedition vessel and headed back, joining the hunt for Raxxla again.

What I'm wondering from the beginning is the "tiny bit obvious" hint.
Should we believe it? If yes, are all our current theories "too complex"?
How obvious is obvious? Can we expect obvious to be some kind of "simple"?

May we should focus to something that can be "obvious", whatever that could be.
I'm still (yeah, I know I mention this again and again) suspicious about all those old systems. We found nothing so far, there seems to be no "route" there seems to be no "map", there seems to be no hidden mechanic ..
But they can be seen as "obvious". FDev added them (randomly, by purpose?) to the game, after all.

What do you think? Should we check every theory to see if it can be seen as obvious? And dismiss all theories which aren't?
(We should define what obvious means ... )

I can see those wheels turning
