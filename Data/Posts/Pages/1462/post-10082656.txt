The other thing that comes to mind is that DB said the missions were intended to guide you around, and he knew there were missions that nobody had ever found. So.....
True. But that only goes so far. If TDW or Club has Raxxla, there is one key detail from the past worth pointing out as it highlights who found it. Pilot's Federation is founded in 2805. Supposedly we don't have the first Elite combateer until nearly 3200 (that's slightly less than 6 centuries). That means it was one of skillsets added later that found it first: Explorers or Traders*. After all, Raxxla was found BY 2296 OR BEFORE (given rumors take awhile to spread) which is a mere 66 years following rapid expansion. Most of the time between 2097 to 2296 (199 years) would have been in Sol or its' immediate vicinity.

You are meant to move around. Yes, it is entirely possible to this via missions but on the flip side you can get stuck in a tiny corner of the galaxy.

*Bounty Hunters also move frequently as do pirates as a necessity of the profession. This also applies to CMDRs who serve as a taxi service.
