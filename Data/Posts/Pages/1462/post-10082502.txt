I went back through the Guardian Codex and there is some interesting stuff in there that may be relevant:

-Guardians had shielded domed cities. Yet, the only examples of this seem to be human - more specifically the stadium-esque planetary ports. There is one in Sol at Mercury (Ehrlich City). There are but a handful of these (2,971) compared to every other type of human station, settlement, port, or outpost type.

-Guardians especially the traditionalist camp were very fond of biological-based weapons. Judas Syndicate (based out of Black Mausoleum palm tree station in Beta Hydri) and by extension The Dark Wheel prefer synthetic organisms, poisons, and other assorted chemicals as their weapons of choice. I can personally vouch for this as it was my method of taking down Azimuth Biotech when they were god-moded into multiple systems. Should be noted that The Revised Catholic Mission (strongly linked to Gnosticism per First Encounters journals) is based out of Aymiay in Cooperworld, Mars in Sol, and Beta Hydri. The progressives had their war machines (ships and SRVs).

We may actually some sort of weird descendants of the Guardians and this was kind of hinted at in Ram Tah Guardian logs. Perhaps we aren't looking for Sol but our true home - the Guardian homeworld. If Planetary Ports are Guardian, it is actually in the Bubble.

Did I mention there is one of the huge stadium ports in Etain (Far God Cult)? The one in Etain is Vian Landing.
