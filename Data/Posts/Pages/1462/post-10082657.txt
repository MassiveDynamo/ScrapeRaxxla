We have less than 2 centuries for RAXXLA to show up and that's from the pessimistic perspective. The optimistic one has it found possibly even before we left the cradle (and the rumor just takes awhile). Humanity does not even leave Sol until 2097. Lave isn't even settled until 2412 or 116 years after the rumor of RAXXLA were confirmed as existing.
