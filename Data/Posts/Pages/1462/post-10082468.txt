Update on Operation VIP

Currently working in the old systems, the Lave cluster, making good progress. Though no solid leads on Raxxla yet. Haven't taken any long range passenger yet in the +20KLy range to see if lures that a lead out.

Found the ELW planet Duck on a short range VIP mission.
SPOILER: PLANET DUCK

If thereâ€™s ANY logic behind this storyline any such VIP passenger missions ought logically to be from TDW or PF at Shin Dez. Have you tried there?
