Update on Operation VIP

Currently working in the old systems, the Lave cluster, making good progress. Though no solid leads on Raxxla yet. Haven't taken any long range passenger yet in the +20KLy range to see if that lures a lead out.

Found the ELW planet Duck on a short range VIP mission.
SPOILER: PLANET DUCK
