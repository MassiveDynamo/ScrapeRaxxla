Planet Cambridge is in Pollux.

Planet Cambridge's Hole in Zeaex.

Planet Londonium in Alexandrinus

Planet London's Legacy in Fomalhaut

Station London Relay in Epsilon Indi.

Unless Cambridge is code language for another place.

Note: Yes, fully aware Cambridge and London are absolutely and totally separate. Just trying to figure out ways to hide this. Apparently, the old name for Cambridge was Grantabrycge and there are no references to that directly.
