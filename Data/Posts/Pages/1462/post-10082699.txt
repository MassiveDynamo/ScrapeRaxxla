For the record: all my research to date would indicate that Fomalhaut was previously known as Enaness. Why is that important? It may have been home to aliens.

The academy of Rymhananman is justly famous for its theoretical physics and chemistry departments. It also boasts the foundation established by Wyksymdra Baranha to explore and exploit Enaness 4. Wyksymdra is famous for his conjecture that the fourth planet of Enaness was the homeworld of a civilised alien race, who later terraformed Charles Colony when they rendered their own world uninhabitable by excessive pollution. The evidence for this theory is hotly disputed by many eminent archeologists, but they are at a loss to explain the peculiar mineral deposits of Enaness 4 and the absence of ancient fossils on Enaness 5. The abrupt appearance of life `sprung full grown in all its glory' suggests, to Baranha, tentative evidence of the works of an ancient spacefaring civilisation.

Damn it. It is never that easy. Just noticed mention of Charles Colony which means LHS 449 is a candidate given Charles' Mine for Enaness. LHS 449 may actually be a better fit. Though, a Planetary Port exists in Fomalhaut. Both are very near Sol. This is LHS 449 in-game description. So, it definitely had prior name(s).
