Hello Commanders,
I am new to the hunt for Raxxla and I am just getting into it. While reading the messages from the Zurara, i was wondering if someone tried to decrypt the stuff using a "Hexeditor". I am asking just outa curiosity, just to get rid of this thought. ^^
Welcome to thread, cmdr!

I don’t recall there being anything in the Zurara logs which was encrypted. We’re you thinking of something in particular?

Using an actual real life hexeditor would (AFAIK) be in violation of the ED End User Licence and Terms of Service, and hence is a big no-no. I’m guessing that’s not what you meant though. We’re you thinking of something which can be used in-game?
