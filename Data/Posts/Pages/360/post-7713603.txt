Thank you !
Anytime mate! (Well assuming it was actually helpful anyway! I realise it might also have been more of a 'teaching grandma to suck eggs' so naturally you (and others) have my apologies if that was the case. )

Oh, and I obviously tried to come up with a slightly more tailored version of that particular phrase to use in conversation with your good self, but got a few too many, so just pick your fave!:
teaching a Reverend Mother about her maternal heritage
teaching a Tleilaxu who to make Gholas
teaching a Fremen how to do up a stillsuit
