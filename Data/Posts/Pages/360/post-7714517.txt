Mmm...DB said ”Number stations”!!!

However I’ve just been searching the forums; can’t find my posts on this, nor the original thread where MB clarified DB’s livestream interview utterance.

I know I was involved in a recent conversation on this because my young clone Tyko started collecting & posted some fed station numbers he encountered while getting his ship engineered, so it’s quite recently. The conversation ended when we found MB’s clarification that DB said “number stations” not “numbered stations”. Not sure if it was this thread or another where this conversation (this thread had a short conversation last September but that’s not the more recent one I’m trying to find), but don’t like this new forum if it’s deleting posts!
