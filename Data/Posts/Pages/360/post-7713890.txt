Yeah I was going back and forth on that one too. The quote from the Epimetheus log having both "siren" and "the void" inside of two sentences made me give that one over. I was initially thinking it was sirens like The Odyssey as well (back to the Cassiopeia myth, Poseidon and his Nereids were involved).

"By the ninth day, the siren had stopped, but no one had come for Joe; he survived thanks to automated systems that provided him with food and water, and disposed of his waste, but could not accept that he would be trapped alone in his cell on the Epimetheus indefinitely. By the time of Joe's final log on day 1,047, he had lapsed into insanity and believed that his isolation was a deliberate test which "the void" was trying to help him solve. "

Edit: Oh man, had a funny (far-fetched) thought. The isolation was a test the void was helping him with. Isolation like Solo mode? "A journey everyone must complete on their own"? I would slap Braben's face for that lol.

"Thetis. Significance in The Odyssey: Sea-goddess who is the mother of Achilles. Thetis is mentioned in Book 24 when one suitor tells Achilles that his mother sobbed and mourned for him when she found out he was dead."

Astrophel and Stella is important because as a clue it is telling us to look at the suitors within the Odyssey. The number of sonnets equals the number of suitors.

Of those suitors (as above) with text associated with them, how many reference something which could be a named generation ship?

Not every suitor is detailed so of those that are do those 'references' triangulate a location or something else?
