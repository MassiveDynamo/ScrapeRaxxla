All the religious sects in the game, that I've noticed, have had a tattoo on their forehead, all religious factions with permits have them.
Some theocratic based PMF's have them too. It's hard to tell what it means. The passengers with them take you to some notable places.
In Van Maanen there's an installation called "Stellar Legal Ministries". Ive been using this as a hint of what not to do, crime. A few times the tattoo passengers have brought me to a tourism beacon explaining the Revised Catholic Mission, a mission based on an adaptation to modern times. Another time I was brought to a detention center megaship called "Blood of Atonement" in Lyncis Sector QJ-Q b5-2. Note in the beacons description that it's locations are Aymiay, Mars and beta Hydri. In Aymiay we have named planets,
Baker, Camp Diamond and Diamond Fort Station (Diamond's a star in Prism too), Cooperworld and Hayne's Wreck. Beta Hydri has the planets Camp Schmidt, Camp Shepard, Endl, Homeland,and Jordan's Legacy. It's also one of the first few systems we expanded to. It also has a station called Black Mausoleum.
Once atoned (not sure if this was a thing before going to that station) I began noticing passengers who have night vision on them. Not sure if this is a bug or not. I have not raised a ticket for it. Despite the darker skin tone on one of them, these 3 different guys seem to look like just 1 guy, or the same haircut at least, and he's the only one I notice the night vision on.

Edit: No, I am not the religious type, though I do value people being good to one another.
However, Braben and Ian Bell both graduated from the historic
Imagine the fit the community would throw if it was all hidden in religious dogma and being a good person!

Mmm, image 3-he doesnâ€™t seem to be wearing night vision gear as you said, but is viewed with night vision gear. Might be a clue in itself?
