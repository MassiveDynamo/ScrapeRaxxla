Another thing I'm noticing right now is out of Robigo, touching on my previous post about a possible tie to Total Recall and the Alien Relic.
The Robigo Cartel's contact is Art Lester when neutral with the faction. I'm not gonna do any bounty hunting so I'm kind of stuck on getting any sort of traction with them as I cannot take passenger missions from them without some sort of allegiance. The passenger missions contact is Sarahi Schmidt and she has the tattoo.
Schmidt Camp is in Beta Hydri.

As far as Gen ships go, The Cete's logs have me intrigued.
I've been to quite a few of the gen ships as well, the Thetis included. It raised my eyebrow like it did yours.
