Welcome to thread, cmdr!

I don’t recall there being anything in the Zurara logs which was encrypted. We’re you thinking of something in particular?

Using an actual real life hexeditor would (AFAIK) be in violation of the ED End User Licence and Terms of Service, and hence is a big no-no. I’m guessing that’s not what you meant though. We’re you thinking of something which can be used in-game?

Thanks for the answer. I havent even thought about "reverse engineering using a hexeditor". I was more curious about the idea to translate the messages, or parts of the messages into HexCode. Maybe you find something interesting. I did it on my own but i am missing the knowledge to see anything in particular.

Cheers
