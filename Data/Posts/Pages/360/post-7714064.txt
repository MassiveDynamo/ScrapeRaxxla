Imagine the fit the community would throw if it was all hidden in religious dogma and being a good person!

It was Jesus College, Cambridge (not London) - which I am sure you know, and I feel rather churlish pointing it out, but you’ve such a good eye for detail that I wouldn’t want to let that get through your net if it is a line you are considering

Your posts are fascinating, informative, researched, and always interesting, please keep them coming
