I think Iam on to something a clue
I have unlocked 4 permit systems, and the orders have all the same tattoo on their forehead,

I remember when I was unlocking Chapter of Isinor. First I was greeted from young female acolyte.
When I was friendly, elder woman gave me missions. When I was allied, bold fat dude greeted me.
I was expecting reverse order...

IIRC, they all had some tatto on the forehead.
