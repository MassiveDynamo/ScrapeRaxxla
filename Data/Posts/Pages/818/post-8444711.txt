Huh? I just had a giant virus for a lunch. I believe there is an archaic water world somewhere nearby where they are harvested, living on algae close to some thermal vents or something. You can really taste the RNA when you pour some soy sauce on the capsid and the fibrils swirl a little. Some scientists claim they are intelligent, but they are also used as a food source on some deep space colonies.
It was old russian book, about fly to Venus & victory of communism. Damn, they had academician on board instead spaceman, any way. On Venus they found huge bacterias, among other huge grows, which were same single-cell, but more then human-sized
So are you sure your breakfast is not from that book ?


P.S. Why you involve myths there you ignore other cultures. For example, slovenian ones. But I saw names of old gods (before Christ) there too. I'm pretty sure other cultures are presented as well.
