I can 100% confirm this. My Oolite novels (Status Quo, Mutabilis, Incursio, Finis and Altera) are strictly non-canon for the ED universe. The were written for the fan made game Oolite (based on the original Elite).

I did create a crossover to some degree. The Rebecca character from those novels does exist in the universe of ED for example. There are others. The second book 'Mutabilis' was my take on 'Raxxla' but it was written in 2008 long before ED was a thing. Enjoy them as an Elite-themed read, but those books should not be used as a basis for ED investigations into Raxxla.

Cheers,

Drew.
