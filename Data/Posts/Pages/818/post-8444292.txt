Nobody has picked up on my comment, although admittedly it was in the middle of a load of text:

The Raxxla codex entry mentions Prester John, an old fable (apparently Marco Polo referred to a ruler named Prester John) and adventure story by John Buchan (I remember it was a good read, did it at school) .

I realised yesterday that Giovanni is a male Italian given name (from Latin Ioannes). It is the Italian equivalent of John. And prester means a church official, but is also used to mean “elder”, which suggests rank or reputation . The Cambridge dictionary says “prestigio. noun. prestige, reputation or influence due to success, rank etc.”

So Luko Prestigio Giovanni (member of TDW and mentor of Salomé, see Reclamation and Premonition books) is equivalent to Luke Prester John.

Is this coincidental? Is it an FD hint? Is the codex actually a riddle with hidden meaning?

Good catch on the Luko link.

Prester John was also often (from the late sixteenth century) described as the king / emperor of Ethiopia. This gives an astronomical link to Cepheus (Fater of Andromeda and husband of Cassiopeia).

The period from approximately 1550-1625 may be significant in some way. This was the period of Philip Sidney, Mary Sidney, Shakespeare and Walter Raleigh (Both Mary and Raleigh have supposedly written Shakespeare).
Raleigh is closely connected to the El Dorado myth and wrote an epitaph to his friend Sidney(more on Raleigh and El Dorado in a later post).

1550-1625 is half of the period of the old Elite games 3100-3250. This may a coincidence or a deliberate choice?
