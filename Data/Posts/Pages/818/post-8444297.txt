It looks like UK (& elsewhere) corona virus lockdown will be eased very soon.
Just remember...

Easing lockdown doesn’t mean the pandemic is over...it means there’s now room for you in Intensive Care!!!

(A sobering message from a relative who works in ICU! The figures I’ve seen suggest of patients entering ICU up to two out of three have died...)

Fly safe! No passengers or crew within 2 metres! Wear a Remlock at all times!
