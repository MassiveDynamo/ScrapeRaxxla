Lave 2 as Raxxla came from Drew Wagar's Oolite series of books. These were fan-fiction; they are good reads (they are free to download from his website) but in no way are they canonical lore for Elite Dangerous. We can assume that nobody outside FD knows where Raxxla really is in-game, or what it is, since nobody has provided any credible proof of finding it.

Lave 2, Diso 5c, Sol’s Triton all require a permit which we cannot attain. I think the author of one of the official FD books that used it in his plot requested Diso 5c be locked. We don’t know why the other two are. See the permits thread for details of all in-game locks: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/updated-permit-list.122593/

I can 100% confirm this. My Oolite novels (Status Quo, Mutabilis, Incursio, Finis and Altera) are strictly non-canon for the ED universe. The were written for the fan made game Oolite (based on the original Elite).

I did create a crossover to some degree. The Rebecca character from those novels does exist in the universe of ED for example. There are others. The second book 'Mutabilis' was my take on 'Raxxla' but it was written in 2008 long before ED was a thing. Enjoy them as an Elite-themed read, but those books should not be used as a basis for ED investigations into Raxxla.

Cheers,

Drew.
