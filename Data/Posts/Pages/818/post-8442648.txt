Hi. Maybe this has been discuss before, not sure, been trying to follow this thread but may have forgotten if it has.

So came across this story, which I will post a link too. It sounds like Raaxla is at the moon of Lave. Is the moon Lave 2 which needs a permit?

Here's the story, https://books.google.ca/books?id=I8u0srLlOJYC&pg=PT127&lpg=PT127&dq=where+is+raxxla&source=bl&ots=Qkkr9DD9D-&sig=ACfU3U2aVbl-mEC-8d_DZwu7_a5wrCVLpw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwij9IW575zpAhWVjp4KHSR5CqM4ChDoATAJegQIBhAB#v=onepage&q=where is raxxla&f=false

Lave 2 as Raxxla came from Drew Wagar's Oolite series of books. These were fan-fiction; they are good reads (they are free to download from his website) but in no way are they canonical lore for Elite Dangerous. We can assume that nobody outside FD knows where Raxxla really is in-game, or what it is, since nobody has provided any credible proof of finding it.

Lave 2, Diso 5c, Sol’s Triton all require a permit which we cannot attain. I think the author of one of the official FD books that used it in his plot requested Diso 5c be locked. We don’t know why the other two are. See the permits thread for details of all in-game locks: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/updated-permit-list.122593/
