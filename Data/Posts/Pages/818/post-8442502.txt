Yes it is locked. I just tried to force land on it the other day but it kinda acts like an exclusion zone. Triton is also locked but i watched a yt of a cmdr landing on it but i had no such luck

Also tried few weeks ago. Past a certain altitude, the ship doesn't get any further. An invisible wall blocks it. I tried to turn the engines off and let the gravity do the job, without success.
Using the external views shows the ship shaking against that "wall".

Anyone tried to pass it while carrying some specific objects, like relics?
