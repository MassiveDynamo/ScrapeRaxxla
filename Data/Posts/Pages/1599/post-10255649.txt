Ya the Pleiades are one possibility. Also Alnilam – Orions belt... the string of pearls… Then there is that whole Pearl Cluster....

My favorite idea is it possibly referring to Indras Pearls / Indras Net which is tied to the Axis Mundi
Indra hung over his palace on Mount Meru a net of silk threads like a spider web… which extends to infinity… at each knot a precious gem …..

Ever wondered why when you look at depictions of the Omphalos you see a net covering it?



An interconnected web of lenses that focus and twist the flow of spacetime..... Sound Familiar ?

Orion's Belt - Wikipedia

References in history and culture
Richard Hinckley Allen lists many folk names for the Belt of Orion. English ones include: Jacob's Rod or Jacob's Staff; Peter's Staff; the Golden Yard-arm; The L, or Ell; The Ell and Yard; the Yard-stick, and the Yard-wand; the Ellwand; Our Lady's Wand; the Magi / the Three Kings; the Three Marys; or simply the Three Stars.[7]

The passage "Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?" is found in the Bible's Book of Job[8] and Book of Amos.[9] Tennyson's poem The Princess describes Orion's belt as:

...those three stars of the airy Giant's zone,
That glitter burnished by the frosty dark.

When you read about a Princess, what's the first thing that springs to mind.... well this forum for me....

Anyway just a thought.... ;-)
