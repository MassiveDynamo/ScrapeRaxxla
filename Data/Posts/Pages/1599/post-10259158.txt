In relation to some of the "Tip Off" Mission text (as per my post here). I went through the Canonn site records of the surface sites and pulled all the ones that mostly resembled the Tip Off ones I noted earlier as being interesting.

In relation to the Raxxla Codex: "To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!" Thargoids are the only thing in all these Lore references that seem to interact in Witchspace, the Formidine Rift logs literally mention "The lights in witch-space are coming for me, the lights… always the lights… they’re calling to me… a siren song" which is pretty similar, there's also another of the Exodus logs that talk about voices in witchspace. That general idea seems to come up below in many of the abandoned sites, and also as in my previous post for some of the Tip Off missions.











I think I do remember at least two cases when some tip off end messages are literally copy-paste version of one of the logs from known sites... or vice versa

However don't count the one on Coni A 2 - that was me who accidently stumbled on a tip off base-connected site without the mission being assigned (these mechanic was quite new at that time), and that's why it ended on the cannon site.... Also, some text versions of tip off messages have evolved in time - that's a proven fact (besides only "original" English versions have evolved=)))), not the other language localizations )
