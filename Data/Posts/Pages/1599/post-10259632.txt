I think I do remember at least two cases when some tip off end messages are literally copy-paste version of one of the logs from known sites... or vice versa

However don't count the one on Coni A 2 - that was me who accidently stumbled on a tip off base-connected site without the mission being assigned (these mechanic was quite new at that time), and that's why it ended on the cannon site.... Also, some text versions of tip off messages have evolved in time - that's a proven fact (besides only "original" English versions have evolved=)))), not the other language localizations )
Good info, thanks
