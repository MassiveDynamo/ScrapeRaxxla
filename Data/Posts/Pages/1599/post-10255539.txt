Ragthorn is going on my Christmas list (if I can find a copy).

I am wondering if there are a few other hints that we might be missing.
For example, I have often wondered if the 'Braben Woollens' mentioned in the Agartha system description were a hint that we are 'getting warm' and yesterday I was looking around and found that the Thule system has a station called Short Hop - so is that a hint that it is only a short hop away from something interesting? (Granted it orbits the planet Frogspawn but that could easily have been an excuse to call the station that. Also, the Thule system is the home of Achilles Corporation. They are certainly powerful enough to maintain control of secret locations...).
Another clue might be in the naming of concourse NPCs. I mentioned a Persephone Key a couple of pages back and on Persephone (the station, in Avalon), there is an Abriana Turner looking after Pioneer Supplies. Of course, that might be a coincidence but a Turner on a station with such an important name? I'm not convinced - and I'll be looking around more closely in case there are more hints (both in and out of the Lost Realms, to help determine if relevant names are confined to the region).
It's one of the few books of Robert Holdstock that is available as ebooks (Ragthorn, Mythago series, and Merlin codex series). Should be on Kindle, Google Books, and Apple Books.
