Some notes in the Yoruba front:

Alternate names for Obaluayé also present as systems are Shakpana, Sakpata and Soponna. I suspect each spelling was added from a different diasporic faith.
Also Yemaia is the Orisha of motherhood - this spelling in particular being more closely associated with Santería.
Brilliant, have added these too and updated, like the other deities, they too fall within a banding.

I suspect the ‘Ragthorn’ ‘male’ triad hypothesis is a bust, although all it highlighted is it’s an unknown. There may be an obscure references out there. Again, a trawl through keyword searches on net might find matches.
