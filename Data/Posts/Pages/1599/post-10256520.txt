Wow that "tip off" resource collected by @djadjok is awesome.

Now, granted the reply @Rochester got from support was very useful - but - it only said that the messages aren't from the same person(s) as the mysterious person in the manual cover letter. Support confirmed they're from someone(s) else hiding their identity.

Does that mean the same as "these missions have no relevance to the hunt for Raxxla" though?

Just scanning some of the messages recorded in djadjok's spreadsheets, a few things jump out at me right away:
SPOILER: LIST OF INTERESTING MESSAGES





































It seems clear to me that Fdev used these to tell some of the more 'narrative' stories, not unlike the older style mission text and those that started this very thread.

It seems like references to "lights" and "anomalies" in space are present in these, like they are in some of the other 'abandoned settlement' logs. Even though these might not be related to Raxxla, I do love that they're showing the galaxy is a bit mysterious and spooky. Very grateful to djadjok and all those that worked on this compilation.

*Edit: Reading through again. Thargoids (here and in the other logs, and in the Formidine Rift expedition logs) are often mentioned in relation to sounds. Can't help but think about Sirens.
