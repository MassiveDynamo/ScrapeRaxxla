"Mysterious Strange Tip Off" mission question.

Recently I went to Maia and did some missions for the Ryder Revolutionary Party, I think I did about 4-5 before getting a "Tip Off" mission. I've seen and done these before a few times and used to ignore them, but I went and did it anyway for fun. However... the payment for the mission (scanning a wreck) was only payable by the PF, couldn't redeem the bond anywhere but a IF in the end, bit odd.

And the last couple of weeks I've been running Imperial missions from Cemiess to grind out Imp ranks (at long last) and did at least a few hundred across the various types (mostly kill or transport) - and not got a single Tip Off mission at all.

I had previously believed that they were something that just happened randomly for a bit of added flavour, but... is that the case?

I've done a bunch of googling but most people seem intent on discussing whether the mission is worth doing rather than any particular pattern behind when and why you get them. Is there anyone that's compiled any info on these? frequency, list of the mission text? that sort of thing? I'm sure there must be, anyone here know?

Just wondering if these are related to the "test administered in secret"?
