Yeah...from this point of view, makes sense.
By the way, I guess it already was stated, but, anyway.. Ticushpakhi - 49 Arietis: 190 Ly, as from Varati and HIP 8603, more or less. Where is the fourth vertex (in the outer rim of the bubble) of this tetrahedron (center: Ticushpakhi or Mariyacoch) Han_Zen, please ? (I will ask about the octahedron..later )

What does "A Certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth." really mean? (I still think it's music related).
Imho, 'Place that is not..' because Raxxla is some kind of witchspace. 'Door that is also...' because it's an open portal to this witchspace free of PF's control, key to jump anywhere you want (locked systems/regions, unreachable PSR systems). 'Celestial body', because the portal is on there, an unregistered and obfuscated 'class X (exotic)' body which doesn't interact with our scanners waves (Dark Matter ?) . And 'The Myth' because it follows the Raxxla lore ( events can be canon or not. Lore is lore.) Just tinfoiled assumptions but consistent with the lore and some technical data.
