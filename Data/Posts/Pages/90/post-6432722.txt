Theres always the possibility that they just made the whole raxxla thing up as to it being in game in elite dangerous.

Its not the first time thats been done in the elite/frontier series.

Like the mirage in FE2.......... or the black hole at the centre of the galaxy in FE2................

Good way to keep people looking and playing though.

This is what makes Raxxla so wonderful and so awful! It could be marketing genius. It is the ONLY reason I still play this game. The idea that its not really there keeps me awake at night.
There is somewhat of a paradox involved in it being in game. What happens if we do find it? It would literally be the biggest find in ED. It would have major impact to the entire game lore. The amount of players that would drop whatever they are doing and b-line for it would be remarkable. I think that if its ever found, it deserves a story arc that would be way more grandiose than the whole Salome thing was. Is FD prepared for that? Highly doubtful. The amount of work that would go into that would be too massive for it to just be waiting in the wings for the possibility of someone stumbling across it.
Id say thats a pretty good argument for it not being in game. You think im going to stop looking? Pffft. my tinfoil is way too thick for that!
