I wonder why they didn't just move it to Exploration?

It's clearly a Club plot to hide the truth from enquiring minds.

They closed the FRift thread!?!?!

And I STILL haven't figured out what in Sheol that whole "Vain Queen/Giraffe/Hero" riddle was supposed to be pointing at. As long as new players join the game and stumble upon a mention of the Formidine Rift there will be a need for a Rift thread ... if only to let them know that 99% of the loose ends have been tied up.
