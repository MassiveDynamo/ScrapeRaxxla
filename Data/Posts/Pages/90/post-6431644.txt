They closed the FRift thread!?!?!

And I STILL haven't figured out what in Sheol that whole "Vain Queen/Giraffe/Hero" riddle was supposed to be pointing at. As long as new players join the game and stumble upon a mention of the Formidine Rift there will be a need for a Rift thread ... if only to let them know that 99% of the loose ends have been tied up.

I donâ€™t think the forum moderators have inside knowledge from FD. So IFF it is mysteriously re-opened again then I think that would be an indication there is still something significant in that storyline
