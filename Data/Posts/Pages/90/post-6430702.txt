Theres always the possibility that they just made the whole raxxla thing up as to it being in game in elite dangerous.

Its not the first time thats been done in the elite/frontier series.

Like the mirage in FE2.......... or the black hole at the centre of the galaxy in FE2................

Good way to keep people looking and playing though.
