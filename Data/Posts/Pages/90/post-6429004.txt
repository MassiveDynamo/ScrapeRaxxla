I have to say, just found the FRift thread closed for myself and my instant reaction was anger. Why the **** was it reopened if it was just a wild goose chase???

Anyway, from what the mod said, at least we know that FD are clearly DONE with the FRift.

I was just saying to a friend yesterday that at present, I get more fun coming to these forums to discuss and tin-foil than I do actually playing the game. What a sorry state of affairs...
