Okay, try not to complain about another thread being closed for being off-topic, because that might happen here too! Currently the discussion is about another thread which is about another (AFAIK completely unrelated) mystery and about an entirely different game! Call me naive but these topics aren't exactly on topic.

Back on topic:
Where's Macros got to? What are we going to search for when 3.0 launches? Sap-8 core containers? Trinkets of hidden fortune? Data crystals? Black boxes? Will we try to get The Dark Wheel faction in control of Shin-Dez? Try to use star trigonometry to identify the location of the system(s) in the start screen? What does "A Certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth." really mean? (I still think it's music related).

What if Raxxla is in the Formidine Rift and it is all just misdirection by moderators and FD? Just another thread on the tapestry etc. etc.
