When could Raxxla (specifically the classical Omphalos Rift Stargate version*) appear in the timeline of Guardian Lore?
It would be right after the Arks. They fully develop Hyperspace whilst the Arks were traveling. I think this is scattered between the various Guardian Data logs on culture and technology. Faster than light communication came first then full hyperspace.
