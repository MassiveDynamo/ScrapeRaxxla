The Moon would be a practical place to put a portal, if the purpose of it is to access earth. The moon has been permit locked since release and the permit seem unobtainable. If the moon is Raxxla, it's either impossible to go there or the the permit is possible to override.
No, don't think Luna is Raxxla, but from the Toast Luna might be the first step on the Journey....
