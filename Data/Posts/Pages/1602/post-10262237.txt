Well, if memory is correct one of the unregistered comms that ultimately lead to first "Thargoid" crash orbits The Moon. I believe the other was near Jupiter. I put it as "Thargoid" because it is the human name for that species based on a holo-vid from Lave. THARG was the means by which the "Lavian Phoenix Greeting Protocol" was decoded from the beginning of "Lave: Revolution". That said, it doubtful that "Thargoids" are actually called "Thargoids" by themselves. Especially once you add in the annoying detail that Lave was a dictatorship in the first game which should put it well after the departure of said "Thargoids" in 3151 (we are talking 3174 to December 31st, 3199). Just saying, but maybe Robert Holdstock's mention of Oresrians that happen to look like "Thargoids" is an often overlooked important detail.






Lavian Phoenix Greeting Protocol

The old mercenaries preferred a silent hail when meeting in deep space . Approach dead ahead with gun ports open at ninety degrees to target. Stop at five hundred metres , rotate ninety to the left and wait for same response.

Once established, custom is Phoenix members help each other. Your new friend might fly your wing for a while, but they’ll be gone if something comes up.

No pilot violates the greeting. If they does, let it be know. The Lady of Fate don’t smile on traitors.
