It would be right after the Arks. They fully develop Hyperspace whilst the Arks were traveling. I think this is scattered between the various Guardian Data logs on culture and technology. Faster than light communication came first then full hyperspace.
Side note: FDev co-developed or partially funded Deliver Us Mars and the same company has Deliver Us the Moon. Those games have 3 Arks just like the Guardians and timeline match Elite Universe exactly. I don't know if we should read into that or not. If nothing else, the story is freaking amazing. Outward is the story of the 3 Arks and an attempt to save humanity. The lore deeply involved artificial intelligence, too.

I have personal suspicions that Artemis Suit looks the way it does very intentionally.

You won't arrive at your destination for several hours after beginning Deliver Us Mars, but the world-building makes it worth the wait.
