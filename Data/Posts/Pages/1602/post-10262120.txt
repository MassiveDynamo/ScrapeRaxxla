All deities found to date are focused around or below Sol, there are none found further out than the prescribed sphere of influence set by the furthest discovered systems up-to 2296.

These zone denotes a separation boundary (water) similar to that denoted by Robert Holdstocks Lost Realms, namely that the Otherworld is hidden over sea or water. In if following this the ‘Otherworld’ is the same as Holdstocks ‘Lost Realms’ eg a lost paradise ergo Eden, as Holdstock identifies. Similarly as FD establishes Raxxla is the same as John Miltons ‘pendant world’ aka Raxxla is another example of a lost Eden aka a Lost Realm.
Can you check the Aerial system relative to your zones? I think I know where Eden is located. Aerial is where Holdstock's story "Earthwind" happened but apparently due to some temporal anomaly it occurs in 36th century (Tuesday, January 1, 3501 - Sunday, December 31, 3600).

I think you'll understand way I suggest this given the rare good from the system: Eden Apples Of Aerial

This is almost too perfect and makes so much sense with the larger lore
