Aerial is a good candidate, it is very close, being within the ‘underground’ zone.

But in Earthwind the name was not Aerial, it was Aeran. This is as a girl's name related to the Gaelic name Erin. The meaning of Aeran is "Ireland".

The words Aeran and Erin are not systems in game.

Updated it is not Areial but Aeran… nice try.
