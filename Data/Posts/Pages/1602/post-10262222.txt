We also have good old Ishmael Palin. Ishmael is of course the name of the first person narrator in the Moby D story.

Just a minor thing, but we don't actually know that's the narrator's name. Just what they ask to be called

Side note: FDev co-developed or partially funded Deliver Us Mars and the same company has Deliver Us the Moon.

No. FDev did not co-develop Deliver Us Mars. They were the publishers for the game that was already well under development.

Odyssey started development even before Deliver Us Mars had entered planning, and don't forget if Raxxla has been in the game since the very beginning. Then that is 4 years before Deliver Us The Moon.

I don't know if we should read into that or not.

No
