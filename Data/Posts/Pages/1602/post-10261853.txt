If Raxxla is Guardian. My big question for y'all is:

When could Raxxla (specifically the classical Omphalos Rift Stargate version*) appear in the timeline of Guardian Lore?


* As opposed to the 'gateway to other universes' being virtual or a transcendence post-mortality state, for example.
I would say you can rule out the time from when they we're wiped out onwards with some certainty...
