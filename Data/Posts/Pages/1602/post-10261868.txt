If Raxxla is Guardian. My big question for y'all is:

When could Raxxla (specifically the classical Omphalos Rift Stargate version*) appear in the timeline of Guardian Lore?


* As opposed to the 'gateway to other universes' being virtual or a transcendence post-mortality state, for example.
When they where on their last retreat and needed to escape? and in turn also created the AI which could be linked
