2001 Space Odyssey is remembered in the ED docking music (as it was in Elite 1). IIRC in 2001SO the first monolith landed on Earth and affected primitive hominids in pre-history (Guardian times?). A second monolith was found (during 20th Century space exploration) in a magnetic anomaly buried on Luna & when excavated sent a signal to the final monolith in Jupiter orbit (in the book, but changed in film). The final monolith was a portal, but could be that any of them could do that function. So perhaps Raxxla is a monolith portal on Luna? Odd that Luna is still permit locked....

Luna fits one aspect of the Triple Goddess theme of the logo. It also fits the Jewel on the Brow of the Mother of Galaxies (Sol's Mother Gaia faction).

There is another possibility...that the second monolith is on Luna and points to the third (gateway) which could be on Triton (also strangely permit locked). I don't like this hypothesis as it would mean FD have deliberately blocked the Quest, and still are.

Also...Triton is the start point of the journey through the Underworld depicted in MB's tattoo
The Moon would be a practical place to put a portal, if the purpose of it is to access earth. The moon has been permit locked since release and the permit seem unobtainable. If the moon is Raxxla, it's either impossible to go there or the the permit is possible to override.
