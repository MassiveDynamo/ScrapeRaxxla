If Raxxla is Guardian. My big question for y'all is:

When could Raxxla (specifically the classical Omphalos Rift Stargate version*) appear in the timeline of Guardian Lore?


* As opposed to the 'gateway to other universes' being virtual or a transcendence post-mortality state, for example.
I think Raxxla appear long after the Guardian timeline we have from the sites. If Raxxla has any connection to the classical mythology of earth, I think we can approximately date it. If we believe all the stories, mythologies and religions, it seems the goods appear on earth about 12,000 BC and mostly leave around 3,000 - 2,000 BC.
We then have a short return of a demi god from about 4 BC - 30 AD and a human using the portal in about 620 AD.

In this period the gods lived elsewhere and just visited earth, when they felt like it. Some lived in the heavens and some lived in the underworld. They all had some access to earth, but very limited for those from the underworld.

This period is probably at least million years after the fall of the Guardians. We are talking about remnants, exiles, constructs or some other form of descendents from the Guardians. Possibly several factions, in a bit of a power struggle.
We only have access to the late history of the traditionalist Guardians. These were fully or mostly wiped out.
What happened to the other groups, is still unknown. Who ever they were or are, the seem to have given up on project earth a few thousand years ago. Hopefully they didn't dismantle their portal when they left. They sure hid it well though.
