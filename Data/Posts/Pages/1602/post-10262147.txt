That still leaves the question of: what would be the next step?
Scan the system thoroughly. There's bound to be something important. Though, that may be the apple itself.

That said, there's a reason why I said this,

This is almost too perfect and makes so much sense with the larger lore

For the record, pretty sure Aerial is in "Tour of the Universe" and one or two others done jointly between Robert Holdstock and Malcolm Edwards. Here's the book's description from the rear:

Earthwind tells the story of two people trapped on the planet Aeran. What has happened to the colonists of this world to obliterate their memories of who and what they were, and to have rebuilt in their place a precise and accurate copy of a stone age culture that had flourished in Ireland during the fourth millennium BC?

Elspeth Mueller, fighting against time as her memory decayed, tried to find out; deformed and embittered by the barbaric rituals of her ‘civilised’ home world, she struggled against her own fear to accept the cruel customs of Aerani society, knowing that the answers she sought lay in those same rituals.

Peter Ashka, his life inextricably interwoven with the I Ching, tried to find out as well — but his quest brought him into conflict with the two authorities that guided his life.

I think this is first very clear indication most if not all the Steven Eisler, Robert Holdstock, and jointly written works between Robert Holdstock and Malcolm Edwards are canonical to Elite Dangerous.

Remember, this is the Pilot's Federation symbol and astronomical symbol of Earth..
