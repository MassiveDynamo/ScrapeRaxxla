Phone screen??

Mate, you need Pranav Antal’s “Acheron Interface” neurological implant!!

Though I note that in Greek mythology, the Acheron was was one of the rivers of the Greek underworld & known as the "river of woe", the "river of pain" or the "river of lost souls", so I anticipate that this might not go too well!

@Rochester : another Underworld link! Antal’s area of influence seems to fit in.
