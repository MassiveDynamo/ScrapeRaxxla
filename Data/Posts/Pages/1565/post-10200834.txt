Oh and yes. I don't want to fully lay out my theories about what will happen next in the elite and how it is related to raxxla. I don't want to be banned.

Plus, with the speed at which developers roll out updates. I think my new predictions will unfold for another two years. As it was last year with motherships.

But I'll give you a couple of hints.

Col Sectors
Wregoe sectors.

Anomaly type P06
Anomaly type L07

Human ships based on Targoid technologies (not FSD)

Pay attention to the little things and look for brown green planet(planetoid). Not a star or gas giant. Not a Raxxla - but the direction.
