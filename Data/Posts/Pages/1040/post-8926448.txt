Nope, still not there.

How did your investigation of glow in other systems go?

I spent 2 hours in Kokary (a G-class system with two belts) mimicking my Sol activities. I still experienced teleporting at a rough 45 135 degree opposition to where I was on the Orrery map when entering the belts, but I never encountered any glows.

It's worth noting that Kokary does not contain Earth-like worlds, which is why I'll be visiting another G-class system today or tomorrow and attempting the same procedures.

After venturing into Kokary I wanted to confirm that I could still trigger the glow in Sol, so I went back and managed to get one medium-strength within 40 minutes.
