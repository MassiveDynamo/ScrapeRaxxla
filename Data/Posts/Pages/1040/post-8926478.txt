We’re trying to find out if it’s a real thing or a lighting bug of some form. Investigations are going on dynamically, especially in the Independent Raxxla Hunters Discord.

SparklePaws said five posts ago that s/he has investigated Kokary and next will investigate asteroid belts in systems with ELW.
Another possibility is some form of bleed through from use of the orrery view, also under investigation.
