Maybe this mechanic of flying is SC and drop at a specific location in normal space without locking/targeting it what is needed to find Raxxla having the asteroid belt in Sol hinting it as a clue
Ah, this is taking me back to the Castellan 2 cluster in Lave, and the old ‘it’s not possible to get in, there’s something there!’ stuff.

Great days!

Anyway, point being that getting into targetable clusters can still be a challenge.

Would Sol have something similar but without a targetable point?

It shouldn’t for the asteroids based on current RL, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t.

Plus, there might be a comet or two as well!
