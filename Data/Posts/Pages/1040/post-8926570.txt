I spent an hour in Eta Cassiopeiae performing the same search routine I did in Sol. After a while I slowed down and tried opening/closing the Orrery System Map close to a 100 (maybe 200) times. Eventually I observed the same "glow" effect from Sol, but instead of green it was black. Here's the clip:

I also noticed that much like in Sol I was being disaplaced, though at a different angle. There were no asteroid belts in this system.
