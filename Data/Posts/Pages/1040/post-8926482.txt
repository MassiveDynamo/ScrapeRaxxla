I watched all the videos attached a little earlier on which captured the green glow. According to my observations, it occurs along the Sun - Jupiter route. Yes, there were exceptions. If we take into account our theory with the Trojan asteroid belts, they are just tied to Jupiter and rotate synchronously with it. Only Hilda rotates slightly on a different axis and at a different speed. An interesting observation - at the moment, the position of Jupiter and presumably the belts coincides with the position in the Raxxla logo, but this is not accurate, you need to spend time to fully calculate their position based on the position of the planets.

A couple of important links:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_asteroid - Hilda rotation.
https://www.solarsystemscope.com/ - Sol system online model with time rotation.

Im working on this theory.
