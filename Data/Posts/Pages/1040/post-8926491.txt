Ah, this is taking me back to the Castellan 2 cluster in Lave, and the old ‘it’s not possible to get in, there’s something there!’ stuff.

Great days!

Anyway, point being that getting into targetable clusters can still be a challenge.

Would Sol have something similar but without a targetable point?

It for the asteroids based on current RL, but that doesn’t mean it .

Plus, there might be a comet or two as well!

About the mechanics of falling out. Indeed, if you fly in a wing with a friend and drop out next to each other but not using the FSD trace, you will appear far enough apart and still be able to cover that distance between each other. Therefore, hiding something in space is an easy task. But to find - how to look for a needle in a haystack.
