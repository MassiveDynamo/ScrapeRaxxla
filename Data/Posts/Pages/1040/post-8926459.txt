Intereresting that the asteroid belt is rotating (as it should IRL), or at least the bodies within it. Maybe this is FD’s way of giving it rotation without actually putting any real asteroids in for <reasons>?

It does make the sector positioning difficult. I thought I had seen the sectors at varying angles but didn’t look closely as I thought they were fixed. Mmmm!!
