Maybe this mechanic of flying is SC and drop at a specific location in normal space without locking/targeting it what is needed to find Raxxla having the asteroid belt in Sol hinting it as a clue
But I crashed out of SC when I had 5he glow visible & nothing there. Not to say youâ€™re wrong on this though! May need to crash out a few times...
