Guys i hope this green glow is not related to a bug about earthlike planets and their visualisation in galmap. They are green and there are obiviously, 2 earthlike planets nearby area the search is going. I also had the glow after couple of hours spend in that place. But not in sector 16, it was 1 or 2 near jupiter side.
