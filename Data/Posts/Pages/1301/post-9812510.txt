I'm near an unregistered beacon orbiting Lave 2. It seems... the beacons are broken/switched off, and nothing else is transmitting indeed, we need to somehow persuade the FD wizards to check if Raxxla is working, otherwise maybe we are trying in vain. And the meeting does not take place because some script does not work
In my signature I have a link to a spreadsheet of Listening Posts and UCB which I compiled from various sources as an aid to hunting various things. I update it when anyone reports something new that can be verified. They are listed alphabetically by system name so can provide a quick check if you come across an LP or UCB and wonder if it is new.
For Lave UCB I have broadcast time as 10mins past the hour.
