If Frontier is lying that would end very bad for them. They would loose all of their honors and respect. Lying to players is not something they should take for granted.
It wouldn’t be FD lying.

If, for example, President Hudson puts out a statement saying something and it turns out not to be entirely truthful, is that FD lying? No it isn’t. And the same principle applies.
