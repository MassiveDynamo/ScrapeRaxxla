You made me wonder something: were anomalies been introduced in same time as the codex entry of Raxxla or was it before/after ?
In the game market, there is something called "particles anomaly" that noone ever found a way to get them even with research limpet controller (whatever the anomaly type).
So i'm afraid if Raxxla is linked to anomalies, it could be just as broken as them (anomalies are broken since their beginning...).
No, Han_Zen and I called these things anomalies because ... they are!
What you are talking of is labelled "anomalies" (P-type and Q-type) in the codex and on the screen when you meet one in space but they are some type of energy-bsed lifeform I think (Michael Brookes seemed to be quite taken with the idea of energy-based lifeforms). They are a form of Notable Stellar Phenomena, but what we are talking about only exists (as far as we know) in the system map of some (many, but not all!) systems. I did try to track them down within their system after seeing them appear in the system map, but nothing was there, hence anomalous!
