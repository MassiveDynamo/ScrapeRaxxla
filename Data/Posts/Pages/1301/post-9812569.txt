In my signature I have a link to a spreadsheet of Listening Posts and UCB which I compiled from various sources as an aid to hunting various things. I update it when anyone reports something new that can be verified. They are listed alphabetically by system name so can provide a quick check if you come across an LP or UCB and wonder if it is new.
For Lave UCB I have broadcast time as 10mins past the hour.
I will definitely use this link, but most of the beacons have already been verified by me. In particular, the beacon near Lave 2, when we were just looking for a planet with fallen Thargoids. Then everything worked. Yesterday I decided to revisit our entire journey from the very beginning, including mentions of Ruxxla in the context of a story in a 1990 magazine. Arrived at the beacon, it is there, but does not transmit any signals for an hour (maybe the event just ended and it was turned off as unnecessary or bug)
