If you perceive Raxxla as being something ground breaking, and you are representative of a significant percentage of the player base, you might feel like FD have lied, but FD are still not beholden to us.

They have never (unless you hold AT to his statement) described it as something amazing. So they aren’t liers, Galnet isn’t 100% accurate either, it being in the control of a rather mysterious group and has in the past been interrupted by certain powers, DB has himself alluded to such.

The vast majority of hub-bub concerning Raxxla and these 1304 pages is fan projection. May I remind, we are still contained within the ‘lore & role play’ section.

I would still be happy if Raxxla was a million-gallon vat of custard, as much as if it were something awesome; yet I still suspect the puzzle will certainly be more rewarding than the prize; but I do like custard; custard is pretty awesome.
