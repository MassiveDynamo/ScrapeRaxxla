If Raxxla is something we lost, this image depicts the possession of the crown, the loss, the search and the climb back to the throne to get the crown once again.
Possession, loss, search and ascension. Cyclical, implying it happens over and over and over. Demeter and Persephone were Agricultural goddesses, cyclical in nature. She is in hades for a time and returns for a time bringing spring, endlessly, as on a wheel.

The definition of Rax from Merriam Webster.
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rax
Middle English (northern dialect) raxen, from Old English raxan; akin to Old English reccan to stretch.
