21 Zeta Cephei 4 H: No station located & not quite the right colour.
Blast it! Just realized NGC 2682 FBC 3456 is a one-way trip to the Cancri cluster. I was framed! Ah well, anything for the quest.

Crap! 21 Zeta Cephei was my favourite of the bunch since it was the only Super giant (the rest are just 'Giant').
Unless the station is at nav-beacon range to the star, I think the star has to be a Red Supergiant.
I don't think a gas giant with 8 moons can spawn within 20 ls of a star.
On top of that, it needs to be class M9 with a temperature under <= 2100 (<2000 more likely)

None of the stars on my list were M9s though...
