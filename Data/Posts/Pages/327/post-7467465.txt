21 Zeta Cephei 4 H: No station located & not quite the right colour.
Blast it! Just realized NGC 2682 FBC 3456 is a one-way trip to the Cancri cluster. I was framed! Ah well, anything for the quest.

I am wondering if there are M+ in game. I just checked most of the classifications and they all don't seem to be 'red enough' @ M Class + and any type of L seems way to red/maroon. I am wondering if there is any filtering going on or whether ambient lighting is playing into it.


My 2 cents... *Shrug*

I don't feel like flying 2000Ly to scope this guy out:
