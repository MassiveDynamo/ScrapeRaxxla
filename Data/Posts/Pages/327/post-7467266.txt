So....
The Low-Profile Workshop and Bohmshohm....
After doing a bunch of jobs for them, I began noticing an increased amount of requests to go to Fortuna.
Well...Fortuna is the Goddess of Fortune and prosperity. Which according to the wiki about her means "Bonus Eventus."
Fortuna is also known as the Goddess Tyche...
Tyche, sound familiar?
Tycho's Supernova, the famed missing supernova from Cassiopeiae?
And Fortuna is the one who gave me the mysterious courier missions to Colonia once I was allied with them....
BTW, do not ever do illegal missions against Fortuna. Just a forewarning.
Now lets take a look at the lyrics of O Fortuna.
