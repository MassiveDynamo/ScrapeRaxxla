Really annoying that text of previously viewed beacons can't be seen at a later date, either in game via the map or codex or in the journals.

Codex - Commander - Archive - Tourist Beacons

Should show in order of finding. Scroll down is a bit weird, have to manually select / highlight first one and go down until way off the page then its starts scrolling (at least on XB where RS would normally do this function)
