Really annoying that text of previously viewed beacons can't be seen at a later date, either in game via the map or codex or in the journals.

http://elitedangerous.hozbase.co.uk/customtable/display?id=touristbeacons&system=colonia mentions it, not sure if the wording is taken exactly or is a more general comment

"Distant Worlds II was an ambitious five-month expedition to the far outer rim. It launched from the Pallaeni system in January of 3305 and reached its final destination of Beagle Point in May 3305. The purpose of the expedition was to unravel the mysteries of the galaxy, and to construct a starport at Sagittarius A*. This beacon marks one of the locations discovered by the Distant Worlds fleet during its epic journey."
Yep, arent they shown in your codex? But I always take a pic of them.
