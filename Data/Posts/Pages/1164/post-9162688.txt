is that the Choose Your Own Adventure one? Wasnt there a Tourist Beacon to scan?
Yes, that was Choose Your Own Adventure beacon after arrival between 3 neutron stars and a white dwarf, text referred to DW2 (I think). The right-most of them has ( ) around it and that's where the beacon was.

My focus was making sure I avoided them all and before I'd done that the passenger piped up with the usual "take me home now". I just hope if Raxxla can be found in game it is a bit more dramatic than the usual passenger mission destinations (although to be fair I'd be well-chuffed even with the usual response if someone finds it)

EDIT:
Going through my screenshot folder I did make a few snaps
SPOILER: IMAGES OF VISITOR BEACON
