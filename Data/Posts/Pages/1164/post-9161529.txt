Just a thought but RAXXLA could be like an old school cheat code. If you use an XBOX controller it would be Right, A, X, X, Left, A. That would make RAXXLA the key. The only question is where to use it. Maybe during a jump if you put it in it will drop you in witchspace.

or RA and LA could be Right Analogue and Left Analogue.

I’m not at home so can’t test this, but I would be pretty annoyed if that was the answer
