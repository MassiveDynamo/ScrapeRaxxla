Ill have to do the DW & DW2 routes some day, but just got back from a 3 week trip 'South' of the bubble in time to catch up with Turning The Wheel for the final experiment. I can see the allure of having 2 accts sometimes. Too much happening in the story right now to leave the Sector. FOMO lol Im a sucker for FOMO. Maybe Adamastor pt iii will lead even further afield.
