Here me out. We are told the Guardians had a space-faring civilization (despite literally never seeing evidence beyond Beacons). We are told they had shielded cities. I think I am beginning to understand exactly what we found: something like Jeury Terminal is in Van Maanan's Star system (the one given to Guardians of the Free Spirit). This is one of the absolutely giant facilities that appears like a stadium. They also seemingly have a glow as if they are shielded. There is another one of these in Sol: Ehrlich City on Mercury. Further, there is another in Etain (the Far God system) - Vian Landing. I don't think these were built by humans. These are also the rarest of surface sites - usually designated as Surface Ports.

We are told Guardians were taller than us. This might just explain the size of the ramps into these facilities. They are giant. I am seriously beginning to wonder if the Guardian sites we have seen are their much older stuff. Meanwhile, humanity exists in the ruins of the more modern Guardian civilization that happened before they were wiped. Perhaps these giant cities were the Raxxlan cities. Interestingly, these look kind of similar to the Raxxla logo when looked at from above (though obviously more round). Which begs the question: are the non-dockable Horizons sites actually Human or built by Guardians? None of these structures really look similar to our settlements or historical Earth cities - save the skyscrapers that dwarf anything built by humans.
