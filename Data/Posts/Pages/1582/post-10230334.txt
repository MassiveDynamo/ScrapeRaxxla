Galactic News: Hyperspace

"The first commercially available hyperspace system was known as the 'Faraway Jump'. The Faraway system was far from perfect, however, depending on a complex network of monitoring satellites, branch lines, stop points and rescue stations – which took hundreds of years to establish – to operate smoothly."

"It was around this time the phrase 'witch-space' first appeared, reflecting the inherent dangers of early hyperspace technology and the strange 'corridor' a ship travelled through during a hyperspace jump. Some even believed witch-space was haunted by 'ghosts of ships that went into Faraway and didn't come out again'. It is certainly true that a number of ships never reached their destinations."

I am thinking those orbital installations also aren't exactly human built. Again, absolutely no docking points. Also, our ships seem to be the sole proof of Guardian space-faring technology. Their ability to travel between systems was known as through-space. Guess how our technology was referenced in the first manual - ThruSpace. So, our comms systems came from an alien civilization, too. Through-space after all is just another term for wormholes.
