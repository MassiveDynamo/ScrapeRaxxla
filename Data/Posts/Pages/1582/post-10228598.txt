The points on Artemis by @Jorki Rasalas do shine some new light on the Brookes tour destinations. Let's revise them:
Tourist Spot 0507 Freeholm Victory, Artemis - AKA HD 16270, HIP 12110, GJ 1048; right at the border between the Cetus and Fornax constellations, but officially belongs to the former. Seems to be a repurposed beacon, given the numbering.
Tourist Spot 0746 A Brilliant Pairing, Beta Sculptoris - Part of the Sculptor constellation, as the name implies. Anything of note in the Elite lore?
Tourist Spot 0747 Life Beyond Earth, Synuefe CI-J b42-3 - The odd one out; only Stellar Forge-generated star in the tour and located in Guardian space.
Tourist Spot 0748 A Rare Warmth, Taygeta - AKA 19 Tauri, one of the Pleiades. The description of the escape pod filled with tokens to honour Michael strongly reminds me of the Trinkets of Hidden Fortune.
Tourist Spot 0749 , - Part of the Orion nebula. Explicitly talks about Raxxla, quoting Milton and the pendant world.
Yes I agree, there has to be something of importance with Artemis. I think FD have dropped various hints already.
