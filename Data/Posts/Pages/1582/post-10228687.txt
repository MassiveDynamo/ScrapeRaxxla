Yes I agree, there has to be something of importance with Artemis. I think FD have dropped various hints already.

Artemis is the Moon. She has many names. Some of them are direct personifications of the moon. Other are aspects of the moon.
The list of lunar deities: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lunar_deities are probably represented with 30 systems in ED.

These lunar deities are closely related to the triple goddess theme, with it's gateways and guardians.

It's difficult to say if these are just hints to Raxxla being a moon or if the Moon it self is the important factor.

If mythology is important to the Raxxla puzzle, it would be logical that the navigational markers are celestial bodies and constellations that were known in ancient times. We can't be sure that FD has made a logical puzzle though.
