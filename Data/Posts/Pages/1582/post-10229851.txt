Here's some historical context that bears repeating in the context of The Dark Wheel and Raxxla myths.

How many all Elite CMDRs do you think there are and how might this impact access to The Dark Wheel and Raxxla?

Not many and especially in all six categories - especially factoring Elite+ ranks. That said, I have strong suspicions all six aren't necessary - but you still need to be quite capable. History here is one of the major factors. Raxxla mythos is known to exist definitively by 2296, but rumors likely predate this by anywhere from decades to possibly a century or more. Pilot's Federation as an organization doesn't exist until 2805. The first Elite CMDR doesn't really happen until centuries later - approximately in the late 3100s. Combat Elite was the first Elite CMDR ranking.

In other words, Raxxla was likely found by non-Elite people if it has been found in the past 1,013 or more years. The Elite ranking probably has more to do with surviving to find it, surviving the trip there, surviving what you find, surviving whatever guards it. There is also the matter that The Dark Wheel apparently takes very seriously being absolutely the best of the best. Basically, you need some combo of the following skills:

- Combat - ability to just survive in the Elite Universe. Combat and good piloting are pretty much a must.

- Trade - Instincts to thrive on your own and make a living and know where to source various resources. Additionally, there is the matter of piracy.

- Exploration - The galaxy is big. Exploration is fundamentally dangerous especially when your survival depends on your wits and resourcefulness when hundreds to thousands of lightyears from civilization.

- Mercenary - An add-on skillset from combat - survival of dangerous situations when lacking a ship.

- Exo-biology - An add-on skillset from exploration that helps you know when a region is important or somehow unique.

- CQC - Ship-based combat on steroids.

TL;DR: Skills pay the bills . Skills keep you alive. You need to be capable of facing anything and make snap decisions that affect you chances and you have to make them fast. You also need to be able to tell what areas are important and what isn't and survive no matter the conditions.

This doesn't even factor into the equation the very deeply twisted historical narratives that appear to be crafted by a group or multiple groups not exactly interested in the reality of the past being widely available to the general public.
