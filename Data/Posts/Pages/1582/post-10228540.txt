That’s a possibility, but my recollection of ‘Regained’ was that it’s a poor sequel. Unlike the first, Miltons follow up is more religious, there is less focus of cosmology and Satan is more atypical, the story being focused more of the temptation of Christ. The book was not so favourably received during its time.

The first work is far more interesting and its cosmological descriptions of the fall and of the Prime mobile are very detailed, there is none of this in Regained to my knowledge.

I’ve no supporting evidence other than intuition but I suspect Brookes had utilised multiple sources to construct something new, a composite of Milton, Holdstock and Lovecraft. Likely I hypothesis more emphasis might have been upon Holdstock.

Lovecraft, I feel inflected the Thargoids; the Thargod cult narrative and I believe the various Generation ship stories too, I do suspect originally everything tied together, and probably still does, but I also suspect a certain percentage of works were not finalised, due I presume to a narrative redux - evident from the 2016/2017 purge.

It’s true that Regained may be yet another clue, I don’t discount it, but I think it might just be a thread stretched too far… it’s easy to fall down a rabbit hole with this. If there’s any in game reference, then there might be scope for it.

Holdstock I now feel is a primary influence. Various works of his do focus upon Celtic / Old English and Norse mythology, I can imagine this had an impact upon the inclusion of Yggdrasil; so I’m now pretty much convinced Raxxla is a Holdstock Easter egg, flavoured with a good pinch of Milton….
