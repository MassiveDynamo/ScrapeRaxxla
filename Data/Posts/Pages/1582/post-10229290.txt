Ive been sat in my old Annie at Freeholm for the last few days re reading Legacy (i like to follow Elite storys in game if you get what i mean).
I did spend a lot of time here previously but will have a complete re scan of everything once more over the next few nights.
One thing i did notice in the book was on page 219 and his reference when describing the Majestic Class ship as 'Toroid'.
