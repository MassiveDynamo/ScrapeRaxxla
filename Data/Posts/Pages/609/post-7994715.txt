I explored some of the uninhabited systems with human civ flags. Mostly just degraded USS, but a few seem to spawn high grades (ferez). No idea if this is some sort of bug. Only NPCs to be found are at asteroid clusters as is usual of uninhabited systems anywhere close to human space. I am going to try and get a complete list pulled form the edsm data set this weekend.
