Jupp. I think the Persephone link has been investigated inside out. Salomé went to Avalon and Persephone after her Sol trip, If I remember correctly.
I think it was meant to symbolise her going under ground. It was the transformation from Kahina to Salomé or something.

I have fond memories of jettisoning canisters of grain and silver into the sun in Persephone system. I might even have a ship or two left there.
