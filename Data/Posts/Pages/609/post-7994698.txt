Did most of the accessible ones except Alnilam because I got stuck hopping around the named systems in the Running Man Nebula (Hard to see unless you're in there and looking at the nav panel, since there's so many, so close together) and I seem to recall finding a bunch with your tags on them.
Pretty sure you missed a few, on purpose maybe, and got a few tags of my own out there.

I just treat places like that as a guest book. Just leaving my signature for the most part. I always hated when in deep space at some relatively small nebula you'll sometimes find a cmdr who has tagged and mapped every dang thing in it. Seems greedy to me to an extent. I've spent a whole lot of time in and around Orion. Currently here now funny enough. This recent move by the bugs towards Which Head is putting me on my toes. If they move to Orion prepare for something massive to happen.
