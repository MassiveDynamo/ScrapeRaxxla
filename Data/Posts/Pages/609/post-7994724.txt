I just treat places like that as a guest book. Just leaving my signature for the most part. I always hated when in deep space at some relatively small nebula you'll sometimes find a cmdr who has tagged and mapped every dang thing in it. Seems greedy to me to an extent. I've spent a whole lot of time in and around Orion. Currently here now funny enough. This recent move by the bugs towards Which Head is putting me on my toes. If they move to Orion prepare for something massive to happen.
The OCD made me do it, honest! Oink, oink! I'sa greedy lil' piggy!

[Edit: Coming at it from the other direction - may as well complete the job while I'm here.]
[Edit, edit: Will take that idea on board though, and maybe leave some for others to tag...]
