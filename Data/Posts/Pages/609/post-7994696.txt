Betelgeuse is a phenomenal sight.
The center and furthest star in his belt, Epsilon Orionis aka Alnilam, and the star at the tip of his sword, 44 Iota Orionis aka Hatsya should be the only 2 navigable stars that will give you trouble as they are on the far side of Barnard's Loop/Col 70 Sector. It just takes a little time to work around.
Did most of the accessible ones except Alnilam because I got stuck hopping around the named systems in the Running Man Nebula (Hard to see unless you're in there and looking at the nav panel, since there's so many, so close together) and I seem to recall finding a bunch with your tags on them.

Pretty sure you missed a few, on purpose maybe, and got a few tags of my own out there.
