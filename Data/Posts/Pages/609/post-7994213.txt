its been mentioned, but haven't seen evidence that all Dorado stars were checked like I did for the crane constellation.. The wiki list is good for a check list of stars in the constellation which is what Guru meant I think. I went through the list ticking them off (for Crane)- interesting time - saw my first S class star for instance.
