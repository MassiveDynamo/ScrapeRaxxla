Been out and mapped it since the FSS was added, think I even landed on it to scan a BIO / GEO signal but if there was more than one of each I wouldn't have checked them all (probably only site [3] and / or [6] if there were that many) but I don't recall seeing a human signal or I'd have checked that too, probably (OCD FTW).

3 geo's. 2 water geysers and a fiery fumarole along with 1 installation "Primary Transport Authority" or something close to that.
