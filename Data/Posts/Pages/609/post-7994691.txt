I did Betelgeuse and Rigel but had a hard time find most of the rest. one of the belt was behind a huge wall of locked systems too I think. v orionis it might have been. I thought no it was the right side belt star
Betelgeuse is a phenomenal sight.
The center and furthest star in his belt, Epsilon Orionis aka Alnilam, and the star at the tip of his sword, 44 Iota Orionis aka Hatsya should be the only 2 navigable stars that will give you trouble as they are on the far side of Barnard's Loop/Col 70 Sector. It just takes a little time to work around.
