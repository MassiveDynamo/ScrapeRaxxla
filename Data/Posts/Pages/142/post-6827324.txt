And the Oolite version of Raxxla, being not a simple planet but a 'witchspace', a network of 8 (did I say eight ? ) portals in the MW (did I say in the MW ?) fits... a lttle. Because we know that The Myth is a celestial body. So, 8 bodies ('Raxxla-1' to 'R8') homing a portal which interconnects them. N/S/E/W/UP/Down/SgrA*/...and the last near the Bubble for practical reasons.

Wasn't Raxxla implemented in Oolite by more than one OXP? I don't think there is a single version of Raxxla in Oolite and, even if there is, I don't think it is part of the base game. Lots of people created lots of different mods for that game. I even had a very special (and very cheaty) modification of the Cobra Mk III with a custom paint job that could out run and out maneuver every other ship in the universe. Weapons so powerful it could shred Thargoids without blinking.
