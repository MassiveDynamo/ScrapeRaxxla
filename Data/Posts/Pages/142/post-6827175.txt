I hope Raxxla is not findable through simple eyeballing, but after a succession of deeds and achievements which grant its 'deobfuscation', and only for the one who completed the 'personal journey'. Like earning a permit to some locked system. A Quest. I hope the starting point is TDW faction (getting Elite the first step, then allied with TDW, then ...), even when I suspect the storyline being on standby, working as intended...
That would add some so much in need depth to the game.

And the Oolite version of Raxxla, being not a simple planet but a 'witchspace', a network of 8 (did I say eight ? ) portals in the MW (did I say in the MW ?) fits... a lttle. Because we know that The Myth is a celestial body. So, 8 bodies ('Raxxla-1' to 'R8') homing a portal which interconnects them. N/S/E/W/UP/Down/SgrA*/...and the last near the Bubble for practical reasons.

Where is Raxxla, Mr Brookes ? Oh, it's in the MW! Meaning: 'all over the MW'.
Is Raxxla in the game, Mr Braben ? Of course, but you don't know what it is. (<--- fits with the E/F mission giver calling it 'The Myth', 'celestial body' and not specifically planet 'Raxxla'.) Meaning: 'of course, all over the game'.

And... How can the bloody Thargs hyperdict us ? Do they master 'Raxxla', the key to understand 'witchspace' ?

That fits. And that's what I call tinfoiling !
