As we’re on the subject of EDSM, I recently got the record for smallest T Tauri star.

I was more intrigued by it’s surface temperature being cooler than it currently is outside at a balmy 18.85 degrees c!

Kinda OT I know, but it was a bit of a reminder that there are some unusual bodies out there!
