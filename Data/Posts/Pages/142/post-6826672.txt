Huh? Raxxla doesn't exist in any of the official games of the Elite franchise (except for this one, of course). The games have been torn apart and datamined for decades by people looking for Raxxla; nothing has ever been found. Is this from an official Elite book?

It's probably from one of the old oral histories of Elite. Lots of people 'claimed' to have found Raxxla by doing X, Y or Z.
