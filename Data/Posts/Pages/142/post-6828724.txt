Wasn't Raxxla implemented in Oolite by more than one OXP? I don't think there is a single version of Raxxla in Oolite and, even if there is, I don't think it is part of the base game. Lots of people created lots of different mods for that game. I even had a very special (and very cheaty) modification of the Cobra Mk III with a custom paint job that could out run and out maneuver every other ship in the universe. Weapons so powerful it could shred Thargoids without blinking.

I laugh at your farsical attempt to pronounce Ooniverse!

Although I wish I knew how to spell farsical...
