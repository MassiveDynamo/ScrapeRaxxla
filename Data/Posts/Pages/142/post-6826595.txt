I think it ties into Sirius, personally. The Waypoint planet. The old way to access Raxxla used to involved flying around the Lave system, clockwise, twice and then jumping to Tionisia in no less than 7-9 jumps (back when jump ranges were very poor).


Huh? Raxxla doesn't exist in any of the official games of the Elite franchise (except for this one, of course). The games have been torn apart and datamined for decades by people looking for Raxxla; nothing has ever been found. Is this from an official Elite book?
