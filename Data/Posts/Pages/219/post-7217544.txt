I think Raxxla is going to be hidden somehow-maybe in a uss that only is detectable when you’re very close to it, so doesn’t matter how well the area is mapped. Even so I did get a couple of first discoveries this week. What I need is someone skilled in image engancement to have a look at the image from the start video (I’ll see if I’ve got an unenhanced original and add it to my last post) and find something else that can help the triangulation; even clearing up the aspect of Barnard’s Loop could help a lot. We need the search area to be narrowed down.

I'm not very good at working things out based on a picture either, but I'm fairly convinced that the view in that image from the opening is taken from somewhere inside the Pleiades. When I get the chance, I'll try looking for it, just not certain when that's going to be atm.
