As I said before I haven't found the solution, but I am pretty well convinced this is the way to get there.

This had crossed my mind some time ago. The nebula is most likely the loop, 'the path everyone takes' refers I feel to reaching Elite - and the old wheel missions, 'Obfuscated In The Outer Rim' could literally be its near or hidden on the outer rim of the loop.

Now that sector is very much totally mapped but there could be something hidden. Some tiny nebula don't show up in gal map until your on top of them.

Anyhow I'm tooling around there right now so I've just discovered another reason to stay and take in the sights.
