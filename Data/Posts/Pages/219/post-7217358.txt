This had crossed my mind some time ago. The nebula is most likely the loop, 'the path everyone takes' refers I feel to reaching Elite - and the old wheel missions, 'Obfuscated In The Outer Rim' could literally be its near or hidden on the outer rim of the loop.

Now that sector is very much totally mapped but there could be something hidden. Some tiny nebula don't show up in gal map until your on top of them.

Anyhow I'm tooling around there right now so I've just discovered another reason to stay and take in the sights.

I think Raxxla is going to be hidden somehow-maybe in a uss that only is detectable when you’re very close to it, so doesn’t matter how well the area is mapped. Even so I did get a couple of first discoveries this week. What I need is someone skilled in image engancement to have a look at the image from the start video (I’ll see if I’ve got an unenhanced original and add it to my last post) and find something else that can help the triangulation; even clearing up the aspect of Barnard’s Loop could help a lot. We need the search area to be narrowed down.
