As an Atheist, I personally associate Raxxia with the various religions versions of a "HEAVEN". and if they exist, then one has to be DEAD, in order to get there. Inso much as one cannot die but keeps spawning again and again. Gettting to Raxxia is not doable.

hmmm... OPTIONS >> CLEAR SAVE could do the trick (just saying)
