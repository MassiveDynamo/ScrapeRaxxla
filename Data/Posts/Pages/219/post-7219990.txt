Ah I see. When you get a ways out from the bubble there’s a load of interstellar dust, some is reddish, the rest is bluish; so I think the blue in the image is dust rather than blue nebulosity as in the Pleiades. I was going to ask about this since I remember the Pleiades colour was adjusted not so long ago to make it true to life & I think it was originally reddish, however has the start video changed at all?

But I started young Tyko on his training today & of course he started his journeying in the bubble. Looking at the background skybox “it” may be closer in than I thought; there’s a lot of dust around Asellus Primus area. I’m wondering if FD have been really sneaky and adjusted the size of BLoop and Witchhead to further obfuscate; it’s features A & B that are the real sticking point. I need to play around in galmap, but shoulder was hurting & dinnertime so I closed the pc down.

Yeah, I suspect, having watched the video rather than skipping it habitually, that the blue is neither nebulosity or background dust, and should not be factored in. Based on the number of stars that actually move, I'm thinking it might be meant to represent a non-fsd hyperspace movement of some sort (megaship or alien ship etc.).

Having trouble uploading to imgur right now, but was just going to highlight that brightest star just above witchhead. I believe that HAS to be Rigel (based on its proximity to the nebula). Every system I jump to right now, I select Rigel from the galmap and supercruise in that direction.

I'm also thinking that the view is from inside the bubble now.
