I'm not very good at working things out based on a picture either, but I'm fairly convinced that the view in that image from the opening is taken from somewhere inside the Pleiades. When I get the chance, I'll try looking for it, just not certain when that's going to be atm.

You can look very quickly in galmap to get a rough idea (though the star patterns are limited by some strange cut off distance, I can never find a star that I can see out the cockpit window- it drives me mad with frustration!). I took Dr Kaii’s list of all the known real life nebulae (light & dark, visible and invisible from the bubble, about 130 in total! https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=178731) and played around in galmap to see if they would suit the image. I think from memory the Pleiades is too close and gives the wrong aspect angle -BLoop and Witchhead would be side on.

Edit: I would have checked out procedural nebulae as well but couldn’t find a list.
