Yeah I used to have the Nvidia equivalent of that setup (it may even still be, I should check). Had the same issue with remembering to turn it off at the right time so it doesnt overwrite though.
I used to use Nvidia ShadowPlay. It was good software which turned into unreliable bloatware. Every update stopped it saving video & usually took me a day or so to resolve. In the end I ditched it and after trying a couple of different apps I settled on the Windows Gamebar. Already in Windows10 and pretty reliable. The only thing Iâ€™d complain about is that there seems to be limited choice over the key combinations to control it .
