Well there seems to be a whole lot of nothing going on in Seagull Nebula. No Thargoid activity that I can see. Tried my hand at seeing if Trinkets were still dropping as part of cargo loads at the Nav Beacon at Hell Port (still can't get used to there being stations, let alone fleet carriers, everywhere these days) where they had been reported, and quickly remembered how crap I am at combat. Fitted out a Krait as best as I could there, and still got shot up, down to 40% hull and no shields by a wing of two wanted competent pirate Adders before I managed to jump away, having achieved nothing other than another blow to my ego. Sold the Krait and am back in the Asp, and have a route around the back of Barnard's Loop/Horsehead Nebula into the Orion Dark Region, so am off there after a quick trip to Thor's Helmet. Hopefully we won't need to be Elite in combat (or trading) to find Raxxla. I find with combat there are two poles to the spectrum - boring tedium of easy kills in low risk zones, or quickly getting killed by taking on the next level up. If we do need it I guess I will eventually have to figure out a way to git gud, likely by the first route.
