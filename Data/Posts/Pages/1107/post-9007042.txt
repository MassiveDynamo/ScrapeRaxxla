Anyone have further information on this or got the same encrypted message?

Reddit seems to have a good grasp on it and some very relevant questions...looks like a hoax atm. In addition to Reddit qs about the voice priority etc and analysis the voice sounds nothing like the UCB ones, not in the same rhythm, pronunciation of phonetics, or voice...it sounds 'amateur'. The numbers arent read in the same way either.

Dunno why he went to all the trouble of getting that code to crack it, this website does it in 1 second without any key or text solved, just click Word Divisions - No and 'Computer Take It From Here'.

Solve an Aristocrat or Patristocrat

Then theres the 'acting' in the video, no surprise or anything even though this should be the 'proof' video on reproduction, Id be chuffed to bits I caught it on camera and it would show in my voice.

If he didnt record it the first time how the hell did he keep up with that text to get it written down and solved when he shouldn't have been ready for it at all?

So on the basis that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence....imo that evidence doesnt meet the bar yet, if someone else replicates or GalNet reports we will know, and mean Frontier have gone off the 'standard' message format and delivery methods they have used in every case so far, but so far to me, not ringing true. Good attempt though if hoax, short and sweet not full of self-gratitude and self-praise and 'worship me' that usually drives the hoaxer.

TLDR: 4/10
