I know, I was among the first members. Until I was thrown off their Discord for the crime of not being active enough (in their view), along with some other folks who had contributed quite a bit to their efforts. Another long history, which is not worth exploring, and just confirmed my distaste for player groups/factions and their internal and external politics and power grabs, and special treatment by FD. Moral of the story, trust no one, particularly if they claim to be "Independent".

PS None of us remember the details any more anyways, as FDev had us all hexedited.
I thought the independent Raxxla hunters were just a Discord.
The CoR documets are probably only those that CoR have published.
