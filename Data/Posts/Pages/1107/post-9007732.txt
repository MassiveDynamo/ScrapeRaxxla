Rarity for a Jolly Green Gas Giant. If you see one you'll know, they have luminous stripes or patterns.

They were originally a mistake in the Stellar Forge and iirc some were different colours but they removed / fixed most of them but a few green ones left in coz they are cool Apparently not one found in every Sector so far so atm the last chance to get name in Codex if you find one in a new Sector.

Theres a thread that keeps track of them but iirc something like only 30 found so far.
