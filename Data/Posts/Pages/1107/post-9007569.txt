@Jorki strange that a lot of the documents linked on that "Independent" Raxxla Hunters Discord are from the Children of Raxxla... I smell another conspiracy!

I pretty much lost my sense of smell at age 9 when a childhood “friend” threw a rock at my head!

There is some dubious stuff and folk to be found everywhere! I judge by behaviour and some of the guys there were very helpful in proving the “green glows in Sol” was a graphics glitch
