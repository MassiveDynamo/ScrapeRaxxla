The problem here is 2296 is a long damn time in the past and well before Mycoid. We know Mars Relic was small. But, no word on the size of RAXXLA. RAXXLA being found had to have left some traces as far as impacts. Also, there is the weird bit re: deadly secrets connected to The Dark Wheel organization.

Strictly speaking, if Mycoid was linked to the incurable plague of Earth post-WW III it fits timeline wise with initial discovery. It would also be a deadly secret.
