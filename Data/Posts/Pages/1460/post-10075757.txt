It vaguely looks similar to the green icon connected to the RAXXLA codex.
Stop. I had already forgotten that the Raxxla logo is green. Hmm. What color did we get the new artifact when we mixed the Guardians and Thargoids?

P.S.
For some reason it came back to the last Lara Croft movie, when the floor collapsed, she realized that the color of life is green and combined the yellow and blue crystals.
Strange, the Guardians are blue, the Thargoids are yellow...
