Excuse me, but I'm very old and can't see the connection. I would be grateful if someone could poke me in the place where it is clear how the beacons and guards bases are connected.

When you scan the orb at a guardian beacon it gives a location for a guardian structure to take the key... That is the correlation I was trying to show.
