Pardon me if my recollection is off, but if I recall the roll-out of the Guardian story, the ruins came in 2 phases, 1st the ancient ruins, then the guardian structures, and then the beacons came into the game later, so the beacons were not in game at the time of the discovery of the ruins or structures.
I remember that too. But as I understand it is not about the ruins and large buildings guards, they appeared in the game along with the lighthouses and only there can be used keys from the lighthouses.
