I am thinking another pass at timelines is in order. Given recent discussion these appear to be the most likely candidate to have discovered Raxxla:

-Federation or Founder colony (early Federation discovery scenario).
-Lakon Spaceways/Galactic Navy
-Sirius Corporation (either Sol or in/near Sirius)
-Marlin Duval
-Marlinists
-Art Tornquist or family member
-Imperial Navy
-Gutamaya (dependent on founding date)
-Augustus Brenquith/Jaques (depending on timing of Battle of Hell's Gate - candidate battle is mentioned in both Federal and Imperial Navy codexes (Jaques is lying scenario).

Dredgers appear to not be an option given Scrivener University (later absorbed by Orion University) doesn't . A quick review of the unofficial timeline of all games and books appears to indicate this may not be the first Dredger. However, earliest these are possibly built is still a disqualifier given the date is in the 2330s.

Maybe it doesn't matter why, who, or when it was first discovered. It was so long ago unless some specific record comes to light it'll be unknowable.

What's probably a more useful way of thinking about this question is - who knew about it?

From there, consider what might have been done about it: Assume it's a secret discovery, what then? Assume it's not, what then? What if it's known but unreachable, what then?

Essentially, try to reconstruct a motivation chain that makes sense of what we know.

A loose motivation chain might be something like I suggested a while back:
Raxxla is known as a distant alien 'thing', the promise of alien tech and the profit that brings. (Doesn't matter how it's known)
Humans can't reach it - yet
Long-termist thinking in corporations in early Federation invest in interstellar travel knowing that they can use the advancements made by society as a whole to reach Raxxla first. i.e. develop robust interstellar infrastructure as a 'railroad' to help you get towards your goal.
Profit.
Back then I speculated that looking at the people pushing expansion and FTL research might be important, with the assumption that the end goal is to reach Raxxla first. That means Sirius Corp is a strong contender since they've always been apolitical and invested heavily in expansion and drive technologies. There are other possibilities.

The Duval expedition to Achenar may have been just as it seemed... but it may be that Duval was trying to reach Raxxla and assembled a well-funded expedition to do it as soon as FTL was robust enough to make it possible.

I still strongly believe that Raxxla by now is obfuscated by whoever found it. I think figuring out who controls it is the way to find it, not by physically searching for it.
