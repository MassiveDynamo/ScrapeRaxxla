Excuse me, but I'm very old and can't see the connection. I would be grateful if someone could poke me in the place where it is clear how the beacons and guards bases are connected.
If by ‘ guards bases’,you are talking about the structures, they are a part of the same net work. The beacons and the structures are a communications and defense system referred to as the monolith network. It is my belief that the beacons were intended to lead you to the structures but as I remember the players discovered them in the wrong order.
There are three types of markings that we have locked down in the guardian species and one of them is a triangular language that seems to represent numbers or possibly elements. At the ruins the only place you find them is at the bottom of the relic towers. But at the structures there are tons of combinations of these triangular patterns in the transmission towers, the same combinations can be found on the wings of the beacons.
The inner arms of the beacons have markings that have turned out to be segments of structures in some kind of diagram form with the pigmentation missing.
Not all of the dogs have been connected yet because a lot of the dots were ignored for the last seven years. We are working on it.
