This is the original creation story for weapon grade Mycoid, from FFE: http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/first-e...life-on-the-frontier/inevitable-consequences/
Mycoid was originally used for recycling metals and plastics. They were controlled by an endovirus, that would shut it down after a given time. After removing the dependency of the endovirus, it stopped shutting down and could be used as a weapon against Thargoids.
Both Thargoid hardware and Thargoid physiology contains polymeres similar to plastics, making them vulnerable to the Mycoid.

How much of the original story that is still valid in ED, is unknown. My guess is that the story has been changed a bit. I think we will learn at some point, that Mycoid was originally a Guardian invention. Guardians were masters of biological warfare. The brain trees could be remnants of an old defence system. Basically an insect repellent that Guardians planted on planets they wanted Thargoid free.

The fungal infections we see on Thargoid stuff in the Pleiades, is probably remnants of the Mycoid attacks in the 3150s.

The Sohalian fewer and the Cerberus plague are virus diseases. At least the Cerberus plague was an endovirus (like the safety element of Mycoid). Both deceases were probably man made. Other than that, they have little to do with Mycoid and fungal infections.

This is the Mycoid logo from the INRA sites. It vaguely looks similar to the green icon connected to the RAXXLA codex. Perhaps a hybrid between a virus and and fungal organism. In the Ram Tah technology logs, we are revealed as being very close to the capabilities of the progressive Guardians insofar as genetic manipulation.
