Interesting! Prompted me to have a look at your site. I’ll watch through your Chronicles vids when Ive got time, but I noticed #3 seems to be missing?
Yeah, I need to fix that. The pilot should be number one. The beacons should be number two, and the update should be number three but I kept feeling like the update needed to be later in the series. I’m kind of new at this and the social media thing and attention was not something I was used to so it’s a little sloppy so far. I will try to straighten it out. SorryBut no episodes are missing. They are all on the elite dangerous playlist
