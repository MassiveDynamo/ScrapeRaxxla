Now, yes there is plenty hide but Hyperspace/Witchspace access as well as the black ops military programs stand out as the most obvious candidates for what precisely RAXXLA might be. Though, our technology being Hydrogen-based isn't really worth lying this much. You also don't lie about winning a war. You might lie if you lost. Evidence of that is scant. Something changing your species forever might be worth investing in an alternative narrative. Hmm, what could have justified all this? Motives aren't really aligned to something so damn important that people would go to so much effort to protect it. Mycoid might be it given we targeted human populations repeatedly. Infecting the galaxy with a zombie-inducing fungus would be certainly worth it. Still, this seems off given rumors of the past. We possibly made peace with aliens or wiped them out. Neither really rises to the level of obfuscation observed. Unless I am really missing something, anything worth hiding would be about us as CMDRs, what humans did, or something big happening to humans.
