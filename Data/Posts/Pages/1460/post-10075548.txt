Pelargonium genus plants (more commonly referred to as geranium but I don't believe they are true geraniums) have plastic-like cell walls and were observed wilting. My guess is some unholy mix between a mycovirus, plant virus, and possibly something geared to attack animals. Cerberus story arc had a GalNet citing the triple-structure and it was in the PDF I recently posted. I also got descriptions from FE and explicitly linked Mycoid to both Cerberus Plague and Sohalian Fever.
