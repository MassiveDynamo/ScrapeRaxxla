Haha, spot on! Yes, if we can reduce the insanity that Raxxla brings it can only be a good thing.

Technically speaking, I feel as though we're already on a wild goose chase - but when we go off on a tangent, we're on a wild goose chase chasing a wild goose chase... If that makes sense...

Nonsense!

Most of the geese here are quite tame and are willing to feed on any crumb, seed or rat pellet tossed their way!

When the geese appear hostile perhaps it is merely a natural avian reaction to your aggressive homindal waving of wings and nasty honkings!
[this is very very rude in goose]

Keep your arms to your sides and smack your beak like a chimp smacking peanut butter off its upper pallet, the geese will become accepting.
[this is goose for "do not run, I am your friend']


Then again perhaps "Goose Chase" is a clue in and of itself?
