No apology necessary. My comment wasn't meant to imply anything at all. I just wanted to weigh in so that, six months from now when someone starts reading every comment on the thread they don't hit something on an unnecessary wild goose chase.

Haha, spot on! Yes, if we can reduce the insanity that Raxxla brings it can only be a good thing.

Technically speaking, I feel as though we're already on a wild goose chase - but when we go off on a tangent, we're on a wild goose chase chasing a wild goose chase... If that makes sense...
