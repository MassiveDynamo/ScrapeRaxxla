Fair point. Fact remains all the nebulas are still in the center of the belt acting as a barrier to the third star, Epsilon Orionis.

EDSM reports 30 cmdr's who use 3rd party logging tools have been there, so there must be a way.

and its seems to have been fully scanned

for fun I'll give it a shot as soon as the current cash cow CG ends, which I expect in a few hours.

What are you flying and what's your range?

Single frames from that catscan thing can be useful to show how to get in and out of some of the interior regions without huge jump ranges.

I see it's quite low -567, shouldn't be a problem.

hum,, lookin at it in game now it's behind bernard's loop,,,
sparsity of stars down and out there maybe the bigger problem,
a little like reaching Rho Cass in the old timey-times 18 months ago
hum


edit[ with write access to eddn i toyed with adding a body to eddn wierdly orbiting the black hole for the lulz,
but I could never do that to y'all,,,,,i'll pick somewhere else]
