I assure you that it very much appears to be locked, the region of Barnards Loop, the general neighboring sectors. Try navigating from the first two stars in the belt and go to the third. And it is in the middle of Orion's Belt. Also the Col 70 sector is in close proximity to the Pleiades and the Aries Dark. A fleet, barnacles and a ref point from a probe and still you say there appears to be no sign of thargoids near BL?

He may mean there's little Thargoid presence in the accessible sectors in the area which doesn't mean the locked sectors aren't thriving with them.
There was a EDSM style map of the area but I've lost the link but here's a video of like a CAT scan of locked sectors in the region.

So as long as you avoid them BL is perfectly navigable.
