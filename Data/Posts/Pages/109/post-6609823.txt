I've been to Polaris several times in FFE. If Raxxla is there, it's well hidden within the system.
Polaris was more of a Thargoid nest with two terrestrial Ammonia worlds, back then.

If Raxxla is in Polaris, there is more to it than getting the permit.

I honestly think that Raxxla was retconned out of the series in both FE2 & FFE along with the edible poets from the original game.
