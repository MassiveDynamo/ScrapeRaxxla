It was. Bear in mind Raxxla has never been mentioned in any of the three games, and there's people who have done serious data-mining on all the old ones and there's no planet, object, system or anything called Raxxla. It's not in any of the missions or in-game journals that I could find. This site and similar ones are pretty good for info on the FE2 for example: https://www.sharoma.com/frontierverse/rumours.htm

Essentially Raxxla is only (that I'm aware of ) in TDW, and has never actually been in-game until now. The comments by MB and DB confirming it's in ED (in some way) is the first time that I'm aware of that it's ever been officially confirmed.

Of course, there's always the usual - "It might not be called Raxxla in any previous game", and since both FFE and FE2 has a few million stars then it's possible it was out there (but as what, it's impossible to know, and other than blindly stumbling over it there seems to be no path that leads there).

I'm aware that people have and do hack the code of Elite Dangerous, that's how some things have been discovered already (certain permit locked single systems in the middle of no-where for example), and how certain other things are suspected to have been found - but still, no-one's found Raxxla. That means it's almost certainly not as easy as just finding a planet named Raxxla .
In fairness, for it to be possible to do via finding a planet called Raxxla, then it would have to be known as such to UC / the PF / your ships Navcom. Which would kind of need the folks on Raxxla to have an arrangement in place with UC, etc. that the big flashing 'this is Raxxla' sign pops up if you scan the planet. Which would be a kind of odd thing for them to do.
