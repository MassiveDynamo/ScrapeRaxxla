I assure you that it very much appears to be locked, the region of Barnards Loop, the general neighboring sectors. Try navigating from the first two stars in the belt and go to the third. And it is in the middle of Orion's Belt. Also the Col 70 sector is in close proximity to the Pleiades and the Aries Dark. A fleet, barnacles and a ref point from a probe and still you say there appears to be no sign of thargoids near BL?
