That appears to be a Mod and not an official release, no? If so ... even if Raxxla made an appearance it wouldn't be official. I think someone had released an Oolite OXP that implemented Raxxla but that wouldn't count either.

Apologies - I wasn't implying that it would be lore - just that that's where the 'spectrogram' information came from, if it did.
