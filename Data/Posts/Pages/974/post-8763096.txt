Odin’s Wisdom. I find this system interesting! at ~900ly below SD it is well off the beaten track and is obviously manually named whereas all the surrounding systems are 2Mass, HIP, or stellar forge named. Why is it specifically named? I didn’t find anything special there, or in any of the other systems enroute. I went back & sold the data to TDW at Neuman Camp SD. Immediately got a mission uss, TDW wanted me to deliver 81 tons of animal meat back to them at Neuman Camp. Did so despite 4 antagonists (avoided interdiction). No other apparent “capability test”; if TDW want me to kill off the antagonists as part of the test they are going to have a long wait with my current hand problems!

Edit: oops, just checked out my travel history-I forget to visit Hel & Baldr!! Oh no!!!
"Other stars, sparsely set beneath Hydrochoüs, hang on high between Cetus in the heavens and the Fish, dim and nameless, and near them on the right hand of bright Hydrochoüs, like some sprinked drops of water lightly shed on this side and on that, other stars wheel bright-eyed though weak. But among them are borne two of more lustrous form, not far apart and yet not near: one beneath both feet of Hydrochoüs, a goodly star and bright, the other beneath the tail of dark-blue Cetus. This cluster as a whole men call The Water. But others low beneath the forefeet of the Archer, a tuned in a circled ring, go wheeling round the sky."
