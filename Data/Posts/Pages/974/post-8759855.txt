Graphics glitch by the look of it, something to do with the shadows I imagine.

Nice patterns though, I like the little dogs and the Persian & Egyptian architecture....plus the fact that you ca make shapes out of the light and the dark depedning which you focus on

But an ironic graphics glitch since its Alpha Reticuli!
Perhaps an FD Easter egg??
