Another question. Why, when looking at the EDSM codex for Inner Orion Spur > Terrestrial Planets > Ammonia Planet are there two entries first showing as Non Terraformable and the other showing as 13022 with a reported location of Jambin. I have it on my list to visit now but am 7500ly away and heading in the opposite direction.
