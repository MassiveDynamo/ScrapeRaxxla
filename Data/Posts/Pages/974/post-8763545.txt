Took your Yggdrasil route and sold carto at Neumann Camp. Then took uneventful E/F mission to Faraday Ring. No joy.

Probably another hypothesis / red herring (there must be a reason why that system was specifically named - “TDW” obfuscation??) laid to rest.

Still no sign of those old E/F missions? Maybe they crop up once you’ve gained membership?

Think my clone Tyko is going to try the carbon star+edge of space hypothesis, but firstly got lawn to aerate this morning, then washday, then grandkids this afternoon, then collapse in a heap, so tomorrow before he can start to engineer the aspX and gather jumponium..... I must have been very wicked in an earlier life!!
