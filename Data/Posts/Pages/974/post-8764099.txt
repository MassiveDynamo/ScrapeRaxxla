Cryptic Elite Instagram/Twitter posts?
Frontier has posted a couple odd images to their social media sites. Thoughts? Source: https://www.instagram.com/p/CGzgWDLAR3J/ Source: https://twitter.com/EliteDangerous/status/1320689181560025088 I didnt see a thread on this already. If there is one, please direct me to it so I can...

Theres a thread on that just for reference, theres also a Twitter & Reddit so good luck keeping up with it all. Have you got the original of the binary too I cant find it? Is the one on the thread cropped or is it full size?

Almost certainly to do with Halloween though.
