A little more info on the RA 20째 direction.

Right ascension 20째 and approximately flat in the galactic plane (Dec +35째) is the direction our solar system moves, due to galactic rotation. This direction is important in the field of dark matter research. The spiralling stars of the Milky way rotates inside a halo of dark matter. From an earth bound view point, this creates a constant wind of dark matter, that can be detected.


From earth, in ED, this is towards the Star of India. The direction of the wind in other parts of the galaxy, can be found by aligning flat in the galactic plane and having Sag. A at roughly 90째 to your right.
