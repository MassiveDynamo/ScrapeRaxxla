Ok, so to check out the Yggdrasil hypothesis I’ve been to & scanned in succession:
Bifrost, Jord
Loki Tstae, Loki Tan
Hel
Baldr
Odin’s Wisdom. I find this system interesting! at ~900ly below SD it is well off the beaten track and is obviously manually named whereas all the surrounding systems are 2Mass, HIP, or stellar forge named. Why is it specifically named? I didn’t find anything special there, or in any of the other systems enroute. I went back & sold the data to TDW at Neuman Camp SD. Immediately got a mission uss, TDW wanted me to deliver 81 tons of animal meat back to them at Neuman Camp. Did so despite 4 antagonists (avoided interdiction). No other apparent “capability test”; if TDW want me to kill off the antagonists as part of the test they are going to have a long wait with my current hand problems!

Edit: oops, just checked out my travel history-I forget to visit Hel & Baldr!! Oh no!!!
