False alert guys,it happens on all rocky bodies as far as now, but the interesting thing is it seems to happen only on the pole. I mean the point where the longitude and lattitude is close to zero. Can anyone try this out? I mean is it only me or is it a game bug everyone can experience?

So it happens at the 'top' and 'bottom' of the sphere where all the separate graphics blocks get scrunched up or meet.

Id say report it as bug, but it could become one of those things best left and people will visit it, Im gonna have a go next Rocky
Something like that seems to happen, but not as extreme in my case:
