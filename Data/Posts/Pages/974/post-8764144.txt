I know you guys love my tinfoil haha! If you split that binary in half and then swap the from to the back, then convert, you get this: �G7V

Idk what that first symbol is (I could get real tinfoil on it though) but G7V is a class of star if I’m not mistaken. 61Virginis comes up as this type of star. Not sure about others.
