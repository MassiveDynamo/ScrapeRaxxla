Ok, lets make a one thing clear, no matter where is it or who is it or when is it, Raxxla must be connected and explained by and thru codex, right ????
Meaning, when someone will find raxxla, reading in to codex will explain what codex says and somehow both will be connected. What I'm trying to say is, codex can't lie, right ?
Of course it can. Itâ€™s provided by the Pilots Federation.
