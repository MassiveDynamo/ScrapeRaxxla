I suspect they’re a graphics artefact relating to the Coronal Mass Ejection animations we see, since they have the same colour as the system star(s).

Mmmm, I was going to say that the one thing I am now convinced of is that they aren’t anything to do with Raxxla, because they exist in many systems and we know from MB that Raxxla is in a definite place. However he didnt actually say that; I’ve just checked back to my FD quotes thread and he said of Raxxla:
“It’s something in the game world (not text) and very hard to find”
“It’s not a random thing”
“Anyone can find it and more than once”

To me these statements implied Raxxla is a single instance of something and that it’s in a single place. However on rereading they , at a stretch, apply to these artefacts! They hard to find ( they aren’t in every system, and you have to wait up to 10 minutes for them to appear & then they fade out, cyclicly), they are not text, they are in a definite place (the system map), anyone can find them, and more than once!

Though I’d say again I’d be very disappointed if so!!

Edit: but I havent checked recently to see if they’re still occurring in-game!! have you checked mate?

Haven’t checked lately, but I would be surpriced If they are gone.
You don’t have to be in the system to check. If you have the sysmap, they show up.
