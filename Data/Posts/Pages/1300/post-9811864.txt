Well, I'm not sure.
But the FC and single jump range thing still stand, as jump range couldn't be increased until Horizons (that said, I don't remember when neutron & WC boosts became a thing).
Fair enough! And agreed on the jump range stuff. I was just wondering if you knew the source for the in game since gamma thing!
