I'm near an unregistered beacon orbiting Lave 2. It seems... the beacons are broken/switched off, and nothing else is transmitting indeed, we need to somehow persuade the FD wizards to check if Raxxla is working, otherwise maybe we are trying in vain. And the meeting does not take place because some script does not work
How long have you sat and listened to the beacon for?
