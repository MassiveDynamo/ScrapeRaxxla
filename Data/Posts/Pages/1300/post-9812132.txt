However, the "green CME hypothesis" could be refined, e.g.
1) You have to wait until 6 green CMEs appear simultaneously
2) You have to find a star with a surface temperature matching the Raxxla green from the Raxxla symbol
(Just joking)
Ha ha, like it. A sense of humour is an essential requisite for partaking in the Quest for Raxxla! Together with a deep cache of valium and an even deeper cache of Lavian Brandy!

Unfortunately I’m on a diet and off brandy for a while

But I seem to remember a green star is impossible, though I can’t remember the physics behind that.
Mmm, unless perhaps it’s an Exotic star? Seem to remember quarks have Colour!

Edit: yep, just checked. quarks can have red, blue or green colour! https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge
Mystery solved! raxxla is a green quark star! Now just got to find it!
