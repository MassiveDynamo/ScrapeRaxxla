they are in a definite place (the system map), anyone can find them, and more than once!
Your second statement relies upon logic that defies you first statement, your first statement relies upon flawed usage of the English language as you cannot find something twice that has not moved since your last finding of it, thus if it is in a single place as your first statement claims then once it has been found it cannot be found again...

It is not in a single location, Arf is welcome to arrange to have Braben confirm and check what is actually known, as ofc neither Arf nor the other Fdev staff outside of very senior roles would even know themselves what it is.
