Just another nights read of the codex regarding the Dark wheel station, I believe we are looking for a Nostrum type station built by the Merritt group, there was one type of this station built to compete with Brewer corps orbis but at a much lower cost, The codex entry for brewer corp entails an issue where its main ring failed, this would suggest it is a ringed station unlike other industrial stations, it only suggest that it had failed, it doesn't go on to say that it was completely destroyed.

The location Tau Ceti is interesting, now it doesn't have a gas giant let alone the 8th moon of one however this damaged starport may have been moved, is this a brief clue on the search area? this is the only ingame entry apart from the Dark wheel codex that describes a different type of station to what we see usually
