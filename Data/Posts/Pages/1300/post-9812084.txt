As for the graphics glitches in the system map, as of Yesterday they were still there (in Alpha Cygni and Horizons, at least).
I had two glitches, one usually as a point, the other one more like the pictures, but sometimes both look complicated, one is white, they other more grey.
They grow when a CME (Coronal Mass Ejection) at the star grows and they fade with it.
They disappear when leaving the system map and returning to it.
So the system map is clean when opening it and over time some information from the CMEs spills over to the map and gets projected to a small region.
Therefore, I agree: Probably a graphics glitch related to CMEs.

As for CMEs having the same colour as the star, there might be exceptions, at least by visual appearance due to lighting.
I encountered a greenish CME in HIP 35102 that looked so weird that I had to take a screenshot - although by the time I found the button it was almost gone.

Oh, ah, new hypothesis:
Raxxla could be a green CME that is very rare and/or could be triggered by a specific chain of events.
And when you fly through such a green CME you can, eh, supercharge your FSD to 100.000 LYs - and after such a jump the FSD is toast?

Edit: Went back there, it's HIP 35102 C, actually. Got a better picture. Flew through a few of these greenish CMEs. Nothing happened.
And they probably appear greenish, because the surface temperature of the star is 5700 K.
