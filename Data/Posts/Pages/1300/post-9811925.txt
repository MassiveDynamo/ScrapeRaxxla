One way of finding raxxla may be to analyze the system coordinates. Particularly per star type and cross star types. That thargoid map seems to show certain star types. And being able to analyze via system coordinates may let you find anamolies faster than exploration. If there are patterns in the stars you could then show positive or negative information must faster. The coordinates may be the fastest way to analyse the galaxy. And it's all available on the map. I would look for patterns in the placements. It's technically the fastest way to analyse anything in this game. Might even lead to other interesting information.
