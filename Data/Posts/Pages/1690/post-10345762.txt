The reference to Satan creating his version of heaven, marries with Milton’s conception of hell, in the it was a perverted version of heaven.

It might make sense of why in game, the Lost Realms are in the Underworld.

Technically the concept of a punitive hell is relatively Christian, most other faiths it was a mixture, collectively they all seemed to share this concept of an ‘Otherworld’.

Robert Holstock in his book Lost Realms, draws upon this and provides the analysis that these realms were examples of an Eden…

This might make sense of why in game the Lost Realms are in the Underworld, but I couldn’t understand why there was so much detail in game to form an Empyrean; or hint at a Miltonian model.

Brookes description of his books plot, follows the above description from the artist, that the universe was created not by god, but something older…so if Brookes was marrying various mythos this ‘mirroring’ makes sense..

This is what I saw in the Lost Realms - in game, a sort of mirror image of the heavens…

At first I thought Raxxla might logically be in the Lost Realms, hidden in the middle of other Edens… maybe it is? But then I began to see this weird mirroring.. I couldn’t explain it until now.

I do believe more and more Brookes embedded his book template into game.

Given your research, it may be beneficial to read Michael Brookes' "Paradise Lost - The greatest story ever told" from his website. This additionally fits very nicely with Gnostic Cosmology. The early monotheistic movements had concepts called the Monad, Aeons, and Demiurge.
