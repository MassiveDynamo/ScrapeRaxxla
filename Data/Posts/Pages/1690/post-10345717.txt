So, we actually have an explanation for the Brookes tattoo. Wow. That is awesome. That said, would get too hung up on dualism. I say this because my reading of Holdstock and Brookes showes an emphasis on non-duality. Example, Kore/Persephone is both goddess of spring and a Chthonic deity. Gaea is similarly a universal mother and destroyer. Michael Brookes wrote a trilogy called The Third Path. This third path is reiterated in-game with the Alliance which attempts to balance the best and worst of it sibling superpowers.

In truth, from a RP-perspective, I feel almost like Lucifer here. As many of you are aware, my character goes by the nickname "Morningstar". This was actually a homage to being the community's angel and devil. You cannot appreciate the light without darkness. Even my recent initiative PAX INTER ASTRA sounds a whole lot like INRA (albeit a more ethically-inclined version).

This is why I ultimately became an advocate of the idea that The Dark Wheel and The Club are one and the same. In other words, balancing between extremes is the key.
