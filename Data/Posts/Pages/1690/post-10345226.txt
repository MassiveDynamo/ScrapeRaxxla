Could be a coincidence or not, but the proposed hexagon systems all seem fairly close to the borders of their respective regions: Demeter (W) on Herculis Sector, Eulexia (S) on Shudun Sector, Nefertem (E) on Yin Sector and Siren (N) on Tascheter Sector.

This does make Demeter an outlier, though, as its sector doesn't have an ancient star name but a constellation one.
