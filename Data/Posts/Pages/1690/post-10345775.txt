Super cool that the "Whisperers in withspace" have been found along with the "Sirens Call".
-images in witchspace and the signal respectively.

"Jewel on the brow" is not something i have seen a verified argument for so far.
Deciphering the clues are needed to proceed along a solid path.

"More clues and it would be a spoiler" tells me we have already been presented with the needed items to solve the riddle.
