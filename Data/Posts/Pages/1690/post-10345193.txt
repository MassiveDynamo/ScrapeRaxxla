Based off my extrapolation I calculated the hexagons centroids closest system to be Albina, again please note how it like the other points aligns upon the same y/z plain!

In Greek mythology Albina was exiled to a mysterious uninhabited island, after attempting to murder her husband.

She and her sisters were then seduced by a demon and later they gave birth to a race of giants.

In game I suspect this is likely an intentional link towards the system Jotnar and this Norse myth concept of a land of giants, who lived in an ‘Otherworld’ and held knowledge beyond mans understanding.

This likewise I believe ties into various Celtic systems in that same relative area, linked to the mythology of the Tuatha Dé Danann, a mythic race, who lived in an Otherworld, and possessed secret knowledge!

Or it could be a reference to the Etruscan ‘White Goddess’ or Saint Albina the goddess of the dawn and protector of ill-fated lovers!

It’s shown below as the centre star in yellow.

Another in this area is Aeolus, likewise aligned upon the same y/z plain, shown below in green (top centre).

Aeolus was the ruler of the winds who gave Odysseus a bag with all the winds, except the West wind; he lived on a mythical, idyllic island paradise, a floating island called Aeolia (not in game).

Oh of our se - doh, Yoruba is fight next to Aeolus!

I don’t think this is a coincidence anymore…
