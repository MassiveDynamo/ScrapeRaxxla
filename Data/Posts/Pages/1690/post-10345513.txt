I remembered Beyond - Chapter Four - Exploration Reveal18Oct2018 : @1:29:58 Adam Bourke-Waite (Senior Designer) said “that thing we haven’t shown” (Raxxla codex entry) “there’s elements of that that are probably my favourite parts of this”... .

I suspect that when/if we find Raxxla the graphics sequence will be amazing.

Do we have a breakdown on exactly ‘what’ Adam Bourke-Waite (Senior Designer) helped build? Eg graphics etc or was it wide ranging?

I’ve always liked that Dev video segment, it’s a really positive aspect to the quest, it shows how Devs felt about it.

Given Arthurs later comments I do wonder if it’s something graphical or momentous as with the outcome from the Mealstroms?

“It’s there. Clearly it’s there. I’ve said this in another stream, I’ll say it today, it’s been going a longtime. The payoff would have to be great, and that’s all I will say on it”.

Arthur used a series of words in reputation during that interview which marry to his description of the then new narrative… payoff - huge etc which always made me wonder if it could be some type of graphical showstopper?

I feel some love was put into it.
