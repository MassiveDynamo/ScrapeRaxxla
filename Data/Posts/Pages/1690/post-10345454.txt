The Greek wind gods are all in-game so why not stick with them? Why is East contentious?
Boreas (North) (2.9375 / 64.96875 / -7.65625)
Zephyrus (West) (-21.84375 / 12.59375 / -60.75)

Eurus (East) (26.09375 / -39.09375 / -45.75)
That’s true, now edited.

I only say contentious because my research indicates that East had at least two names historically, and both are in game. I’m just trying to inject a little doubt to my data, I’m trying not to get too biased about it.

I want Cmdrs to challenge it, by doing so it either identifies its potentially wrong, or it corroborates it. O7
