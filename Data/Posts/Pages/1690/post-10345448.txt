Here is a quick image of the Morrigan’s / hypothetical hexagon location I’ve mapped, this time with the Greek wind compass overlaid.

Before we get into what is up/down etc, first lets us acknowledge where this Greek compass resides… it’s technically in this same location, I think this is intentional.

East is a little contentious in my opinion, but there is a system very far down below the Lost Realms, right by the first leg of the Brookes Tour by Michel, it’s an Egyptian deity that denotes the protector of the East gate…this when seen in comparison with the Greek compass - I feel is technically in the correct location for East which aligns with the Greek compass (green).

I’ve always said, I think it’s likely in the North Western side of the wall of heaven, but I’m open to it being also the West… but the relatively small area would mean any such direction is getting rather precise..

I think the West of the wall or the brow is somewhere between Jotnar and Fall… the west wind resides in this locals does who kept the west wind.

If memory is correct Satan fell from a fissure or breach in the most northern aspect of the North wall, so Fall is to the North, this aligns with the Greek compass.

The deity Chaos said that the pendant globe was not too far off from whence he and his troop first fell…

So it’s possible to be on the northern aspect of the west wall, where the gate is… The Empyrean is also described as being both circular and square, so there may not be any clear angle to separate them?

The Greek wind gods are all in-game so why not stick with them? Why is East contentious?
