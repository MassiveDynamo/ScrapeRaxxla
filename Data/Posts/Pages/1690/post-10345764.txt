Given your research, it may be beneficial to read Michael Brookes' "Paradise Lost - The greatest story ever told" from his website. This additionally fits very nicely with Gnostic Cosmology. The early monotheistic movements had concepts called the Monad, Aeons, and Demiurge.
I’m well aware of Brookes blog, been following it for a very long time O7. This is probably true, but I try not to overthink this (?!!) and follow the data as much as I can. I think Brookes mixed his sources creatively - which is great but it leaves it open to interpretation if you don’t give an explanation of the exact source material.. normally that would get explained through reading the full work… of course we don’t have that luxury… as I suspect FD might have axed the original narrative, so all we have is this architecture…but no plan on it’s finished design… maybe that’s what Raxxla is, what if it is a state of cosmic enlightenment which explains this cosmology?

One potential short-cut answer might probably be - Guardians made humans, but the Thargoids were really here first, and the Guardians were just interlopers / false gods…that basically follows Brooks unwritten book plot… maybe Raxxla is just that proof?

That follows Ram Tahs interpretation of the Guardian archives,,,

Take note it’s also basically implied via certain sources, that FD may have diverted from an original narrative, then maybe simplified it… Raxxla might just be the ‘original’ more complex origin of a story we are already (now) aware of…the template Brookes wrote?
