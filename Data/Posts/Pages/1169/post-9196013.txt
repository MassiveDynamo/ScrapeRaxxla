Typical of the backward icon worshiping sect that claim to be Far God believers! They believe the Thargoid Queen is the Far God ... far from it! The TRUE believers in the Far God know that it is a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face is a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind ! And it is trapped in the space "inbetween" .... waiting for us to release it.
Time to put CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN into operation? MB is a big fan of the Far God you describe after all... He who shall not be named.
