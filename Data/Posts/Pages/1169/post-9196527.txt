i'm 88 jumps from the BETWEEN system. Taxi? : D

unfortunately, Utopia has a standing mission to explore and guard against bovomit in the event that AI invasion forces will originate from within.

it is Utopia's belief that bovomit is where the exiled AI went. it is these forces that created the formadine rift myth, and that they will some day decide to extinguish mankind and that is why the pilot's federation has locked the entire sector. we wish to make first contact to avoid that fate, or if unavoidable, send advanced warning and preemptively jump in the attack any c&c locations
