Axis Mundi is a nice system name. I have never found any use for it, when trying to establish an axis.
Now I see that it is pretty close to anti Lave. I like that.
Strange they would give an empty system a non-catalog and non-procedural name like that (and a new name not from the old games) and not have it relate to something. So many missed opportunities in the cosmology and narrative.
