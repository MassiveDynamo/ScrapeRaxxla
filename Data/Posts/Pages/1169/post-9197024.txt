unfortunately, Utopia has a standing mission to explore and guard against bovomit in the event that AI invasion forces will originate from within.

it is Utopia's belief that bovomit is where the exiled AI went. it is these forces that created the formadine rift myth, and that they will some day decide to extinguish mankind and that is why the pilot's federation has locked the entire sector. we wish to make first contact to avoid that fate, or if unavoidable, send advanced warning and preemptively jump in the attack any c&c locations
Wait... you work for Pranav Antal? The guy who wants to digitize human consciousness and transcend our physical selves....? Utopia is basically like the Guardian version of the Far God cult ... they had an issue with Guardians "ascending to a digital consciousness" too. Sounds more like he would be in league with Guardian AI as they are probably the key to doing that. I doubt you were really sent there to protect humanity from an AI invasion - more likely Antal wants to work out a deal with them and act as a fifth column.
