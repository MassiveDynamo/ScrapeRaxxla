Hello people.

Any important news about Raxxla?
I am on my way to the heart of SMAIDAU systems.

According to my research, what I am doing is making a straight line from reort to twice the distance in a straight line through the BETWEEN solar system.

This points exactly to the SMAIDAU systems and in the first foray I made, I found by analyzing the results that the closer I was to the heart of the SMAIDAU systems the more earth-type planets there were.

These systems are at the end of the galactic arm and throughout the journey through the formidine rift I found no living system except there.

To all this, I was also amazed at how there was no system discovered by other commanders, these were virgins.

You can read the results and follow-up of my exploration here:

Greetings commanders, I am Carlos Sagan, one more explorer after the search for raxxla. I speak Catalan and I am not very good at English, so excuse me if the translation is not 100% correct. I learned, after finishing reviewing the results of my last scan for raxxla, a difference from others...

I wanted the fleet carrier to go back there, but right now I'm tired of waiting

So I'm on my way with my Anaconda.
