I found this system called Axis Mundi (meaning axis of the world or also refered to as the navel of the world). Now I came across this system and I couldn't help wondering, is there a connection to Raxxla? I searched the whole system with FSS and found nothing. The system only has 2 suns in it. So I wondered why have an empty system with a fancy name that isn't a real system? Why not a random name and why call it that? I might be going full tin foil hat here but on Raxxla there is this thing called the Omphalos Rift, Omphalos means navel. See the connection?

Nice! Hadnt realized we had an Axis Mundi system

Hmm - I wonder if it might actually be centred or equidistant between the pole stars? (Polaris and Polaris Australis aka Sigma Octantis) Or two other stars that might be worth checking out as part of a cosmological Axis Mundi and somehow related to the Omphalos and/or Raxxla??
It does not appear to line up with the earths poles or the Sol system ecliptic Poles. It is down in empire space near asphodel, persephone, summerland, giltine.... not to far from achenar. hmmmmmm
