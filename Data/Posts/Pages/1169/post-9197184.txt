Wait... you work for Pranav Antal? The guy who wants to digitize human consciousness and transcend our physical selves....? Utopia is basically like the Guardian version of the Far God cult ... they had an issue with Guardians "ascending to a digital consciousness" too. Sounds more like he would be in league with Guardian AI as they are probably the key to doing that. I doubt you were really sent there to protect humanity from an AI invasion - more likely Antal wants to work out a deal with them and act as a fifth column.

Those are quite troubling accusations....where about did you say you were currently?
