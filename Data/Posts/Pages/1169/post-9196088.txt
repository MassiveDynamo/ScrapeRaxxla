Delphi fails on numerous counts (being central reference point for deduction of Raxxla location):
-Fails on the fact that anything that remotely ties it to the codex was changed or added much later. Even the original system name was not Delphi until December 11th, 3304 - it was Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55. The Raxxla myth likely started mid-21st century or early 22nd century to be relatively widespread by the time Taylor Colony in Tau Ceti was self-sufficient (2159).
I think Delfi has some merit - Assuming the raxxla myth has been an ongoing project by the Club that they havent solved. Maybe they determined that Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 was important in some way to it. It is located within the Pleiades...lots of mythology ties there. It is also very close to Merope (of dubious and questionable meaning) - one of the ends of the Thargoid Axis. I also suspect the Donars Oak settlement is a hint at the sacred trees... the so called barnacles that are found in nebula like the Pleiades.. which the Thargoids tend to...
