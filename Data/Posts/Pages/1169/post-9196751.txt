I think Delfi has some merit - Assuming the raxxla myth has been an ongoing project by the Club that they havent solved. Maybe they determined that Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 was important in some way to it. It is located within the Pleiades...lots of mythology ties there. It is also very close to Merope (of dubious and questionable meaning) - one of the ends of the Thargoid Axis. I also suspect the Donars Oak settlement is a hint at the sacred trees... the so called barnacles that are found in nebula like the Pleiades.. which the Thargoids tend to...
The lessons and story are important .. just not directly insofar as using the system to deduce Raxxla's location.
