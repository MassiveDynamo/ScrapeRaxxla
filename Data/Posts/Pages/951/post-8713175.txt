I've often thought that the invite comes to the first person who fills the codex completely.

But the Codex didnâ€™t exist until recently, so FD would have had to change the mechanism to achieve Raxxla from the mechanism implemented since the gamma release. Far more likely the Codex is just a way to provide us a few unhelpful clues but mainly to normalise the lore which was previously stated in books external to the game (which some people objected to), and most of which have been retconned.
