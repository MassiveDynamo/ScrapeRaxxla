I don’t know if it has anything to do with Raxxla but At HIP 2296 which is also the only numbers mentioned in the codex about Raxxla..hence 2296. I found some planets and anomalies with the metallic crystals around the 8th planet of a gas giant of all places. But the biggest thing to stand out is that the planets were discovered by real commanders exploring but were first scanned my Mic Turner who’s supposed to be dead since the game went live. I’ve been hunting all surrounding systems for more bodies scanned by Mic Turner but haven’t found any yet. The second big thing I thought about when I seen the name was the unknown pilot somebody sent out in the lore, can’t remember if it even has anything to do with anything. Have to dig deeper into it.
May be a irl commander using Mic Turner or may be a lead
