So is this personal journey to become an FD employee?

Ah, you mean infiltrate The Club leadership to get inside information! I like it, but Iâ€™m no software developer, and happily enjoying my retirement. Maybe one of the young whippersnappers here wants to try it?

edit: of course if you're found out expect to be fed to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal!
