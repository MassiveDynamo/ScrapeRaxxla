But the Codex didnâ€™t exist until recently, so FD would have had to change the mechanism to achieve Raxxla from the mechanism implemented since the gamma release. Far more likely the Codex is just a way to provide us a few unhelpful clues but mainly to normalise the lore which was previously stated in books external to the game (which some people objected to), and most of which have been retconned.
An interesting side not is that when the Codex came out, it was empty for everyone. Even for Commanders that had seen it all, before. This tells me that FD has never had much track on what we do at all and that there probably isn't any huge hidden database on each commander.
Pre codex, it was just the stat page on the Right-panel. Now it is the codex.

The only real gate that was present at launch and applicable to the Dark Wheel was the Founders permit. That permit would give access to do missions for the Dark Wheel faction. It does not have to be more complex than that. If you are allied when you find the station, you get invited. If not, you are not welcome.
