Oswald....did you see the programme on UK tv a while ago where they had a former detective team go over the facts of the JFK assassination (as known) & available video recordings. Seem to remember their conclusion was that the bullet that killed Kennedy did not come from Oswaldâ€™s gun; it came from the wrong direction (& maybe wrong calibre?

No but i saw the on on Ch4 a few years ago where they had a 'sharpshooter' or 'marksman' ranked (Ranger trained and same as Oswald anyway) guy, using the same bolt action rifle, fire and reload it 3 times in 5.4s (way below the 7s thats supposedly impossible) so that put paid to that bit. He said that was a basic qualification for the rank.

Then they got him up a crane thing and put him 5 stories up, put the car in the same vector and position, 'people' in the car were those CSI gel dummy things designed to act like human tissue, and he did it again. This time one of the bullets (the 2nd in Z film), hit in exactly the same place and caused exactly the same 'explosion' shown in the video. the same reaction from the 'body' in the same direction, nobody expected it. All captured on film. So that solved that. Conspiracies are fun but facts are facts.

Oh, and the guy who was a sharpshooter? He was trained at same time as Oswald and was now in his 60s 5.4s for 3 shots in his 60s
