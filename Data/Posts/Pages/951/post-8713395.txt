There is a Commander Mic Turner, in the game. It could of course be one of FD's acted characters, but most likely it's just a player.

Its flipping annoying they didn't lock some lore names off from Cmdr use.....recently saw the KS pledge Â£1500 and get 'Jameson' in your name, I can see both sides but it has made me think theres something where there isn't before.

This tells me that FD has never had much track on what we do at all and that there probably isn't any huge hidden database on each commander.

Why am I disappointed by that when in any other setting Id be appalled if they did? Frontier dont mass surveillance us and we are like 'Why not!?'
