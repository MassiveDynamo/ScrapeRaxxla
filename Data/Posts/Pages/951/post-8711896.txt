sheeh, I even tried flying to mars and see if I could see the famous "Face on mars" should be in the coast region Acidalia Planita > Cydonia Mesa [+40.75 N,+9.46 W long].
I don't think we can see that level of detail from orbit.

Then I took a flight to Peresephone a 2G heavy planetoid (Planet X I guess, the missing 10th planet) In the system map > planet view, if you squint hard, and get intoxicated with a cargo hold full of contraband, it looks like letters in the northern hemisphere.
I wanted to have a look from my cockpit, but I counldn't make heads or tails due to orientation issues
Got som lovel materials, but then got blown up when I went to defend the installation there. Soo can't be bothered to fly back out there.
Anyway I got a hold of the greek version of the odyssey so I'll get that up, and check out the likely candidates (systems, planets, factions) and get that on the board in a few days.
