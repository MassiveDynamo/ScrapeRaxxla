This may be something to go on. The Pleiades is pretty close to COL 70, Horsehead, Bernard's Loop, etc. which includes a large number of permit locked systems. We've often speculated over the possibility of Raxxla being permit locked. Horsehead and Bernard's loop, as nebulae, would go a long way toward obfuscating something in the "outer loop" of the Orion Spur.

Interesting. And Much like pilots today headed to obvious stellar phenomena I expect the same has always been true. It might be worth considering well known stars and things in the local area - even if Raxxla isn't located in one of those systems it's possible it was found while heading to something 'a little bit obvious'.

As you say, something like Barnard's Loop is almost literally a big bullseye that's maybe not too far from human space to reach even in the 2800s, and I can well imagine that it would have been one of the things the earliest explorers wanted to see up close.
