Ok, so technically what you've discovered is lore on the state of some public knowledge more than 100 years into the use of the type 2b. They're describing themselves as one of the early expeditions out into the black. An early expedition 1,000 years after the use of hyperspace started?

I don't doubt they think they are one of the early expeditions out into the black. But it completely stretches credibility that they are.

Knowledge of expeditions has been lost or was never public knowledge in the first place - if not, the routes & destinations of all the generation ships would be known.

Personally I think what we're seeing here is more evidence of the loss of knowledge.

We know type 1 hyperdrive tech was somehow lost in the collapse of Galcop. If something which would have been so fundamental to the running of the galaxy could have been lost, than it's almost certain that knowledge of many other things would have been lost too.

We are building a library of actual lore references giving times, dates, distances and descriptions of exploration/travel journeys prior to FSD. We have at least some data now covering a period from 2800 to only 30 years ago - this is all valuable information, and we're moving away from having to make up stories about how far people could travel, because now we're finding more and more hard info on how far people actually did travel
