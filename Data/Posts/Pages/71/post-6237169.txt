I'm not sure how accurate this is (I don't yet have the EERPG, but my understanding is that information contained in it is Lore, as it counts as one of the novels: https://daftworks.co.uk/eliterpg/index.php/Landing_Pad).

While researching something else I came across this:

"Between the 2810's and 2840's, GalCop documents a significant number of ship disappearances in its space and near the Pleiades Nebula. Investigations find no evidence of foul-play, but the disappearances and other strange phenomena continue intermittently, stoking anxiety among pilots." Source is reported as the EERPG manual.

Didn't Salome say that Raxxla was discovered around 2814 or something?

The above info comes from the same source as the info that Drew had, the writers guide for the novels. while I realise it's a big galaxy and just because something happens in one place in the 2810's it doesn't mean anything else happens there - however, thought it was interesting to pass on since it's the only thing I've found that has that sort of date in there.

It's interesting for a few reasons - Galcop space is basically the opposite end of the bubble to the Pleiades - so that's an area of space as large as our current extended bubble, way back in 2800.

It also implies that (a "significant number" of) people were exploring the Pleiades in the 2800's as Thatchinho has been saying for a while. This is the only reference I've found so far in Lore that explicitly states exploring wayyyyy outside the bubble as early as this.
