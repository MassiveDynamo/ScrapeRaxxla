We've often speculated over the possibility of Raxxla being permit locked.

Hmm but aren't permits issued by the Pilots Federation?

I mean the proper bureaucratic pilots Fed, not the "shadowy super-elite who control Raxxla", so even if the RaxElite could make the Pilots Fed issue a permit, it's marking that system as something special. Presumably (in lore) there must be people in the Pilots Fed who can visit permit locked systems, just not us lowly normal CMDR Elites.

It seems a bit counter-intuitive of the RaxElite, assuming they exist and do not exert absolute control over the entire Pilots Fed, to do that.

I'd see it as the CIA telling the USA government to mark Area 51 as off-limits. Ok you restrict people generally going there, but it's existence leaks out, and there must be personal being involved in running it who aren't CIA specially.
Better to hide something you really want hidden by not getting bureaucrats involved.
