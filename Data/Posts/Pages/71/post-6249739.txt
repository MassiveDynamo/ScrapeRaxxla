FINALLY I've discovered an in-game Lore reference to hyperdrive travel in the past and what was considered "far" by long-range explorers - and it's dated! This data might help to figure out where Raxxla could be, given that (if some theories are correct) it must have been possible to reach hundreds of years ago.

660ly was considered immensely far out only 30 years ago, possibly further than anyone travelled before (in recorded history) - from Sol, the planet where this camp was found (Wregoe VK-E c12-0) is 669 ly away. https://canonn.science/codex/columbus-expedition-camp-14/ It gives us an idea of what "normal people" considered extremely far.

Here's the logs:











































As you can see here, they feel that they are extremely far out, and maybe the first out that far - which obviously may or may not be true, but also look at the date, they spend 4 years on that planet growing new food, mining resources to refuel and make repairs before heading out - and they suggest this isn't extraordinary, they've done it before (although presumably only a few weeks or months), it's what they planned to do. This is obviously in the era of the slow 2b hyperdrive, but we can see here that there's been no documented human expeditions out this far 30 years ago - AND they feel they are filling in data as they go, implying that even any probes that went before clearly didn't do very much in the way of mapping. They also suggest they are going to maybe terraform a planet or something, they mention not coming back and taking seeds with them.


Therefore the following lore references can help us to understand the scope of what we might consider "human travel" prior to FSD:

- References in 2810 to explorers going missing in the Pleiades (380ly from Sol) (Quirium Drive/Pre-Quirium Drive?)
- Jameson in a Cobra reached (near) the Pleiades in 3151 (Quirium Drive)
- Peregrina (200ly from Sol) is outside human space in 3275, but reachable by an average pilot in a customised singleship. (Class 2b)
- The columbus Expedition passes 669ly from Sol in 3273 - official and well equipped expedition, designed for long-range. (Class 2b)
- The Dynasty Expeditions used experimental technology to reach 12,000ly in 3275 (Class 2b - supported by experimental tech)
- Rebecca in Premonition has visited the Rift in a heavily modified vintage Cobra, (unknown modifications and drive system)

Ok, so technically what you've discovered is lore on the state of some public knowledge more than 100 years into the use of the type 2b. They're describing themselves as one of the early expeditions out into the black. An early expedition 1,000 years after the use of hyperspace started?

I don't doubt they think they are one of the early expeditions out into the black. But it completely stretches credibility that they are.

Knowledge of expeditions has been lost or was never public knowledge in the first place - if not, the routes & destinations of all the generation ships would be known.

Personally I think what we're seeing here is more evidence of the loss of knowledge.

We know type 1 hyperdrive tech was somehow lost in the collapse of Galcop. If something which would have been so fundamental to the running of the galaxy could have been lost, than it's almost certain that knowledge of many other things would have been lost too.
