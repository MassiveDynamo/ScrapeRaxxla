In-Game reference to how far is far prior to FSD travel

FINALLY I've discovered an in-game Lore reference to hyperdrive travel in the past and what was considered "far" by long-range explorers - and it's dated! This data might help to figure out where Raxxla could be, given that (if some theories are correct) it must have been possible to reach hundreds of years ago.

660ly was considered immensely far out only 30 years ago, possibly further than anyone travelled before (in recorded history) - from Sol, the planet where this camp was found (Wregoe VK-E c12-0) is 669 ly away. https://canonn.science/codex/columbus-expedition-camp-14/ It gives us an idea of what "normal people" considered extremely far.

Here's the logs:
SPOILER











































As you can see here, they feel that they are extremely far out, and maybe the first out that far - which obviously may or may not be true, but also look at the date, they spend 4 years on that planet growing new food, mining resources to refuel and make repairs before heading out - and they suggest this isn't extraordinary, they've done it before (although presumably only a few weeks or months), it's what they planned to do. This is obviously in the era of the slow 2b hyperdrive, but we can see here that there's been no documented human expeditions out this far 30 years ago - AND they feel they are filling in data as they go, implying that even any probes that went before clearly didn't do very much in the way of mapping. They also suggest they are going to maybe terraform a planet or something, they mention not coming back and taking seeds with them.

"In the years to come, I’m sure explorers will be able to jump larger distances and see things we can only dream of. I’m sure they will make discoveries that we can’t possibly imagine and travel to the furthest reaches of our galaxy. But these early expeditions into the black will be remembered as a significant step in humanity’s journey out into the stars."

Therefore the following lore references can help us to understand the scope of what we might consider "human travel" prior to FSD:

- References in 2810 to explorers going missing in the Pleiades (380ly from Sol) (Quirium Drive/Pre-Quirium Drive?)
- Jameson in a Cobra reached (near) the Pleiades in 3151 (Quirium Drive)
- Peregrina (200ly from Sol) is outside human space in 3275, but reachable by an average pilot in a customised singleship. (Class 2b)
- The columbus Expedition passes 669ly from Sol in 3273 - official and well equipped expedition, designed for long-range. (Class 2b)
- The Dynasty Expeditions used experimental technology to reach 12,000ly in 3275 (Class 2b - supported by experimental tech)
- Rebecca in Premonition has visited the Rift in a heavily modified vintage Cobra, (unknown modifications and drive system)
