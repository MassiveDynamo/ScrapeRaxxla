FWIW MB recently acquired an early original Paradise Lost edition and has been collecting various other modern editions. He plans to transcribe the original and illustrate it using one of those copyright-violating "art"-generating "AI" thingamabobs [Aren't they banned? I guess because they aren't real AIs they don't need to be banned yet, violating artists' and photographers' IP and copyright is OK, right? Right? eds.] More info here: https://paradiselostaiedition.blogspot.com/

Of course he also is obsessed with the Sleeper of R'lyeh, Him Who Is Not to be Named, and their many friends, as well as big swords, big axes, and 40K among other things so clues to Raxxla (or perhaps even Raxxla itself) could be hidden anywhere there really. Or not.

He likes beer too - has anyone tried following a path of systems and stations named after pubs, beers or famous brewers?
