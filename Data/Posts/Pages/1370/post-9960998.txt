Anyone recall any Sonnets in Astrophil and Stella that would be considered Sidney's "Utopian" view cause I know he makes out that Stella is some Utopian type of person off and on.

Edit Update: Maybe the "Place that is also not a place, A Door that is also a Key"

The more I think about it these are descriptions that may have been overlooked for a long time. First part would describe the word Utopia, and the 2nd part which I have never thought of since I was a kid but I remember a Book would be described as a Door so in a sense the Book can be a Door and Key.

This would also fit the reason for the Raxxla Knowledge Base as it describes El Dorado, Atlantis, and Kingdom of Prester John, these are Utopian places
Astrophil and Stella was just a very misdirecting hint they made us think it was the book itself. But more the fact it just a book If they just said it was a book then it would be considered a too much of a Hint.

Again the clues fit with the old so it may have seem like nothing was untouched since then.

Edit 2 Update: I will Emphasis the idea of Utopia meaning no place, it's also other meaning is nowhere.

Vagabond which is a wanderer to no place, or also nowhere.

Which could also mean a Wanderer for Utopia

possibly reference Utopia Book
