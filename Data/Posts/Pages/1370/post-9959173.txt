I have found another interesting coincidence which may/may not be pertinent...

I’m reviewing the Toast and possibilities derived therefrom...

Jewel on Brow implies “crown” which implies Corona...

Corona Borealis is the "northern crown", Princess Ariadne’s crown (of minotaur labryinth myth)...The constellation was featured as a main plot ingredient in the short story”Hypnos” by HP Lovecraft published in 1923. And we know MBrookes‘ love of Cthulhu!
