Still reviewing the Toast and possibilities derived there from...

Jewel on Brow implies “crown” which implies Corona...

Corona Borealis has T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), "the Blaze Star", which is a recurrent nova and would be a good candidate for "Jewel on the Brow" BUT IT'S NOT IN-GAME!
(I've checked all its alternative names from Simbad)
also UW Coronae Borealis, a low-mass X-ray binary system composed of a star less massive than the Sun and a neutron star surrounded by an accretion disk that draws material from the companion star (but again not in-game)
nor is recurrent nova V394 Coronae Australis

For Cassiopeia ("Mother of Galaxies" candidate) there are two supernovae remnants: Cas A (remnant of supernova SN 1680) and Tycho’s Star (3C 10) but neither are in-game



a dissapointing morning...now time to feed the copawlot!!
