Yes, very, but so much in game is coincidence as FD have a finite directory of names to extract from, ‘Bridge’ is a long-shot albeit a peculiar one, and I’m only toying, I doubt it’s linked, up-to now I believe if certain systems have been utilised their naming will be accurate and literal not interpretational.

Aside ironically I enjoy this method of lateral exploration; I’m well aware its tin-foil and I never take it seriously (!) it genuinely gives me a reason to explore.
