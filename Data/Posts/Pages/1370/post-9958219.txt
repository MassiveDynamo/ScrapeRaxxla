Or how Midjourney does at least...
Ha - yes that’s true and there’s further obfuscation as he may not share the textural prompts.

I’ve been playing with that same AI bot to understand how it works, and very simple let’s call them literal interpretations are usually just that, but in Milton’s Paradise Lost the journey of Lucifer is wonderfully abstract and expressionist.

When you attempt abstraction the AI gets very creative (!) and there in lies difficulty, and sometimes one has to utilise very specific prompts. If MB goes down an abstract route I think it might be insightful, but only if we can know the prompts?

Below are some of my own Midjourney attempts utilising prompts extracted from Milton and the older DW missions (textual prompts not shown in full as they were lengthy) granted I do possess a background in art theory…

The AI bot utilises a specific database of images and I would imagine non-copyrighted content, so after a while one tends to ‘see’ the same seed and style…


The Omphalos rift upon the outer rim, beset by spiralling stars…


The archangel guarding the Omphalos holding a flaming sword, clouds, spiralling stars..


The omphalos rift upon the outer rim…

My descriptions above are the base prompts, but they needed some editing to get where they are, and I’m being rather arbitrary. MB likely will have a very specific image in mind so more likely to reproduce something very clear…we wait to see, with eyes that see!
