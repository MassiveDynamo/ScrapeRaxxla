It’s sound to not peer too much in any nominals personal biography, for sake of interpretational bias, but also it skirts close to intrusive intelligence.

Many of the ramblings here are based solely on MB iterations linked to ED and Raxxla, although as a public post it’s open for reference. Have myself read those blogs, I doubt he’ll unintentionally leak something, I would presume he still haunts these pages, still would be interesting to see how he visualises the Crystalline sphere or ‘heavens gate’!
Or how Midjourney does at least...
