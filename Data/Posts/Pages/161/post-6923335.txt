due to the sheer size of the project.

Sheer size? You're doing around 10 systems each in 12 constellations.
I'm currently 11 constellations into investigating all significant stars (according to the lists in Wikipedia) of all 88. I've hit around 1,500 cataloged systems so there's probably around 12k to go.

Nonetheless, I like your thinking and dedication, so best of luck Commander o7
