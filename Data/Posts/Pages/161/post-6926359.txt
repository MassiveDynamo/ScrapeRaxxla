Still up for grabs.

I'm having a look at the French connection form this thread: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/366828-The-Hunt-for-Raxxla-Void

Seems that it's quite common to get 'raXXla' as an interpretation of Γαλλία (Gallia, France in Greek), when scanning old books and using text recognition software(OCR).

Would not surprise me if the same mistake was repeated a thousand years later. The knowledge of Greek and Latin is limited in the ED era.

You know, 'Ah, non, pas encore'.
