Guardian ship or station maybe? Someone mentioned Guardian ship blueprints a while ago.
Dont see that it could be revant to Raxxla

It's probably not, but only because it's a different story segment.

The Guardian sites that have been found fits very well with the description "on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and lifeâ€¦"

They are alien constructs that gives us information, technology and relics. Calling their network 'other universes' may be a stretch, but virtual universes may be valid.
