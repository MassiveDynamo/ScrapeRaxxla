yes, thatâ€™s the one. It struck me that Asellus is a genus of marine creature & so is the barnacle.......and Primus seems to suggest some importance.

Those things inside Thargoid Interceptor cockpit-cocoon are parasites.

No proof! No evidence! Enjoy the Perseid Meteor Shower tonight.
Ive seen some really spectacular ones few minutes ago, bright red with long trails.

Edit: Asellus Primus was shown for a sec in one of The Return trailer or streaming and also one or two other systems.
Ive made a note intrigued with the system name, but no idea if it is relevant. [weird]
