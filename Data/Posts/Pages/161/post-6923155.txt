I have a problem with that infographic. The hat shouldn't be a beanie, it should be tinfoil. Aside from that though it does make me pine for another trip to my favorite SNR. Maybe I'll fire up my son's copy of Space Engine.

I take it you think I believe in Astrology? Also, a beanie is technically still a hat. Just figured I'd try something no one else appears to have attempted. Either by a lack of insight or due to the sheer size of the project.
