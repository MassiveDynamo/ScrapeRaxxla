I need to confess, the whole DW/Raxxla thing is getting annoying, since there is no ingame (Galnet) thing telling is if we are 'warm'. People are out in the black, people are doing things in Maia, Delphi. People are just plain hoping to find something, but are we doing well? Who of these people is close? I myself are around the Heart and Soul Nebula, searching but nothing to be found and it's getting old fast. Am I warm?
