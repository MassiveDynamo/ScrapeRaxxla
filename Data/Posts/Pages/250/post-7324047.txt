Well, I can tell you that LGM-1 (the first pulsar she discovered) is very dull in game. One of my earlier exploration trips was to take a look. It has a class G companion, but no planets.

Keep in mind the codex referenced a childrenâ€™s book about princess Astrophel and the Spiraling Stars. I ordered the book in case there are clues.
