I'm heading to Rasalgethi, another red supergiant, to see whether it occurs here too.
Edit: Can confirm it happens at Rasalgethi too: https://i.imgur.com/LgONE5i.jpg

Probably OT, but was there anything odd about Rasalgethi that you noticed when you were there?

It should be a semi-variable star, with stellar gas shells visible out to about 90 AU. If it just looked "normal", then that is another tick for the "Variable stars are either omitted or implemented as standard stars" hypothesis that I'm developing...
