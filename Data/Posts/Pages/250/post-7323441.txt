I'll do you one better. WHY is Raxxla?!

If I were to guess, I would say that Raxxla/the Portal was built by the Guardians that merged with their own AI or possibly by just the AI.

Guardian AI are called constructs. The same word Rafe setter used to describe the portal on Raxxla. Perhaps it's a bridge between their physical and their digital worlds?
