Give Frontiers usual modus operandi, finding Raxxla could as well mean you have to do 10 special tip-off missions. Those missions look exactly the same as every other tip-off mission and are only marked by a hidden server side flag. And they spawn only 1 on a 1000 because the intern did add one zero too many.

But honestly, I don't think that Frontier wants Raxxla to be found because it would be dull with the current possibilities of the game. So yes, Raxxla might be ingame but it is most likely permit locked until they have a narrative or whatever ready. Wrt. TDW faction: I think this was the original idea. One has to become elite and then do some missions for TDW but Frontier realized that people are way faster then they thought (or development goes way slower *cough* ) and the missions have been removed. I also think that the TDW faction will be removed in the near future which is already hinted at in the codex.
