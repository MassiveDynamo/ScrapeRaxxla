For those of you who haven't already noticed - The Dark Wheel faction indeed expanded to LFT 926.
They now appear on the mission boards there.
The ground bases however show The Pilots Federation Local Branch as the controlling faction (2 of the 3 bases).
I guess this might be a bug and due to the changes FDEV once made to Jameson Memorial in Shinrarta D, which was controlled by TDW for a long time, but now has TPFLB as controlling faction.

While TDW is currently in war, for the first time ever (as far as I remember) this is a really good oportunity to test, if getting hostile to them (for at least some weeks) leads to something.
In my opinion, getting hostile to them has always been much more difficult than getting allied. And I think most, if not all of CMDRs have never tried it?
