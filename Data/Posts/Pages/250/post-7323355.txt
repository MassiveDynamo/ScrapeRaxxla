I'll do you one better. What if Raxxla is hovering in witchspace as the Thargoids do? If CMDRGURU's on the right path, maybe Maia's BH is the gate to Raxxla, if the lensing experiments don't pan out. Another interesting line of thinking there is to line up the BH's lensing effect with Delphi as his group did with Barnard's Loop.

This could line up with the "Siren of the deepest void" line of the DW toast.

Edit: added additional thoughts

I'll do you one better. WHY is Raxxla?!

Anyway, I was watching one of the links in the original post of this thread and the guy said it's a journey every commander will have to take themselves.

What if there are a number of variables each persons will need to make true for any single person to get near Raxxla? There are a few obvious ones that won't hurt to do, e.g. triple elite, allied with TDW, max rank with Feds and Imps (because it could be an inter-faction conspiracy).

Thoughts?
