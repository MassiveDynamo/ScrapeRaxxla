Good question.

I probably wouldn’t publicly announce it. I definitely would reach out to people here and ask them if they want to know where it is specifically, or if they would want clues, or if they would want to keep searching for themselves.

Most of the fun is in the journey and mystery, I wouldn’t want to spoil it for anyone who did not want to know.
