Just did some math. The 158,200ly range to get to the nearest galaxy would only take 90 years in a new modern 2001c gen ship. Would it take longer to get to that galaxy or to find Raxxla by raw brute force if it's in our galaxy?

Quest is, what happened before the first reference to Raxxla. How many gen ships were out at that point. I'm asssuming you guys are following between systems to look for things. What other systems could we find stuff in. Like between sol and banard star and whatnot. How many have been checked?

Do any theories give ideas as to which stars to traven between manually to possibly find things?
