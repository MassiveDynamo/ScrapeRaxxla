So Commanders, if you found Raxxla, would you tell anyone or post your findings here, or just keep it to yourself for awhile?

Of course, just saying you did would not be enough, without video proof.

I, for one, would keep it to myself and enjoy the personal achievement. After this, I would tell the world.
If I end up finding Raxxla... yeah ill keep it to myself too for a while after that i'll let you guys know, then if someone diagnoses me with "space dementia" ill post an image in camera mode with "well, is out there" in caps.. sorry guys last night I had too much lavian brandy in my system.
