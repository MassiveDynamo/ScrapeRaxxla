Might meet you in deep space. Iâ€™m 0.67ly from Sol out towards Alpha Hydri, but too busy to get in ship today.
I'm still at 3.15 from Sol. That should be abut the gravitational equilibrium between Sol and Proxima. There is the slight problem that Proxima has moved and is no longer the closest star to Sol.
I can probably go about 1.5 ly more, before I have to jump. I didn't intend to go all the way, so I dropped the extra tank.

Did I mention that I haven't found anything? Well, I haven't.
