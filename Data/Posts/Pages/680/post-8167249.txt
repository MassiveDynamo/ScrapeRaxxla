Ended up in Merope with my bug squishing Chieftain, Invictus.

First time fighting the ‘goids, or even fighting in this ship full stop. So I just took it easy and had some target practice with some scouts.

I didn’t realise that the combat bonds you get from killing them give you rep with the Pilots Federation? Apparently I am now Cordial with them.
Maybe naming your Chieftain Sol Invictus would have yielded better results? The eight ray of the Sun is the lighthouse, enlightening the world. Radiant Basileus the Chieftain, stretching its righteousness against the xeno-kind, a sign of royalty. Gallant acts of heroism for the Mother of the Mountain. In March we sacrifice our Arx along the Via Sacra, and then a great pine-tree is brought in Attilius Orbital.


Philosophers say that Fortune is insane and blind and stupid,
and they teach that she stands on a rolling, spherical rock
