I handed them in at Alcazar’s Hope in Merope. The controlling faction is an independent player faction named “The Hive”. There definitely wasn’t a faction named Pilots Federation there, yet I got a message saying I had increased my standing with The Pilots Federation to Coridial ¯\(ツ)/¯
Keep it up! Get allied with them and see if any unknown permits appear!!
