It's 8 in the evening, before Peter messes with Big Ben. I guess that indicates about 12 hours of super cruising, until morning.
Depends if it is daylight savings in that part of space. And make sure it’s the left star this time. If it’s not, roll until it is.

Edit: I haven’t seen those NPC’s in game that use that line for ages now I think about it. Maybe they found Raxxla

I did see an NPC trader tonight that simply said “This is not the trading ship you are looking for” haha. What do you know he was right. Damn Jedi mind tricks.
