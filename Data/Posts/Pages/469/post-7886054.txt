Sooo. If I understood you correctly your theory is to either start at Sol or TC and always pick the 6th System. I did that for Sol and TC.

To keep it short: TC sends you into a permacycle between LHS 2 and YC Ceti. If you start at Sol the route is Lalande 21185, WX Ursae Majoris, Duamta, G41-14, Gendalla and finally Ross 128. Nothing of interest.

BUT:

If you count the System you're in as 1, TC sends you to LHS 1047 where you find a Listening Post containing a message from Alaunus (2 Phenomena, Gen ship Lycaon). That's where I currently am.
