Codex suggests Raxxla is something "real" and material. Old lore, founding lore, says it's a planet with people living there. E/F missions pointed to a celestial body. MB said it's in the MW (stars and planets)...
IF ED's Raxxla does no longer respond to these descriptions, why do they keep calling that.. thing.. "Raxxla" ?
Old lore not cannon.
I am in the milky way. I am not a star or a planet.
Raxxla could be the name of the ship, or artifact? Don't know, till we find it.
Of course, this could all be totally wrong, but it's the 1st time for a while we have had a theory we can actually run with
