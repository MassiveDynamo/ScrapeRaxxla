Codex suggests Raxxla is something "real" and material. Old lore, founding lore, says it's a planet with people living there. E/F missions pointed to a celestial body. MB said it's in the MW (stars and planets)...
IF ED's Raxxla does no longer respond to these descriptions, why do they keep calling that.. thing.. "Raxxla" ?
