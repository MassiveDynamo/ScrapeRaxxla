I am struggling to believe how many undiscovered goodies I am finding. Was the first discovered tags bugged during the period of high activity in this sector?
Iirc, I for myself, didn't usually bother to tag any body ( other than ELW etc..) when surveying the Rift.
Believe me or not, average time between two jumps in my trusty AspX was like 50s. I loved that ADS.
