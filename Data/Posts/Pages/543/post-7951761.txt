Pardon, but could you remind me in a few words why do you think it could be in the Rift ?
I dont really mean the rift. I mean Eafots. I think this because there are the club bases which say they have heard whispers in witch space and siren calls (exact wording on cannon, or I posted it a few pages back). So my theory is we were meant to find Raxxla during that mystery but didn't. Therefore they put that clue in the codex to point us back to this area. Dont listen to me know. I think I'm the only person on the thread who thinks its plausible.
