We're blind optimists with a very short memory recall time. It's what keeps us looking for Raxxla & ignoring the (lack of) storyline!

One more BH for today, then it's gin o'clock time.
Ah, but where lots of people go wrong with Galnet, is they treat is as a means by which they get told the story, instead of treating it as what it is - something that’s inside the story!

One only has to look at the stuff that doesn’t make it into Galnet.

Project Equinox, for example!
