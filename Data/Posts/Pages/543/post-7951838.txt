Has anybody tested the sounds idea? Its a brilliant suggestion whether its right or not, other things have been hidden in sound as we know. Don't think it will lead anywhere but do think it needs testing just to rule it in or out.

@PeteACarter - its as plausible as any other idea, certainly as plausible as mine which I hope to god is not right, with a sneaking suspicion it might be as answers everything in a typical Elite way....well we never promised you anything so you cant blame us that its not what you thought, welcome to the real world....as per Salome message on the beacons about the Rift, they did make me laugh but Ill bet not everyone felt the same way. Problem is I don't see how Raxxla can be anything that will fulfil our dreams, so the only real possible answer is it wont be or cant be and that leaves my theory wide open to be the answer. Just like everyone elses I hope
