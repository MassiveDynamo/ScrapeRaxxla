Iirc, I for myself, didn't usually bother to tag any body ( other than ELW etc..) when surveying the Rift.
Believe me or not, average time between two jumps in my trusty AspX was like 50s. I loved that ADS.

yep likewise. Even now- will take the effort to map ELW, WW, AW & (sometimes) terraformables out to 60kls. And 8th moons, with drop out of SC either side of the moon to look for ancient Orbis Dark Wheel stations!
