I dont really mean the rift. I mean Eafots. I think this because there are the club bases which say they have heard whispers in witch space and siren calls (exact wording on cannon, or I posted it a few pages back). So my theory is we were meant to find Raxxla during that mystery but didn't. Therefore they put that clue in the codex to point us back to this area. Dont listen to me know. I think I'm the only person on the thread who thinks its plausible.
Oh yeah. Makes sense. Are you going to record Rax.. I mean witch space whispers and pass them through some sound app ?

Anyone knows if there is some kind of witch space "sound map" of the MW ? Canonn ? (Herr Professor-Doktor ?)
