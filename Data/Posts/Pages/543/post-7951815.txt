Oh yeah. Makes sense. Are you going to record Rax.. I mean witch space whispers and pass them through some sound app ?
I wish. Unfortunately, not really understanding what ED was, when I started, I play on PS4, not on PC, making useful and interesting experiments like that very difficult. Probably possible....upload video clips to Twitter, download to PC, maybe.

My truthful but far less impressive plan was to jump around aimlessly, listening for anomalies during jumps and mapping undiscovered planets, in to futile hope I may get a human, or unknown POI pop up.
