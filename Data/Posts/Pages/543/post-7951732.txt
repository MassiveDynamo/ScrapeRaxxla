So whatâ€™s with the Galnet despondency from some?

Have people forgotten that Galnet is to all intents and purposes the equivalent of a state controlled media in-game?

All we were ever getting were the stories that certain parties wanted to come our way.

The real good stuff was never in Galnet in the first place!

(Well not since they had to crack down on independent journalists due to them managing to sneak things past the censors, anyway! )
