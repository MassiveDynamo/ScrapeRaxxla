I assume you don't forget to make parallax observation in low speed SC around these moons, as " low emissive " station doesn't mean " non-reflective."
Of course! And I try to do it against a light background of nebulosity or starlight to help

All my fleet are named "Deep XXXX" since my first ship was (of course) Deep Thought.
Thinking of finishing off these BH tomorrow then popping back to Gorgon Research to rename this ship from "Fathoms Deep" (it's a deep space explorer Phantom, love it) to "Deep Fernweh", to match the mood.....
