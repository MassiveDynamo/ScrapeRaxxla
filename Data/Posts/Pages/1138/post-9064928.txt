Wasn't the Col 70 system where Wreaken was up to whatever they were doing? My money is on some sort of Thargoid experiments/testing a la INRA.

In their map room you will find Guardian Totems. Because the Thargoid map room is a hunting map, not a Thargoid map on where to find them. The Thargoid room has Guardian Totems and markings. This is what caused the first war with Guardians and Thargoids, the Thargoids returned to the systems they seeded to pick up their minerals, and the Guardians were living in them- refused to leave their homes.(CMDR Bluecrash)

Thankfully, the Cannon Science Group have used their considerable resources, developing a tool that allows you to enter the beep sequence generated by a Thargoid Link to get to the next site in the chain:
They have catalogued all known surface site locations that they could find (currently 226) and created a 3D map showing where and how all the sites interlink:
https://canonn.science/resources/unknown-structure-interactive-3d-map/
The surface sites form a sphere of interlinked locations.
One site is of particular note: WREGOE RA-W C15-18, identified as TS146 in the Cannon records. One of the 3 sites it points to is HIP 22460, a permit locked star system.
The 226 sites found so far form a closed loop, so there is nothing more to find at present. It seems that whatever secrets the Thargoid network holds cannot be revealed until the permit lock is lifted from HIP 22460.

The Guardian hunting map leads to the Thargoid matriarch? I believe that if you activate the pylons at a ruins site, and put the LINK in that has been programmed from the GUARDIAN THARGOID HUNTING map room, the permit to HIP 22460 will be unlocked.
