According to my calculations, col 70 sector fy-n c21-3 is Miackce. Right distance and right relative position to the Pleiades.
INRA probably located it the same way we did, listening to probes. That lead to it being a Mycoid target. In ED, the bombing probably happened.
Wreaken was in a system near the edge of COL 70, If I remember correctly.

So Thargoid equivalents of the Tionisla Orbital Graveyard.... Ya when is that going to be in game?
