what we suspect to be the Thargoid Homeworld in Col 70
I for one really don’t think it’s the Thargoid Homeworld.


It’s a place of significance to them sure, but the Col 70 locked wall is only around 100ly thick around it. That’s a very small volume compared to the overall Col 70 locked region, and the Cone and its surrounding locked regions. No signs of Thargoid activity around it until you get quite a bit further away, in the Witchhead (which is obviously still within the overall Col 70 region itself).
