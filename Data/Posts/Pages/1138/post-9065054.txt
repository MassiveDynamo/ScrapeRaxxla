Raxxla IS STILL IN SOL!
(Again with this? Yes, AGAIN!!!)



TL,DWR:

Raxxla is to be in Sol’s “empty” main asteroid belt. Ooooooh, I said it!!!! I went there! And if you, commander, don't already believe that, then read on!


























































































Fdev previously confirming that Raxxla is in-game and "discoverable" obviously fits this whole theory. What also fits both the theory and the (non)progress we've made in the game is that, while being discoverable, the odds of finding it by simply dropping in on it are (appropriately) astronomically low. I have heard of countless commanders dropping in to "see if we could find it", myself included. These odds are not even slightly in our favor, regardless of how many of us do it, or for how long.





I am of the firm belief that to discover the missing asteroids, we need to
A: (Alien artifacts, rare goods, etc), or
B: (Use a scanner, tool, or element in a manner previously undiscovered or unthought of)
or
C: (Think Dark Wheel invite & subsequent knowledge), or
D: ..?








(Damn you Sidney, you and your metaphorical ramblings!)
