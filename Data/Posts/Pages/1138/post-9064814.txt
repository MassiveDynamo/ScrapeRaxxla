Yeah, it would have been Sirius I think. [Edit: actually Beta Ursa Minoris aka Kochab. Sirius was the brightest star in the sky not the pole star] Think that is mentioned here, posted earlier: http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2011JAHH...14...22T/0000027.000.html

I would not lose complete hope though, as the entire constellation of Ursa Minor which includes Polaris was used to represent North for ancient Greek celestial navigation, even if it was not the pole star at that time. See again above, and also this for the history of the changing pole star and early navigation by different cultures (the Greeks actually inherited that idea it seems). https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_star

So I would say your theory is still as valid as it had been (given other caveats various folks here have mentioned) and that the Canonn doesn't always know which way is North . (Too many biscuits and too much Lavian brandy while blowing things up in Lab 69, while refusing to acknowledge the existence of Wagon Wheels. Half of them probably don't know how to navigate their own ship any more now that they have turned the Gnosis into a cruise ship).
