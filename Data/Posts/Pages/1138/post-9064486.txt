I for one really don’t think it’s the Thargoid Homeworld.


It’s a place of significance to them sure, but the Col 70 locked wall is only around 100ly thick around it. That’s a very small volume compared to the overall Col 70 locked region, and the Cone and its surrounding locked regions. No signs of Thargoid activity around it until you get quite a bit further away, in the Witchhead (which is obviously still within the overall Col 70 region itself).
Wasn't the Col 70 system where Wreaken was up to whatever they were doing? My money is on some sort of Thargoid experiments/testing a la INRA.
