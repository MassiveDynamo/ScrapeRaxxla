I look at this thread and notice that a lot of the original (back in the day) contributors don't post anymore, what what

Do you think they have found Raxxla?

Tatty bye
I suspect some of them have taken breaks and may not be playing, or if they are playing, are not playing as much and have moved onto other things in-game while they wait for new content to drop. I just came back from almost three years off from the game a few weeks ago, and was surprised at how quiet the forums seem now.

Also, the advent of Discord and the like and player group channels (or websites with their own forums - see Canonn for example) have removed a lot of the focus from the official forums, a lot of people don't bother because all they do is Discord or Canonn stuff or the like. Or Reddit (shudder).
