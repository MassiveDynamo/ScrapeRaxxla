So I would say your theory is still as valid as it had been (given other caveats various folks here have mentioned) and that the Canonn doesn't always know which way is North . (Too many biscuits and too much Lavian brandy while blowing things up in Lab 69, while refusing to acknowledge the existence of Wagon Wheels. Half of them probably don't know how to navigate their own ship any more now that they have turned the Gnosis into a cruise ship).
Still with the wagon wheels.... Ya u just got the Wagon of Heaven on the brain.
