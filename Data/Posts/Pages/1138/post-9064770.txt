Thinking about the method that I came up with for the Raxxla Codex doesn't at all depend on it. Therefore, going to reduce it to its nuts and bolts and see what part of the galaxy the calculation puts us in. It only depended on the myth of Delphi's origin and it being the "navel of the world". That being said. let me finish this and see if there is enough here to work off. That being said, maybe the Alleged Toast is how to find TDW's real base. Ursa major is still one hell of a basis for a specific part of the sky and on its own the Alleged Toast idea isn't wholly negated as that is still the area on Achilles Shield. So, will keep you up to date if the slimmed down ideas merit further investigation.
