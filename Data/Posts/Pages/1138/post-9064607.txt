Well my theory possibly just met its maker.. Canonn found the Achilles Heal of the whole thing. During the Greek civilization the northern star isn't Polaris. Polaris become the north star as of 500 CE and the Greeks were BCE. Also, given the procession of the equinoxes the north star would have changed 3 times by the time we hit 3000 nevermind 3300. Damn it.

They used Ursa Minor as a navigational aide for North. Like in the Alcman fragment - Its spins around the axis. Not specifically Polaris but I wouldn't worry too much about that.
