Well, I think we should diferentiate where is Raxxla and what is Raxxla (R is possibly everywhere, a place that is not a place and Oolite's witchspace and MB's "oh, it's in the Milky Way"). DW knows the what is, and doesn't know the where is (meaning "how to get access"). So, I take for granted Raxxla is what DW describes in his novels. He wouldn't have denatured the subject Raxxla after reading the alien background secret book from Frontier. What concerns me, is the "a certain celestial body"-thing which could refer to the access entry ( 8 accesses ? ) to R and could then be anywhere...and moving.
EDIT: which makes me wonder if the "obfuscated"-thing missions showed us R access moving from Ticushpakhi to Varati to 49 Arietis and Hip 8603 clusters ...most of them being in the (outer?) rim of the bubble. In this way of tinfoiling, we lost R access trail around HIP 8603 ...or maybe it's still there ?

The best (only?) clue I've seen from anyone at Frontier was when DJTruthsayer got Micheal Brookes to say that it has to be "a little bit obvious".

TDW faction, Doc ?
