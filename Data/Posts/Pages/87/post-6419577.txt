TDW faction, Doc ?

Well ... it is odd, based on their description in The Dark Wheel novella, to find The Dark Wheel existing as a Minor Faction based around a single system instead of out exploring the depths of the galaxy in search of legends and myths. It seems that, after Alex took on the mantle of leadership, The Dark Wheel narrowed its focus to just searching for Raxxla. At least until the CIEPers split off to find Soontil. Maybe the split was so devastating that The Dark Wheel finally gave up on the quest? Or maybe we should be probing the area around Shinrarta Dhezra more thoroughly?
