Hmm
Maybe the dark wheel refers to a circumference from sol or founders world, that is a distance of the edge of the bubble and as it turns. Raxxla location on the hub moves too. Hence dark wheel I.e its in the black and wheel shaped. Obfuscated or hidden in the outer rim and 49 atietis. Isnt that where the thargoids have reached.
Suggest a circumnavigation of the bubble edge?
