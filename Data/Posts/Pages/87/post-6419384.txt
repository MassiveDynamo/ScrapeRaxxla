Where is the source for the quote “Raxxla is not a POI”?

I'm pretty sure that comes directly from conflating the Formidine Rift Mystery with Raxxla. As far as I am aware the only "Mystery" to which the statement "not a POI" was attributed to was when Drew stated that the Formidine Rift wasn't one ... which, although true, turned out to be a misdirection as unlocking the mystery of the Rift turned out to be a POI ... making me kick myself for turning those off in the navigation filters while out Rifting.

The best (only?) clue I've seen from anyone at Frontier was when DJTruthsayer got Micheal Brookes to say that it has to be "a little bit obvious".
