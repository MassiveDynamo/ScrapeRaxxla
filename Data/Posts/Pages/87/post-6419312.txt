Where is the source for the quote “Raxxla is not a POI”? It’s the first time I’ve come across this & as far as I know the only clues we have from FD are that Raxxla has ben in game from the outset, they know where it is, and there will be no clues related to it.

Is this a misinterpretation of DrewWagar’s quote that the Formidine Rift mystery is not a poi? (It wasn’t-the mystery was the Dynasty Conspiracy and their Exodus plot, but it was revealed through a poi which was the Zurara).
