TDW seems (seemed) more interested in other systems (Elite/Founders missions) than Shinrarta...
And IF they got lost "what is lost", seems to me consistent they focused on R.

Maybe the Elite/Founders missions got yanked because ... someone found Raxxla? I mean ... if they found it they wouldn't need to offer those missions anymore. Maybe the fact that they are missing from the game isn't a bug, oversight or omission after all. Maybe The Dark Wheel hushed up because their efforts paid off?
