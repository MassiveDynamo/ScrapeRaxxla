Oh s...
Sorry, I mean, I would be very disappointed to loose the last thing (after the Rift mYsTeRy (booo)) which makes me be still playing this game ...

I don't think the TDW missions them self means anything. They are just there to hide secret messages in the mission texts and turn attention to certain commodities.

TDW are on the mission boards of Jameson, just to keep the Founders of their back.

Well ... I'm not saying that I genuinely believe that Raxxla has been found or that the existence/lack of Elite/Founder missions means anything. Just postulating yet another possibility.
