Maybe the Elite/Founders missions got yanked because ... someone found Raxxla? I mean ... if they found it they wouldn't need to offer those missions anymore. Maybe the fact that they are missing from the game isn't a bug, oversight or omission after all. Maybe The Dark Wheel hushed up because their efforts paid off?

I don't think the TDW missions them self means anything. They are just there to hide secret messages in the mission texts and turn attention to certain commodities.

TDW are on the mission boards of Jameson, just to keep the Founders of their back.
