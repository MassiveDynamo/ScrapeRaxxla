Just about the Raxxla symbol again, The Dark Wheel is supposedly using an old Toroid station, Well what has the and the Raxxla logo got in common I show you below:

Toroidal polyhedron - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org



Notice the similarities between the flat down logo and the 3d image of a Toroidal Polyhedron, What if the logo doesn't represent Raxxla itself but The Dark Wheel station who are hunting it. Or maybe even the codex entry reference to a station or the whole entry itself isnt true and we have to pick out words and bits into their own meaning like a riddle.

Now don't get me wrong the logo could symbolize the system the station is in also however its a new perspective and meh not going anywhere but tinfoil anyways
