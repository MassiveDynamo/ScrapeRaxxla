Officially, Universal Cartographics and all associated IT/Telecommunications/Market/Trade data is a direct subsidiary of The Pilot's Federation. I am not sure if they use some sort of subspace/hyperspace communication relay method to accomodate nearly real-time communication and data refresh capabilities. Essentially, it's all The Pilot's Federation "magic".
Exactly but where did this "Magic" come from and how does it work Distances are always going to be off even with the tech present in Elite dangerous lore regarding uncharted stars, yet they appear to be exact (obviously for gameplay reason but still coudl be more and a valid reason to tie it into lore)
