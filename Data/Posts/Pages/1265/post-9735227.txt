I would like to add to your thoughts. In the game, as in real life, there is a global, supranational government. In real life, the symbol of this government is the Radiant Delta and the numerical mark of the numbers 9, 11 and 22. I agree that the structures of INRA, the Club, the Dark Wheel are some kind of periphery of supranational government (aka Global Predictor).

At the same time, the search for RAXXLA, in fact, is a certain qualification task for those who want to become members of this department, since they also need a change of personnel. Therefore, as a kind of real object in the game, RAXXLA may not exist, since it is just a riddle that is proposed to be solved.

One more thought about the Guardians. If compared with real life, or rather with one hypothesis, then the current human civilization is the descendants of the Atlantean slaves who gained independence after the destruction of Ailantida. Zeus, Hercules and other gods of ancient Greece are the Atlanteans who survived the collapse of Atlantis. Accordingly, the Guardians are Atlantes. At the same time, the knowledge possessed by the Global Predictor was received from the Atlanteans.

Perhaps my thoughts will somehow help in the search.
