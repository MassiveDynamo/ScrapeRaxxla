what system is this ?
Jumping from Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-34 to HIP 17481. I could replicate it consistently. But if I moved away from that area it wasn’t in the witch space animation. Only happened around those stars while I was messing with it. I went back a while later and it wasn’t happening anymore. I always check for it when I jump tho lol.

When you jump around systems that have thargoids in them, you always see those green thargoid looking disk things in hyperspace. And the picture I posted straight up looks like a dark planet with a portal to another dimension next to it….soooo maybe I was close to something? Lol
