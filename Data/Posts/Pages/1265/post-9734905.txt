See the thing about the distance they could of travelled I thin may be hit or miss, although they may not have reached raxxla due to hyperspace limits tat doesnt take away the fact they may have found the location of it, via probes, advanced telescopes and other lucrative methods, after all they had star charts and system data for places way beyond their reach, Galmap for instance knows the location and star maps of some systems Humanity has never reached before, the Pilots fed have Permits locking out zones of space at times where they wouldnt have even be reached yet, If you look up the dates of hyperspace travel, times, resources and jump ranges versus lets say the Hyponia and other regions also near Beagle these areas where permit locked but no way could have been reached at the time they where...so why permit lock them if you didnt know what was there beforehadn due to other ways

Even going on that, Galmap itself....how does it work regarding Lore, it seems to know the exact location of stars that CMDR's have never even been to yet, by first discovery tags being a basis to draw the lore from their either a lie (we wernt the real first to discover otherwise they wouldnt have been in galmap yet or there location wouldnt be exact) or whoever created galmap had some way of either being at the locations somehow to input the data or "Insert secret alien tech here"

The Mars relic could be

1. the tech used to create galmap

2. from this Raxxla location found/mentioned or something although never actually reached

Officially, Universal Cartographics and all associated IT/Telecommunications/Market/Trade data is a direct subsidiary of The Pilot's Federation. I am not sure if they use some sort of subspace/hyperspace communication relay method to accomodate nearly real-time communication and data refresh capabilities. Essentially, it's all The Pilot's Federation "magic". If you scanned all the beacons in Shinrarta Dezra your CMDR Codex Archive should have those beacons that discusses all this. Alternatively, there is always EDDB's attraction tools (https://eddb.io/attraction).
