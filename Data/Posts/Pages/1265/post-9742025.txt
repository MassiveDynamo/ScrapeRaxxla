Just about the Raxxla symbol again, The Dark Wheel is supposedly using an old Toroid station, Well what has the and the Raxxla logo got in common I show you below:

Notice the similarities between the flat down logo and the 3d image of a Toroidal Polyhedron, What if the logo doesn't represent Raxxla itself but The Dark Wheel station who are hunting it. Or maybe even the codex entry reference to a station or the whole entry itself isnt true and we have to pick out words and bits into their own meaning like a riddle.

Now don't get me wrong the logo could symbolize the system the station is in also however its a new perspective and meh not going anywhere but tinfoil anyways

There's a very toroidal station in Kappa Fornacis: Harvestport. A note from this angle, it looks dark but there are lots of lights on your approach. I say, though, this is one of the more unique Orbis stations I have ever seen. This is from about slightly greater than 12 kilometers out from the station to get a proper perspective on how weird this one looks.

Now granted, this might be more related to The Dark Wheel but I wouldn't exactly rule out the omphalos rift being part of the central ring structure of something similar. Though, I would think Raxxla would be many centuries or even many milennia old (and probably not man-made). Unless, in the Elite Universe humans were imported to Sol and Earth similar to Known Space series by Larry Niven.

Also, apologies for screenshot quality .. done in VR and forgot to alt + F10 for high definition.
