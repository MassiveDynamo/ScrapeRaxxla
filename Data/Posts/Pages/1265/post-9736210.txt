OR the Mars Relic could be an FD tribute to the Arnold Schwarzenegger version of Total Recall where the alien machine is started when he presses his hand into an XL hand-shaped depression in a stone.

All we know is it’s alien and the size of a child’s hand.
Yeah, the relic is a hangover from previous game lore, circa 1992 so likely began there as a tribute to Total Recall that came out 1990?

Regards it’s inclusion in ED; FD alluded to it being narrative in nature, so it may be linked to some storyline or other. I expect it may get shoehorned into something in the future, or not.
