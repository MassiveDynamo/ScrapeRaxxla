Time to check everywhere again Only belts or 'orbital cruise zone' dont show POI in FSS though. And maybe if one POI is in another POI eg Megaship visiting an Installation may only show as one apparently but still shows one.



Clarified on Hesperus thread I got confused with MB comment, he was on about ADS not FSS, will edit original post. But thats good to know about size as well.

The min radius is from empirical data. Nothing official from FD.
ADS had the same limitations.

Lord Zoltan was sort of a press secretary for Canonn, in the begining. Active and vocal.
Wrote a ton of Galnet pieces for Canonn.
He backed out, due to the work load. He might still be the administrator of the Canonn web site?

Lots of people have burned out and / or got fed up with FD or ED.
