Ha, my fathers middle name was zoltan, he refuses to acknowledge its his middle name lol
He wasn’t a wrestler was he?

Lord Zoltan was active in the Canonn group back in the days of the “UA Mystery” and a nice helpful guy. There was an interesting period when someone appeared to take offence at his nom de forum, particularly the Lord part, ignoring the fact that there had been IRL a wrestler who used that alias...
