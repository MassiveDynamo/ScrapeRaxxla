So, since there are some changes in poi appearing, i think it's time to check Kwatis system again

Time to check everywhere again Only belts or 'orbital cruise zone' dont show POI in FSS though. And maybe if one POI is in another POI eg Megaship visiting an Installation may only show as one apparently but still shows one.

The FSS does not resolve ‘cold’ objects, smaller than 135 km radius.

Clarified on Hesperus thread I got confused with MB comment, he was on about ADS not FSS, will edit original post. But thats good to know about size as well.
