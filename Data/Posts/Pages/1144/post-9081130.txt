So anyone have some spare trinkets? Something I want to test...
Not me - I thought about trying to get them when I was out Seagull Nebula way, but apparently you can only get them by pirating cargo, which I don't do (for roleplay but also mostly because I suck at combat). I have 10 Void Opals now if you need any.
