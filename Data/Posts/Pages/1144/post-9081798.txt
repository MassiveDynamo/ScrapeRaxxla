Well I can officially confirm that dropping into asteroid belts to see what is in them is just as repetitive and boring as it was when we thought there was nothing in them. Just went back to Suijin on a lark to look for Octavia's base, and I think I managed to drop into four clusters before calling it quits. If they are going to use this as a mechanic in future lets hope they either fix the FSS, or give us clear hints as to a limited number of possible systems that need to be searched. I can't imagine doing what everyone did with California Sector over the weekend and having to check all the asteroid clusters. New levels of tedious grind potential if they don't.
