Ok, things that is still bugging me about the Hesperus...

1. Once you deliver the "Slavation" mission to Hind Mines station you get CR2Mi... AND A PERMIT?!
To where?! Very shady "Permit"

2. Asteroid belts... LPs hidden inside asteroid belts, the Hesperus and Dredger... humm... I think this is a way Frontier is using to point out to us "visit all asteroid belts you can find!"

Cheers!
