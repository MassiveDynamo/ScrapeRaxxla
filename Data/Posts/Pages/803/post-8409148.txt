Pf in sd was my reasoning for doing lft 926 so yea, we're in the same line of reasoning. This is a bummer because i was really hoping to expand tdw out of lft 926 as it has never been done for that faction. Im going to continue this research though. For all i know, this could be not impossible but extremely difficult, perhaps a test of sorts if you will. At least thats my hopes.

I did have something i thought was interesting happen. I'll post it in a vid later when i can.

Any suggestion in missions/trading partners from DW in LFT 926 where other member factions of the “DW agglomerate” might be? I remember someone (Macros??) investigating this angle but cant remember any outcome.
