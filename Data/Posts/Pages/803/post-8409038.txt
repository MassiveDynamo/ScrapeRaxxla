So far through my research ive decided my findings leaning towards TDW in SD/ LFT 926 are not the real DW. Im basing this opinion on months of bgs for controlling faction and it seems we run unopposed until right before we should be preparing for war with Green Party of LFT 926, at which time something happens and we suddenly bottom out in influence. Most recently it was infrastructure failure somehow on a mf that has a bunch of people supporting daily.

to me this seems to back up Felicity farseer statement that fakes get shut down quietly. Because every time we're about to make it somewhere with them we get shut down or at least our efforts do.

If anybody else has insight on this I would appreciate it that would be great.
