You can also unlock 16t (class 4) corrosion-resistant cargo racks through a Human Tech Broker.
This seems fun ... need to make special ship for breaking cargos, with long enough jump and good cargo to collect stuff.
Then even more fun to unlock bubble head
...and all this stuff must fly fast or fight back, as pirates will start attacking you ...
