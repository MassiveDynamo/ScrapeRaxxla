The only practical way to do this in ED, is to find a star with aproximately the same RA and DEC and ai for that.

Simbad http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/ is a good place to start, because it has cooridinate search. You can fine tune by checking stars in the right direction, in EDSM.

It takes a bit of fiddling in the gal map, but you wil find an ok star to head for.

Good luck.
Im trying to find asteroids in Sol but since they don't show right im trying to use the RA and D from RL info to find 19 fortuna, an asteroid that is currently visible in capricornus
