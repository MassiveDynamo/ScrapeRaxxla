..don't recall if we got that idea already..
..so there are many stations named in the name of well-known humans, like Tereshkova port etc. Maybe that toast refers such a names, not a greek myths?
So at the times of Einstein galaxies were unknown yet. Maybe it was some woman who helped to discovery they're, and in her name station is named...so she will be "mother of galaxies".

Did do some research along the female astronomer line for “mother of galaxies” a while ago. Names I came up with were: Nancy Grace Roman, Jocelyn Bell Burnell, Vera Rubin, Margaret J Geller, Sandra Faber, Martha Liller

But couldn’t see that it led anywhere.
