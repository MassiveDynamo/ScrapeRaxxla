Sandra Moore Faber is the closet I could come up with. She is one of the first well know female astronomers (actually astrophysicist). She is known for her research on the evolution of galaxies.

There is a Faber Terminal. It is an Outpost in the Gliese 110 system. (note: that system does contain Gliese 110 A 3 H ... 8th moon of a gas giant)
Yes, but you could buy something, or take weird mission there...

Upd: EDDB knows 13 of "Faber". Too many options ...anything more unique?
Upd2: Or maybe other 2 names from toast must be in "Fiber" system and then it will narrow to 1.
