..don't recall if we got that idea already..
..so there are many stations named in the name of well-known humans, like Tereshkova port etc. Maybe that toast refers such a names, not a greek myths?
So at the times of Einstein galaxies were unknown yet. Maybe it was some woman who helped to discovery they're, and in her name station is named...so she will be "mother of galaxies".
Sandra Moore Faber is the closet I could come up with. She is one of the first well know female astronomers (actually astrophysicist). She is known for her research on the evolution of galaxies.

There is a Faber Terminal. It is an Outpost in the Gliese 110 system. (note: that system does contain Gliese 110 A 3 H ... 8th moon of a gas giant)
