..wow, just soloed interceptor! My first one - 4 hearts variant. Used MK-2 with fighters on board.
Feel good ...any idea where to get cargo to hold their hearts? And why do I need that hearts at all.

Btw, I think figured a trick, if disengage happens at about 17Mm then it will be interceptor in signal, if normal 900kms then it will be smalls a lot.
