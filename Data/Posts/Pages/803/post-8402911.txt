Okey..field news...made hatch breaker, to get "Neofabric insulation " from megaships in Delphi. Tried 2 ships there, each 5-7 times with relogs. Cargos are just empty. Nothing pops.
Going back to search for missions
Or even better, I think best is postpone till new FC arrive making that bubble head.
Btw...they announced updates to FC. Now I want it.
