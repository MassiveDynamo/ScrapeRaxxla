I think raising the TDW influence was also attempted by Ben Ryder a few years back (find him a few posts in on the first page of this thread), They attempted to do it in Shinrarta Dezhra, but were also 'shutdown' if I remember correctly.

Could be that Shinrarta Dezhra is locked to the Pilot's Federation and thus all attempts will fail here, but that does not explain LFT 926.
