I think raising the TDW influence was also attempted by Ben Ryder a few years back (find him a few posts in on the first page of this thread), They attempted to do it in Shinrarta Dezhra, but were also 'shutdown' if I remember correctly.

Could be that Shinrarta Dezhra is locked to the Pilot's Federation and thus all attempts will fail here, but that does not explain LFT 926.
Pf in sd was my reasoning for doing lft 926 so yea, we're in the same line of reasoning. This is a bummer because i was really hoping to expand tdw out of lft 926 as it has never been done for that faction. Im going to continue this research though. For all i know, this could be not impossible but extremely difficult, perhaps a test of sorts if you will. At least thats my hopes.

I did have something i thought was interesting happen. I'll post it in a vid later when i can.
