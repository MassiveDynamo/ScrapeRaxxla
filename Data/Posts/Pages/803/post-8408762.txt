Has anybody tried getting unfriendly with a bunch of pro-Club minor factions lately? I've been reading through the Holdstock Report and The Club Unmasked trying to make a list of factions to annoy and this is what I have at the moment:

If anybody has suggestions, I'm all ears.

There's also an open spreadsheet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdS5jCcghT2XC-Mi4aEE968srZAsIvkUGi9RZJFceAg/edit?usp=sharing if anybody feels like kicking in any ideas.
