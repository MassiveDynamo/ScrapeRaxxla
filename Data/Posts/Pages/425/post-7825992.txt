To the best of my knowledge, traversable wormholes (or at least the one's definable under General Relativity) have 'throats', and traverse distance and times are non-zero.

(Happy to see something from a reputable source demonstrating a zero-length traversable wormhole as possible under GR of course. Not that you're not a reputable source but you know what I mean.)

A source clearly stating the non-zero traverse time and length as a rule isn't readily available, but I've not seen anything it's not implicit in. A few examples with it implicit:

Well from what relativity states, in wormhole travel time gets a bit ifffffyyyy. Relativity Implies that when you enter you would exit at the same time in a different location so space time isn’t broken. You would, I guess, travel through the worm hole and could feel the affects of time whilst inside. For example you could technically feel like you where inside it for hours but in reality you would spent < 0 amount of time inside.
But we are getting into the realm of theory not reality so we can’t infer anything
Hope this helps
