Rogue planets having to be referenced as "stars" to make possible to jump at. Actually, are they ?
Consequences of bad initial game design, leading to inconsistencies.
"Fog of war" is what should be the explo mechanic.

During the Formidine Rift search I pm’d DB, DW and Ed Lewis asking if the “dark systems” from Elite Reclamation were actually implemented in-game to know what I was looking for. Needless to say got no response from anybody. If rogue planets are implemented then they would form dark systems, since they would have no stars. One thing I remember is searching through a complete subsector (Phaa Ain NO-X) and finding gaps in the system numbering sequence. I remember searching for some of the “missing” systems; never spotted them & never found an explanation for such gaps. They didn’t appear in galmap, nor in the nav panel as I wondered around the subsector.
