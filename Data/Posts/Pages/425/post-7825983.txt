If you want to get really technical, I don't think there is a distance to travel in a worm hole. Speed is needed to get to the worm hole but once you are there, you are on the other side.
To the best of my knowledge, traversable wormholes (or at least the one's definable under General Relativity) have 'throats', and traverse distance and times are non-zero.

(Happy to see something from a reputable source demonstrating a zero-length traversable wormhole as possible under GR of course. Not that you're not a reputable source but you know what I mean.)

A source clearly stating the non-zero traverse time and length as a rule isn't readily available, but I've not seen anything it's not implicit in. A few examples with it implicit:
