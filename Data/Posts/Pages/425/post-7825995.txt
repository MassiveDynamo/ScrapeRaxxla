I like what you're thinking about here, although i doubt the game systems would need actual holes in system boundaries to make rogue plantes work. In fact, if we assume that a rogue planet moves on some trajectory (parabolic or otherwise) through the galaxy, it actually would be EXTREMELY unlikely to ever enter any systems, unless specifically programmed to. In this case, it would HAVE to be a one time occurence. If the planet entered a system more than once, it would have to be in some sort of regular orbit, no longer considered rogue.

Edit: of course, i havent ruled out the possibility that Raxxla is a body that can defy physics. My suppositions are only about run of the mill rogues, not places that arent even places.
It’s possible that in game if it is a rouge planet it could travel through multiple systems. I.e. be present for some time before moving through another, that could explain the place that isn’t a place?
