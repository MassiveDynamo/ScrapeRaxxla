This is to be expected (we discussed this topic earlier in the thread). A rogue planet is one not bound gravitationally to any other body, therefore it will be on its lonesome. ED fsd requires a star to jump to, therefore if rogue planets exist in-game then they must be classed as a star type otherwise you would never be able to reach them, effectively putting them outside the game....

If they are to be found in-game they should appear as very low-mass systems, so will probably have a system designation something like Sectorname XX-X A?, since A type systems have the lowest mass.
What about XX-L A
