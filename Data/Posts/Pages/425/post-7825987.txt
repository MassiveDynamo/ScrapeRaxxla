A rogue planet would not move very fast. Even one ejected by a dramatic event would travel at only a small fraction of the speed of light.
If there are any in ED, they are probably in the same system as they were on release.

In ED all systems are infinitly big. A rogue planet is either part of a regular system or it is itâ€™s own system.
Switching it from one system to another could be done on server ticks, bu it would bee extreemly rare.
Having thought about it, I do wonder if the stellar forge would generate 'pure' rogue planets, by which I mean ones that form from a gas cloud that lacks the mass to form a star. I don't remember anything from the video on the stellar forge which would seem to preclude it, but equally it's a long time since I watched it, and it's not necessarily something that would be specifically covered anyway.
