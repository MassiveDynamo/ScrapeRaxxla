A rogue planet would not move very fast. Even one ejected by a dramatic event would travel at only a small fraction of the speed of light.
If there are any in ED, they are probably in the same system as they were on release.

In ED all systems are infinitly big. A rogue planet is either part of a regular system or it is it’s own system.
Switching it from one system to another could be done on server ticks, bu it would bee extreemly rare.
Unless the rouge planet is being powered by the ‘gateway’
