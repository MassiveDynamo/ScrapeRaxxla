Just a passing thought...can't remember who posted the pic of the fish pond in the space station and the discussion of it's relation to Paradise Lost cosmology..
I posted the pics and someone else linked it to Paradise Lost using the image on this post. That said, these really do not look to be portals to another universe so kindly don't upset station security. Besides, I don't think people want a ship slamming into the station.
