In the Elite: Dangerous CODEX it states the Coriolis and basically any current version of starport (including obis and the others) are all BREWER made. There was one Rival corp that created a station I think in TAU CETI, which summaraly had an 'accident'. Since then no one has gone away from Brewer. View attachment 382782

I understand all that. However, sometimes it is better to consider the official lore of Elite Dangerous the officially sanctioned version of the Elite Pilots' Federation history that they allow the public and rank and file CMDRs to know. Heresy is deeply interwoven in the story especially via the Revised Catholic Mission of Aymiay, Sol, and Beta Hydri.

ANTI-POPE TO VISIT GRAHAMHURST
J.J.

Consternation was expressed by many of the delegates to the Annual Federal Theological Synod at the news that Decius Torquemadoc, the Gnostolic Antipope is due to land at Lomasport, Aymiay, later this week to join their deliberations.

The Synod, held traditionally at Grahamhurst University, has not yet included the Gnostolic Anti-religion in their Inventory of Recognised Faiths and Gnostolicism has for long been black-listed by the clerical orders.

It is thought that major demonstrations are being planned by leading clerics to greet the arrival of the Antipope. However, Admiral Bentley, together with an escort of Naval Cruisers has been dispatched from Alpha to prevent the kind of blood letting seen at last yearâ€™s Synod when the Enthralled Cenobites of Epsilon clashed with the Moderate Chapter of the Two Day Adventists.

You're playing with and a gentle reminder..

I am not the hero but I am not a villain, either. What was that about theocracy factions not necessarily being an officially sanctioned religion? I fear no evil, the shadow is mine and so is the valley.
