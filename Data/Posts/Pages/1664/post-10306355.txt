The Thargoid mystery used a very complex set of nested mysteries
One of which - there's still no obvious reason why it uses morse code at all - is still there.

That said, despite the complexity and length of time needed to solve the mystery, the eventual solution can be explained very quickly for both the sensor and probe, and is relatively quick to replicate once you know what you're doing. The difficulty so far has come from figuring out the right thing to do, not from doing it.
