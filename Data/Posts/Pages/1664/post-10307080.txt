Just a passing thought...can't remember who posted the pic of the fish pond in the space station and the discussion of it's relation to Paradise Lost cosmology..

But has anyone actually tried to land/fly through the appropriate part of that pond layout??
Oh, if your're that desperate that you want to try flying into things then I would suggest you try flying into that dark gas giant in Shinrarta Dezhra, I think it was B3. Pretty spooky fellow, that one.
