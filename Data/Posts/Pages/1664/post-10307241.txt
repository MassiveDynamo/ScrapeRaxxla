Got me looking at those station gardens again, and I noticed the Hebrew Qoph letter ק inverted has a similar appearance to the gates in the garden walls.
The letter is "suggested to have originally depicted either a sewing needle, specifically the eye of a needle (Hebrew קוף quf and Aramaic קופא qopɑʔ both refer to the eye of a needle), or the back of a head and neck (qāf in Arabic meant "nape")"

Eye of a Needle - this is a metaphor for a narrow opening or, in the spiritual sense, a test of self to remove one's own "worldly baggage" in order to enter the gates of heaven.

Then I remembered the name Halsey can be interpreted as 'Neck' of a Road. Was she tested by the beings and is now embarking on her new spiritual journey.
