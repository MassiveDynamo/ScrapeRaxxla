There's a lot of ambiguous details with Jaques. In "...All that Glisters" he states he's at least 300 something at that point. However, that is approximately 3200 to possibly even the mid-3200s (haven't attempted to date the story). Jaques is by his own admission connected to the building of Peter's Base (Coriolis) in Facece which easily dates him to 2750 or so. That's before we even get to Battle of Hell's Gate. I personally err on the side it may even have been Battle of Achenar following Mudlark extinction. Achenar (previously known by Achernar) is at the end of Eridanus. Eridanus (sometimes spelled Eridanos) is one of the rivers of Hades. Attaching relevant story snippets and origin story of the Coriolis in the first manual. Anyway, Jaques may be the oldest character in the series.

The system bears the traditional name of Achernar (sometimes spelled Achenar), derived from the Arabic آخر النهر ākhir an-nahr, meaning "The End of the River". However, it seems that this name originally referred to Theta Eridani instead, which latterly was known by the similar traditional name Acamar, with the same etymology. The IAU Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) approved the name with the spelling Achernar for the component Alpha Eridani A on 30 June 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.
