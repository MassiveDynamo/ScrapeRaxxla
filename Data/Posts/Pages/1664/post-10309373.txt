In the Elite: Dangerous CODEX it states the Coriolis and basically any current version of starport (including obis and the others) are all BREWER made. There was one Rival corp that created a station I think in TAU CETI, which summaraly had an 'accident'. Since then no one has gone away from Brewer.
