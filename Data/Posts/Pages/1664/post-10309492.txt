My quote is from the official Elite: Dangerous lore that all rank and file CMDRs get. Coriolis was created by Brewer corp.
This game launched in 1984 and started in a backwater dictatorship system by the name of Lave. It's leader at the time, Dr. Hans Walden, was particularly noted for his usage of propaganda. It is entirely possible for both statements to be true. According to the Elite Pilots' Federation, the Coriolis owes it's origin to Brewer Corporation. According to Jaques himself, he was instrumental in the design of Coriolis which became his initial base, Peter's Base in Facece. One is a primary source and other second-hand source. Regardless, I mentioned the year of the launch of the series because of a quote from George Orwell's "1984" that is particularly important to keep in mind:

“The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.”

-George Orwell from "1984"

If I had wanted to harm others, all that had to be done is blindly agree with the consensus or simply never speak out. I spoke out because the watered down version that has been officially sanctioned is not helpful in finding Raxxla, and the community needs to come to terms with that idea. That and Frontier Developments and David Braben consider it to be one continuous universe.
