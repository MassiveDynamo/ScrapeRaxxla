A bit more on the orishas: Oduduwa was the one who descended on the golden chain to create Earth - an alternative name present as a system is Odudu.
He usurped the role from his brother Obatala (Oxal√°, Orishala), who was assigned the role but got distracted by a party on the way out. As punishment, Olorun relegated the latter to create humankind - and the reason for our flaws is that he hit the liquor too much on the job.

The Empire/Underworld - Federation/Chaos - Alliance/Empyrean arrangement seems definitely on purpose, and a natural extension from how FFE presented them:

We can then extrapolate that, if Raxxla is indeed Eden (perhaps on literal Earth?), it's necessary to find the gates of the Empyrean somewhere in the historical Alliance-Federation border and then the golden ladder to descend on.
...speaking of which, wasn't the Halsey tour all about the Federal frontier?

After some more thinking, I'm not very sold on Erebus because "Hell's Gate" is directly related to Jaques as the battle site where Imperials captured him and did further modifications afterwards.
So the answer might be somewhere else on the tale of our cyborg bartender explorer friend.
