The stuff the Pilot's Federation gives out is woefully lacking in context. Sure, you can find that trade post to sell your cargo, just don't think the Elite Pilots' Federation is giving up any of their power.
-and at the same time the entry on raxxla in the codex is to be taken very literal wrt clues.
Agree on them not seceding power.


It is a bit interesting it was said that anymore clues and it would be a spoiler.
