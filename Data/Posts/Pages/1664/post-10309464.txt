I understand all that. However, sometimes it is better to consider the official lore of Elite Dangerous the officially sanctioned version of the Elite Pilots' Federation history that they allow the public and rank and file CMDRs to know. Heresy is deeply interwoven in the story especially via the Revised Catholic Mission of Aymiay, Sol, and Beta Hydri.
My quote is from the official Elite: Dangerous lore that all rank and file CMDRs get. Coriolis was created by Brewer corp.
