Allow me to explain why I am an explorer: unlike the dystopic hell-scape we find ourselves in, you can trust yourself because there no one else in control. It is far better then to be the map-maker than the poor fool who wronged the map-maker and is sent with potentially bad or incomplete information as karma.

The stuff the Pilot's Federation gives out is woefully lacking in context. Sure, you can find that trade post to sell your cargo, just don't think the Elite Pilots' Federation is giving up any of their power.
