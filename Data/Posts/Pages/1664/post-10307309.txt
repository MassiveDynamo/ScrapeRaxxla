Oh, if your're that desperate that you want to try flying into things then I would suggest you try flying into that dark gas giant in Shinrarta Dezhra, I think it was B3. Pretty spooky fellow, that one.
If it's got anything resembling an Omphalos then I'm up for trying to fly into it!
But it will have to wait a while....just got 4 skill magazines to get in Starfield and then the final two missions before NG+
