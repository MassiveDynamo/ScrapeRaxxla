There’s a huge flaw!- the hypothesis is based on the premise that the rumour of Raxxla was caused by somebody actually physically discovering it! Which is not necessary, nor likely given the fsd ranges of the time (7ly or less).

I pointed out a couple of pages ago that IMHO it is more likely that an astronomical anomaly was discovered which gave rise to the rumour. Somebody may later have physically discovered it & perhaps that gave rise to TDW (e.g. legendary explorer Augustus Brenquith, who may have reported the discovery in his message crystal found in Sol). The “Mother Gaia” faction might actually be the “mother of galaxies” and a hint to the Gaia astrometric space telescope which IIRC launched in 2013. Say the anomaly was detected circa 2016, then 2016-2296 is plenty of time for a report of an astronomical anomaly to turn into a rumour. Even without any physical discovery.

That potentially false premise (that the short fsd range of the time implied Raxxla must be near Sol) misled me for a long while. But there is a hint in the codex that the astronomical anomaly hypothesis is the way to go.

And David Braben loves astronomy!

That's interesting. When I was recently taking my 'codex only' run at Raxxla originally I actually interpreted the "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" as possibly a wolf-rayet, but I thought they weren't actually in the game so I discounted that entirely without checking (stupid).

Then @Thatchinho, @CMDR Davanix, and @CMDRCorrMorningstarFelian a few posts back were discussing that odd system, Lawd 26, which I also didn't know about, that's close to Sol and seems to contain:

LAWD 26 (the Bubble's only Wolf-Rayet).

That would be something astronomically interesting (right?) and reachable within our timeframe.
