Raxxla must have been discovered, then leaked, before 2296 in order for Art to write about it.
There’s a flaw in the logic here, as it presupposes that the discovery of Raxxla is the only thing which could lead to the rumour of Raxxla.

The Codex equates the legend of Raxxla to those of Atlantis, El Dorado, and the Kingdom of Prester John.

I think a good test of the logic is to consider an equivalent phrase to Art Tornqvist’s, but with any of the above substituted in for ‘Raxxla’, and then consider what conclusions would be drawn about the discovery of the aforesaid places in that scenario.

(Or to put it another way, if we’re going off the codex, I don’t think we can ignore the part of the codex that implies that the rumour of Raxxla didn’t originate from Raxxla being discovered.)

That’s not to dismiss the rest of the analysis by the way. It’s absolutely an avenue worth exploring. We just need to be careful not to draw conclusions which might not be valid.
