I know. New is - decal must be painted on current ship used
Mmm, fraid Iâ€™ve had the triple elite decal on my ship for about 2 years, been all over the bubble and havent seen any sign of the Real Dark Wheel or an invitation!

Lots of people have got triple elite, I gather many have now got extra Elite rankings; nobody has reported any DW interest!

I think the answer is in the codex!
