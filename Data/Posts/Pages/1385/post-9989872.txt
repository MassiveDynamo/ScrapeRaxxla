@Allen Stroud as you penned this beacon, will you know definitely the FTL top speed / distance for a vessel at that period of time, up to 2296?
Nope. Sorry.

In terms of the dates and expansion rates, I started with the material I was given (and had), using that as the basis for a better 'history book'. A case of pulling information from several sources. Calculations regarding dates and distances would have been done by other people after I submitted the content.

The guidebook files were never designed for beacons as the concept didn't exist when I wrote the material. Most of the beacon content text being shared here are paragraphs from the guidebook files that I wrote which Frontier decided to use later when the network was installed in the game.

In was nearly ten years ago, by the way.
