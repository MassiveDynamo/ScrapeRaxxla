Just because there are a few new guys around now, here is a list of things which I personally collected in the codex / ranks / permits, etc. Being triple elite, carrying the badge, having no bounties, max rank in everything (except CQC for me), visited all of the tourist beacons (although more have been added in the last year or so). It was two years' work, and amounted to nothing, as expected. Just to save you from feeling you have to do it.... Over the years, we've published a fair amount of Raxxla/lore digging, and most of it ended up in this mega thread somewhere! We've investigated Holdstock, Braben, Stroud (hi...), and spoken to several of the authors directly.

I know its a horrific thing, but please read this thread. don't go over old ground, and above all, if its not in the game, its just rumour!
