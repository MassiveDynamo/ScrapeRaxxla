@Allen Stroud that's really useful info was there plans for a printed history book? That would have been amazingly cool! I remember reading the future history timeline in the Frontier Elite 2 manual. I enjoy this but I always sort of wanted it in a book, like some relic that fell back through time, Grey's Sports Almanac style!
I doubt it. When I did the work I provided the material to Frontier. If they wanted to do something like that it would be up to them.

The same documents were then used as source materials for the RPGs. So, that would be the nearest thing to a published work like that. Spidermind Games had plans for more individually focused supplement works, which I was due to write if there was demand for them.
