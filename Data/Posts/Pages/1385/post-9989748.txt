AHH! So they started in Beta Hydra and moved to Achenar a whole year.
This is first paragraph of two from "Logistical Nightmare" and it apparently only took a few weeks and we had fuel scoops already:

In the fall of 2323, the fleet journeyed from its staging area at Beta Hydri towards the Achenar system over a period of several weeks. The systems between Achenar and Beta Hydri were largely unexplored at the time, with only a few embryonic colonies at the beginning of the journey incapable of supplying the Federal fleet other than by scooping fuel. This caused Admiral Morgan considerable logistical difficulties and forced him to move only as fast as the slowest ship, with many turning back.
