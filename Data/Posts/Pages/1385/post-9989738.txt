There is even more details in "Logistical Nightmare" beacon in Beta Hydri of the trip to Achenar and the results upon arrival. Weirdly mentioned is Federal hunting pack maneuver being weaponized against the Federation due to an intelligence leak that occurred.
AHH! So they started in Beta Hydra and moved to Achenar a whole year.

So they didn't start their travels at the start of 2323 but at the Fall of 2323, and didn't arrive until the start of 2324
