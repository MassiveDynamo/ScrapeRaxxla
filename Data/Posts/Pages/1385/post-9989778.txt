It does certainly seem like early Hyperdrive wasn't that slow, slow by 3300 FSD standards, sure, but it still creates a massive area of 'exploration and discovery' by 2296.

The only thing we do definitely know is that it was difficult and dangerous to travel far and it usually ended poorly, or required vast funding (and still seemed to end poorly). Achenar was settled because it was far from Sol and therefore out of the Fed's easy reach. It's 139ly away, and the info @Cunder and @CMDRCorrMorningstarFelian highlighted shows that it wasn't an easy trip even with hyperdrive 100 years after Art Tornqvist's journal entry.

I've seen there's a project to scan every body within 200ly of Sol and the numbers there show something between 68,000 and 135,000 star systems.

I'm personally liking the idea that Sol is way more important than I previously ever considered.

Also... Stargoids do seem to be heading Sol-wards...

... maybe they know something!

... ARE THE THARGOIDS LOOKING FOR RAXXLA?!!
