Mmm, fraid Iâ€™ve had the triple elite decal on my ship for about 2 years, been all over the bubble and havent seen any sign of the Real Dark Wheel or an invitation!

Lots of people have got triple elite, I gather many have now got extra Elite rankings; nobody has reported any DW interest!

I think the answer is in the codex!
Maybe you need ALL Elites - up to 5/V - like that other poster recently:

6 x Elite V - It is done!

... Might be worth drafting them into this forum - get them to collect all permits and use them as a guinea pig.
