Lawd 26 is quite interesting system. The tourist beacon is #52 'Scorched World' and is a User-Submitted one in series 1, ie. not written by FDev, and one of the first submitted.
System contains a Primary WD with asteroid belts and a GG with 6 moons. Secondary is the WR with the single scorched planet.

Due to its mass, you arrive at the secondary star when jumping in. It is a populated system, with a player faction. Stone's Legacy is one of those semi-complete Ocellus stations - ie, no habitation ring. Nothing of note in-station.
