dont multi-star systems blow out when you look at them a certain way in the galaxy map....so the two stars here are probably blown out from the center point of the view so it loos like you're centered on nothing but really there are two stars just to the sides of your circle that represent the system ... they should collapse to a single point when not centered on the system if that's the case.
