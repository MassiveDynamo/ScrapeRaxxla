Who knows about Raxxa? - think about it. A graphics designer, sound engineer, visual effects or whatever team to design Raxxla. Agreed, a few people probably know what it is and what it looks like or sounds like. However theres no reason at all for them to know where it is. They don't have to place it in game, that's one person job. Who is that person? My most likely candidate Michael Brookes with input from David Braben and probably A.N. other. Why would you tell a Community Manager the biggest game secret? MB implemented Drews Eurydice system from an Excel document with very little discussion with Drew, it was a surprise for him in effect to find it exactly as he imagined it. I don't know who had a say about where it was placed, Drew doesn't mention it specifically I don't think but it may be tied into his books narrative. Also DB intervened once in Drews storyline to say that an Earth like planet wouldn't exist in the orbit he had it placed around that type of star, that's a tiny detail that nobody would really notice but it mattered to DB, says a lot to me about the thinking behind it and the implications for the DW station and Raxxla could be significant, or may mean nothing at all.

Golconda makes it clear there doesnt have to be a narrative, thats the problem for me, it doesn't have to make sense, I just hope it does.

Where is all the Nazi gold? The assets of its victims looted, transported, hidden and laundered in collusion with many collaborative institutions, but no one knows where.
