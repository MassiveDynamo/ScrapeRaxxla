I am in the process of bookmarking a lot of stars for an upcoming expedition. Has it ever happened to you where you type in the name of a star and the galaxy map takes you to a blank region, almost as if something should be there but isn't?

To that end, what do you get as a result when you search for HD 144218 on the map?

Is it just mislocated or is it this:

Black dwarf
Hello, I have one idea. How about adding black dwarfs? Black dwarfs are white dwarfs that have cooled and therefore do not emit (or weakly emit) in the visible range. They represent the final stage of evolution of white dwarfs in the absence of accretion. Although our scientists believe that...

Could this be the, "Yes, we know where raxxla is and we know why nobody has found it?!" Sounds awfully similar.

This would be the even odder version of it's behind a locked permit.

Yea, I get a location near graffias in the middle of nowhere. I used to try this with those giant gas things. I find stars that I can jump between that make my hyper jump go through the objects. Maybe we can get to it somehow. Or could it be manually flown too?

Possible jumps:

HIP 79124 - Col 359 Sector TA-K B11-3
HIP 79124 - Col 359 Sector RF-K B11-0
HIP 79124 - HIP 77406
Graffias - Col 359 Sector OU-L B10-0
Graffias - Col 359 Sector OU-L B10-4
Col 359 Sector QF-K B11-4 - Col 359 Sector OU-L B10-0
Col 359 Sector LB-W D2-55 - HIP 79369


The map uses dimness to show stars. The idea in that thread is that some are so dim you can't see them. It's possible this is the case.

We have super bright stars we can see from very far away. It only makes sense we have super dim ones we can't.

It's stored under abandoned settlements in the archives in my codex?!

Also there is a single degraded emmisions threat 0 halfway between the two stars at 357ls away. Are those types of things usually between two stars like that? The star is twice that away. It's going away from the other star a bit also. I wonder what the longest distance a USS can be out since they can only be up for 30 minutes. Although I guess that wouldn't matter since you could start near it and get lucky.

This seems to be related to these. If you add a bunch of these up do they go to something in general. Can you triangulate these quests as a whole? Is it related to guardian stuff?
