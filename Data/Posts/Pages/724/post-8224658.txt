Abandonded Settlements - Yes they are stored under this as you ended up at an abandoned settlement, bit of a giveaway after one LP I know. Instead of triangulating just note the names of the systems in the Nav Panel that fit into the range. usually only 1 system is in correct range of 2 LPs let alone 3 so quickest way to do it. I always fo all 3 though just for the RP.

Degraded - yes they can appear in shipping lanes or routes between A & B stars for example, sometimes 100kls in the wrong direction past the A star away from the B star In uninhabited they seem to be in orbit of the star at whatever distance. They can appear around the B star even if its 650 kls away but obviously you cant get to them in 30 minutes like you say.

Do you really want the answer to the last question or would you rather find it out in game? Theres quite a few LPs to find so it will spoil it.

This one was over 800ls from the b star though. It was no where near anything. 375 from main and 800 from secondary. No other stars. Wasn't sure if it was an oddity.

BTW, this is directly over the path to the invisible system and is exactly 33.0ly away!

This is on Dschubba 7A These weird purple planets(from light I assume) have weird crack like things on them. Any way it's writing? There is a lot and it looks like other characters I've seen before.

BTW, the craters on this planet are very deep and there is a wierd texture on it's surface. Looks like guardian tech.

And the sun is so bright that nightvision doesn't work and isn't visible.
