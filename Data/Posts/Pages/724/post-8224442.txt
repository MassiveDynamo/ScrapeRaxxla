I am in the process of bookmarking a lot of stars for an upcoming expedition. Has it ever happened to you where you type in the name of a star and the galaxy map takes you to a blank region, almost as if something should be there but isn't?

To that end, what do you get as a result when you search for HD 144218 on the map?
