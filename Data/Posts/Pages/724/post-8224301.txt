So a lot depends on who wrote the story and how much lore they gave credence to and what explanations if any they use to explain the mystery and why it hadn't been found before that date (remember Golconda), assuming its discoverable. If we can find out how it is possible it might tell us where it is possible as in a region of space not a system. Who writes the Codex, are they RPing it properly, who wrote Raxxla and the DW in, how did they include it into the narrative if at all, how did they implement it in game etc etc?

We suspect that there has been much retconning of lore. I think the codex is meant to be a re-statement of the lore as it stands now. This means there will be much that is no longer accurate in the official novels, if its contradicted by the codex. So as far as I see it the codex is the only reliable lore now. Everything else is just tales now.

On the plus side that mean DW and Rax are still in
