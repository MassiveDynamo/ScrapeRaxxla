Is it just mislocated or is it this:



Yea, I get a location near graffias in the middle of nowhere. I used to try this with those giant gas things. I find stars that I can jump between that make my hyper jump go through the objects. Maybe we can get to it somehow. Or could it be manually flown too?

Possible jumps:

HIP 79124 - Col 359 Sector TA-K B11-3
HIP 79124 - Col 359 Sector RF-K B11-0
HIP 79124 - HIP 77406
Graffias - Col 359 Sector OU-L B10-0
Graffias - Col 359 Sector OU-L B10-4
Col 359 Sector QF-K B11-4 - Col 359 Sector OU-L B10-0
Col 359 Sector LB-W D2-55 - HIP 79369


The map uses dimness to show stars. The idea in that thread is that some are so dim you can't see them. It's possible this is the case.

We have super bright stars we can see from very far away. It only makes sense we have super dim ones we can't.

Graffias listening post:


It's stored under abandoned settlements in the archives in my codex?!

Also there is a single degraded emmisions threat 0 halfway between the two stars at 357ls away. Are those types of things usually between two stars like that? The star is twice that away. It's going away from the other star a bit also. I wonder what the longest distance a USS can be out since they can only be up for 30 minutes. Although I guess that wouldn't matter since you could start near it and get lucky.

This seems to be related to these. If you add a bunch of these up do they go to something in general. Can you triangulate these quests as a whole? Is it related to guardian stuff?

Abandonded Settlements - Yes they are stored under this as you ended up at an abandoned settlement, bit of a giveaway after one LP I know. Instead of triangulating just note the names of the systems in the Nav Panel that fit into the range. usually only 1 system is in correct range of 2 LPs let alone 3 so quickest way to do it. I always fo all 3 though just for the RP.

Degraded - yes they can appear in shipping lanes or routes between A & B stars for example, sometimes 100kls in the wrong direction past the A star away from the B star In uninhabited they seem to be in orbit of the star at whatever distance. They can appear around the B star even if its 650 kls away but obviously you cant get to them in 30 minutes like you say.

Do you really want the answer to the last question or would you rather find it out in game? Theres quite a few LPs to find so it will spoil it.
