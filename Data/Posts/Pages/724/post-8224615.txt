The map uses dimness to show stars. The idea in that thread is that some are so dim you can't see them. It's possible this is the case.

We have super bright stars we can see from very far away. It only makes sense we have super dim ones we can't.

Not sure that thread has a source for the info. Also seems to be some dispute about whether the Universe is old enough to have them. How does it fit in with 'tiny bit obvious' if its too dim to see on the map and we cant even filter for it? Only way I can see is if it has a planetary nebula which is visible with all filters off but thats a stretch.
