Could be some crude joke, but hey, this is the Raxxla forum, right? Maybe he said the thruth by accident. He doesnt grin..
What about the Romero story? Can't remember. Was it just a Galnet Hoax? He talked about a place glowing like heaven and round like a sphere!? So everybody started their FTL drives and raced towards the bubble nebula. But nothing was found. Maybe we should have checked all rings and asteroid belts too! I didn't do that.
By the way. I checked some fibonacci related HIP systems. No joy so far..
This sounds like the bubble nebula. I didn't find anything but this was admittedly before i had any real understanding of exploration tools. I just honked, fss'd and left because everything was already tagged.
