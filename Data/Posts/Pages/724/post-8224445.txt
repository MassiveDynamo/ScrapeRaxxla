Am enjoying this.. i like the asteroid belt theory.
Just going to point out that the Codex calls out three distinct thing related to all this... Raxxla, The Dark Wheel Station, and the Omphalos Rift (an artefact). Well four if you think raxxla is a gateway to another place.. whatever that other place might be ( Im going to go with the "Raxxlaverse").

So we have a possible planet( or who knows what), a dark station and an artefact. The station is supposedly on the eighth moon of some unnamed gas giant. Just a thought but as there are 33 dashes around the sun symbol on the raxxla icon... could we be looking for the eighth moon of a gas giant in a 33 body system? ... Just something to think about next time u are honking your way through systems...
