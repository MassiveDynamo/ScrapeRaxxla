Prior to Michelson/Morley experiment it was logical to believe that the speed of light would vary depending on the direction of movement relative to the aether. The experiment showed no such variation, and as technology and techniques improve measurement accuracy over time it has been repeated (as are measurements in other aspects of physics, in case some new effect might be found). No variation in C has been detected, so speed of light is constant whatever you do; therefore aether doesnâ€™t exist & that fact led Einstein directly to postulating his theory of Relativity.
Oops, I forgot the /s tags again, didn't I...

Science is far from settled, and will never be, or it's be-LIE-f and dogma, not ongoing scientific inquiry...

Apparently the speed of light does vary, as do some of the other supposed constants: See 09:51 onward:
