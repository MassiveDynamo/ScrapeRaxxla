Been talking with Rochester about Holdstocks ragthorn book…. Going back over the art tornquist and cora names associated with the first known mention of raxxla….

Art Tornquist always made me think of King Arthur (Glastonbury tree). Cora could refer to the Lady Elaine … I tend to lean not towards the Lady of Shalott … but rather the Lady of Corbenic (in game). Maiden of the Grail… Of course she was entwined with Lancelot- not Arthur. But as part of the trials associated with Elaine … Lancelot killed a Dragon…

Ya i think this is a reference to the standard archetype of hero/god fights with snake/ dragon

And a nice depiction of Lancelots Dragon slaying done by Rackham! (where does he find the time?)


This is an example of snakes as guardians of the tree of life/axis. And the need to fight them for access… The grail is an object that is associated with life giving powers ( think soma /amrit) - in Christian ideas the path to god is through christ - he is associated with the tree/axis - see the Dream of the Rood. This is the golden chain - the path to the Sun Door read coomaraswamy.

I think we need to steal something guarded by the thargoids… we already did that to an extent with the meta-alloys…
