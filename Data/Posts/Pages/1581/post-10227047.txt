Note these deities don’t share any commonalities that I’m aware of: the Morrigan was thought to be possibly one person, just going by other name, whilst the Norns were not fates, nor muses or either goddess, and they didn’t represent ‘youth, maturity nor death’.

I would argue that the norns and fates are representing the same thing. They are both arbiters of fate or wyrd. The norns are even sometimes cast in the “weaving of fate” role:

“Mightily wove they
the web of fate,
While Bralund's towns
were trembling all;
And there the golden
threads they wove,
And in the moon's hall
fast they made them.”
-Helgakvida Hundingsbana I

Even talks about the golden thread … er chain…

Interesting that they are so nicely bundled together there.
