I would argue that the norns and fates are representing the same thing. They are both arbiters of fate or wyrd. The norns are even sometimes cast in the “weaving of fate” role:

“Mightily wove they
the web of fate,
While Bralund's towns
were trembling all;
And there the golden
threads they wove,
And in the moon's hall
fast they made them.”
-Helgakvida Hundingsbana I

Even talks about the golden thread … er chain…

Interesting that they are so nicely bundled together there.
I would agree, their in game relative positioning would certainly re-enforce this.

It’s obvious to my experienced eye such systems; namely Yggdrasil and the Lost Realms, have been inserted into game by hand and placed so intentionally.

To the extent that ‘supporting’ elements such as Greek and Celtic deities correlate and contextualise each other!

I’m impressed by the level of restraint there has been, none of these symbolic groupings seem to fall into uniformity. To my eye this might indicate the author has placed elements so they ‘draw’ the attention through classical associations, towards a fulcrum in the Lost Realms area, not necessarily wholly via visual senses, although that too is evident.

This to my experience shows the level of creativity and knowledge of the author, I can’t express fully how impressive it is. I hope FD understands what an amazing work this cosmological construct is. I can only wonder at what ‘might have been’ if the older DW missions were still in game.

I am as you know of the opinion, all of this is by the hand of Brookes, and these constructions visually build a three dimensional cosmology construct of his (supposedly) unwritten book.

The journey we all much take, is the journey to the ‘Otherworld’, to our time upon the mountain, to follow our fernweh back to those older lands.
