I disagree. It is possible.There would be limits to this of course;

Look at the several handcrafted worlds and 'old' mission lines that were removed. Just like chasing down ships for hunting missions or recieving secret comms while following beacons.
All is still there. Everything works yet. But not enough for you. That what I said before. Game has no end, so it needs infinite work in that way.
Paid quests are there, extra quests need extra payment.
