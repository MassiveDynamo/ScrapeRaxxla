Yeah, the cut scenes are time saving but quickly become boring. But then long flights between systems in ED are also boring...

Bethesda have obviously put a lot of effort into making the cutscenes graphically attractive, but ED is inherently beautiful (though I preferred the pre-Odyssey visuals). The ideal would be to beef up ED with decent storylines. Perhaps the devs will play Starfield and learn some lessons!?
I'd love to see Bethesda + Frontier to collab.
Bethesda does ground and quest interaction, Frontier does Space.
I'm enjoying Starfield but long to pick up the helm to search for Raxxla again.
