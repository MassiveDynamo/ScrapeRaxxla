Wondering if we have been neglecting a distinct possibility - that Raxxla is one or several objects that when combined in a specific way or at a specific place activates the Omphalos Rift. The Martian Relic was tiny - only the size of a human child's palm. There are numerous other references to similar small but important objects. This is from Wanted. The Journey may be part of realizing what these key objects are and how they must be used either alone or together.
