I'm trying to remember. I'm sure I came across something somewhere that said that Raxxla was guarded, there were people living there that would kill to protect the secret. Maybe Reclamation? I will try to find the source, I may have totally made it up...
That'll probably be the people that had Jason Ryder assassinated. From the last page of TDW (following directly from the quote I posted above):

"'But why?' Alex asked. 'Why kill him for finding Raxxla?'

'Because there are people on Raxxla already. This is only a guess, mind you, but from what
happened to Jason I'd say it was close to being right. We've long suspected that a corps of Ã©lites
lives there, and are exploiting the gateway. They're powerful, twisted men. Powerful enough to hire
an assassin to kill the threat to their dominance.'"
