Looking for confirmation.

To the best of my knowledge any mention of Raxxla is completely missing from Frontier: Elite II and Frontier: First Encounters, correct?

Yes.

Raxxla was never mentioned in any game ever. Actually, it's not ever been in any game prior to ED (and afaik it's still never been actually mentioned in game).

EDIT: Sorry, let me qualify this a bit:

Raxxla wasn't in Elite, FE2 or FFE as a named object (no-one found it via data-mining or anything like that).
It wasn't mentioned in the FE2 Gazeteer or FFE Journals.

I don't believe it was mentioned elsewhere, but it's possible it was mentioned in the short stories that accompanies both games - though I don't think so (been a while since I read them), and I haven't been able to find the searchable version of the FE2 journals to check, but I don't think it was in there either.
