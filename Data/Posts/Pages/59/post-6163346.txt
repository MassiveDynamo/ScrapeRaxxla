Great observation Han.

I've always looked at the 7 light-year limit as being a feature of the Thru-Space drive but you are absolutely right. The limit was based on available fuel. I'd rep you twice if I could.

Agreed, it's a great point. And I'm already out of rep!

Forgot the golden rule of Elite - never do a jump that doesn't leave you some in the tank. (Well not without saving immediately beforehand anyway)!
