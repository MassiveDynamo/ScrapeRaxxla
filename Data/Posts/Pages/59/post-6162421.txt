Regarding the 7ly jump range of the Cobra in Elite. As far as I remember, it was a fuel limit. If you jumped 7ly, the tank was empty. If you jumped 3ly, you had fuel left for a 4ly jump.

Fitting a bigger tank would probably have given more range.

Great observation Han.

I've always looked at the 7 light-year limit as being a feature of the Thru-Space drive but you are absolutely right. The limit was based on available fuel. I'd rep you twice if I could.
