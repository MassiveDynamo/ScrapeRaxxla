Took a bit of finding, but here you go:

Post from CookieJarviz

"You people seem to forget that the missing can only go as far as 1000ly. and you say the ancient's might be the missing/ a lost cononly. but they specifically went for systems with ELWs"

Reply from Michael Brookes:

"That's not strictly true. Most of the missing aren't on generation ships - they're just the most famous - and oldest. The later generation ships were also capable of FTL."


Awesome

Also BTW forgot to mention, Jameson's Mycoid attack was around 3150-3151 since that's when the war ended and all Thargoids vanished (Sarasvati logs).
