Yes.

Raxxla was never mentioned in any game ever. Actually, it's not ever been in any game prior to ED (and afaik it's still never been actually mentioned in game).

EDIT: Sorry, let me qualify this a bit:

Raxxla wasn't in Elite, FE2 or FFE as a named object (no-one found it via data-mining or anything like that).
It wasn't mentioned in the FE2 Gazeteer or FFE Journals.

I don't believe it was mentioned elsewhere, but it's possible it was mentioned in the short stories that accompanies both games - though I don't think so (been a while since I read them), and I haven't been able to find the searchable version of the FE2 journals to check, but I don't think it was in there either.

Good point. While Raxxla isn't mentioned "in game" in the original Elite it is central to the accompanying Dark Wheel novella ... which, given the state of 8 bit games in 1984 I take accompanying literature as on par to an in game reference. None of the literature accomanying Elite 2 & 3 mentions Raxxla so what I intended to clarify is whether there are any oblique references to Raxxla in the games (2&3) themselves.

My understanding is that the only references to Raxxla in the Elite universe is TDW and a short mention in John Harper's And Here The Wheel.
