Fair point!

And that's made me wonder.... how would the actions of the people on Raxxla have differed in the two different scenarios of Jason finding Raxxla vs Jason finding evidence of Raxxla's existence, and is there's anything we can deduce from that...

I suspect if he’d found Raxxla they would have killed him there, whereas if he had merely found evidence if its existence they would have sent an assassin after him.

mmmmm

unless he was killed at Raxxla, except it must be off the beaten track to require an expedition to find it, so he wouldn’t have taken his son there.....
