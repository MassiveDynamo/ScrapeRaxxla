We don't know for a fact that Jason didn't find Raxxla. He died before he was able to deliver all of the information he had to the rest of The Dark Wheel. Rafe knew, through Jason's last words to Alex, that Jason had found evidence that Raxxla was real. We don't know with any degree of certainty just what evidence he'd managed to uncover. He could have found Raxxla itself ... or maybe he just found archival evidence proving that Raxxla was real.

This is typically what we mean when we say that Jason found Raxxla. Whatever he found had got him pretty excited ... maybe even more excited then I was when I stumbled on Steven Eisler's The Alien World and found out that Raxxla predates the Original Elite and The Dark Wheel novella by a number of years.

It really doesn't matter if Jason actually stumbled on Raxxla itself or simply uncovered evidence that would lead to it's discovery. Either way it's the springboard for our current quest and one of the few tenuous references to Raxxla that we have.

Fair point!

And that's made me wonder.... how would the actions of the people on Raxxla have differed in the two different scenarios of Jason finding Raxxla vs Jason finding evidence of Raxxla's existence, and is there's anything we can deduce from that...
