Agreed, I’m just being pedantic, I just find it lazy; if there is content we are missing do something in game to highlight this, not some 2 hour long social media blog… don’t waste our time.

I agree it is likely totally irrelevant. My assumption is primarily based upon their continued sly reference to things they won’t name, invoking the name of Braben etc. like they aren’t allowed to say the word Raxxla.

Just venting steam.
It's much worse, how can you look for something and get answers where there are artificially limited areas without any explanation. You can not fly there because it is simply limited in the code of the game.
