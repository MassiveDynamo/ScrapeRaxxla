Have been pondering upon this location myself for some time, it does seem interestingly placed.

In relation to the systems first discovered, it is just outside the sphere of influence prescribed by Achenar and the date 2296, but not close enough I initially established to warrant further investigation ‘at that time’, but I kept it on my radar.

However, if you apply the Yggdrasil systems, the star system closest to it within that model would be Nithhogg, and then Jotunheim, if viewed in direct alignment.

It is also typically within the hypothetical lower celestial hemisphere of the underworld if you accept my ‘John Milton’ and ‘Better to reign in hell’ hypothesis, so it would potentially fit. I think this is tantalising.

The other two systems mentioned in the above link don’t seem to correlate initially, one being someway off (yet relatively close) and the other falls within the sphere of influence… however when you view all 3 together they might form a .

This potential ‘triangle’ isn’t equilateral, but part of it does fall within the sphere of influence…within the lower celestial hemisphere, I will be attempting to plot its centre, which I suspect falls close to the ‘outer rim’ of the sphere of influence.

Crack open the tin-foil…

The trip to Achenar may not have been straight from Tau Ceti. Capella contains bodies: Duval's Grave, Lawrence's Grave, Gold, Molotov's Claim, and Nobleworld. I would check the codex for the Empire and GalNet "Birth of an Empire". The first generation ship launched from Sol and then goes to Tau Ceti before going to Achenar. Achenar was settled by the Mayflower 97 from First Encounters journals. Regardless, Capella is visited very early by humans.

However, that could have been where Marlin Duval was taken to be executed by her brother.
