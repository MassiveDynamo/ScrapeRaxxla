Agreed, Roger that.

I’m just being overly pedantic, when you love something so passionately, one tends to overreact

I just find such actions misleading; if there is content we are missing do something in game to highlight this, fix it, not some 2 hour long social media blog… don’t waste our time, ultimately it just makes it feel like FD hold all the cards, which is disheartening.

I agree it is likely totally irrelevant. My assumption is primarily based upon their continued sly references to things they won’t name, invoking the name of Braben etc. like they aren’t allowed to say the word Raxxla directly!

It doesn’t actually help, it just confuses and conflates the issue. I wish they just left it all alone. Then again I just miss Brookes.

Just venting steam, I am just becoming increasingly despondent about this entire endeavour.

I sympathise! I’m in burnout & not playing at the moment.
I think this is FD’s attitude, which I also find very off-putting. I find livestreams generally a complete waste of time and nor do I tweet at all! Perhaps I’m just showing my luddite age, I like a storyline! But I’m having difficulty in finding books that I want to read at the moment.
Agreed, I miss him too. While MB’s hints were never very helpful, they at least gave the impression that someone was listening to us!
Never mind, Starfield is on its way! Though I’m no longer holding out much hope for that either
