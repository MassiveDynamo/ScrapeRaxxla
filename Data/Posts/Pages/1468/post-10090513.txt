Ah, the irrestible joys of being a tourist...seeing exciting new places, experiencing colorful personas. Oh joy!
SPOILER: SLAVERY

I've wondered how a solid lead could be presented to a CMDR, this kind of wrinkle could be one way.
The question to resolve is does “a legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters” imply that TDW are actually pirates and slavers?

I’ve pointed out in the past that Elizabethan-era pirates were referred to as “gentlemen adventurers”. So, how warped is DB’s sense of humour?
