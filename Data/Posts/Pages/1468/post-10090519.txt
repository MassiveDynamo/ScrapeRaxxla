I think you’re digging your own hole there! Whatever makes you assume this “subtle environmental storytelling” is anything at all to do with Raxxla?

Of course there might be some clues about Raxxla in USS, or elsewhere, but we have never noticed any otherwise they would have been reported in this thread. So as part of the Quest carry on playing; investigate all asteroid clusters and look in USS, especially mission givers and permanent signal source (i.e. no expiration countdown), but don’t beat yourself up. This is just adding some more fluffy flavour to the fluffy game.
Agreed, Roger that.

I’m just being overly pedantic, when you love something so passionately, one tends to overreact

I just find such actions misleading; if there is content we are missing do something in game to highlight this, fix it, not some 2 hour long social media blog… don’t waste our time, ultimately it just makes it feel like FD hold all the cards, which is disheartening.

I agree it is likely totally irrelevant. My assumption is primarily based upon their continued sly references to things they won’t name, invoking the name of Braben etc. like they aren’t allowed to say the word Raxxla directly!

It doesn’t actually help, it just confuses and conflates the issue. I wish they just left it all alone. Then again I just miss Brookes.

Just venting steam, I am just becoming increasingly despondent about this entire endeavour.
