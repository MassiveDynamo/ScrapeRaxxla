The trip to Achenar may not have been straight from Tau Ceti. Capella contains bodies: Duval's Grave, Lawrence's Grave, Gold, Molotov's Claim, and Nobleworld. I would check the codex for the Empire and GalNet "Birth of an Empire". The first generation ship launched from Sol and then goes to Tau Ceti before going to Achenar. Achenar was settled by the Mayflower 97 from First Encounters journals. Regardless, Capella is visited very early by humans.

However, that could have been where Marlin Duval was taken to be executed by her brother.
Maybe but Capella is only 40 ly from Sol so is too close in my opinion to have any correlative relationship with that of Demeter, Persephone and Pandemonium; if my interpretation of the Codex (Cora being drunk / pirates) is valid, but will consider it.
