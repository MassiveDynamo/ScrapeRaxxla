Maybe but Capella is only 40 ly from Sol so is too close in my opinion to have any correlative relationship with that of Demeter, Persephone and Pandemonium, but will consider it.
Don't overthink things - even John Milton thought the mind created its own hell and heaven and usually not in favor of the individual. Whatever your intuition is saying run with that. The trip to Achenar must be completed between 2097 - 2296 (so 199 years). I think codex or Galnet put arrival in mid-2200s (believe this was "Birth of an Empire").
