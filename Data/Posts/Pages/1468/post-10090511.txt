I think you’re digging your own hole there! Whatever makes you assume this “subtle environmental storytelling” is anything at all to do with Raxxla?

Of course there might be some clues about Raxxla in USS, or elsewhere, but we have never noticed any otherwise they would have been reported in this thread. So as part of the Quest carry on playing; investigate all asteroid clusters and look in USS, especially mission givers and permanent signal source (i.e. no expiration countdown), but don’t beat yourself up. This is just adding some more fluffy flavour to the fluffy game.
Before signal sources were random, I do not think that changing them into permanent (I think it was not easy in programming) was done only for one purpose - to prevent people from foraging for a lot of materials.
