Based on quotes from "Paradise Lost" seek Hell/Hades/etc as they will serve you better. Heaven comes only from the correct mindset. Besides, Hell in religious terms is an invention of man-kind to control the population. If there is anything like Hell it is closer to Hades than the Christian Hell. The Devil like Hades is allied with Zeus/God/whatever you choose to name it. They are not opposites. This is why I have long asserted we got TDW's invitation in the manual and we are both TDW/The Club at the same time. The Club is just the Elite Pilots' Federation. They do, however, very much run the Bubble even some of the Duval's and other key characters are former or current CMDRs. This is sadly where The Children of Raxxla got stuck. Duality is very often not real.
