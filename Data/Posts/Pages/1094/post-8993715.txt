I discovered (probably not?) That you can cause a fault in the jump to the entry point in the target system. As such, I am calling this a misjump. Fdev can suck a lemon if they don't like it. Now they're in game (or technically out of game as the app is closed when the 'misjump' occurs). Problem solved.

Splitting hairs about the terminology doesn't change what happens. The action causes the ship to come out of its jump routine at a location other than where you should come out of a jump.
