No, itâ€™s hyperdiction!
Misjumps are not in-game according toFD, so not canon lore for ED.
I'm sorry but that doesn't make much sense (to me at least, lol). Apart from the obvious, what is hyper-diction? I mean the mechanics of it, how does hyper-diction cause your ship to drop from witch-space? Somewhat same with interdiction, what is the cause and effect of interdiction that causes a ship to drop out of super cruise into normal space?

I am at the understanding that hyper-diction (and maybe interdiction) causes a commanders ship to misjump (may be known by another name, I don't know) therefore forcing the players ship to drop out to normal space. Could be construed to be a misjump in all but name unless it's something else completely different that drops a ship to normal space.

Like I said, I don't know the mechanics of it and could be completely getting it wrong. Who's to say that hyper-diction and interdiction are not a forced misjump. I believe misjumps are in game and are just known by a different name.
