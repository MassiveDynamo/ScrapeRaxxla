Depends on the definition of a misjump. I think the Thargoids cause apparent misjumps all time when pulling commanders from witch-space.
I've written before, maybe even here, but I'll say it again.
Only Targoid interceptions of commanders are contacts and count in the game.
If we fly to a point with a Targoid, it does not count as contact.
