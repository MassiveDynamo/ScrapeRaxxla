thats hyperdiction. You are always returned to where you started.
It could be that the purpose of hyper-diction is to cause some kind of misjump to force drop you out of hyperspace into normal space. I don't know the mechanics of hyper-diction but it could be a theory worth looking into rather than taking for gospel that FDev confirmed it wasn't in game. It might not have been in game at the time of confirmation but implemented at a later date.
