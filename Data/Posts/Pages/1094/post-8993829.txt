Just thinking about the Hesperus / Adamastor

Both relate to poems about wrecked ships. Both have mythological ties... Hesperus - the Evening Star ... a ship wreacked on Norman's Reef, Adamastor - a later created monster supposedly a Giant from Greek mythology which personified the Cape of Good Hope. ( was hoping for an east vs west thing... but not sure...)

What i find interesting is going back to Adamastor

The Adamastor bit is from a larger epic poem Os Lusidas - about the De Gammas and the discovery of the sea route around the Cape of Good hope to India. Its even got sirens and the machine of the world
