Also it is the 9th planet. Pluto and the rest out ther are dwarf planets.
Yea I find the words we use misleading. Dwarf stars are stars so afaic dwarf planets are planets. Maybe call them something other than planets, right? Like massive asteroids maybe idk. All I'm saying is there would be less confusion if the words we used didn't seem to imply what they apparently don't mean.
