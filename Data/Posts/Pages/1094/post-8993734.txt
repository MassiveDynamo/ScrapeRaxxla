I discovered (probably not?) That you can cause a fault in the jump to the entry point in the target system. As such Fdev, I am calling this a misjump. Fdev can suck a lemon if they don't like it. Now they're in game (or technically out of game as the app is closed when the 'misjump' occurs). Problem solved.

Splitting hairs about the terminology doesn't change what happens. The action causes the ship to come out of its jump routine at a location other than where you should come out of a jump.

There are misjumps - Jacques was an obvious one. I remember MB coming on one of the iterations of the Mysteries thread when we were pfafing around with trying to cause misjumps and - I could have swore he said there was no way to do it. - of course I cant find this quote now.... And I took it to mean there was no Mechanism by which players could cause a Misjump... like in older games.... not that misjumps are now non-canon.
