A misjump is when something goes wrong and you end up in a random destination which is different from where you started and the destination youâ€™d selected. FD said this was not implemented in ED, which is a shame because it might allow circumvention of permit locks.

Hyperdiction happens when a Thargoid snatches you out of hyperspace and you find you are still in your starting system. Effectively you have not jumped out of the system, only within it.
How would the Thargoids snatch you from witch-space during an hyper-diction?
Please don't get me wrong, I know what you're saying, But an hyper-diction only keeps you in the start system but never at the exact same spot that you started the jump. Now the drop out spot may not be as random as you think. I originally asked if hyper-dictions always dropped you in the jump start system or the destination system as well. And if it was (as all seem to now confirm) just the start system then could there be another mechanic to cause a drop out of witch-space in another system. Obviously not named a misjump (as FDev have confirmed?) but a misjump caused by something else out of the players control and named something different. There is one way to drop in out in the destination system and that's to force log-off the game during the jump animation before getting to the destination but I'm pretty sure that's not the way to do it.

Who to say that hyper-diction isn't the Thargoids way of causing something to go wrong with your jump (misjump) and dropping you in a supposed random location (within' the system you start jumping in).
