Just thinking about the Hesperus / Adamastor

Both relate to poems about wrecked ships. Both have mythological ties... Hesperus - the Evening Star ... a ship wreacked on Norman's Reef, Adamastor - a later created monster supposedly a Giant from Greek mythology which personified the Cape of Good Hope. ( was hoping for an east vs west thing... but not sure...)

What i find interesting is going back to Adamastor

The Adamastor bit is from a larger epic poem Os Lusidas - about the De Gammas and the discovery of the sea route around the Cape of Good hope to India. Its even got sirens and the machine of the world

Sounds like that would make a cool mystery map were someone to draw one...
