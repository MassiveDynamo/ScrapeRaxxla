What i still cant fathom is how Jaques ended up in Colonia? its not exactly on the flight path to Beagle and there's no Mercator projection to consider

Oh I think FD fully expected some people to sabotage Jaques' jump by selling UA/TS in his market. The effect supposedly threw him out of hyperspace in a random direction/system, but in practice I suspect FD planned a second human buble there from the outset in view of their plans for the inevitable Thargoid war.
