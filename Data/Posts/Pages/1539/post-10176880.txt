oh I think Beagle Point was a natural choice for Jaques, a cybernetic explorer & likely member of TDW (a group of adventurers and explorers). It's just about the furthest point from the bubble and had already become a focal point destination for other explorers so why not set yourself up as a bartender there, sell drinks and enjoy the bar chat and discussions of discoveries they'd made on the way??
but yes, FD wanted a second bubble and what better way to start it in anticipation of the Thargoid war by moving a station, manned by a cybernetic bartender and his minions, to (what became) Colonia, in a damaged state which would trigger the inevitable long range journeys to support him. A cunning bit of psychology!
