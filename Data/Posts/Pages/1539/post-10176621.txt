The Codex shows that there are guardian ruins all over the galaxy. But I haven't encountered them in the bubble.
Here's likely why: a large portion all Earth-likes in Human space either are 1/3 mass of Earth or functionally have gravity at 1/3 Earth normal. In other words, we cannot see them because we cannot land on Earth-likes. There are definitely ones more geared to normal humans and others geared to the aliens we are on good terms with like First Encounters suggested had happened. This is also why a lot of Orbis and Ocellus have 1 ring that is substantially bigger than the other so 1 ring has 1g and other 0.5g. With Coriolis, if you further away from access of rotation there was automatically less gravity.
