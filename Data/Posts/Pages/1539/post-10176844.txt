What i still cant fathom is how Jaques ended up in Colonia? its not exactly on the flight path to Beagle and there's no Mercator projection to consider

I have slight feeling he wasnt really going to Beagle and just used the hype to get him wherever he was goin but was stopped along the way by the Sensors, Perhaps Hyponia? or getting closer to Hyponia or maybe near a titan in the area caused the sensors to flip? One of the current titans did come more from that direction rather than the direction of the others or they flipped due to him passing directly through a Guardian site (there is some in his path to Colonia in Prua Phoe/Skaudai sector)
