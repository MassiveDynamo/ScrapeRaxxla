If MB set this as a mythology-based puzzle I think you have to remember he was an author & would have been fairly precise in his usage of the concepts.
Tartaurus was the region, so ok for the deepest void, but the whisperer/siren? More likely Hades was the lover, and then could also be the whisperer/siren. However from Paradise Lost it would be Lucifer, who tried to seduce Eve and whispered to her (temptation->siren) about the forbidden fruit.

We might presume Jaques spent the missing years exploring this region in search of Raxxla....I suspect he found it, and then he wanted further adventure so was planning to jump across the galaxy to Beagle Point but was sabotaged by the Thargoid Sensor terrorists.
What i still cant fathom is how Jaques ended up in Colonia? its not exactly on the flight path to Beagle and there's no Mercator projection to consider
