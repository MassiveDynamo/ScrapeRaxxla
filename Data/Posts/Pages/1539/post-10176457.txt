Your options are: Facece, Phekda, or Ayethi (the original home of Walter Argent).

Phekda has 3 earth-likes in orbit of Phekda 4. In other words, they are moons. Also, home to the very cool The Ancients of Mumu. The "moons" are Nirvana, New California, and Topaz. The system has another earth-like simply known as Phekda 3.

In Facece, Topaz is a stand-alone earth-like planet.

In Ayethi, Topaz is a stand-alone earth-like planet.
