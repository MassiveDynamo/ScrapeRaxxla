In regards to Jaques and Yggdrasil there is no definitive correlation, however the existence of the ‘underworld’ area does sit directly below Yggdrasil, and Axis Mundi could be identified as being at its base.
Pilot's Federation is founded in 2805. However, first Elite CMDR doesn't happen until centuries later sometime during 3100s (Peter Jameson). So, clearly Peter Jameson is not the founder of the organization.

Hold up, though, it isn't that simple...

Facece has both the planet Peter's Wreck and station (Coriolis) Peter's Base. So, apparently Peter Jameson did not die in Riedquat as reported in manual of Frontier and First Encounters.

Jaques (aka Peter Jameson) is revealed as being some 300 or more years old in "..All that Glisters". This, however, would put him in line with being sufficiently old to have founded The Pilot's Federation and potentially be the same person as Augustus Brenquith and his "Glistening legacy" who discovered pretty much everything in Frontier gazetteer including Ackwada and Quphieth (this was the Imperials name for it). Quphieth was notable for having the Donaldson starport. In other words, it is known in modern times as the stellar "El Dorado" (language used in Alliance History codex entry in Elite Dangerous) that is Alioth.
