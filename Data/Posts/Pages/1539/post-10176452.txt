We have no evidence linking Jaques to Raxxla, however IIRC there is a similarity to codex TDW logo, which in the past has caused me to muse that Jaques is a member of TDW (not got PC powered yet to check the codex, pity it’s not available on the web! ). Membership of TDW would make sense given his long life, wanderings, knowledge gained through bar room chat etc. Facece is one of the Old Worlds & hence possibility for TDW (“operating since the very earliest days of interstellar travel”). However I have posted in the past about his journeys mentioned in Galnet posts.

Systems visited by Jaques prior to the jump to Colonia:

(There’s a risk that some of the old lore re Jaques is not canon for ED, but we go with what we got!)

Circa 3000 he got a job as bartender in the newly-built Peters Base station at Facece/Topaz (not 8th moon Facece 6g!)
By 3200 he had secured ownership over half of the station. Jaques' dream was to buy out the rest of the station, attach engines to it, and use it to explore the galaxy.
By 3300, Jaques had exchanged Peters Base, a Coriolis, for a more resilient Orbis.

? Feb 3301 - 19 Feb 3301 wandering around HIP 110620

19 Feb 3301 Journeying through HIP 110079 - Unknown date

-16 months gap in record of Jaques’ activities!-

19 May 3302 Jaques jumped from Gliese 1269. Beagle Point was the intended destination, jump expected to take a week but he went missing

28 Jun 3302 Jaques found in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 (Colonia)

So I wonder if that 16 month gap without explanation, (and the Galnet posts seem deliberately intended to call attention to it) means that he spent the time looking for Raxxla? No suggestion of that possibility in the codex, but he is a wanderer (“vagabond”). Do those systems tie in with your mythology-based hypothesis? I do agree that Persephone (greek myth of Demeter &“Kore”) and the Tau Ceti rumour’s “Cora” is suggestive....
do you have a centre system and radius for your suspect region?
