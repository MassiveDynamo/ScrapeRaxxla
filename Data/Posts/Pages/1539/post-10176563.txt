You want to know who built the console for your ships? That's a Saud Kruger Astrogation console. Guess who founded that organization and built the controls - Augustus Brenquith. In other words, the same person suspected of being yet another alias of Jaques "the supplanter". Yet, we cheered this megalomaniac on his exit of the Bubble (presumably). Unless someone else has alternative theories on this, the matter seems fairly straightforward. Especially, given the events involving the D'Writ estate and subsequent destruction of the Rockforth Legal Academy.

ROCKFORTH LEGAL ACADEMY DESTROYED
M.C.S

One of the Galaxy’s newest but nevertheless most prestigious legal Academies was destroyed last week in a series of unannounced bombing raids.

Five separate ships, all bearing false identification markings launched devastating point-blank missile attacks on the Academy, leaving it a heap of smouldering rubble.

Emergency services had their rescue efforts seriously hampered by the serial nature of the bombings and the entire structure was raised to the ground in the space of a few minutes. Fortunately, the attacks took place during the night and few of the academic staff were on the premises at the time.

The three Senate attorneys preparing the final judgement in the W’rit vs. Thompsonson case were, however, on site and all three were injured beyond repair in the blasts.

Neither side in the case has made any official statement, however, sources close to both parties suggest that they may well be prepared to drop all further action in an effort to prevent any further escalation of the violence.

There is also a suggestion that the proposed Rockforth vs. Frontier News libel suit may also be allowed to lapse.
