How does “To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla” fit your hypothesis?

Mother of galaxies I think might be Sol or Hathor....Eve only had three children (Cain, Abel, Seth) that we know and none relate to galaxies, though IIRC Abel might be a star catalogue....ah yes, (but no system called Eve) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_catalogue !

Milton of course knew nothing about galaxies, Hubble’s observations were way later. I did have a brief glance at
The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Astronomy of Milton's 'Paradise Lost', by Thomas N. Orchard.
www.gutenberg.org
But didnt see anything I thought relevant.
