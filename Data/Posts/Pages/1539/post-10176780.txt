How does “To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla” fit your hypothesis?

Mother of galaxies I think might be Sol or Hathor....Eve only had three children (Cain, Abel, Seth) that we know and none relate to galaxies, though IIRC Abel might be a star catalogue....ah yes, (but no system called Eve) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_catalogue !

Milton of course knew nothing about galaxies, Hubble’s observations were way later. I did have a brief glance at
But didnt see anything I thought relevant.
Had a further thought this morning. we know DB was impressed by 2001 Space Odyssey (e.g. Blue Danube music for docking), but there are subsequent books. The second “2010:Odyssey Two” book/film had Jupiter turned by millions of monoliths into a star named Lucifer... and mankind was forbidden to land on Europa as the monoliths had found aquatic life there with potential to evolve intelligence.

In the third “2061: Odyssey Three” a mountain (Mount Zeus -reminiscent of the eagles and omphalos greek myth) was observed on Europa, and determined to be a diamond fragment of Jupiter’s core. Other fragments anticipated in Lucifer orbit.

Now Lucifer would tie across to Paradise Lost, and also the second line of the toast. Also the third line if the parent was God grieving over Adam & Eve’s transgression and they were the vagabonds after expulsion from Eden.

So could Raxxla be a giant diamond in orbit of Jupiter? It would seriously mix timelines and lore though!!!

Copawlot fit at 06:55, now thunderstorm outside, so not going to go exploring until at least later today!

I have another thought to check out!
