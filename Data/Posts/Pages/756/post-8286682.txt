Odd thing I found. Guardian musicâ€™s main 3 note chime is G A D. Like on a piano. Obviously those 3 letters are in the word guardian. Wondering if other music holds any clues like that. Not just audio spectrum analysis but simply the notes.
Wow, thats deep, and a completely new line of research to do now
