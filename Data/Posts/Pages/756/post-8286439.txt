I just got a tip off for Pleiades sector IH-V C2-16 D 2, approx 500ly away from Cerberus space, where I currently reside. Haven't made a move on it yet, just thought I'd share because its the first time I've had one for a system that seemed relevant to the lore in some sense.

I may be wrong of course (probably)
