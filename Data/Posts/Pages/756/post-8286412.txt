How do you fly out to them and drop out of SC in the right place if you can't target them? They could be in a 360 degree radius /orbit couldn't they? Am I missing something?

Edit: Im on XB, I guess youre on PC? Cant show me in game, any chance you could do a vid? thinking could be a valuable skill to learn.

Here, give it a go.

Strange thing, as I dropped into the 'hidden' belt a Search and Rescue anaconda appeared. And kept insisting on keeping me safe, circling me at ~2km. I moved and it moved with me.
It stayed for about 7-8 minutes or so.
I did not notice anything else peculiar with it though. No communication in local.

EDIT: Ehm, while writing this post; 7-10 minutes after the Conda jumped out another Search & Rescue appeared. This time an ASP. Is this normal?
I've been idling in space in quite many times & locations, but never been randomly visited by Search & Rescue like this.
Perhaps it's new due to the system status in Sol. Hm alright.
