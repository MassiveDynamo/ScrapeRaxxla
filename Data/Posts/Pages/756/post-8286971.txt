So I was watching travel videos today and I realized what number 1 is ... Its Triton from the Pena Palace.. He is guarding the gate between the lower aquatic world and the upper terrestrial one... https://www.parquesdesintra.pt/en/pontos-de-atracao/the-arch-of-the-triton/
SPOILER: TRITON

Nicely spotted!
So if Triton is the first part of the puzzle, how do we get the permit??
I have long suspected that FD are using permits to 1) slow us down and 2) highlight systems.
