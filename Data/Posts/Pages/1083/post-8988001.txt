@Spaceman Spiff:
ah, there is an 8 showing on the FSS frequency window for asteroids, never really noticed that before! Need new specs!
But they're not emitting any signal by which you could locate them...mmmm!!!!!!
Mmm also notice on my fss scanner the number for ancient probes/concentrated signals is not legible-looks like two digits merged together? I have 5 transient signals showing (after I resolved them), then 27 for first "concentrated signal sources" then what looks like 7 and 9 merged together for the second "concentrated signal sources" where the ancient probe signals were. This looks like another oddity!!
