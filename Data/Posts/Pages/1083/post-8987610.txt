I need your clothes rather help.
I decided to go here with the most obvious option, using only in-game information. And then questions began to pour in....
Why was the first mention in the tau kit, why not in any other system, although at that time it was already known about other systems? Having received no response from my alter ego, I decided that the tau was the starting point. Hmmm where to go? my alter ego is still silent ... in this system there is a faction Sublime Order of van Maanen's Star, which gives access to a closed system. In principle, this gives the direction where you need to move. But having received permission, I was at a dead end, I do not know where to go next ... can anyone have any ideas?
PS I'm a little confused by their spaceport, it looks like a tourist, everything is expensive and rich, but the system is closed ...
PS2 I assumed that I would get into a dead end, there is a second option - these are the old worlds, it was there that the headquarters of the gallop was, it was there that the first contact with the Thargoids was. I wonder what the Thargoids did in the old worlds, so close to the sol? I think it's worth looking for clues there ...
PS3 my alter ego said something ...

I had thought along these lines when I first started searching. I wound up being obsessed with Thurstons Gateway. It’s the last thing in the system so what is it a Gateway to? Oddly enough if you google Thurston Gateway the first thing not related to Elite is Thurston ROTARY club. The rotary logo looks very familiar.
For a while I thought you had to use the neutron star to jump in the direction of the gateway to maybe initiate a miss jump, but I think I got side tracked by something else in this thread about a year back and forgot all about this.
Anyway first post o7
