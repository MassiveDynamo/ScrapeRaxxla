Going from the spellings Could be there are just 3 factions. From my numbering scheme (a couple pages back):

1 Pilots Federation Local Branch -PFDemocracy AND 5 The Pilots Federation - IndependentDemocracy
Seems Davanix got Allied with #1 after combat in the recent Jupiter Rochester HIP 54530 CG??

2 Pilots’ Federation Administration - PFCorporate AND 3 Pilots’ Federation Local Branch - PFDemocracy
in ShinDezAccording to game screen in station Jorki Allied!

4 PilotsFederation - no detail! -rank via rescue missions or Thargoid kills-Jorki Allied!

Will keep an out on Galnet for any more CG or permit-related items to see if Jorki can get allied with faction 1 (& 5?) then see what happens. I suspect this might be related to DW gameplay thread-DW a faction within PF after all! (Tourist beacon!)

The big mystery though is which hanger do they each use?
