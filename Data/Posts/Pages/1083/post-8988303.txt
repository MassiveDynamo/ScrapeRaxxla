I tried going out to lemon slice nebula last night. Spansh said I could make it but my route plotting failed with only 1900Â±ly. I know it was kind of a joke when it was posted but you never know. I can only find references to it being unreachable before FC but now that I have one, does anyone know a route? I've seen that someone has been there on yt.
