A propos of nothing, and actually Raxxla-related, watching Drew's recent video series had me thinking about the comment (by MB or DB?) that Raxxla would be a "personal journey" for every pilot. And also how Elite Dangerous, at the outset at least, was marketed as "play your own way" i.e. fight, trade or explore etc. Maybe others have
long ago come to this conclusion (haven't stayed up with the forums) but this got me thinking that while having at least one category of Elite is likely a requirement of some sort, having triple Elite probably isn't (and quadruple Elite definitely not, as CQC was not in the game at the outset, or for quite some time after launch actually, while Raxxla purportedly has been findable from launch). Anyways, I throw this out there FWIW, probably old news.
