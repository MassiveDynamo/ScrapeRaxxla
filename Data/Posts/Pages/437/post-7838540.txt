Isn't the hyperspace jump just a cinematic while the program is downloading data of the next system ? Then, is that compatible with any kind of game mechanic acting at that very moment ?
Computers , here, so just asking.
When the E/F missions were running, did we have tip off missions too ? Can't remember for sure.

I remember arguing about what star cluster is the one we can see passing by repeatedly.

Witchspace travel is basically a loading screen. However, that does not prevent information to be encoded into it in one way or another.

Could not find the release notes for tipoff missions, but guessing they were introduced around 2.2 Guardians.
