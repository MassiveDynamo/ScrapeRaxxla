Mmmh... So it would not make sense to say that tip off missions anyhow replaced the E/F missions for the Raxxla Quest. Imho.
E/F missions? You mean the ones with "special wording" from Founders Station offered by The Black Wheel, or the really old ones that were for things like Sap-8/Trinkets that required Elite Rank?

If so... no, tip-offs didn't replace them... they existed well before. Tip-offs came about not long after the new mission interface was introduced, if not at the same time. It was also semi-confirmed by FD that tip-offs were obtained by doing lots of missions for a single faction... nothing related to the particular faction or your rank.
