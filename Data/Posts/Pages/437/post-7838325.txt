Just watched the hyperspace footage again, this time on PC instead of mobile. Maybe it's just me, but I'm seeing nothing of note there at all. The spins seem insignificant to be honest. Sorry.

I recall a very similar conversation taking place back in the Rift days - I think around the Exodus bases. Nothing conclusive ever came from it.
