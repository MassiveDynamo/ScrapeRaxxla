Dear Cmdr Tacticus2711,
Keep up the good work. You may notice upon sharing your efforts, however they may turn out, that some Commanders whom haven't appeared to contribute to the hunt(at least since I joined) will begin to throw shade at you. This is to be expected. Please continue your research because, contrary to popular belief, even negative results are positive in trial and error.
Fly Dangerously Commander, o7

I complete agree with you Filthy.

Tacticus2711, if you or anyone is looking for inspiration in dealing with negative results, just look at what all the regular CMDRs in this thread do. We've all decided to 'try' something, often taking many, many hours, only to encounter â€¦ the usual result of "nothing unusual here move along!"

I just make sure I take fun in the journey, which helps lots when your trying long-term goals like Operation Less Than Three!

Keep plugging away, anything we can tick off as 'not' helping solve the puzzle still contributes.

Fly Dangerously,
/ Ra.
