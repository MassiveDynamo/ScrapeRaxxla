RE: A few previous posts...

Indeed... I followed a link in the Thargoids and Guardians forum to this thread, and while I did call out Tacitus' first DBX discovery as "discovered back in September 2018", which is still true, it's led to me revisiting Tip-Offs, and creating a subsequent thread... tl;dr I think we need to start looking at tip-offs closer.
Agreed. Frontier may have put more thought into the tip off missions then we've given them credit for.
