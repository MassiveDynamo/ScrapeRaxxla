This is what Iâ€™m talking about:
Footage of weird spin in hyperspace

Maybe I'm just over analyzing given the context, but is there slightly different audio to a normal hyperspace tunnel? The sound that sticks out to me is at 0:25.

Assuming this is a lead, how do we explore this further? Maybe the Hyperspace tunnel spins faster and faster when you are jumping in the right direction towards a specific system? Do you happen to know the systems where this spinning event occurred? Maybe we can calculate a vector based on them.

It sort of fits the whole "Hidden in plain sight" idea considering the Tunnel is when we usually catch a quick nap while playing.
