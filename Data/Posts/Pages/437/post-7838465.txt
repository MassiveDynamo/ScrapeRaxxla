Isn't the hyperspace jump just a cinematic while the program is downloading data of the next system ? Then, is that compatible with any kind of game mechanic acting at that very moment ?
Computers , here, so just asking.
When the E/F missions were running, did we have tip off missions too ? Can't remember for sure.
