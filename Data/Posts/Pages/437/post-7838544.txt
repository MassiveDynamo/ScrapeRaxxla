Witchspace travel is basically a loading screen. However, that does not prevent information to be encoded into it in one way or another.

Could not find the release notes for tipoff missions, but guessing they were introduced around 2.2 Guardians.


Tip off missions have been in the game for a considerably longer time than that. Can't say how long though, I've been playing since 2015-2016 ish. Encountered a few random ones, found it was higher chance when allied with a faction within a system.
