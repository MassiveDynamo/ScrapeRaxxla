Just watched the hyperspace footage again, this time on PC instead of mobile. Maybe it's just me, but I'm seeing nothing of note there at all. The spins seem insignificant to be honest. Sorry.
I don't think it is unusual either. Sometimes witchspace spirals sometimes it doesn't. I don't know what the common factor is that makes it spiral/not spiral but I've seen it plenty of times and in lots of different sectors. Maybe it has something to do with the star class that you are jumping into?
