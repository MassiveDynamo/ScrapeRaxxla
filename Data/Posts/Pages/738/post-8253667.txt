there are missions where you need to fly to the voyager?
No, I was referring to the image on the pattern t-shirt looking a lot like Jupiter. No specific missions to SOL.

Interestingly I just checked TDW faction in SD at Jameson's and their clothing has all changed to more 'formal' attire. So either FDev did an art pass on the standard dress code or our funky friends have relocated.

I'll keep an eye out as I drift around the nearby systems.
