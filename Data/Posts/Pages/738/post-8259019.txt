Raxxla is probably the algorithm that generates the galaxy. When you provide a seed (value) it grows a tree and can be used to travel (generate) other galaxies. The algorithm is Yggdrasil, the world tree, obfuscated in the code. This method is center (the Omphalos) to our Elite world.

You could be so close, but I dont think it is Yggdrasil. In my humble opinion, one seed is for Guardians and another for Thargoids.
They are used for visual content, but how to apply that in the game I do not know.

There be dragons...
