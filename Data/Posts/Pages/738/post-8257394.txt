I still don't understand how you came up with that system lol. "032 04" means 3203.93? And the guy just posed in front of the numbers reflects their main station's distance from Sol? And they painted those numbers on the wall? And the system you said is the only system that is 3203 LYs away from Sol?

As I said it was 'thin'.

I was looking to see if those numbers might be co-ordinates, labels, naming, and many other possible combinations of stuff just on the odd chance the those with eyes to see might have missed something that was a tiny bit obvious.

I started dredging on distances and noted there was a system that was 3203.93 from SOL (almost 3204, just missing by .07 which could be many potential factors when your talking those distance calculations), and that system happened to have two bodies close together near the secondary star that was similar in colour scale to the image of TDW Codex, and an 8th 'body'.

It was thin, but ticked a few boxes, and we've flown to lots of places with less pretense, so I flagged it as a 'if anyone's close drop by' or I'll check it out some time. Macros decided as is his want to check it out ... and as suspected it turned out to be nothing other than a nice ELW and WW.

I'm at the same time collecting other anecdotal information from enemies and allies of TDW to see if anything else is common, stands out, or might be worth investigating further as I do some missions. Its just a variant focus than searching directly for Raxxla, but the same desired end goal.
