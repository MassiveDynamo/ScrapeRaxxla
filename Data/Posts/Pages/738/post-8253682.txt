It's certainly a possibility!

I'm suspicious that SOL does contain TDW station, but as it's an invite only for TDW (according to the Codex) I suspect direct searching probably wont reveal the stations location.

I think the whisperer from witchspace is more Raxxla related than TDW station/faction invite which I'm trying to work out which then may or may not lead to more Raxxla info.
anyway, we have a beginning point, it remains to understand how to start moving......
