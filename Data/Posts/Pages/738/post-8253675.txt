my question didn’t apply to you)
it’s just the theory, but what if all this wheel toast is in the same system? from the archive gallnet we learned that the pearl is Earth / Mars, I don’t remember now .... a whisper from the witching depths - maybe a voyager? Beyond the grief of the fathers, Oberon and Neptune

It's certainly a possibility!

I'm suspicious that SOL does contain TDW station, but as it's an invite only for TDW (according to the Codex) I suspect direct searching probably wont reveal the stations location.

I think the whisperer from witchspace is more Raxxla related than TDW station/faction invite which I'm trying to work out which then may or may not lead to more Raxxla info.
