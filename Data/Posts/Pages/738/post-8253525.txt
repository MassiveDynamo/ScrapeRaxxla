Just circling back to Churo's call out for the background numbers on the mission providers image (032 04). Since I noted them appear in the backgrounds in the system I'm in currently (LHS 346 > Morukov Orbital). Whilst I suspect it's a proc-gen background I'm still curious, so I've been dredging and came up with system: Drojaea YA-V d3-9


How the .... did you come up with that I hear you ask?!

Distance to Sol: 3,203.93 ly!
or
0-3204

(Roger Murtaugh:
Pretty thin, huh?
Martin Riggs:
Anorexic.)

But a few additional things caught my eye.
B1 & B2 appear to be exceptionally close to each other, and reasonably close to a possible candidate for TDW (~30ls probably too far but worth a sighting), but if the TDW Codex contains representative but inaccurate information, perhaps there is something near the 8th planet, which happens to be B 8 (an ELW).

So if anyone is close and can drop by and check out if there is a hiding DW base there, that'd be awesome, otherwise I'll add it to my future to-do list.

On a side note, I went back through some of my captured images of TDW agents and allies, and also noted a fairly common theme with this rather terrible and out-of-place pattern on their clothes. Jupiter anyone, or just a t-shirt my kids could have created... your pick?




And their enemies appear to have tattoos... which might be important if we think that TDW in JM is a front.



This is a pretty limited sub-set of data at the moment, so I'll do some more diligence on auditing it along with my Operation Less Than Three investigation to capture the images per ally/enemy to see what comes up.
