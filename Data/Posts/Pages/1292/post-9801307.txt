Went there, scanned the ship and hung around. Thargymabob turned up after a few minutes and started popping the cargo ship then turned his attention on me. 2 seconds later i was on the rebuy screen. Angry brute he was.
Went there, scanned the cargo bay but nothing caught my attention. Medusa showed up, scanned it and kept firing at the megaship... who knows why.

The body the megaship is orbiting is a gas giant with amonia-based life. It seems they arrived at their destination.
