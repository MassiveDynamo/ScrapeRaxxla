Oh, I suspect these friend requests are either algorithmic or an FD employee tasked to do this as part of his job, so probably a CM. We know the game keeps stats, they’re in the Codex, though I suspect there are others that are not visible to us & probably related to ranking up with the other PF cliques. The game uploads some data packets, so the monitoring could be done locally and FD notified as appropriate, then notifications either go into a database or an inbox. As I (edited) mentioned in my previous post, I don’t think either of these friend requests are likely to be relevant to the Raxxla/DW storyline. But to determine that, & decide whether NPC or human, we need someone to accept the friend request. Or maybe someone who is already triple elite to raise a friend request to MadDogDiver?
That would be totally crazy if the Dark Wheel had a group of players that was comprised of elite pilots.
