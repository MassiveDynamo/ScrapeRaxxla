I believe it's both... server side friend requests generated by algorithm and a FD Employee tasked to curate such accounts... and yes, on my alt account, sent him a friend request as I did not receive one from MADDOGDIVER once reached tripple Elite... I waited for him to show up online on my main account, switched to the alt and sent the invitation. It was instantly accpeted.

Also, there are so many timed triggers in Elite... you drop on these megaships and it takes a while for a Thargoid to appear. You find a surface POI in the Colonia region and years after the clock runs down and we have a follow up on that story connecting it to the Dark Waters Private Military.
Yes, though I think the Colonia data cache timer delay was a known bug, or a consequence of FD delaying the major storylines for some unknown reasons; the two possibilities are not mutually exclusive!

Have you pursued the friendship with MadDogDiver? Met up in-game? It would be nice to know the purpose of the friendship request if it is indeed triggered by triple elite achievement!

Just did a search and the only forum poster I can find with a similar name is Cmdr Mad Dog MacD from Ontario Canada.
