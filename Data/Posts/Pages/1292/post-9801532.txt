Oh, I suspect these friend requests are either algorithmic or an FD employee tasked to do this as part of his job, so probably a CM. We know the game keeps stats, they’re in the Codex, though I suspect there are others that are not visible to us & probably related to ranking up with the other PF cliques. The game uploads some data packets, so the monitoring could be done locally and FD notified as appropriate, then notifications either go into a database or an inbox. As I (edited) mentioned in my previous post, I don’t think either of these friend requests are likely to be relevant to the Raxxla/DW storyline. But to determine that, & decide whether NPC or human, we need someone to accept the friend request. Or maybe someone who is already triple elite to raise a friend request to MadDogDiver?
I believe it's both... server side friend requests generated by algorithm and a FD Employee tasked to curate such accounts... and yes, on my alt account, sent him a friend request as I did not receive one from MADDOGDIVER once reached tripple Elite... I waited for him to show up online on my main account, switched to the alt and sent the invitation. It was instantly accpeted.

Also, there are so many timed triggers in Elite... you drop on these megaships and it takes a while for a Thargoid to appear. You find a surface POI in the Colonia region and years after the clock runs down and we have a follow up on that story connecting it to the Dark Waters Private Military.
