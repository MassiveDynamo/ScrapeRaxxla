We are not stuck exclusively on "triple elite"... we're stuck on every side so we're trying to milk whatever cow we find... not only cows, but even rocks will do!

So, yeah... welcome to the club!
There is no basis in lore for "triple elite" as in having Trade, Exploration, Combat all elite. One character from AHTW, Gunn had become combat Elite three times due to their secret identity and having to reach combat elite twice to join CIEP (crazy split-off from the Dark Wheel). When the Dark Wheel are only referenced as "elite-ranked treasure hunters". Added an snippet from And Here the Wheel. They are an old group, and not in a simple "they have a long history" more of a "You can't comprehend the complexity of that statement" kind of way.

Side note on the Dark Wheel:
When we encounter them in lore they tend to identify as explorers and traders who are good at combat. They tend of be elderly, and dismissive of the priorities of current-era pilots, as if we forgot what it was all about. They are likely all clones (Male: Hans Walden, Hadrian Augustus Duval / Female: Elyssia Fields (yes she is in Elite Dangerous), Rebecca Weston, Octavia Quinton, Salome...)
