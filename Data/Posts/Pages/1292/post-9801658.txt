Yes, though I think the Colonia data cache timer delay was a known bug, or a consequence of FD delaying the major storylines for some unknown reasons; the two possibilities are not mutually exclusive!

Have you pursued the friendship with MadDogDiver? Met up in-game? It would be nice to know the purpose of the friendship request if it is indeed triggered by triple elite achievement!

Just did a search and the only forum poster I can find with a similar name is Cmdr Mad Dog MacD from Ontario Canada.
Frontier said that the Colonia data cache was indeed a timer and it was working as intended...

About MADDOGDIVER, could never actually meet him in-game... never replied a single message.
