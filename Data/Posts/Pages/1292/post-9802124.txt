There is no basis in lore for "triple elite". When the Dark Wheel are only referenced as "elite-ranked treasure hunters". Added an snippet from And Here the Wheel. They are an old group, and not in a simple "they have a long history" more of a "You can't comprehend the complexity of that statement" kind of way.
The whole point of this thread is exactly that... besides the fact Mr. Braben confirmed Raxxla is "in the game" nobody knows what part of the lore is actually and currently valid. So, yeah... here we are!
