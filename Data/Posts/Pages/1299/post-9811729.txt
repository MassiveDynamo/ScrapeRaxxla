just a line of thought, Raxxla would most likely be in a system where a fleet carrier wont go, this thought would eb so dozens of them dont show up within an instant and completely trash the place no? that would leave permit lock systems
If Raxxla has been in the game and findable - since Gamma phase? - I don't think fleet carriers have been taken into account. Likewise anything that needs longer than 39.2 LY jump is highly likely excluded.
