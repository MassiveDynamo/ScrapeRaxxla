If Raxxla has been in the game and findable - since Gamma phase? - I don't think fleet carriers have been taken into account. Likewise anything that needs longer than 39.2 LY jump is highly likely excluded.
Where did the Gamma thing come from? I’ve heard it many a time, but don’t know the source for it.
