I’m quite curious looking at all them PSR Neutron stars. I find it strange that I can’t find PSR J1921+2153. The first ever Pulsar discovered by our very own Cambridge Dane… Joyce Bell Burnell. I Guess you could call her a space witch and a whisperer reading her bio. I’m heading to the Vulpecula dark region to have a look around, as that’s where the Pulsar is meant to be. Maybe tucked away in another whisperer at the low end of the spectrum.
Vulpecula dark region also happens to sit right in the middle of Vega and Altair if viewed by Sol reading back you will see why this also adds up also LGM-1 at one point system info had itself listed as independent with no population many years ago, now so did a system in Pleiades, Cone (Cone actually had a 3000 population also but was right after the NGC permit lock in the region and no has none) and also the Locked Hen region, Spirograph also however this one was mentioned as an information data bug and was removed along with the others however only Spirograph wassdai to have this bug....

(Edit) Looking at Inara it seems it is still held as independent on there, has no1 been since for it to update? or is it still marked ingame

only 207 ships ever visted here and none recently

This system was visited for the first time on EDSM by Spock Oddsocks on Sep 26, 2015, 7:33:15 PM.

It was named by the Galactic Mapping Project with the name of: LGM-1 Pulsar

207 ships passed through Lgm-1 space, including 0 ship in the last 7 days.

0 ship passed through Lgm-1 space in the last 24 hours.
