The ghosts are actual 3D objects in the SysMap. You can se this when watching the map in VR. One ghost consist of about a dozen shapes that move and fade. The shapes the self are flat, so they probably aren’t meant to be viewed in 3D.
The ghosts may be a visual effect of comets in systems with very bright stars. From what I can see, there are two comets in Deneb (Alpha Cygni).
I’m not an expert at this new comet hunting, so there could be more.
I haven’t vissited the comets. I don’t know how to do that.
