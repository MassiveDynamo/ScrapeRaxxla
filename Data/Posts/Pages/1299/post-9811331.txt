do these ghosts resemble a signal from the center of the galaxy, or is it my imagination?
The ghosts are actual 3D objects in the SysMap. You can se this when watching the map in VR. One ghost consist of about a dozen shapes that move and fade. The shapes the self are flat, so they probably aren’t meant to be viewed in 3D.
The ghosts may be a visual effect of comets in systems with very bright stars. From what I can see, there are two comets in Deneb (Alpha Cygni).
I’m not an expert at this new comet hunting, so there could be more.
I haven’t vissited the comets. I don’t know how to do that.
