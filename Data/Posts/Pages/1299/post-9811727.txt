The ghosts are actual 3D objects in the SysMap. You can se this when watching the map in VR. One ghost consist of about a dozen shapes that move and fade. The shapes the self are flat, so they probably aren’t meant to be viewed in 3D.
The ghosts may be a visual effect of comets in systems with very bright stars. From what I can see, there are two comets in Deneb (Alpha Cygni).
I’m not an expert at this new comet hunting, so there could be more.
I haven’t vissited the comets. I don’t know how to do that.
I suspect they’re a graphics artefact relating to the Coronal Mass Ejection animations we see, since they have the same colour as the system star(s).

Mmmm, I was going to say that the one thing I am now convinced of is that they aren’t anything to do with Raxxla, because they exist in many systems and we know from MB that Raxxla is in a definite place. However he didnt actually say that; I’ve just checked back to my FD quotes thread and he said of Raxxla:
“It’s something in the game world (not text) and very hard to find”
“It’s not a random thing”
“Anyone can find it and more than once”

To me these statements implied Raxxla is a single instance of something and that it’s in a single place. However on rereading they might, at a stretch, apply to these artefacts! They are hard to find ( they aren’t in every system, and you have to wait up to 10 minutes for them to appear & then they fade out, cyclicly), they are not text, they are in a definite place (the system map), anyone can find them, and more than once!

Though I’d say again I’d be very disappointed if so!!

Edit: but I havent checked recently to see if they’re still occurring in-game!! @Han_Zen have you checked mate?
