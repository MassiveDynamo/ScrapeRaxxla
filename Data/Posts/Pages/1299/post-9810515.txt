Colleagues, did someone look into the Spiral Planetary?
Sit down now, I'll tell you an awesome story about how I'm looking for a rakslu.
I was very confused about what the Thargoids are looking for in a coal bag, it looks like some kind of story arc ... if you still try to win back in rp, it turns out that the Thargoids are looking for something in a coal bag. For me, this became a search direction, I began to be interested in the coal bag and it turns out that the dark nebula of the constellation of the southern cross. And in turn, the Southern Cross is a very interesting place, a quote from the wiki - However, the main treasure of the constellation is the open cluster Casket. What do we have in the box? right jewel. but that's not all.
Becrux is also considered a treasure.
By the way, I also advise you to pay attention to Theta Muscae and HD 100546.
By the way, did someone find a nebula necklace in the constellation Arrows?
Going there, I came across a spiral planetary nebula, which I think is a direct reference to the astrophele and spiral stars. to move on, you should read the sonnets ....

tell me, are these cheats that someone got here - BD-13 842?
upd - still found GSC 9409-1163
