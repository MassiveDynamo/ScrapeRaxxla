just a line of thought, Raxxla would most likely be in a system where a fleet carrier wont go, this thought would eb so dozens of them dont show up within an instant and completely trash the place no? that would leave permit lock systems on that note when the fleet carrier update dropped so did new permit systems within and around the bubble, now no seen way of obtaining these but that doesn't mean you cant, i just dont see Fdev letting in the fleet carrier swarm to Raxxla
