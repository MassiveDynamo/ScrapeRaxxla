If Raxxla has been in the game and findable - since Gamma phase? - I don't think fleet carriers have been taken into account. Likewise anything that needs longer than 39.2 LY jump is highly likely excluded.
Yes exactly hence the new permit locked systems since the Fleet carrier update dropped which would be the way they would exclude them taking them into account.....There may be added ways to gain a permit but they wont obviously share this otherwise they would make it a tony bit to obvious

Also as I remember correctly they said it has been in the game since Gamma, I never seen a direct quote that it was accessible in gamma forgive me if this is wrong, Gamma was a very rough time for a lot of in-game features (some of which still don't work correctly) I would be worried if it wasn't changed/built upon since then
