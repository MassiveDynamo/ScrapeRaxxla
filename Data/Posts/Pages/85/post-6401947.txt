There is a system called Ra
XX could be the 20th planet
1a the moon.
Drat there is no 20th planet

Travel to the Ra system, drink 2/3 of a glass of XXX, spill the last third over a sacrificial virgin (donâ€™t bother looking for one at Lave), crash into the first moon that looks promising and surface search by SRV until you die of boredom or achieve Nirvana (the Raxxla state)
