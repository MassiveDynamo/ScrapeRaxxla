I don't entirely agree, Doc.
As I already wrote, more than an "end game", I guess Raxxla Quest is more like an Eastern Egg, just for amateurs of the original Elite lore. Unless it is tightly tied to the Thargs storyline, of course, as always.
And finding it, imho, would not bring god-like powers to the finder. I suspect some witchspace-tied new capabilities (in the Oolite way, 8 portals network across the MW etc..).
I bet 80% of the player base don't care about R (unless they suspect they could get AAA - class weapons there..).

I don't think you're actually disagreeing with me (because I wasn't making a statement intended to be taken as a solid fact). All I said is that Raxxla "would be" a perfect "end game" for the series. I didn't say that it actually is or even is intended to be an "end game". I was merely floating one possible theory among many. The thing with Raxxla is that, since we know so little, multiple possibilities could be true and so I like to keep an open mind about it.

Raxxla could be hiding in plain sight, somewhere in the Bubble, where players pass by ever day. It could be permit locked. Maybe it is hidden somewhere on the edge of the galaxy waiting for Macros the Black to stumble on it during his circumnavigation. All of those possibilities are mutually exclusive but, by current measure, they are each just as likely as any other alternative.

I fully concede that Raxxla may be a Easter Egg of sorts. Half the fun is floating possible theories and uncovering hidden connections. The other half is going out and testing those theories as best we can.
