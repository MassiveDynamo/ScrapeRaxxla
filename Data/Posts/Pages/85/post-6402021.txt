I don't entirely agree, Doc.
As I already wrote, more than an "end game", I guess Raxxla Quest is more like an Eastern Egg, just for amateurs of the original Elite lore. Unless it is tightly tied to the Thargs storyline, of course, as always.
And finding it, imho, would not bring god-like powers to the finder. I suspect some witchspace-tied new capabilities (in the Oolite way, 8 portals network across the MW etc..).
I bet 80% of the player base don't care about R (unless they suspect they could get AAA - class weapons there..).
