It is often buried as hints. For example, there was a GalNet from August 3301 called "Portrait of Bounty Hunter" (see https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/55c8a7a89657babd107d9faa) about Ziva Eschel from Wanted. She is chasing "Red Hourglass" to Jackson's Lighthouse. This is CMDR Khanguire and her son Ji + plus Khanguire's crew. They in the book get hold of the non-human artifact (unsure if this is the one likely stolen by Marlin Duval on her way out of Sol or the one from Exioce). In any case, this is all in the book. Ji gets the non-human artifact and is taken to what sounds like Imperial space and gets a new identity. Anyway, at the end of Wanted the final fight happens at Jackson's Cave in Jackson's Lighthouse (the formally populated Federal system that experienced gravitational collapse). The Cave is in the game (search Jackson on GalMap - it at least appears in Odyssey) and I have gotten to within 70 kilometers of Jackson's Lighthouse. Still haven't found the Cave yet but it can generally only be seen visually and it is really hard with the neutron star.
Iv been in that system lots of times cant get closer to the neutron than 280km in both Horizons and Odyssey before the exlusion sone never seen a cave target only the star though
