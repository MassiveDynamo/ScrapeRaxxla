This is a couple of notes that an Artefact similar to the mars artefact was found on Exioce and that it was associated with a failed terraforming attempt in the past before the Empire colonised it. This re-inforces the connection between the Mars artefact and terraforming, Mars only being successfully terraformed after finding it.

There seems to be another inconsistency in the galaxy compared to the canon lore novels in that the planet named in the RPG is in fact a gas giant in game, so once more it looks like the systems got regenerated between last edit and game release.
