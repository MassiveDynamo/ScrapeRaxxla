I own the Elite Encounters RPG (what EDRPG is sold under presently) and it is a damn gold mine of lore. There is even part about how Hengist Duval was cut by the non-human artifact and that is what allowed the Feds to get his DNA and triggered the votes that put Arissa Lavigny-Duval in as Emperor/Empress. The book is huge and most of it is additional stories.
Nice! â€¦ ive been waffling on getting that, wondering how much extra lore was in it. Will have to pick it up.
