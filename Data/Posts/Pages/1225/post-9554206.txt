The official RPG is canon - the history section only mind you. It was written based on the authors pack given to the novelists, afaik.

its availavle here:

Daftworks – It's daft but it works.
daftworks.co.uk

and looks like this:


But beware! There is the official RPG and there is this one which is canon:

Thanks Yelboc, you’re a star! (another pun, two in one day, the coffee is working!)... didn't even know there are two RPG!
But do we have a reference for the official version being canon within the ED game and not just within the RPG?
(It’s that bidirectional dependency that worries me)
If so I’ll add it to my list of FD quotes.

Mmm, not found an FD quote, but Elite Encounters came from the FD writers pack kickstarter which gave authors access to the FD internal lore book(s) and MB had some oversight in its development (apparently after some initial uncertainty as to whether it counted as a book) so I think that probably makes it pukka in its own right, but still a bit unsure about the applicability of EE RPG lore to the computer game.

To those who have it-is it worth the purchase? Don’t want to cloud my hypothesising little grey cells with info that may not be pukka in-game, I can’t take any more obfuscation! Mmm, I can’t even check the UK price, it’s not on the FD Store and my iPad Norton is blocking access to the Daftworks site (but then, today it’s currently objecting to the FD forum! )
