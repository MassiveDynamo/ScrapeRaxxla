Well looks like it was discovered in 2013 ED went live in 2014 so depending on how quickly it made it in to the star catalog and when ED took its snapshotâ€¦ it might have been found too late to make it in game?
They have added multiple systems and stars since release though including stars as popular such as Trappist 1 etc
