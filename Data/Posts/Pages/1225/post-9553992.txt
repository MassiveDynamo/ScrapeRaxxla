I own the Elite Encounters RPG (what EDRPG is sold under presently) and it is a damn gold mine of lore. There is even part about how Hengist Duval was cut by the non-human artifact and that is what allowed the Feds to get his DNA and triggered the votes that put Arissa Lavigny-Duval in as Emperor/Empress. The book is huge and most of it is additional stories.
The Duval Artefact is not the same as the Mars relic. It was made in Achenar, by Mudlarks.
