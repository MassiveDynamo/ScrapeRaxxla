20 squid in the UK for the PDF. There is a fair bit of lore stuff in there. Hard to judge if its worth it just for that, but my son enjoyed playing the RPG with his mates if thats anything to go by

So I have a quote from the author about the fact that its a canon source, but my search skills are failing me right now

Regards the RPG lore applicability to the game - its only the History section of the manual that is regarded as lore afaik.

[Edit:] Forgot to mention that there are a couple of short stroies included as well so there is a bit more to it..
