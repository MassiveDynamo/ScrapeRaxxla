Would be very weird, even nonsense, that the PF gets a system locked with Raxxla in. Total inconsistent from a lore point of view.
I don't think that obfuscated = locked . I hope it will turn out to be something more... exotic ?
But with FD, who knows ?



That dragon turns out to be a five headed hydra. Then, logically, the Wizard needs five alter ego.

If Raxxla is hidden through an arbitrary or deceptive means people will be upset, and I imagine lots will quit and never come back to the ED franchise. Such ways include permit locks that cant be obtained, Raxxla being in witch space, or being on a star we cant reach so its inaccessible. It would just feel cheap. In the least there must be a way for us to discover where it is even if we cant reach it- e.g. being able to find out in game that it is actually in witch space. That would at least be equivalent to finding it. But for them to just pop up one day and be like "guess what guys!" would everyone off.

I personally think finding TDW will be key to getting leads to where Raxxla is. They may not know its location, but after all this time they may well have lots of strong leads that a player could work with.
