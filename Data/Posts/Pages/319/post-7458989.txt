Idk if it’s been mentioned before but, news to me anyway, the company that started Universal Cartographics, was Omphalos InfoTech. They’re a big company that gobbles up all the cartographic data they can, what their business is with it idk, other than The Club making their list of earth-likes. Idk if there’s a hint in the name or if it’s just coincidence, but there is an Omphalos of sorts gobbling up data on the spiriting stars that is the Milky Way. How a Rift, in the form of an artifact/gateway would fit into that tho, idk.

What is the source of this info ?
Usually if it is a corporation it should also have a home system.
