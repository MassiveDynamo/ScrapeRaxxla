Would be very weird, even nonsense, that the PF gets a system locked with Raxxla in. Quite inconsistent from a lore point of view. I don't think that obfuscated = locked . I hope it will turn out to be something more... exotic ?
But with FD, who knows ?

"A place that is not a place, a door that is also the key."

-> "A place that is not placed at the same place all the time, acessible only when the key (time-lock) is right."

If I would be FD I would made it obfuscated using the same mechanic like thargoid incursion zones. Present all the time but invisible and non-interactive, active only during certain periods (weekly tick e.g.)
"A planet not gravitational bounded to a star" but time-based bounded so it never appears on the same place in the system - switching dimensional planes in intervals. Like in old purged books.

And we already have in the game that planet that you can land on only under certain angle at certain time interval because of high speed rotation.
Enlarge the orbit, made it visible/obfuscated during longer period, retain high speed... Me evil. FD good. Raxxla - precious!
