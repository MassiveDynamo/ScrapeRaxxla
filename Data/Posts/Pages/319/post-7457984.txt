Mental note of little use: both Raxxla and DW symbols possesses elements of isometric cube and by coincidence that pattern is engraved in guardians structures. Kinda like

Note: if you stare at this for some time, it will change directions. In mind only.

The same line pattern appears on mail slot bullseyes a smashed x with a line running through the middle. The center of the Raxxla logo has two circles and three partial circle lines, this resembles the data core of a Guardian beacon. The hexagon is used in game to represent engineers and modified modules. A dotted line may represent a crossable barrier or cloak. The Omphalos rift or possibly the omphalos stone in Delphi. No omphalos in the system of Delphi that can be seen but I'm sure you guys have already been there lol.

"The stone itself has a carving of a knotted net covering its surface, and has a hollow centre, which widens towards its base. The Omphalos at Delphi came to be identified as the stone which Rhea wrapped in swaddling clothes, pretending it was Zeus. This was to deceive Cronus, his father, who swallowed his children so they could not grow up and depose him as he had deposed his own father, Ouranos."
Any way that's my 2 cents about logo connections atm.
