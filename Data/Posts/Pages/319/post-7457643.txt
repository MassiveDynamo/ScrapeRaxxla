It is possible to hide a planet behind a permit lock however. We already have an example of one system where Elite rank is required for access: Shinrarta Dhezra. It is quite possible that there is some other permit lock requirement out there that also hinges on the requirement of Triple Elite. This is all conjecture of course. Until someone actually discovers Raxxla we just won't know what, if any, requirements are required.

Would be very weird, even nonsense, that the PF gets a system locked with Raxxla in. Quite inconsistent from a lore point of view.
I don't think that obfuscated = locked . I hope it will turn out to be something more... exotic ?
But with FD, who knows ?

I have 5 triple accounts...

That dragon turns out to be a five headed hydra. Then, logically, the Wizard needs five alter ego.

So what is “a little bit obvious” in the game?.

The Dark Wheel.
Besides, both are in the Codex.
And never forget the rest of the phrase: ".. so people know what they are doing." It gives all its sense.
The thing is... we all knew what we were doing until the E/F missions suddenly disappeared.
FD...
