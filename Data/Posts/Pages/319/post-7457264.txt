Quite a few of the original bubble worlds like Lave and Reorte and Riadquat were all procedurally-generated names from the original 1984 game, which is the main reason why they are so weird. I don't think Raxxla was a world in one of the original 8 galaxy maps from 1984, but others here will probably know.

It was actually impossible for the name generator in Elite to make a system called Raxxla.
Raxxla was only in the book.
