What's wrong with Tau Ceti?

Tau Ceti was first system where life was discovered off Earth. It was one of the first major human colonies.

From the History section of the Federation codex, we can read: "The year 2162 saw a dispute between the colony of Tau Ceti 3 and the Federation authority, centered on the colonists' repeated refusal to limit the damage they were inflicting on the alien ecosystem."

In ED Tau Ceti 3 is Bell's Wreck. This is wrong. The story of the colonists happened on the earth like world Taylor Colony (Tau Ceti 2). This is confirmed by Tourist beacon 0169.
Taylor Colony and Bell's Wreck has switched places since Fe:2, so this is an understandable mistake. Still sloppy, for such an important system.

A bigger problem is that Taylor Colony is marked as Terraformed in ED. It's strange that a planet where the alien ecosystem triggered the establishment of the Federation and was colonized 140 years before the first ever terrafoming, is tagged like that.

The same problem exist with: Reagan's Legacy in Delta Pavonis, Homeland in Beta Hydri and Biggs Colony in Altair.

All of them are marked as terraformed, in contradiction with both old and new lore.
