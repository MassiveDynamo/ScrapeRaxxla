Almost 90% of my progress from Deadly to Elite (~late 3304 iirc) came from hunting Thargoid Scouts. They all counted for an Elite kill (maybe even a bit over) back then, think they are still good for progress - but you won't earn much from it. I hear Pirate Activity Detected signal sources are also good these days but I've not done one.
