Also, despite the game launching in December 16, 3300 (December 16, 2014), I would not consider the actual launch until January 1st, 3301 (despite "letter from a friend" from the manual and intro sequence citing December 16, 3300). This is partly why I have been investigating if Cicada 3301 might actually be an alternative reality game (ARG) developed by Frontier Developments as a lead up to launch of the game. Cicada 3301 happened 2012 - late 2014. Cicadas have a symbolism of death and rebirth that is reinforced by Elite Dangerous (and the larger Elite Universe).
