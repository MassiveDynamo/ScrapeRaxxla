I wrote this here to show that no one has yet reached the level to reach Raxxla and understand what it is.

For example, I've reached any Elite and now I can go to Shinarta Dezra. But anyone can't go there until they get Elite.

So with Raxxla, whoever reaches that level first reaches Raxxla and realizes what it is. Will post about it on the Forum, won't give instant access to anyone there.
I understand what you are saying but it's not quite right. If you backed at a certain level in the kickstarter you could get into Shinrarta straight away, no need to grind up to Elite. I honestly believe Raxxla was discoverable from the start.
