At the beginning of the game, it was assumed that Raxxla would be found another way. Since then, more clues have been introduced ... the same Codex.
Honestly, the fact the community doubted that this was a legit sequel probably didn't help matters nor did multiple levels of obfuscation. Michael Brookes was apparently intent on making sure it wasn't found immediately. You really had to realize everything happened in the same universe and understand the history before a proper search could be undertaken. Even then, there's a whole lot of gaps.
