I wrote this here to show that no one has yet reached the level to reach Raxxla and understand what it is.

For example, I've reached any Elite and now I can go to Shinarta Dezra. But anyone can't go there until they get Elite.

So with Raxxla, whoever reaches that level first reaches Raxxla and realizes what it is. Will post about it on the Forum, won't give instant access to anyone there.
ahh... lost in translation?

So if I understand you and you are referring to the "anyone" can find it (Raxxla) and more than once but there maybe a requirement we haven't reached and that we don't know what that requirement is?

e.g. Some people believe only Elite ranked can find Raxxla... and some people think you have to be in a Cobra MKIII for some reason too or it might be some other requirement completely....

And whoever reaches that level might not realise what the level was about anyway?
