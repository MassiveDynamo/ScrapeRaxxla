The problem here is that the game did not even have neutron stars on launch, yet Raxxla was already meant to be findable.

And it seems that the Col sectors are actually related to the Collinder catalog of open star clusters - the permit-locked, purported Thargoid homeland of Collinder 70 is visible around Orion's belt (!), while Collinder 285 covers most of Ursa Major including the Alliance core.
At the beginning of the game, it was assumed that Raxxla would be found another way. Since then, more clues have been introduced ... the same Codex.
