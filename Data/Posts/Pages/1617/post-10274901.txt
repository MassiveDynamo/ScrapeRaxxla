Is there any way to get a combat Elite quickly in the game ? All we get in the game is monotonous, long hours of work. This applies to, opening engineers, blueprints, ranks, etc.
Why do we think Raxxla can be found quickly?
For example, earlier it was said that Raxxla can be obtained after confirming all the findings in the codex in all sectors ?
Why do we think this is not the case ?
Don't know about quickly; I usually went to Compromised Navigation Beacons (CNB) to rank up to Elite.

This site (https://edtools.cc/pve) can be useful in finding Massacre missions that can reduce the tedium a bit whilst earning a some coins...
