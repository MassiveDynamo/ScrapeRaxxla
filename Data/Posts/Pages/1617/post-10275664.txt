Is there any way to get a combat Elite quickly in the game ? All we get in the game is monotonous, long hours of work. This applies to, opening engineers, blueprints, ranks, etc.
Why do we think Raxxla can be found quickly?
For example, earlier it was said that Raxxla can be obtained after confirming all the findings in the codex in all sectors ?
Why do we think this is not the case ?
Following on from @Macros Black advice...Thargoid scout killing was the fastest grind up to the spire sites becoming a thing... I am guessing those with all the commanders in them is the easiest these days as it's a mix of scout clearance, orthrus kills and interceptors (if the group are not ignoring leaving thargs... You can upset a group if they are planning on ignoring them as you get a lot of shutdowns and damage)...

You need an AX build and join the AXI private group is the best way and you make 100's millions of creds per hour too.. an orthrus is 40 mil! Tag something with one shot and you get the bounty so you don't need to be the best if experts are there... And expect a rebuy or two (mainly trying to get to the spire site and those annoying glaives!)

I did combat elite years ago first using CZ's mainly but that's a big grind! Haz rez can be used too as they are usually busy with pirates...

Edit: quoted the wrong expert
