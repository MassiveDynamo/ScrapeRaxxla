The mythological angle behind the Thargoids' actions becomes quite amusing when you realize that they come from the crotch of a guy condemned to eternally pursue a group of pretty sisters (the Pleiades). While chased by a giant scorpion.

(which means that somewhere in Scorpio playing a huge role in their demise would not surprise me in the slightest)
