Following up on Investigation #3
Hyperspace Whispers Audio Investigation #4
After over 150 recordings across the bubble and out to Pleiades, I've finished this investigation (for now).

I've seen/heard literally nothing at all in the audio recordings that suggest there's any significant variation.

I visited the systems Rochester suggested, and did the jumps Han_Zen requested to see if we could hear a system that we jump "over". I also did systems around Lave, Achenar, Sol, in the Pleiades, etc. I've tested all major star types, including neutron, white dwarf, and Wolf-Rayet. I also recorded the audio from Youtube videos of older iterations of hyperspace, and other people in the current build, the results are in Investigation #3 from a few days ago.

Of course, it may be that I've just not visited the right place, but I've seen enough to think that the audio component of witch-space isn't a significant clue.

If in future there's any suspicion of this being otherwise, we do have a nice set of audio recordings to compare anything suspicious to
