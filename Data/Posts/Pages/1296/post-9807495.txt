Mmm, my memory is poor, but I think PFLB have always been in Shinrarta. I remember something happening along the lines of PF (which clique??) being made a superpower, but dont know the details. I did try googling this a month or so ago, but my googlefu is weak...

I usually rely on Han_Zen for such historical facts, but not seen him here recently.
Defo in Founder's World from the start... I was one of the backers who got access by mistake...

I thought they stopped the BGS stuff for the PF because players were trying to make it expand out of there and other's trying to kick them out (which is why i asked if they were there because of players or placed by FD)... but my memory is bad too... ;-)
