Mmm, my memory is poor, but I think PFLB have always been in Shinrarta. I remember something happening along the lines of PF (which clique??) being made a superpower, but dont know the details. I did try googling this a month or so ago, but my googlefu is weak...

I usually rely on Han_Zen for such historical facts, but not seen him here recently.
I don’t think the PF being made a superpower was something that came from FD.

Pretty sure it was just players coming up with a sensible figurative explanation for the PF rep notifications that came from killing Thargs. - it wasn’t a minor faction rep change, plus there’d also been the reports of people getting rep changes with the Thargoids, so the PF rep changes made most sense as being with an overarching version of the PF.
