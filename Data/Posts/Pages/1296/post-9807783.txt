This should be considered fact at this point. I know I have heard several separate accounts from people I know who were in the room when it was said, but we have a video from Ascorbius saying he was in the room when it was said, Video link for reference https://m.twitch.tv/clip/SnappyScaryMousePupper.
Disagreed (partially). Ascorbius is a good fella, and I'm more than happy to believe him that something was said. It's the exact wording that's the issue. I've seen more than enough misreporting of things where there's an actual video and everyone can see exactly what was said. Given that, I'd never take someone's version of what was said as being verbatim. Especially not with something said by Michael Brookes, who's prone to being a bit mischievous and cryptic.
