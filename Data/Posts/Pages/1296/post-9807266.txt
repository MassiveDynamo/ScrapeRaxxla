Not as far as I’m aware. It looks to me like FD want PF to be beyond any possible involvement in PowerPlay (though that’s never interested me so I dont have any experience with it, other than getting some of Aisling’s Prismatic Shields).
So we're these in game expansions before they removed the PF from the BGS in systems or placed there by FD?
