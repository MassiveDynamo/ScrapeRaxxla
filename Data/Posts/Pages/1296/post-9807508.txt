Defo in Founder's World from the start... I was one of the backers who got access by mistake...

I thought they stopped the BGS stuff for the PF because players were trying to make it expand out of there and other's trying to kick them out (which is why i asked if they were there because of players or placed by FD)... but my memory is bad too... ;-)
Yeah, I would suspect that the Pilots Federation Local Branches were what the name implies, and were just done as minor factions for the lack of having something more suitable in place. Which is all fine until people start treating them as a minor faction, at which point they would have to be locked to keep them as they’re supposed to be.

There’s been PF factions in the old starter area (Asellus Primus area) for quite a while. They’re just there to give a few one-off starter missions to introduce them to a few different aspects of the game. They don’t have normal BGS generated missions. I would suspect they’re locked, but haven’t checked, other than to note that they seem to be ever present.
