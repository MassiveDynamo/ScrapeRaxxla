Shinrata Dhezra/Founders world was the the system that was only supposed to be for Kickstarter backers (and Elite ranked pilots), I bought in at the beta stage and they accidentally let us in and decided not to revoke access... not aware of any others...
as far as I remember, there were POIs from the very release, and if DÐ°vid says that a regular scanner is enough for us. Maybe it makes sense to check the POI/source signals in Shinrarta? ...especially near the 8th moon
