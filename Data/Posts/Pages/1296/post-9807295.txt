So we're these in game expansions before they removed the PF from the BGS in systems or placed there by FD?
Mmm, my memory is poor, but I think PFLB have always been in Shinrarta. I remember something happening along the lines of PF (which clique??) being made a superpower, but dont know the details. I did try googling this a month or so ago, but my googlefu is weak...

I usually rely on Han_Zen for such historical facts, but not seen him here recently.
