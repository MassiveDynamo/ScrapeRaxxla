I don’t think the PF being made a superpower was something that came from FD.

Pretty sure it was just players coming up with a sensible figurative explanation for the PF rep notifications that came from killing Thargs. - it wasn’t a minor faction rep change, plus there’d also been the reports of people getting rep changes with the Thargoids, so the PF rep changes made most sense as being with an overarching version of the PF.
There's an Official Response from Frontier on this thread:
No Pilot's Federation in Shinrarta?
The Pilot's Federation faction is gone from Shinrarta, the system is uncontrolled. Bug? Feature?

Hi there,

Feature.

The pilots federation is no longer a faction, they are now a superpower.

They still own assets, though. Like Jameson Memorial.

I think they own the starter stations (Trevithick Dock and Beagle 2 Landing) now, too.

Thanks,
Dom
