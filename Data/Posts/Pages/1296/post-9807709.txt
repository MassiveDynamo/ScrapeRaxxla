This should be considered fact at this point. I know I have heard several separate accounts from people I know who were in the room when it was said, but we have a video from Ascorbius saying he was in the room when it was said, Video link for reference https://m.twitch.tv/clip/SnappyScaryMousePupper.
Yep I and several Delta Squadron members was at the same Q&A but as no one recorded it some people are reluctant to believe that Michael Brooks said what he said.
