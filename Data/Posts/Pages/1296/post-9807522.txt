Are you a baсker? do you remember which system was given only for baсkers?
Shinrata Dhezra/Founders world was the the system that was only supposed to be for Kickstarter backers (and Elite ranked pilots), I bought in at the beta stage and they accidentally let us in and decided not to revoke access... not aware of any others...
