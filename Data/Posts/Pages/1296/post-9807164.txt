Jorki... any idea why the Pilots' Federation Local Branch is in control but no influence and not a minor faction in the system as far as I can see.... have I missed something?

Not as far as I’m aware. It looks to me like FD want PF to be beyond any possible involvement in PowerPlay (though that’s never interested me so I dont have any experience with it, other than getting some of Aisling’s Prismatic Shields).

It fits my hypothesis that PF are driven by Guardian remnants, either AI or descendents of emigants, who have been pulling the strings behind humanity’s development for a long time (wouldn’t be surprised if we were originally a genetically engineered prey species that have been developed into an anti-Thargoid force), and Raxxla is one of their ark ships, or perhaps the name of the Guardian/AI driving it all. I think the hints are in Ram Tah’s decodes, and the triangular motif briefly displayed on the ship’s panel (ship systems are controlled by PF) which is very similar to the Guardian obelisk signs.

P.S. I remembered the other day when I was a youth and suffered various Scottish singers on TV (my parents’ choice!) at New Years Eve; a favourite song was “a wee dock and doris”. I was musing the other day what this was actually about and googled it- turns out “wee Deoch an' Doris” is Gaelic for “one for the road”, literally “one for the door” and doris is Gaelic for door.
I remembered the old SD (now deleted) mission that said “A certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth” ....

There’s a Doris system in-game. Just finished searching it,
There is a facility with tunnels orbiting Doris 9 (“the outermost rim”?) but dived all that I could see...
nothing found.
