Mmm, my memory is poor, but I think PFLB have always been in Shinrarta. I remember something happening along the lines of PF (which clique??) being made a superpower, but dont know the details. I did try googling this a month or so ago, but my googlefu is weak...

I usually rely on Han_Zen for such historical facts, but not seen him here recently.
Pilots of Federation was a faction in Shinrarta Dezhra... at some point they became a (hidden) SuperPower and now we have PF Local Branches. It took place about 4-5 years ago...
