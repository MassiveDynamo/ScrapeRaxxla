OK. I dont remember if this is already posted somewhere, but I thought that since Raxxla has been even in the earlier game (the original elite) that I would backtrack on the systems that are in that game. So I went to Teorge and found a listening post there. Here's what the message read.

But really, dont know if this means something... but its f:n creepy.

EDIT: I guess this is old news and I think this is in the book premonition too... Got excited a bit early i guess.

Raxxla was not in the original Elite game. It was only mentioned in the book that came with the game.

Unless Raxxla is the Thargoid portal at Polaris 4b, it wasn't in the sequels either. The code of FFE has been released to the public and checked in detail.

ED is probably the first Elite game, where Raxxla actually exist.
