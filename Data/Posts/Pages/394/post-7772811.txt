In my own personal experience of setting puzzles, its very easy to make things impossible, and its an extremely fine judgement to set the clue to be accessible but challenging. When people miss what appears to me to be easy enough , its very frustrating. But when later you ask people, you discover that what is obvious to you was extremely obscure to them, for instance, because of a lack of shared history on some point, or just thinking along different lines.

So the Codex, I suspect is a step back when they realised that no-one was going to get it. Tha'ts what I hope anyway.

Now, the jewel - if only we could close the first line of the first clue, then I'm sure we'd get somewhere.. (no-one say Cassiopeia !)

The jewel that BURNS... the mother of galaxieS.. -- Robbie Burns?? - where's the tinfoil roll..
