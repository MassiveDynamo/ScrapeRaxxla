I reckon it must be driving them nuts that we haven't picked up the clues after 5years! We must be missing something really obvious.. so obvious its hidden in plain sight

From a Lore perspective it must be obscure enough to go undetected for a thousand years. It's hard to make something obvious if it has been the inspiration of explorers and conspiracy theorists for centuries. The Dark Wheel probably have fare more info than than we have, and even they haven't found it.
