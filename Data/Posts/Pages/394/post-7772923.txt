Quick question about something that might be related to Raxxla....

Is there anything, in lore, that explains why Sol isn't in Elite and yet is (obviously) still around, and regarded as the cradle of humanity, in ED?


Also, I notice that DW's currently "in the news" regarding the anniversary of cooked salami.
I know Drew's a guy who appreciates a good mystery and the value of a bit of intrigue but he's categorically said he has no insider-knowledge about Raxxla.
I don't doubt that his recent comments relate to some "easter egg" involving salami, or possibly related to something in his books or his other works, but it's highly unlikely it's related to Raxxla.
I suppose it's possible that FDev might've seized upon something Drew's mentioned and used it as part of the legend of Raxxla but they'd be doing it without his knowledge - which means he can't provide clues himself.
