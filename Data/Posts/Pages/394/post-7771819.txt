OK. I dont remember if this is already posted somewhere, but I thought that since Raxxla has been even in the earlier game (the original elite) that I would backtrack on the systems that are in that game. So I went to Teorge and found a listening post there. Here's what the message read.

But really, dont know if this means something... but its f:n creepy.

EDIT: I guess this is old news and I think this is in the book premonition too... Got excited a bit early i guess.
That message is from the Drew Wagar Salome storyline, not Raxxla related.

Also, Raxxla was not in the original Elite game. It believe the original game would have been finished before "The Dark Wheel" novella introduced Raxxla and so Raxxla has only been picked up on in Elite Dangerous. I have been known to be wrong though
