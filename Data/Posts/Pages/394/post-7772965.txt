Quick question about something that might be related to Raxxla....

Is there anything, in lore, that explains why Sol isn't in Elite and yet is (obviously) still around, and regarded as the cradle of humanity, in ED?

Yes there is.

In Elite we are licensed as GalCop pilots. Our ships navigation systems will only GalCop controlled systems(and planets with Galcop stations).

According to the the story 'Imprint', it was possible for Elite pilots to get a commissioning with ful jump navigation. This was of course not possible in the game.

Imprint explains a lot of the peculiarities of the GalCop sectors. I think it was partly intended to smoothen the transition to the Fe:2 galaxy.
