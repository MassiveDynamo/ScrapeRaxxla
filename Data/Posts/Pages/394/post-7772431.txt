Just want to post this again to try and get confirmation that this is a normal accurance. Didnâ€™t get any message about a signal being detected or anything. Just randomly noticed my SRV picking up a signal on a far away planet while exploring Kwatis. Lost the signal once I entered my ship :/
That looks like the signal from a surface salvage mission.
