Are these just shuffled names for planets or systems? Or are they something like peoples playe names who have visited Raxxla mixxed up.

I've not seen more on this so far this week. The long string of text contains lower case a-z, upper case A-Z, 0 to 9 digits, spaces, and separated by carriage returns. That's 26+26+10+2 = 64. Base64 (perhaps swapping space and CR with + and / or alternatives) can be converted into other formats (inc. pictures) which might give a clue, but so far I've not had any type of success when converting. There's a lot of characters shown here - it might be a single string if you look at the carriage returns as being just another character.
