OK. I dont remember if this is already posted somewhere, but I thought that since Raxxla has been even in the earlier game (the original elite) that I would backtrack on the systems that are in that game. So I went to Teorge and found a listening post there. Here's what the message read.

But really, dont know if this means something... but its f:n creepy.

EDIT: I guess this is old news and I think this is in the book premonition too... Got excited a bit early i guess.
