Great workaround with the BM. Clever!

EDIT: But also, if this is a 'moving target', the moment you bookmark it you BM a static position in space perhaps. As with some objects that has high motion it may have moved away from the position it was bookmarked.
Good Point. there was a Barry Center i could not drop at because it was moving to fast. will try and find it again and try there.
