Great workaround with the BM. Clever!

EDIT: But also, if this is a 'moving target', the moment you bookmark it you BM a static position in space perhaps. As with some objects that has high motion it may have moved away from the position it was bookmarked. I highly doubt it though, but in a 0.001% scenario it may give us a miss. I'd hate that to happen if it's TDW or Raxxla.
