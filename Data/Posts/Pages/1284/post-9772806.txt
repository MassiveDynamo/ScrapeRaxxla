Many thanks!
I get the part that Shinrarta Dezhra got its name manually and Stellar Forge reffers it as Wregoe FP-E c25-14...

But where you get this information and where did you find the body search string to paste on the galaxy map search bar?
1. Get the system ID from journal or EDSM. Eg Sol: 10477373803
2. Make a copy of his ED SectorNames spreadsheet. In your own copy, paste the value into the cell B6:C7: 10477373803
3. You get a list of real names and IDs (row 26 and down) - pick object-ID you want to explore, jump to the system and use the Gal-map and paste the 'starforge ID' of it to search it.
Then target it and fly to it (or BM it as he shown in the previous posts).

(You want to read the previous 1264 page as well, you can understand more context if you do)
