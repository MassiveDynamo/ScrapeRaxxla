What you have said about DSSA has made me think though. I can't remember where I read it, but somewhere, someone wrote on a forum that 10 years ago the story arc was for the Thargoids to take the bubble and push everyone into the black... which would now be possible without "ing us completely off" with Colonia as established as it is, some of the deep space stations/outposts, and the DSSA network established. As a player base we could coordinate a retaking of the bubble.
Don’t hold your breath for this. Whether or not that was the original intent, there have been sufficiently bad temper tantrums at much smaller scale stuff happening that plans may well have had to change. We’ll see though.
