What you have said about DSSA has made me think though. I can't remember where I read it, but somewhere, someone wrote on a forum that 10 years ago the story arc was for the Thargoids to take the bubble and push everyone into the black... which would now be possible without "ing us completely off" with Colonia as established as it is, some of the deep space stations/outposts, and the DSSA network established. As a player base we could coordinate a retaking of the bubble.

It was leaked in 2016, I think on the old Alien artefact threads, archived some time ago. The attempt to implement the game for consoles has clearly been delaying the unfolding of that plan but I expect the speed will pick up soon. If itâ€™s in the bubble we need to find Raxxla soon!
