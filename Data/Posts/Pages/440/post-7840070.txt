I know tip offs are a hot topic at the moment, so I wondered if anybody had received the seemingly Raxxla related one. I have not been able to get it myself, and annoying I cant find the thread that talked about it, with screenshots. This is from memory, from a couple months ago, but was something like....

There is a rumour that the people of ?HIP? xxxxx? have information regarding the whereabouts of a certain celestrial body, you know the one, the place that isnt a place, the door that is also the key, the myth. Its probably nothing, but it should be checked out.

I THINK the basic mission was hostage rescue, but I could be wrong. I just wondered if anybody had received and/or completed it.

I remember a couple people on the thread saying they had done it and it came to nothing, but they may not have been dedicated Raxxla hunters....
