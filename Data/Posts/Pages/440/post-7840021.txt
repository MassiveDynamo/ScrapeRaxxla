True. Most of us would. Many of us have been looking for/after these features for years. But it seems that FD want their game to keep being a sand box, essentially.
A sand box where you aren't even allowed to build sand castels, though.
Less than 1% of the MW discovered ? Out of the Bubble remain 99% of... emptiness. The Stellar Forge is superb, though. An empty beauty. A huge and dynamic background mostly unexploited by the rest of the game features.We who are/were looking for exciting and fantastic discoveries, stories and quests have to content ourselves with tiny breadcrumbs dropped over a gigantic desert riddled with "don't step here", "please don't touch" and "road closed" signs (i.e. The Cone affair).
Sorry for the whining, but It's such a pity, imho...
