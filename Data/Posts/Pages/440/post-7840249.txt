I believe the implication of this was that all the unknown permit sectors are in the dark spots of the raxxla image. probably not the entire dark spots. I'm sure one could resize it to fit perfectly, but who knows?


most the permits are in the lower right of that SAG A photo... but there seem to also be more than 26 black spots on symbol. interesting idea though.
