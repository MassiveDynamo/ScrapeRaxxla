No no no. The front page covers the missions that used to be handed out by DW in SD.
The Boss would explain this much better than me, but just to keep some concepts clear among the Raxxla mess, be aware that the ancient missions were given by other factions, aimed at doing espionnage on TDW suspect activities. Not by SD TDW.
That was the plot, to shadow TDW investigations for the count of many other factions. (i.e. https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-2571931)
So, two options related to TDW, whether you think this plot is still running under another form and spy TDW or work for TDW to gain their trust and an invite like the Codex suggests.
Imho.
Now, I understand most of this is just happy past times nostalgia, but IF we assume that these missions were finally aimed at the personal journey-discovery of Raxxla (The Myth) and were, for some reason, expressly terminated by FDevs, a pattern remains, though. They were leading you... somewhere. From the core to the rim... and then ?
Could it be extrapolated with consistency ?
