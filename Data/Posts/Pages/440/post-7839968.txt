Hey all,

We should really put "spinning hyperspace" to rest - I've just watched the footage. There is nothing odd there. I see that hyperspace rotation all the time, from the Elysian Shores to Kepler's Crest to the Rift and inside the bubble. It's nothing.

Yeah but how cool it would be if there suddenly were reports of unexplainable hyperspace instability in Barnards Loop region, hyperspace tunnels warping in strange angles and weird observations in witchspace, commanders ending up in places they had not originally planned jumping into, and discovering unexplored systems hidden from our ordinary starmaps. Nobody would know where they are going anymore, following strange patterns somehow in likeness to Thargoid starmaps. And the things out there; derelict anacondas, generationships written out of history, starports made out of flesh and steel, strange spaceships, cold and mute, appearing out of nowhere and a flash of blue light..

I would rather go just crazy about this.
