Hm, almost guaranteed to be totally unrelated.... BUT...

Has anyone ever come up with an explanation as to why Black Holes have an additional Detail (animated Signal Spectrum) displayed in the FSS when zoomed in?

I guess one would need to record a few and see if the animation is mere fluff FX - or changes when FSS'ing different Black Holes.

When I 1st saw that - together with the animation of the Gravity Tunnel - I had a weird idea...

.... with some nice spikes on that small Emissions Signature you could approach and "fly through" the Black Hole instead of the usual "Dropping - too close" or hitting the Body Exclusion Zone?
(and the sentence "place that isn't a place, door that isn't a door" came to mind... I mean hey, Black Holes are true "weirdos in space" after all, so it would kinda fit those nicely. And they're the only Singularity we can somewhat safely approach and fool around with, as opposed to White Dwarfs or Neutrons. Plus, it's "in plain sight", because who zooms into a Black Hole when the Honk DSS'es all the Stars of a System already?)

Just a weird idea but who knows... Most ideas start off a little weird, right?
(and the whirlwind animation kinda invites to try it IMHO, like the classic "The Black Hole" movie intro from 1979)

Seems like time to build a ship with maximum hull strength and reinforcement, then supercruise straight into the dead center of Sag A*, plumb, at maximum possible velocity.
