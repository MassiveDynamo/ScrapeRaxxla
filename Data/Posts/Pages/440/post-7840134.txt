Talking of old Rifters, are the Children of Raxxla still an active PMF? They pretty much abandoned/boycotted the official forums after the Salome debacle, probably due to the abusive s**tshow the forums descended into after some people didn't like the way the endgame panned out. There were/are a bunch of smart people in that group with a lot of good ideas. I miss having them around to (RP) argue with.
Already answered by others, but yeah, the pop up here and there on threads. But yes, I agree, it's a shame that we no longer have a thread with their ongoing active involvement. Lots of good cmdrs in the CoR!
