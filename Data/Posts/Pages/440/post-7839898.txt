Hey all,

We should really put "spinning hyperspace" to rest - I've just watched the footage. There is nothing odd there. I see that hyperspace rotation all the time, from the Elysian Shores to Kepler's Crest to the Rift and inside the bubble. It's nothing.

True.

The hyperspace tunnel always starts to spin, just before drop out. If there is lag in the loading of the next system, the spinning part of the hyperspace sequence can get quit long.
Normally it's just a few seconds before you drop, but it happens on every jump.
