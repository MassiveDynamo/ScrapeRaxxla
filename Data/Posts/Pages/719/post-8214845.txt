Comparitive Mythology - if you read it closely the only comparison to myths is that Raxxla is as myth-like, equally unsubstantiated, as much an unproven place as El Dorado, Atlantis and the Kingdom of Prester John. The Codex uses those myths to discredit or throw doubt onto the existence of Raxxla in the first place as a treasure hunt some have wasted their entire lives on.

I first read the toast as a lament to a lost place (fernweh), fun though it is, nothing has changed my mind yet that it means anything else. Oh yeah and its the 'Alleged' toast of the Dark Wheel according to the Codex, not even that is substantiated as fact.

Not saying theres nothing that will help, but theres another saying about trees...sometimes you cant see the Wood for the trees
