Pursuing the dark wheel doesn't sound like it would be helpful to the search for raxxla at all since they're searching for it and have been for generations and haven't found it.

Raxxla is likely no longer a planet, having destroyed itself after its initial Discovery and that's why nobody has been able to find it again. They're looking for a planet but it is now an asteroid belt. Something we find in it will identify the belt as the remnants of raxxla. That's what we are looking for
I guess that I like working on the Dark Wheel aspect because it is a little more tangible. We have some 'slightly' more specific clues to its location and makes sense to me as a stepping stone to raxxla. Hopefully after generations of searching, they might have some better insight / clues to raxxlas location.
