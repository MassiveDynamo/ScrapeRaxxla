Marianne's Journey to Arcadia

So regards this little oddity I actually contacted the author of the original publication where 'Marianne Arcadia' is the protagonist.

Sally Odgers confirmed: 'I didn't write 'Marianne's Journey to Arcadia'. I didn't know until today that it existed. However, Marianne Arcadia is the protagonist of three of my books: Elysian Dawn, The Silvering and New Dreams, which are the first three books in the ELYDIAN DAWN series. Therefore, it's a coincidence!". (Source email is available).

Now this only rules out the writer as a source, the station name is still highly likely named by a player (fan of book), or its an internationally hand crafted Station by FD (is MB a fan?).

Is there a database of player created content? FD are unlikely to confirm / deny (ticket submitted).

All in all I find it more likely for it to still be a player named station, as there are still no other reference points to confirm this location.
