This is the problem with the mythological approach, because myth begets myth and there is then so much inherent linkage within myths that basing hypotheses on mythological inferences is hazardous. Clearly FD have used mythology to source names for various objects within the game, but given the size of the playing field that’s hardly surprising; I’ve seen politicians and other well known names used for npcs, but don’t believe that is at all relevant to any mysteries in-game.
I get what you are saying however raxxla itself is called out as a myth.. and as you say "myth begets myth".. was there a prgenetor myth? Also alot of references to raxxla specifically allude to older myths... music of the spheres,el dorado... is there a direct connection probably not. Allusions suggest similar story lines or elements though, so i wouldnt totally discount the "mythalogical approach"
