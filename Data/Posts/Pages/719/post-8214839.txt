It would be nice if they had "leads" you could chase down for them that would sometimes lead to nothing special like a crashed sidey or dbx or sometimes leads to unfound side story stuff like the formadine rift mystery, or other 'personally undiscovered' content.

'Tip-off' Missions/ Listening Beacons / occasional GalNet hints 'strange signal in Upaniklis that needs investigating'

Marianne's Journey to Arcadia
SR confirmed I didn't write 'Marianne's Journey to Arcadia'. I didn't know until today that it existed. However, Marianne Arcadia is the protagonist of three of my books: Elysian Dawn, The Silvering and New Dreams, which are the first three books in the ELYDIAN DAWN series. Therefore, it's a coincidence!". (Source email is available).

Now this only rules out the writer as a source, the station name is still highly likely named by a player (fan of book), or its an internationally hand crafted Station by FD (is MB a fan?).

More likely to be hand inserted by fdev knowing the storyline or the name of the protagonist as an Easter Egg. Im sure the script/storyline was submitted and approved long before the final publication. Exactly like TP Discworld Station....if Raxxla was a Discworld I would be happy with that
