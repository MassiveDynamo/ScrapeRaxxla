From my previous post if you missed it,

"If you check out this forum thread, Marianne's Journey to Arcadia in LTT 606 was already mentioned in 2016. So who copied whom, we do not know, or if even MJTA is a reference to the book... What I'm saying is that there really isn't any need to be linked, as the underlying mythology behind both instances are probably pretty similar because of comparative mythology. "

This is the problem with the mythological approach, because myth begets myth and there is then so much inherent linkage within myths that basing hypotheses on mythological inferences is hazardous. Clearly FD have used mythology to source names for various objects within the game, but given the size of the playing field that’s hardly surprising; I’ve seen politicians and other well known names used for npcs, but don’t believe that is at all relevant to any mysteries in-game.
