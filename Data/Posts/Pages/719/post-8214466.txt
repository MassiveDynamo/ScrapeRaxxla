I get what you are saying however raxxla itself is called out as a myth.. and as you say "myth begets myth".. was there a prgenetor myth? Also alot of references to raxxla specifically allude to older myths... music of the spheres,el dorado... is there a direct connection probably not. Allusions suggest similar story lines or elements though, so i wouldnt totally discount the "mythalogical approach"

Exactly, I agree.

The problem with confirmation bias and motifs are that once you understand a little, its really hard to unsee them. Popular culture sometimes places these motifs well and oftentimes badly which makes you wonder if its just a signaler of sorts. Look away if you haven't watched these recent movies (Ad Astra, Star Wars) or don't have some idea of the Hero's Journey. I will be spoiling the end of these movies so if you haven't watched them, look away.

There are good examples of placement but running out of time here so will come back later.
