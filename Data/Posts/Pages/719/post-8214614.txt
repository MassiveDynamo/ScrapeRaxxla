I guess that I like working on the Dark Wheel aspect because it is a little more tangible. We have some 'slightly' more specific clues to its location and makes sense to me as a stepping stone to raxxla. Hopefully after generations of searching, they might have some better insight / clues to raxxlas location.
It would be nice if they had "leads" you could chase down for them that would sometimes lead to nothing special like a crashed sidey or dbx or sometimes leads to unfound side story stuff like the formadine rift mystery, or other 'personally undiscovered' content.
