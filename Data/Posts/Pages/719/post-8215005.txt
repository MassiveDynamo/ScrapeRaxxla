I agree. I think, because the two codex entries are cross-linked, with the toast presented in the Raxxla section, that the toast is a real clue. It my be directions to TDW station, from where there will be further breadcrumbs, or it may lead to Raxxla itself. As I understand matters the original description of Raxxla as a planet which was found but lost by TDW, with an alien artefact and controlled by powerful twisted men, has all been retconned by FD. So I suspect Raxxla may be a Guardian ship of some kind, possibly planet-sized, or a (TDW?) station named Raxxla Gateway. Note that a station named “??? gateway” might answer “a door that is also the key”.
that sounds to me as we just have to spell out "...mechlon..."
