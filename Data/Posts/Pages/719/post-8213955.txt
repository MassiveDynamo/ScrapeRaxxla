I get what you are saying however raxxla itself is called out as a myth.. and as you say "myth begets myth".. was there a prgenetor myth? Also alot of references to raxxla specifically allude to older myths... music of the spheres,el dorado... is there a direct connection probably not. Allusions suggest similar story lines or elements though, so i wouldnt totally discount the "mythalogical approach"

Oh, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is some mythology involved in solution to the toast, but I don’t think it would be very deep, or form the basis for a treasure hunt per se !
