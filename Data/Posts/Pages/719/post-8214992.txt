'Tip-off' Missions/ Listening Beacons / occasional GalNet hints 'strange signal in Upaniklis that needs investigating'



More likely to be hand inserted by fdev knowing the storyline or the name of the protagonist as an Easter Egg. Im sure the script/storyline was submitted and approved long before the final publication. Exactly like TP Discworld Station....if Raxxla was a Discworld I would be happy with that

Agreed, but only if thereâ€™s a tiny Rincewind and Twoflowers in orbit!
