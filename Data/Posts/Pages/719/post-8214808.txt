Marianne's Journey to Arcadia

So regards this little oddity I actually contacted the author of the original publication where 'Marianne Arcadia' is the protagonist.

Sally Odgers confirmed: 'I didn't write 'Marianne's Journey to Arcadia'. I didn't know until today that it existed. However, Marianne Arcadia is the protagonist of three of my books: Elysian Dawn, The Silvering and New Dreams, which are the first three books in the ELYDIAN DAWN series. Therefore, it's a coincidence!". (Source email is available).

Now this only rules out the writer as a source, the station name is still highly likely named by a player (fan of book), or its an internationally hand crafted Station by FD (is MB a fan?).

Is there a database of player created content? FD are unlikely to confirm / deny (ticket submitted).

All in all I find it more likely for it to still be a player named station, as there are still no other reference points to confirm this location.

Would appreciate if you could pm me the source, after stripping identifiers of course.

Considering the denial of the author plus the station was in place at least by 2016 and the book was published in 2018, it is most probably a coincidence. (Edit: In addition, it can't be a fan of the books)
