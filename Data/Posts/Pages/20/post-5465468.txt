Think the bubble is a good place to start the search; however, if Raxxla is located in the bubble in plain sight, then wouldn't it have been found already?

Maybe not if it's in a system, like a rogue planet - WAAAY out from the main star. Look at the Gen Ships and how they are found out in deep space. Listening posts give us a starting planet, and then a direction to fly in, and eventually the Genship pops up in nav-panel. I wonder if Raxxla is something like that, where we need a start location, and a direction to fly in, and eventually can come across it.

Considering how big in-system deep space is, i doubt anyone could find it unless they had those 2 key points (start-point & direction of travel)
