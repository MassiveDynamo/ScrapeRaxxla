Delivery missions to Lave 2 being offered. Bugs reported her https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/346797-Lave-2-permit-vs-missions. Could be indication of permit possible, or just a bug. Inclined to think the latter. Future QA response on bug might indicate which.

Could not find anything lore wise ruling out Lave 2 as Raxxla.
