Not sure how much it's been covered, but going by the above post of 'We have "The Children of Raxxla" advertising the place in their faction name. Salome speaking about Raxxla from Beagle Point and stating that it was first mentioned "in Federation data banks on Earth in 2814".'

When was it first claimed to have been visited again? If it is prior to all of these huge FSD jumps we get now, I can imagine that Raxxla could actually not be that far away from us? Otherwise it'd take a long time to get there and back?
