Coming from the Rifter's thread here, Someone posted and I discussed the idea with him that the R.R. line continues past the Zurara, figured it might lead to Raxxla, as it seems to be a line of great importance to Sirius, who had started colonizing along that route.
It's a nice idea, but I doubt it. There are about 20 official ED stories, and others still in production, there is no reason I can think of why FDev would put Raxxla somewhere where only a clue in one story would lead to. Please do have a look though, it would be cool if you found something new further out from the Zurara.
