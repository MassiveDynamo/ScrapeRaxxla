My biggest concern is that it's hidden in a permit locked system awaiting some future update or assets - This would mean we are hunting for nothing as we cannot "find" it even though technically its in game.

It's actually a crashed condor on the 3rd moon of the 8th planet of an unknown system, somewhere in the bubble, disguised as a canister of biowaste. Or maybe not...
