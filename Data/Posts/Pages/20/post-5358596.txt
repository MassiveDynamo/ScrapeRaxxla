Polaris has a connection to the Thargoids per Frontier: First Encounters.

This I definitely know! Polaris contains a structure that leads to the Thargoid's homeworld. By the by, Sirius Corperation created the software for the Mk.3(b?) drives we use.

A curious thing happened while streaming my first supercruise trip, Shinrarta Dezhra -> Lave. A youtube user claimed it was a waste of time, and definitely not the way to find Raxxla. Asking for elaboration, the user said that FDev had made 2 comments on the subject. No further explanation was given, and asking for references no reply was (yet) given.

Any ideas on the Fdev comments?
