There are systems in-game along those lines:
Cybele
Magna Mater
Terra Mater
Dea Motrona
Matres
Tellus (Roman equivalent)
All of these girls are in the same relative Y coordinates. Except for Terra Mater.


These girls are also in good company, as in this area is also home to a plethora of gods and goddesses:
Danu - Irish The peoples of the goddess Danu.
Hadad - Canaanite storm god
Asherah - Hebrew fertility goddess
Gen - Egyptian god of earth
Personally I think these ladies don’t really associate with anything, however they are more likely part of a greater conglomeration of ‘older gods’, compromising of ‘celestial’ upper deities, and ‘demonic’ lower deities.
