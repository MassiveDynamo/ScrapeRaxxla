The Knowledge Base entry for Alliance > History has something to say about El Dorado.

Alioth was colonised.
The crucible in which the Alliance was forged was Alioth, a system so rich in gas and mineral resources that early surveyors considered it as a stellar El Dorado. When the Federation established its colony on Alioth 5b in 2452, they gave the planet the less grandiose name of Fruitcake, as mineral deposits lay in the loamy soil as abundantly as raisins in cake. Later commentators would reflect, bitterly, that the world was well named because 'everyone wanted a piece'.
