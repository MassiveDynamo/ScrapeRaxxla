The burial sequence in Elite: Legacy is very reminiscent of the description of Trinkets of Hidden Fortune and I do wonder if it was pointing us towards them and the now-abandoned TDW missions. If so, then I fear it is a redundant clue but worth bearing in mind, in case the Trinkets have been repurposed with a different role - after all, when TDW mission were removed, it would have been a good time to remove the Trinkets - but they did not.

Even with Michael Brookes' own novel, I still think we have to be a bit careful as it was written before some things were implemented. For example, it mentions multicrew but the description seems to give more advantage to it than a real situation in 3309 would. Also, there is no Panther Clipper in game, or a module that prevents ships from jumping to either hyperspace or supercruise over a wide region...
