Even with Michael Brookes' own novel, I still think we have to be a bit careful
Yes I totally agree. There are a large number of discrepancies in the book that don’t align with the game.

Eg: ‘Bring up the Beaumont insurrection from 3294. A map of a star system appeared from the holo-projector. The Beaumont system was a frontier world far below Achenar’ - Michael Brookes Elite Legacy

An initial search shows no system named Beaumont in game, interestingly it’s French for beautiful mountain - coincidence?

Generally my hypothesis is based upon only the presumption Brookes established the location of Raxxla at the same point of writing the book. It’s possible it’s actually a red-herring because certain points in the codex sound like they cast doubt on these rumours.

The existence of the ‘Lost Realms’ and the ‘Mountains’ areas is as I propose, evidence of a significant level of detail being built pre-launch; personally as someone with RL experience in GIS mapping - this is not difficult to do, complex certainly, especially if you’re building a game, doubly so if your not GIS trained, but it’s not impossible (and yes I accept my own GIS experience may be forming bias).

If the author had such intent its therefore not outside the realm of plausibility that they would want to mischievously spin a few hints into their other works… I’d be tempted too…

I once worked in the phrase ‘obfuscated on the outer rim’ into an official document, just for a jape myself .

Such a ‘jape’ in Legacy, initially may originally not have been intended to be made public… I suspect it was a clandestine move, and only referenced (if true that is - this is just conjecture) only once the Codex was written…and incorporated as a method to embellish the myth or repurpose assets?

Of course it could be another book entirely…
