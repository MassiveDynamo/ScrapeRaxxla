If that is the case, we have full control of Raxxla. See snake symbolism cropping up with TDW and any ships linked to police forces and Galactic Navy (Federation). The ships are the following manufacturers:

Lakon Spaceways
Faulcon Manspace/Faulcon Delacy
Zorgon Peterson

I think TDW very much has had full control of Raxxla since 2805. This being the core reason for their secrecy. Just a guess: the point of the "personal journey" rediscover who you are and how very powerful that makes you. We need to stop looking externally. We clearly have the answers. We got the invite which means we're all at minimum grandchildren of Peter Jameson who leads The Dark Wheel.
