Pure speculation here: I am increasingly leaning towards "The Emperor's Own" being The Pilots' Federation founded in 2805. Facece has come up far too often as has Jaques and Peter Jameson. Besides, we have Peter's Wreck and Peter's Base in Facece. In that case, the Elite force protecting Raxxla is the Elite Pilots' Federation (of which TDW is a clique of that organization).

There's also the comment made by Raffe Zetter (possibly another alias of Jaques/Jameson):

Rafe nodded. ‘That’s right, Alex,’ he said softly. ‘You can be deadly, you can be dangerous, and you can end up as pet food in orbit around a dog’s ass-of-a-world like Isveve. But if you’re Elite, and you die, then there’s a reason for your death…’

You betray the EPF/TDW: you end up dead .
