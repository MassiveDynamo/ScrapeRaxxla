Raxxla logo disassembled...


Asteroid fields of Sol:

Innermost layer is astronomical symbol for sun: â˜‰
The ring of the solar symbol additionally serves as the dividing line between terresterial planets and the gas giants.
The 3 arcs serves as representation for another oddity of Sol: the Greeks, Trojan, and Hildas asteroid fields that exist in addition to main asteroid belt.
Additionally, the arcs + inner á³ƒ represents how many ringed gas giants are in Sol - a total of 4: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
Dashed line is the dividing line between gas giants and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) - in-game reprsented by: Pluto/Charon, 90482 Orcus/Vanth, (307261) 2002 MS4, Salacia/Actaea, and Haumea/Hi'iaka.
The final 6 dark sections are representative of 6 largest scattered disk objects (SDOs): Quaoar, Makemake, (225088) 2007 OR10 or Gonggong, Eris, Sedna, and Persephone.

Additionally, it should be noted the Raxxla logo appears to look like how TDW's station is described: a spinning orbis station with lots of solar panel (the 6 dark zones of the logo). The Sol system is currently the record holder for number of stations at four. Further, the Pilot's Federation symbol which is emblazened everywhere in stations, outposts, ports, and settlements is literally the symbol of Earth itself: ðŸœ¨

Better version of Earth astronomical symbol and Pilot's Federation symbol (in-game it is an orange circle split 4 ways):
