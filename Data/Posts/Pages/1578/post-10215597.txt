I wonder if this tradition had a particular origin?


Good point - alot of cultures have grave goods associated with burial… The inclusion of figurines and “trinkets” reminds me of mingqi from China.

They were recreating the world (or was it galaxy) - from the trinkets and figurines symbolizing things and people to the shapes of the tombs indicating the cardinal directions and the dome of the sky. - all under a nice mound…
