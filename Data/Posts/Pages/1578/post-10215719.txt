Rochester said:
Mother goddess of mountains?

In Greece, Cybele became associated with mountains, town and city walls, fertile nature, and wild animals, especially lions. In Rome, Cybele became known as Magna Mater ("Great Mother").
There are systems in-game along those lines:
Cybele
Magna Mater
Terra Mater
Dea Motrona
Matres
Tellus (Roman equivalent)
