Thinking more on ‘female chaos deities’ as a potential Miltonian metaphor for the entity in Paradise Lost ‘Chaos’ the womb of creation.

Tiamat - Mesopotamian goddess of salt water / sea; mother of gods and of chaos - (MB wrote a Drabble about her). Has brother and lover is named Apsu (also known as Abzu) - Tiamat is in game.

Kali - Hindu goddess of chaos and destruction in game.

Lilith, Lilit, Lilitu, or Lilis - Hebrew, possibly linked to destruction and chaos? In game.

Nyx - one of the earliest Greek gods to exist, as the offspring of Chaos alongside Erebus( Darkness), in game.

There are a few others as ‘bodies’ but I’m of the perspective that’s too wide.
