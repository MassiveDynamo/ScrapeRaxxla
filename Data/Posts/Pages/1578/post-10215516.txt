Pondering the section within M Brookes book ‘Legacy’ which FD replicated in the memorial beacons, and which I suspect hold some similarity with Trinkets…

‘At the suggestion of the engineering chief, a cargo pod was transformed into an oversized coffin. The mementoes all fitted inside and a memorial plaque laser-etched into the surface. Lina wept openly as the pod launched into space’ Michael Brookes Elite Legacy.

Now the pod was jettisoned in Artemis, but with the proliferation in game of Celtic references, and this being a very unique burial theme, I wonder if this tradition had a particular origin?

I feels to me, the ‘children’s story’ alluded to in the Codex is likely to be Brookes Legacy, simply due to the existence of the description:

’ Michael Brookes Elite Legacy.

In the absence of any other book to extrapolate from, what references could be pulled from Legacy?

I’ve re-read Legacy, and it does seem evident there’s a link involvement Artemis, Hecate and Demeter. An obvious ‘leap’ from there ought to be Persephone… but where from there?

Something is missing here, there’s nothing in Persephone that’s glaringly obvious?
Im just re-reading legacy (bought a new hardback as my old paper one is a tad worn!), hoping to find something i missed to.
