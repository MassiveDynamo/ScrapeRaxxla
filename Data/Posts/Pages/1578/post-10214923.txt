From a quick scan of the Wikipedia article on chaos gods https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_gods, have found the following chaos deities as system/planet names in-game.
No idea how close to the lost realms area they are or how relevant they might be.

Canaanite - Yam (Federation)
Egyptian - Apep (anarchy), Nu (Empire), Set (anarchy)
Celtic - Formorians (Anarchy)
Norse-Germanic: Nidhogg (world in the Nastrond system)
Graeco-Roman: Typhon (anarchy)
Persian Zorostarian: Angra Mainyu (anarchy)

Also, following on from Han_Zen's post, regarding names - maybe they aren't always that obvious. One of my alts is in a system called Edenapel...Eden Apple...Apple of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden...
