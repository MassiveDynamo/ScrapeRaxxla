To be fair there is a hundred ways that 'garden' can be interpreted, from my perspective as a Druid if you walk through the door on the far right it can detail life's journey.
The first circle is the Underworld (Annwn), next the journey into the mortal realm (Abred) and finally the celestial realm (Gwynfyd).
Of course our Nordic brothers have different names for the realms but circles are very important to all Pagans.
