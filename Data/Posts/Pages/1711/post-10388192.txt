Yes, but they orbit in gaps within the rings. There are no ring gaps in that pic, so either the moon is orbiting above the plane ring offset from the plane and the centre of the planet (I think that would be highly unstable) or it's orbit somehow takes it to both sides of the ring (but I can't see how that would happen in this pic - too close to the belt), or it's powered somehow and able to correct it's trajectory which would, I think, otherwise see it crash into the ring.

Edit
Else it's a made up picture that someone thought looked good without any nod to reality?
