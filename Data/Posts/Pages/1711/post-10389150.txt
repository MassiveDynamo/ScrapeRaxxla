I doubt that FD have landed on a definite explanation for these mechanics yet. I think they want to see how the game develops, before they put anything in the codex.

My point entirely. Much of what made it to game may not have an applicable real life explanation, and probably won’t make sense. It is a game after all, and people seem overly expectant that ‘everything’ makes logical sense in game - it evidently does not, for various reasons, but likely because FD just made it up so it could work…

Eg in the start if you ran out of fuel in deep space, a random text based cut scene occurred that said a passing NPC gave you a bit of fuel… you never saw the ship, it was just fade to black.

Technically you logically ought to have lost 30 mins to a few days (given your ships pressurised so should have lots of oxygen). But we never went on about the evident time travel aspect going on in that situation…namely that several hours got pruned!
