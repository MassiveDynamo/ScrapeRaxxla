Audio maps to date, possibly only seem to point to Thargoid narrative - I presume?

I can’t personally confirm if that’s a correct assumption but one might speculate ultimately such insight might only seed our ‘environmental understanding’?

There could well be things out there, there might not which we haven’t found that link directly to Raxxla. I think there ‘was’ a Raxxla story but, I suspect it got canned, and anything built specifically for it, left in situ. Again it might not directly point anywhere ‘now’ but rather only seed this persistent background environmental awareness.

Either way, irrespective, any information is intelligence, as it gives context and might identify something hidden beyond our perception?
