Escape pods and their physical properties were explained during development. The Cmdr seat and part of the cockpit is in fact the ipod; this is ejected and encased, much like the Remlock device.

Our travel to a nearby system is a ‘cut scene’ FD simply did not employ into the game, much like other things it’s a suspension of belief. It’s just an escape pod we don’t get to fly, we don’t actually die in game.

If we go down this train of thought, the entire premise of the game is actually totally illogical, given the ‘handwoven’ theory of digital presence, which in itself renders to entire reality simply absurd.

There is my humble experience, simply a large level of technical aspects FD simply chose to omit, or retrofit, or retcon, the lore is in my opinion from FD perspective fluid and cannot be wholly reliant.

Allen Stroud who wrote much of the ED lore gave a very specific response about the lore in this thread. Certain texts were chosen over others, some simply were omitted, not everything is canon.

The initial idea of integrated escape pods doesn't work though. They were sort of just mentioned in the beginning, without any real explanation at release. They would have to be instant travel devices or at least close. If a pod could travel from Beagle point to Sol in 20 sec., no one would bother to use a slow space ship with limited jump range.
We also happen to die in the SRV or on foot, from time to time. The SRV could of course have a pod, but on foot would be strange.

I doubt that FD have landed on a definite explanation for these mechanics yet. I think they want to see how the game develops, before they put anything in the codex.
