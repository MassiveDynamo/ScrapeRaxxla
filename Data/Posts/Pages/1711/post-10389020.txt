Escape pods and their physical properties were explained during development. The Cmdr seat and part of the cockpit is in fact the pod; this is ejected and encased, much like the Remlock device.

Our travel to a nearby system is a ‘cut scene’ FD simply did not employ into the game, much like other things it’s a suspension of belief. It’s just an escape pod we don’t get to see or fly, we don’t actually die in game.

Again if we run out of fuel, there is only one logical reason for the ship to self destruct, otherwise it should float around forever, it does do to auto-eject the escape pod.

If we go down this train of thought, if why this or why that doesn’t make sense, the entire premise of the game is actually totally illogical, given the various ‘handwoven’ theories applied, one example being of digital presence, which in itself renders to entire reality simply absurd.

There is my humble experience, simply a large level of technical aspects FD simply chose to omit, or retrofit, or retcon, for ‘practical’ reasons, the lore is in my opinion from FD perspective fluid and cannot be wholly reliant in this regard.

Allen Stroud who wrote much of the ED lore gave a very specific response about the lore in this thread. Certain texts were chosen over others, some simply were omitted, not everything is canon, but effectively whatever is ‘in ED is cannon’ anything outside that is not - isn’t.
