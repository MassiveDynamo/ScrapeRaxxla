So, Hammer. Not sure this is the same fella as in Elite Legacy but given the rarity of name, I am going to say it is likely the same character. Hammer's from Lucifer - the hell planet of Sirius. Originally, the character is from a story from "Further Tales of Life on the Frontier" that shipped with FFE. Given Hammer's affinity for bars it would make sense this is same character.

Still processing the story and what we're supposed to take away from it - probably something along the lines of sometimes your preconceived notions need a harsh reality check.

WARNING : Story is definitely R-rated but then again so were Wanted and Nemorensis. The galaxy is a rough place.
