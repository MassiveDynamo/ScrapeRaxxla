So, Hammer. Not sure this is the same fella as in Elite Legacy but given the rarity of name, I am going to say it is likely the same character. Hammer's from Lucifer - the hell planet of Sirius. Originally, the character is from a story from "Further Tales of Life on the Frontier" that shipped with FFE. Given Hammer's affinity for bars it would make sense this is same character.

Still processing the story and what we're supposed to take away from it - probably something along the lines of sometimes your preconceived notions need a harsh reality check.

WARNING : Story is definitely R-rated but then again so were Wanted and Nemorensis. The galaxy is a rough place.
Brilliant. I have been looking for that story. Haven't read it in about 30 years. I did not remember the name Links Hammer.

I'm also missing:
Genuine Thargoid by Moira Sheehan
Ruined Blood by Jude Jones
Invisible Enemy by Kathy Braben
Lucifer Falling by Julian Flood
If you have them by any chance, please post them.

One might assume that the techniques of DNA synthesis have in fact improved, by 3300 and our Commander is rebuilt from the ground up, every time we die.
This story has the best explanation of why we have magic escape pods. Something we didn't have in the old games.
