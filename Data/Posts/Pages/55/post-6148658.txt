Well, it seems we are few here who give some credit to the unique clue MB actually gave us.
Good! Less competition then !

As I've said before I think it's end-game content. As such, if it hasn't already been found there will be clues and hints to guide people to it, but as I've previously said also, I think we can find it, at least the general location, even if we can't do anything with that info at the time. We know Fdev have previously said they don't care if we find stuff early, it's if we fail to find important stuff in time that they start to worry and drop more and more clues until it's found.

I don't think so. My feeling is that Raxxla is a personal quest, a Concerto where only the Solista matters and not a Simfonia , a collective work, like other storylines.
IMHO FDevs have set up the quest since the first day like a bonus for the players who were aware of the myth from former games and novels. An eastern egg, a tribute without relation with others storylines (now, because when the Rift mystery was going on, I thought Raxxla was the answer) .
That's why there will be no clues as MB said.
