As I've said before I think it's end-game content. As such, if it hasn't already been found there will be clues and hints to guide people to it, but as I've previously said also, I think we can find it, at least the general location, even if we can't do anything with that info at the time. We know Fdev have previously said they don't care if we find stuff early, it's if we fail to find important stuff in time that they start to worry and drop more and more clues until it's found.

Well I already went through that spectacularly disappointing process with the Rift mystery. I'm not going to be played for that kind of fool again.
I'm going back to the Rift thread where there's nothing left to let me down
