Two questions:

1. How do the many asteroid bases scattered around the various nebulae fit into this logic?
2. Regarding the 'massively, hugely unlikely' part - isn't that EXACTLY the reason why Raxxla is so significant?

All of those bases are new - as in, made in the last three years. So, all of them fit into my logic - in that, if FTL was easy and commonplace prior to FSD then those bases would be old and there would be colonies all over the Galaxy. There's not, so, older FTL was limited in the extreme.

2) Sure, but you're forgetting - Raxxla is known about. So, at least one person made it there and back, and if Ryder's theories/myths are true then many people made it there, live there and guard it. If that's the case then it must have been close enough to known space that getting there (and back) was viable - what's the point of guarding a place and assassinating people that know where it is if it's so far away that it's almost impossible to get to?
