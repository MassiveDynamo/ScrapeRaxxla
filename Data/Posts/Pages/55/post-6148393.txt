I thought we were looking for a planet, not a moonbase *shrug*

Either way, if you make it impossible to find, then you have to provide a trail of breadcrumbs, or you may as well not include it at all.
So those of you who think it's in the Bubble, but obfuscated, how do you think we're going to find it?

As I've said before I think it's end-game content. As such, if it hasn't already been found there will be clues and hints to guide people to it, but as I've previously said also, I think we can find it, at least the general location, even if we can't do anything with that info at the time. We know Fdev have previously said they don't care if we find stuff early, it's if we fail to find important stuff in time that they start to worry and drop more and more clues until it's found.
