All of those bases are new - as in, made in the last three years. So, all of them fit into my logic - in that, if FTL was easy and commonplace prior to FSD then those bases would be old and there would be colonies all over the Galaxy. There's not, so, older FTL was limited in the extreme.

2) Sure, but you're forgetting - Raxxla is known about. So, at least one person made it there and back, and if Ryder's theories/myths are true then many people made it there, live there and guard it. If that's the case then it must have been close enough to known space that getting there (and back) was viable - what's the point of guarding a place and assassinating people that know where it is if it's so far away that it's almost impossible to get to?

Are they new?
They just became visible recently, but that doesn't mean that they're new.
Also, it's kind of a weird coincidence that all these asteroid bases suddenly appeared all at once - how did all that construction happen without anybody hearing about it?

What's the point of keeping somewhere secret if it's right in the middle of populated space?
If Raxxla is now in the Bubble then somebody would have found it. You can't keep it secret - there are just too many people you'd have to kill. It would be like trying to hide a secret city in the middle of Norfolk.
