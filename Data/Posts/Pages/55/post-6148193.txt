Not wishing to be a damp squib, but I guess it's not in game yet, rather like the generation ships suddenly appeared recently.

It is in-game and has been since the start, confirmed by DB.

"David Braben said “It’s out there and we (FD) know where it is.”"

That doesn't mean that a) It's currently possible to find it, or b) it's possible to do anything with it yet.

And here's Drew saying he asked DB directly, that's where the quote comes from, so if you want to call Drew a liar, go for it
