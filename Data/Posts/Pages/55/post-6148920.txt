Not wishing to be a damp squib, but I guess it's not in game yet, rather like the generation ships suddenly appeared recently.

I think DBOBE himself has confirmed Raxxla has been in-game from the start, but only he and a small number of FD know where. To disbelieve that statement suggests an existentialist state of mind which disbelieves (rather like the Zarura deniers) anything of interest is in game until it is found, & if that were to be the case then playing the game would be meaningless.
