Yep, that's why I think it's founders world too. A journey everyone has to take for themselves - earning elite status to get there, and "you have to make it a tiny bit obvious" - most people looking for Raxxla head off into the black, And that makes total sense in terms of a place that's hard to get to, takes dedication, etc.

But, founders world is a place that, IMO fits all the clues and is hidden in plain sight, and is an earth-like world and takes a personal journey to get there. Maybe the reason some Raxxla hunters don't like it as a potential solution is maybe because it's too easy? it's right there after all. But, as I've said, knowing where Raxxla is isn't the point, it's actually being able to interact with it, which I believe is where the actual journey starts

The other reason I think it's Founders is because Raxxla was never in any other game. I think they made it Founders World as sort of a nod to people who supported the dream, the idea of ED, just like for decades the myth of Raxxla existed despite never being in any game and people still talked about it and searched for it. I realise that's a bit prosaic but there it is

I mean, it's entirely possible that the Raxxla Gate at Founders is like a Stargate that goes to the heart of one of the permit locked areas, there's another human bubble there made up of TDW and Elite pilot descendents, it's permit locked because if anyone found it now it would be pretty obvious what it was, they hate visitors and that's what Rebecca meant when she said "And they thought the Thargoids were trouble"!

Who knows, but it's fun speculating
