Well, it seems we are few here who give some credit to the unique clue MB actually gave us.
Good! Less competition then !



I don't think so. My feeling is that Raxxla is a personal quest, a Concerto where only the Solista matters and not a Simfonia , a collective work, like other storylines.
IMHO FDevs have set up the quest since the first day like a bonus for the players who were aware of the myth from former games and novels. An eastern egg, a tribute without relation with others storylines (now, because when the Rift mystery was going on, I thought Raxxla was the answer) .
That's why there will be no clues as MB said.

Thing is, if there will be no clues, as MB said, then that means the mission that started this thread are meaningless?
