I believe Raxxla is out there, either in the bubble or nearby. As to why it hasn't been found, it's currently hard to find stuff in this game, due to missing scanner functionality (heatmaps and such). It might be on a planet with an atmosphere. It might be on a planet that doesn't show up when you honk the system.

For all we know, it could lie beyond Hutton Orbital. If I was an ED developer, that's where I'd hide it!
