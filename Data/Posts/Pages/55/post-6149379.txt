If Raxxla is now in the Bubble then somebody would have found it. You can't keep it secret - there are just too many people you'd have to kill. It would be like trying to hide a secret city in the middle of Norfolk.

I'm sure I recall hearing a little while back that all systems within the bubble have now been discovered. If that's the case then my thoughts are that either it's not in the bubble, it's hiding in plain sight (Founders' World theory) or is a planet in a system that has not been detail scanned/doesn't appear on scanners...
