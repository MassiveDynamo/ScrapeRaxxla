I'm sure I recall hearing a little while back that all systems within the bubble have now been discovered. If that's the case then my thoughts are that either it's not in the bubble, it's hiding in plain sight (Founders' World theory) or is a planet in a system that has not been detail scanned/doesn't appear on scanners...

Or itâ€™s permit-locked in plain sight: Lave2, Isinor, Triton...
