Thanks.

I've put in the planes as surfaces in my plot (turned of in the link). The display is pretty horrible, so ti doesn't help much.

I need a better 3D program. I'm used to working in Rhinoseros 3D, but I don't have a lisens at the moment.

I have been using Sketchup for mine... It has a xyz import... works good for plotting out the points.
