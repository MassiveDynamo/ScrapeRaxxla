Fantastic work. I have played with ra 20 / lave myself and not got anywhere, but I've not taken it as far as this

I've put in the planes as surfaces in my plot (turned of in the link). The display is pretty horrible, so ti doesn't help much.

I need a better 3D program. I'm used to working in Rhinoseros 3D, but I don't have a lisens at the moment.
