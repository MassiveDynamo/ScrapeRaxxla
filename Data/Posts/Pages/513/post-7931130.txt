Im just checking back with this because i mentioned last week that i would be setting off on a lead to Raxxla. Well i looked at it carefully then decided not to go because. I was offered a passenger mission going to the The Children of Raxxla staging post in Eafots BP-l d9-35 system. I looked it up with EDSM and found it's discovered and numerous ships passed through even in the last week. So then i saw a passenger mission going to twin earth likes that sounded familiar after clicking on show in Galaxy Map from mission there was my bookmark from years ago hence why i didn't go. Still keep an eye out for Raxxla / Dark Wheel during your travels o7
