Im currently in the Algol system and found this eerie USS.
This Cetus' Bane, his ship, the 5 canisters (earth relics) and the signal are the same everytime I do a reboot, the only thing that changes is Cetus Bane's faction and ship name.
The ship names and factions that i get so far are:
Radical Cross / Spiritual Order Of HR 7729
Agent / Oshata Commodities
Joy / Nzamnet Natural Interestelar
Duc De Dantzig / Graung Universal Inc
Twenty One Friends (this one was funny) / Partnership Of Zemez




is this tinfoil? or the USS was for that treasure hunt event and FD forgot to remove it?

It's the treasure hunt.
FDev never got around to tidying it up.
