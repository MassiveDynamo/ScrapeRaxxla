Time for a little tinfoil.

I've tried to analyse the clues from the Codex in a slightly new way. The idea is that the Dark Wheel toast, is in Dark Wheel lingo and has to bee seen from their traditional perspective. Therefore I decided to build a hypothesis on the idea that 'Mother of Galaxies' is Galaxy 1, from the original Elite.

What we have left of Galaxy 1, is the Lave cluster. This region is the biggest known anomaly in the galaxy. A bunch of systems are aligned in the galactic plane at Y = 48.75. The region also has an odd amount of planets with exactly one earth mass.

I started checking with assumption that anything on the brow, should also be on Y = 48.75 or close. I therefore plotted lines like the Reorte - Riedquat line, to see what came up.
I chose Riedquat as my local 'Omphalos', just to have a starting point.

Projected in the Y = 48.75 plane, I got this.

The Sifi EP-T b3-3 is only a reference system at exactly Y = 48.75.

I then moved to Princess Astrophel and the spiraling stars. Assuming it means Vega and the stars in the Milky Way band. My Milky Way band is set to Y = 48.75.

I also added a black line. This is the mystery line. If I have managed to plot correctly, this is the intersecting line between the Y = 48.75 plane and the Right ascension = 20h plane. I know this looks weird, but it's an attempt to fit the name as well in to the equation.

Raxxla -> Ra = Right ascension, xx = 20, la = Lave or Lave altitude/ascension or 50(L=50) altitude/ascension.

Interesting observations:

Hope you find something interesting here. Perhaps @ could make a prettier plot?
