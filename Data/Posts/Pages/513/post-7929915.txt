@PeteACarter - I did not say protecting humanity was evil. Nor do I believe Aegis is good. A rock and a hard place. That is where humanity is right now. I am now in the Pleiades Sector investigating what is going on. It does not look good for Aegis so I stand corrected.

I did encounter a Thargoid attacking a freighter. Spectacular stuff but I did not engage. But, I don't think the Human and Thargoid race will be making up and riding into the sunset very soon, if ever.

My work with Aegis is done so I will be moving on to the next major corporation that may have dealing ( or infiltrated ) by the real Dark Wheel. However, there is a lot of interesting things to explore around here as long as the Thargoids do not notice me.
