Interesting. The message says:

The clues took pilots to "Persephone in the Avalon System". One problem.

Persephone is in the Sol system and not in the Avalon system.

Persephone is a system, a station (in Avalon) and a planet in Sol. The system and station have been in the game since release. Persephone was only added to Sol much later - around 2.3, I think, and long after the treasure hunt.
