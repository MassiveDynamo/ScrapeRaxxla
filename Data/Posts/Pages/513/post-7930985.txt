Im currently in the Algol system and found this eerie USS.
This Cetus' Bane, his ship, the 5 canisters (earth relics) and the signal are the same everytime I do a reboot, the only thing that changes is Cetus Bane's faction and ship name.
The ship names and factions that i get so far are:
Radical Cross / Spiritual Order Of HR 7729
Agent / Oshata Commodities
Joy / Nzamnet Natural Interestelar
Duc De Dantzig / Graung Universal Inc
Twenty One Friends (this one was funny) / Partnership Of Zemez




is this tinfoil? or the USS was for that treasure hunt event and FD forgot to remove it?
