I guess I saw it as different in that Waldens were done in a "traditional" way presumably the clones were brought to term in an incubator and then "born" and grew up normally. I assumed that the cloning of Kahina/Salome was done after the Prisim incident... (so the clone would have been some sort of quick grown to the right age thing) - why would the Lorens have made clones of her as a kid ? But putting a pin in that for the moment. If Kahina was a clone as well as Salome ... It makes more sense now why Octavia Quinton wanted her body specifically. Octavia had to have been an older version of the same clone... It also begs the question ... Was Kahina/Salome/Octavia made by Walden?
And is there a backup Salome clone 'on ice' / being grown or growing up somewhere?
