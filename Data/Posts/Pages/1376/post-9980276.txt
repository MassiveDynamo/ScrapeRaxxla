P.S. Since this is the place for undocumented rumours and hearsay, I have one.
There may exists a VIP passenger mission with a passenger that claims to have a pretty solid lead on the location of Raxxla.

They say that captains running passenger missions continue to go missing… often after picking up a mysterious lady who looks alot like that actress Consuela Knight…
