Augustus Brenquith…. Very good! So the artefact found in orbit around jupiter becomes his logs…. With his glittering legacy… He is very similar to the character of Saramandara from the Alien World. The guy who finds the Oiser-Raxxla homeworld….
I believe one of the beacons in Ackwada openly stated he sent info back to Sol setting off waves of colonization but it is possible I am remembering part of the First Encounters journals.
