Little more info please; sounds interesting?

I don’t think this thread ought to be a resource for ‘undocumented’ rumours, more of a repository of imaginative lateral thinking, or quantum leaps in logic, at least based upon some factual information seed….

It's not that mysterious. I had a game crash and the text was in the Windows crash dump file.
Not sure if I'm supposed to look there. It feels a little like hacking.

I was in 30 Comae Berenices at the time of the crash, but I doubt that had anything to do with it.
