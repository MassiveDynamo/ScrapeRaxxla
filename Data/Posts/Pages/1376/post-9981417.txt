Augustus Brenquith…. Very good! So the artefact found in orbit around jupiter becomes his logs…. With his glittering legacy… He is very similar to the character of Saramandara from the Alien World. The guy who finds the Oiser-Raxxla homeworld….
If memory serves me correctly, we are looking for a particular star cluster in connection with the Talmor Lens. This, of course, presumes we have hyperspace/Witchspace access precisely because we figured out the construction defect at Sol. Tour of the Universe uses Witch Space and Witchspace in alternating fashion. There is also a gateway found somewhere around 2280. There is a map in the center of the book of the Galactic Cooperative centered on Sol.
