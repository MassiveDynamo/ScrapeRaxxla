â€¦.I've got your suit for the Wedding Barge, what size is Cora for the bridesmaid dress?
Cora? XXL at the moment....

and all we got is ra XXL a ? (would capitalise but its late at night here and don't want to wake the neighbours)

On that note Ive wondered whether princessastropholeandthespirallingstars is whats meant to be read between. Have looked for Leand & Hespa but to no avail, theres Cessa, Essas, Sastro, Pholean, Thesp (one for Discworld fans) and probably many more.

Along this thought line i galmap searched prin and came to a system Princeps. Its seemingly an unremarkable system for the most part. Google tells me...

-Princeps is a Latin word meaning "first in time or order; the first, foremost, chief, the most eminent, distinguished, or noble; the first man, first person". As a title, "princeps" originated in the Roman Republic wherein the leading member of the Senate was designated princeps senatus.-

A few phrases there seemed relevant, however i suppose i could be making them seem that way for my own benefit.

'first in time or order' -- the legend of raxxla seems to predate the games timeline.

'the most eminent' --the definition of eminent reads as...
Definition of eminent

1: exhibiting eminence especially in standing above others in some quality or position : PROMINENT
2: standing out so as to be readily perceived or noted : CONSPICUOUS
3: jutting out : PROJECTING

The 2nd definition 'stands out' to me in this particular reference as we are inevitably supposed to find raxxla or it wouldnt be included.
