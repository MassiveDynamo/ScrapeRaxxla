Google gave me another semi-idea ...also showed 340 page or so from this topic..

..."Princess Astrophil and spiral stars" tip in codex.... another guy on reddit mentioned, and wiki confirms - Wolf Rayet stars can form spirals if have companion star in system...
...also I was always wondered why map has special checkbox for WR stars.
...so right now something floats in my mind - like ...visit WR stars which has extra stars in system...
