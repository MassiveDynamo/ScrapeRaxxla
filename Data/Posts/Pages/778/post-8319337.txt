Holdon ...aren't those somehing like magellan clouds ? I mean ..Milky Way has couple satellite galaxies around 100 000 ly away each. ...and those on images seems like magellan clouds (though never seen it, as it is southern hemisphere)

If you want more tinfoil .. I was in Lave system today, read beacons. 1 of them says initial alien met had symbols which looked liked "THAR" so they were named "Thargoids".
Sooo "RAXXLA" has AR as well. Can it be their language?

P.S. They sell 24 brandies in 1 hands now! Twice more to have in fridge!
