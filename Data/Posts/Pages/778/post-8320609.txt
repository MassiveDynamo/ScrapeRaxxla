What about ARx?
Nah ... I mean ... THAR symbols could mean something in alien language, for example ship number like 1234
And then ...if RAXXLA is written using alien alphabet then we could decode something. For example it can be exact coordinates written using alien numbers.
But to get something from that idea - need research of hundreds of alien ships ... Maybe just nothing related here.
So only we know now aliens have symbols "A" and "R" in their alphabet. No meaning for it though.
Or maybe those symbols are somehow related to older "unknown artifact" puzzle.
