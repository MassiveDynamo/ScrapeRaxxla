you mean its based on a partially intercepted communication?

â€¦.I've got your suit for the Wedding Barge, what size is Cora for the bridesmaid dress?
Cora? XXL at the moment....

and all we got is ra XXL a ? (would capitalise but its late at night here and don't want to wake the neighbours)

On that note Ive wondered whether princessastropholeandthespirallingstars is whats meant to be read between. Have looked for Leand & Hespa but to no avail, theres Cessa, Essas, Sastro, Pholean, Thesp (one for Discworld fans) and probably many more.
