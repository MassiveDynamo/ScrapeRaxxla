Nah ... I mean ... THAR symbols could mean something in alien language, for example ship number like 1234
And then ...if RAXXLA is written using alien alphabet then we could decode something. For example it can be exact coordinates written using alien numbers.
But to get something from that idea - need research of hundreds of alien ships ... Maybe just nothing related here.
So only we know now aliens have symbols "A" and "R" in their alphabet. No meaning for it though.
Or maybe those symbols are somehow related to older "unknown artifact" puzzle.
Well... before we all get too carried away.

The tourist beacon also points out that others who saw the same photo said there wasn’t any writing there whatsoever and that those who saw letters were just ascribing meaning to random patterns, marks and scratches.

The key point really is that ‘Thargoids’ isn’t the aliens name for themselves, it’s just a nickname given by humans. (Same with the Guardians as well.)

There’s no signs reported so far of the Thargoids having any writing that matches of our alphabet. The only clear markings with meaning spotted so far are the ones above the ‘cockpit’ on the Interceptors.

Here’s the thread investigating the Thargoid logograms: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...of-thargoid-ship-logograms-compendium.379844/

Not sure if there’s been any additions to the research elsewhere since.

The Guardians have two forms of writing, which can be seen at their sites. The more obvious one is composed of patterns of triangles, prime examples being on the displays on the obelisks, ones which appear to have been vandalised onto the bases of the relic towers, and ones that are on the object in the inside of the ancient relics.

Having said all that, I’m not sure if anyone’s tried to take a detailed look at the hills of the Thargoid scouts for markings. Might be worth a look!
