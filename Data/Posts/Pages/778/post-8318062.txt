That might bring blessed relief...

I've been checking systems that have Allegiance, but no population. There are many that are just prisons or other sensible things. But there are a short list of Fed systems that have no reason to be like this. I checked them out - none of them are actually very interesting, but there are some that have inconsistent data between what the Galaxy Map says and what the System map says.

LTT 15493
HIP 15310
So this is likely just a bug (I have reported it if you want to give it a poke)


In addition there are these that are correctly consistent - i.e. they have allegiance but no people to pledge allegiance...

which is a little odd. A couple are lore sysytems, but several have just stars in.


Finally there is AY Indi (which has population btw) - the only system with Pilot's Federation allegiance that isn't a starter system (apart from Shindez) - anyone know if this was once a start system in beta or something? Nothing interesting there though...

Now what was the question? Six x Nine..??

Tridecimal (Base 13) â€“ probably most famous for being the counting system in which six times nine actually does equal forty two.

Counted as: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 1A, 1B, 1C, 20, 21, etc

Mathematically in base thirteen: 6 * 9 = 42
