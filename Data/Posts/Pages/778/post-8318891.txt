Hi Macros,

I was re-reading the FP entries (again, ... again) and noted Tau Ceti system(s) which confused me for a second, so I checked up the Game Codex, and noted it was 'system'. So I thought I better re-scan the text and get anything else I noticed fixed in case it is actually important.

Hope you don't mind adjusting the following for accuracy?

Things to fix in the Raxxla 'Spolier' entry in the FP.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The earliest recorded mention of Raxxla dates from 2296, from the journal of Art Tornqvist,
a shipboard mechanic based in the Tau Ceti systems.
replace ' with '.

She claims she's found a map to some
pirate stash, and all I have to do is load her my ship so we can go dig it up.
replace '' with ''.

Meybe we should go find Raxxla while we're at it!
replace '' with ''

The earliest document stories tend to agree on several points, however: that Raxxla is a
definite place and that it holds a mystical secret.
replace '' with ''

that Raxxla is a definite place and that it holds a mystical secret.
add comma ... definite place and that ...

Commentators have compared this sensation to 'fernweh' the unaccountable longing for a place one has never seen.
change period to comma ... to 'fernweh' the unnacountable ...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've never met them, but I know they're there.
lose the extra o in there.

Those who believe in the existence of the Dark Wheel consider it to be a continuous and
clandestine organisation operating since the very earliest days of interstellar travel.
add a comma, ... organisation operating since ...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interstingly I also noted in the Codex that it's
- Felicy Farseer,
and not what I would have expected FDev to write in the Codex
- Felicy Farseer,

Not sure it means anything particularly, but just struck me as odd since we all know her as an Engineer (for FSD's). I might need to re-visit and see if there is any other odd text when at her base.

Keep up the awesome work maintaining the thread.

FP updated, much appreciated.

Felicy's bio in the Codex/Engineers does say "Felicity Farseer is a legendary explorer, who engineered her own improvements to her Asp Explorer..."
I like her comment on Macros Black: “I admire your talent for searching for knowledge out in the void, Commander Macros Black. You're a true explorer.„
Now that today's logbook work is done, those Coalition of Ngalung Civilians are not going to massacre themselves...
