That might bring blessed relief...

I've been checking systems that have Allegiance, but no population. There are many that are just prisons or other sensible things. But there are a short list of Fed systems that have no reason to be like this. I checked them out - none of them are actually very interesting, but there are some that have inconsistent data between what the Galaxy Map says and what the System map says.

LTT 15493
HIP 15310
LTT 11159
NLTT 8065
BD+03 3861
Jackson's Lighthouse
V463 Carinae
LHS 412
LTT 10787
LTT 2952
BD+10 1684
Andbephi
LTT 12106
LTT 3013
Lanaest
Placet
MCC 515
NLTT 18977

So this is likely just a bug (I have reported it if you want to give it a poke)

In addition there are these that are correctly consistent - i.e. they have allegiance but no people to pledge allegiance...

HIP 107457
Pegasi Sector JW-W c1-21
LP 413-18
Ferez
B Carinae
LTT 3075
LTT 3010
NLTT 19088
LP 366-45
LP 123-75

which is a little odd. A couple are lore sysytems, but several have just stars in.

Finally there is AY Indi (which has population btw) - the only system with Pilot's Federation allegiance that isn't a starter system (apart from Shindez) - anyone know if this was once a start system in beta or something? Nothing interesting there though...

Now what was the question? Six x Nine..??
