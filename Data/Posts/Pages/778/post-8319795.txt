Has anyone else noticed that two of the engineers, both with noteworthy surnames have the same neck tattoo?

I'm sure I saw the same one recently when I unlocked the permit for van Maanen's Star, and it was on the Sublime Order of van Maanen's Star contact. Although they also had the weird four leaf clover tattoo that criminal masterminds seem to have as well.

Not sure how this relates to anything as yet, but might be a tiny bit obvious too.

SPOILER: TATTOO'S - JAMESON & RYDER








I haven't yet unlocked Lori, so I don't know if she's also has allegiance to the Empire?
