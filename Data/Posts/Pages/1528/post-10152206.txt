Ya I still think the "Guardians" are named so because they are similar to the Guardians of Platos "Republic". The society has a generic similarity, and if we assume that Guardians are related in some way to Raxxla then the fixiation on Utopias and things like the Axis Mundi have meaning... In general I am more inclined to think that Raxxla is either associated with some lost remaining bit of the Guardians, The Guardian AI, or the Guardian Homeworld... ya sounds like Im convincing myself I need to try mapping Guardian sites again....
