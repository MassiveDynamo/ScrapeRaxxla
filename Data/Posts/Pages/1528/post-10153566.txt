Sorry, no. I have no idea about anything related to the author you are discussing and I make it my business to have nothing to do with his work.
Could we at least ask your personal thoughts on the Engineers in general and some of the older mega-corporations. Martuuk and Farseer collaborate on the expedition mentioned in same system as Mitterand Hollow (believe this involved a series of GalNet entries). There is also Wreaken and its' Col 70 incident connection mentioned in GalNet and "..And Here the Wheel". Notably, events as described in "..And Here the Wheel" paint a much grimmer sequence of events with deaths in the thousands. Then we have Rockforth Corporation, with its' in-game advertisment with a Thargoid looking icon in the upper left (most commonly seen in concourses and settlements but occasionally stations on entry and inside). Just curious, if you think this implies a larger group associated to the Club?

The reason I ask is this: Farseer is directly quoted in The Dark Wheel codex entry. In other words, finding The Dark Wheel may be more important to Raxxla but also more dangerous than imagined.
