Well TDW are meant to be as old as space travel. The PF grew up later for sure, as described in the beacons for PF. CIEP was created for AHTW as a device to avoid making TDW part of the book making them a recent group. They are meant to be a splinter of TDW, led by Oberon Ryder who split with his brother Neptune - Neptune continuing to pursue Raxxla. They found Soontill and exploted the tech they found there. CIEP were playing at being good guys, cleaning up piracy etc., but like so often happens they ended up having to do 'bad' things to get humanity to notice the Thargoid threat. Good guys bad guys - its a bit more shades of grey in that book.
