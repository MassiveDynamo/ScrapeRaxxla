To be clear: I suspect The Club is real as is The Dark Wheel but deducing which side is which may be less clear. I suspect TDW, as hinted by Drew Wager and Holdstock, is basically a rebel arm of Pilot's Federation. Who found it is a better question. Circle of Independent Elite Pilots appears to be the same as Elite Pilots' Federation. If I had to guess, The Dark Wheel may have been honest that they didn't find Raxxla but perhaps The Club did. This would at least neatly explain the CIEPer connection to Soontill. I have some theories on why The Dark Wheel rebelled and most of them involve who founded The Pilot's Federation. Technically, I suspect that The Dark Wheel is far, far older. Maybe some of them find something, get greedy, and form a splinter group that becomes The Pilot's Federation.
