While I agree that caution is advised, when I was a member Children of Raxxla it appears that these CMDR written pieces were central to multiple key story arcs:
Antares/Starship One
Jaques jump saga
Salom√© saga
Cerberus Plague (and it's connection to Sohalia and Sohalian Fever)
Probably several others I am forgetting
I am at the point where player contributions to the lore are often more important than the official version. Notable that a number of authors including Allen Stroud, Drew Wager, Robert Holdstock, and likely others were themselves CMDRs. Elite Dangerous used the fan-lore to make the whole thing stick. Do not discount the fact you impacted the story because so did Robert Holdstock and he became Elite with the help of David Braben and Ian Bell. The story of Elite is that CMDRs can change things by their actions - never forget that.

Almost all the player submitted Galnet articles reflect real events, that happened in the game.
Only a few, very early articles were pure fantasy. I think they have been removed from the archive.

Player submitted Galnet articles can be considered lore, not fan fiction. Several of these articles have later been put on Tourist beacons.

I wrote this one for Canonn: https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/57c7fe999657badb5446a7f6

The same text can now be found on the TS, at Merope 5C.
