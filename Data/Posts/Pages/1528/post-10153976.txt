I find it interesting that there are 13 TB references to "some icy geysers are powerful enough to create rings, such as Saturn's E ring in the Sol system".
Perhaps a hint to look or Raxxla in Saturn's E ring? I have tried, but the RNG nature of this makes it uninteresting gameplay!
Another possibility, is whatever "Raxxla" is exists in multiple locations. There is a very interesting tourist beacon of similar nature in the Hecate system that I believe also mentioned jewels. Perhaps a connection to Alleged Toast of The Dark Wheel?

It is around Hecate 4. The system is beautiful and worth a visit.
