True, but what does FD consider ‘environmental storytelling’ which adds texture and a history to the game, and what can be established as ‘data’?

Data is raw information which through analysis can establish who, why, where, when and what, and inform upon intelligence which gives insight into the movements of individuals and can be used to monitor and project the actions of groups of people.

Personally, I feel FD could not hope to manage such a flood of raw data into their lore, and give it enough relevance to have a direct impact upon the game, mainly because it allows us carte blanche.

At most I suspect it was capitalised to add additional flavour to existing content but not identified by FD as having any true relevance, as data it might have some wider abstract context, but I don’t suspect we could ever establish exactly which player driven information FD deemed factual and not simply abstract background.

We have to thank for the vast majority of reliable information in game, that was directed and sanctioned by FD and essentially can be seen as trusted information. But we cannot IMOP just assume everything submitted by every ‘player’ is likewise wholly factual, not without some confirmation from FD.
Nothing in Galnet can really be established as data, unless it's verifiable in the game. It's just a news outlet. The articles are written by 'NPC journalists'. They make mistakes and have agendas.
This was very evident in FFE where the same events were described totally different, in the different papers. It's a bit more clouded in Galnet.

The same can be said for the tourist beacons. They were also written by someone with limited knowledge and an agenda.
