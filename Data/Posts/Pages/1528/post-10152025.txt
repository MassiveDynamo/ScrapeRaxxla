The cities of gold, along the lost sunken lands, within the underworld

Please find an update regarding my Underworld hypothesis, where I’ve focused upon clearly identifying a number of key systems named specifically after the regions of classical Greek Underworld; a series of systems named specifically after sunken kingdoms, the cities of gold and mythic kingdoms.

Note this list is not definitive and may alter upon any new discoveries.

It is my strong belief that the passage in the Codex “Much like the ancient myths of Atlantis (sunken kingdoms), El Dorado (Cities of gold) and the kingdom of Prester John (mythic kingdoms)” is a spacial clue identifying this exact location.

This hypothesis has been established by first identifying a number other correlations likewise centred upon this location.

The image below shows each relative system grouping colour coded. Lines have been drawn between each point to better identify each separate system group. A full list of systems is provided in the link above.


Green denotes the path of Persephone.
Gold denotes systems named after the cities of gold.
Blue denotes systems named after lost sunken kingdoms.
Yellow denotes systems named after mythic kingdoms.
Red denotes systems named after regions of the Greek underworld.
White denotes first systems discovered upto 2296.
Purple denotes Axis Mundi.

Note: there do exist several other systems named after ‘lost mythic lands’ within this area, but presently these have been omitted so as to focus on systems with a direct relationship to the descriptions in the Codex.

Based upon the above, it is my assessment that it is probable these systems do establish a collective focal point.
