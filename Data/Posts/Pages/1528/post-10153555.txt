I thought it was just Elvira Martuuk & Bill Turner.

P.S. I imagine Liz Ryder will be a supporter/member of TDW, and I think they’re supposed to be enemies of The Club, but don’t recollect what is the basis for that perception. Clearly Salomé was an enemy of The Club, as was (eventually) Rebecca, and by association Alyssia Fields (IIRC the name correctly) and Luko....though I suspect Luko (Luciano "Luko" Prestigio Giovanni) was actually “elder Giovanni” of CIEP (from Legacy).

P.P.S. I find it unlikely that two characters by two independent authors (in AHTW and Drew Wagar’s Reclamation & Premonition) are both named Giovanni. Whether that is actually based on background lore that we haven’t seen, whether it will be revealed at some point, or whether it is somehow meaningful in the TDW/Raxxla storyline I have absolutely no idea. I think it’s also interesting (and I suspect corroboration, but does it have deeper meaning??) that “Giovanni” is the Itallian version of “John”, and “Prester John” is named as part of the Codex Raxxla entry....”Prester” meaning “Presbyter” which means “elder”. In Latin “Prester John” was “Presbyter Ioannes”......

Edit
“Prestigio” in Italian means “Prestige”, the definition of which is “reputation or influence arising from success, achievement, rank, or other favorable attributes” I.E. reputation/influence of an “elder”.

:Allen, can you say if there is more to be discovered on this character? A CIEP elder helping out a TDW character seems likely to be a storyline expansion in waiting.
Sorry, no. I have no idea about anything related to the author you are discussing and I make it my business to have nothing to do with his work.
