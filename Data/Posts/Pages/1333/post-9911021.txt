Food for thought?
SPOILER: WHAT WAS LOST...










I think those missions were foreshadowing the Guardians and of course hinting at secret groups operating in the shadows. The description of the Sap8 containers sound very guardian like.
The first guardian ruin was found by data mining and the story didn't play out as intended. There may have been a role for the trinkets and Sap8s in ED's plans.
