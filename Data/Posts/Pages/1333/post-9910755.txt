Speaking on Secret Content.

Here's the thing about Proteus.
Proteus was a King and Sea-God on the island, Pharos, that neighbored Alexandria and its famed library in ancient Egypt.
At the time the lighthouse was considered a wonder of the world. If memory serves me right, at the time it was the first actual lighthouse.

Alexander the Great inherited Egypt, deemed Son of God/Amun-Ra/Zeus-Amon, by Amun-Ra himself.

Salvation wiped out the Alexandria.

I called this connection out three years ago, based on clues within Tau Ceti.
Alexander the Great was the key.
