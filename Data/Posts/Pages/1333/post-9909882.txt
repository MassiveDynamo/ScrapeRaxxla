Well, visited both Thor's Helmet Sector FB-X C1-5 and Seagull Sector DL-Y D3 (anarchy). Checked out the belt clusters in the former (nothing) & got some Trinkets in the latter.
@Pyroboros : Seagull Sector DL-Y D3 was interesting- it has one comet but tried several times & couldnt drop into the instance so always a couple of hundred metres away & it kept moving away from me (while being pestered by a pirate). There were also a couple of bodyids which crashed the game, even when bookmarked. And a few which I didnt check out, before Hell’s Port, which I think was bodyid 17. With only 3 stars, one planet and an asteroid station there’s something strange with this system! I’ll paste the spreadsheet in here later, when lunch has digested & I get back briefly to the PC before the afternoon heat arrives. Siesta time!...
had too much coffee to siesta... here's the sheet:

Edit: I would go back and check the other body search criteria for more comets, but with my hand/wrist problems I was having a painful time trying to avoid the pirates who were after my Trinkets, and I want to check out some bubble comets with those!
Has anyone checked for comets in Sirius?
