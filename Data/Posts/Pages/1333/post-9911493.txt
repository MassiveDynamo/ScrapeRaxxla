Im afraid you have your wires crossed - that tale is attached to the Guardian Sites - first discovered by reverse engineering the trailers. In game the Halsley story that was meant to lead to them rolled as if nothing had happened. I expect FD are a bit more careful these days with trailers.

It was still an impressive feat to find the site from those images..

You are correct that Stellar forge generates the system on the fly as it were. There is no database of the galaxy on your or FD's harddrive - its all procgen for normal systems, though there is some server side and client cache for 'Hand Authored' systems. FD do not keep the galaxy on the server - EDDB does, in as far as commanders submit their data, and the database is already well over 100GB for something of the order of 0.01% of the galaxy...
