You need a fast ship and boost with FA off for the shutdown... Damn Thargs appear quite quick anywhere in the system... Haven't tried the shutdown neutraliser as my bindings have been wiped and muscle memory is bad with my new hotas...

I had a Tharg interceptor almost keep up with me with continual boosting of 531... And the mass lock is a pain...
It was a player that pulled me out though, and on playstation.

No thargoids around, player came out from behind the planet and knocked me out of super cruise.
