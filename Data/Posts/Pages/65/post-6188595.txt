Something is definitely hauling the Castellan Belt Cluster 2 along at 1.36Mm/s. The belt cannot be locked and jumped into like other locations from the Nav Tab. I managed to get within 1Mm range and then emergency drop, but without a Safe disengage ready message. Whatever object is driving the belt is also ghost-like, i.e. no face planting emergencies happened.

Made it in. Nothing exciting to report Iâ€™m afraid.
