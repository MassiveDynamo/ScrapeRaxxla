Fair point...and nice find.

Maybe I'll head out there and poke around after this CG in Run is complete. I've been in the bubble too long anyhow.

When I'm looking for unexplored systems I use the EDDiscovery 'stars near me' list and compare it to the Nav Panel list, then visit systems that are only in my Nav Panel. It's not foolproof, since lots of people don't use EDDisco and it didn't always automatically log system locations, but it reduces the amount of 'wasted' time. Plus it helps update EDSM with system information which is definitely a good thing.
