Strictly speaking a sphere cannot have a rim. Rim definition from OED: “The upper or outer edge of an object, typically something circular or approximately circular”; from which the rim would be the circumference/edge of the orbital plane of the system (which would cut down on Han_Zen’s search area!) or galaxy. However OED also allows: “A limit or boundary, ‘the outer rim of the solar system’”, which IMHO is a confusing definition.

I'm not gonna search it. I just flew through or at least 1.6ly out. Things appear very normal out there. Quite a lot of signal sources.

This was the last one.

Four ships from Sol Workers Party that had destroyed a Clipper with Tantalum.
