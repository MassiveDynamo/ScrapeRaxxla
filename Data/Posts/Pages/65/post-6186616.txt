Ah....I had it in my head that it was a planetary nebula. That explains why it didn't show up as a system in EDSM. Derp.

So, what then? If it's like any of the other dozens of nebulae I've seen, they've all been bagged and tagged. If there was anything there, wouldn't it have been spotted?

There's still plenty of Red Dwarfs and the like that are untagged in the nebulae I've been to.
This is probably because they're mostly surrounded by snowballs, but on the way to Sag A* there's an M class star orbited by an ELW with my name on it.
