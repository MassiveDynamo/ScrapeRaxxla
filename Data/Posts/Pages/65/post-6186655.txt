There's still plenty of Red Dwarfs and the like that are untagged in the nebulae I've been to.
This is probably because they're mostly surrounded by snowballs, but on the way to Sag A* there's an M class star orbited by an ELW with my name on it.

Fair point...and nice find.

Maybe I'll head out there and poke around after this CG in Run is complete. I've been in the bubble too long anyhow.
