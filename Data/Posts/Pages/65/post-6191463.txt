Well..IMHO the "rim" of a sphere is a surface. But have fun anyway !

Strictly speaking a sphere cannot have a rim. Rim definition from OED: “The upper or outer edge of an object, typically something circular or approximately circular”; from which the rim would be the circumference/edge of the orbital plane of the system (which would cut down on Han_Zen’s search area!) or galaxy. However OED also allows: “A limit or boundary, ‘the outer rim of the solar system’”, which IMHO is a confusing definition.
