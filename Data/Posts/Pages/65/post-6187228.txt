Ah....I had it in my head that it was a planetary nebula. That explains why it didn't show up as a system in EDSM. Derp.

So, what then? If it's like any of the other dozens of nebulae I've seen, they've all been bagged and tagged. If there was anything there, wouldn't it have been spotted?

I for myself was joking about the Rim Nebula. I don't think it is related to the ..obfuscated in the outer rim.. clue. But, again, who knows ?

By the way...

Just to see 'the outer rim' of a system.

Nothing but Rescue One, so far.
