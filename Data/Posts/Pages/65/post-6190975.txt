Just one thing to add. “Obfuscated by the outer rim”... the outer of rim is r & m. So the location in question could be obfuscated by the letters r & m.

A search on all system names that contained letters r&m and then removing r&m to from the name lead to about 150 “new names”. Cross referencing them against EDSM system names yielded just one match and I’m not sure what it means if anything as I’ve confused myself a little and feel a lot like I am barking up the wrong tree.

The Brambai systems once r&m are removed leaves Babai which is an existing system name. I can’t see anything interesting on EDSM and am away from Elite so cannot go and have a look (also I’m about 17kylies away in game).

Dunno. My twopence worth. I like cryptic crosswords and wanted to stretch the legs on the idea. Longshot. Not sure I found anything useful to be honest.
