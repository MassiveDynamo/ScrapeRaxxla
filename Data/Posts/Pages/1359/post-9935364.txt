Anyone got a cheat sheet for a 1 minute "Where we're at now"? Seems like I am seeing a lot of references to stuff that I have no idea why they are being referred to.

We are in-game with 400 billion star systems. Possibly includes some rogue planets, definitely lots of comets which exist as point sources of mass but are not visually implemented. Something is in-game and it may be called Raxxla (or it may not).

There is an in-game Codex which may or may not be truthful, and purports to say something about Raxxla and an in-game faction called The Dark Wheel. The Dark Wheel: may, or may not, have a hidden space station; they may, or may not, exist; and may, or may not, be charlatans and liars. There also may, or may not, be a faction who are the Real Dark Wheel.

All we know about Raxxla (everything else is supposition!):

(MB) “It’s in the Milky Way” and “you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious so people know what they’re doing”
Q: founder's world name?...Shinrarta Dezhra... I'm a tiny little bit disappointed they didn't call it Raxxla - A: (MB) “Raxxla is something different”
(MB) “FD did look at a story involving Raxxla, but felt that was a story that should be played out in game rather than as a novel”
(MB) “It’s something in the game world (not text) and very hard to find”
(MB) “It’s not a random thing”
(MB) “Anyone can find it, and more than once”
(Allen Stroud) “it is a topic within the Alien lore book” that we have no insight into
(DB) “You don’t know what it is”

MB said by Ascorbius to have said at a closed Q&A at Lavecon “Raxxla system had been entered but Raxxla not found”

There are lots of hypotheses about Raxxla. Many have been tested and failed.

So pick/invent one and go look!
