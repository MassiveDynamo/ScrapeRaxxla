We know Soontill is in game but not as expected.

We know Tionsila also has a graveyard thats not findable....

Both have a connection with Raxxla and the Zurara.

Perhaps old fashion investogating might find a map of connections.

Like what about the pirate treasure that was harder to find the Raxxla.

As I'm on console my investigation is limited (no real time journal file) I am looking at the idea that follows a few before me.


Raxxla lile the beacons has a time it is findable (where as the beacon is a time the message repeats.) TDW (fake) may have some ligitimacy with regards to TDW (real) but there are a few otger factions with a much older history in game that only exist in one system amd havr not seemed to lose any... control but always a low influence faction.

I had a few tagged that I was looking at and will grap the list when I have a chance but I believe one was in Lawd 26.

Food for thought
