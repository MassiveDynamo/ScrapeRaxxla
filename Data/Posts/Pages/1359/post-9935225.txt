Ya i wasnt going for any deeper meaning … it just jogged loose a memory. But to be honest half the fun of this thread for me has been digging into things like Phillip Sidney (whom id never even heard of prior) or getting a better understanding of myths i read as a child in Bullfinch or Edith Hamilton… Its the reason I like this thread … someone will come along with something intriguing and we will all pull at it from our various perspectives…
Yup.
After the initial speculation about Astrophel I read Sidney...saw strong reference to Stella’s two black eyes (the iris colour, not domestic abuse!) and spent many hours searching for and diving into double Black Holes. That didnt get me anywhere either!

Edit: and this is part of the problem - there are few firm clues to follow for the Raxxla puzzle. FD have used so many references from all sorts of mythology and literature and science in system names/descriptions etc that anything (or nothing) could be significant. So I’m very sceptical about hypotheses inferring too much into mythologies.
