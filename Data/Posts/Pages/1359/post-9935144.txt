Yes (ha) how true, my point entirely.

There is a reference to a parallel prose edition, that I’ve noticed a few times, each to their own but that edition has some negative reviews, like many parallel interpretations, give me the original text any day I’ll happily read 17th century text, it can be rather fruity.

It’s interesting because our interpretations of one text will differ to that of another person’s. For instance I’d not read Milton nor Sidney since school, and my interpretation used to be somewhat different; but never until now had I appreciated them more through the context of sci-fi and astronomy, so already my perspective to those has altered after playing this game, getting me to re-read them with fresh perspective, how cool. Eyes to see.

They take on additional meaning. But I could just be reading into it (ha)….

Point being our perspectives could be flawed, or inflated. My theories are limited by my bias and experience, it’s good to look for checks and balances to try and think outside ones own box and try and see the subject from another’s perspective, as it may be focused upon a certain aspect you’d not considered.

This has also reminded me to grab this edition: Paradise Lost and the Cosmological Revolution.
