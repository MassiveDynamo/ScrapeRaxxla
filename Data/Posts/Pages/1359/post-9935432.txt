A thought : "burning jewel" could refer to a colour rather than something literally burning.
Thought about that reading about the Flame Nebula. It is Zeta Orionis (Alnitak, blue supergiant) that gives its colour (burning red) to the nebula gases, thanks to its intense ultraviolet emission, by ionizing them.
Now, it is only one example of colouring, could be another object. The burning jewel could be an illuminated formation of some sort (like gases).
For the "mother" part, I don't believe in BH. For me "mother" refers to something "to come", or to something that has potential to give birth.
BH have not this potential, they are deceased mothers, already banged away their potential when they collapsed.
The mother of ALL galaxies has to be cloud gases in my current and instable opinion, where stars are formed and for some of them later collapse into super massive BH ejecting in the process unfathomable quantity of materials.
