There's an image in that text which shows the relationship between the heavens/earth/chaos/hell by David Mason, is it based on something Milton drew or an interpretation of a description? It looks incredibly similar to the planting layouts in the stations. There's an image a few pages back.

I'm sure that connection has already been made though, and I've just missed it because I've not read everything in this thread.

Yes. Exactly. I am pleased you too have observed this independently. It most certainly is - in my humble opinion, the same design.
