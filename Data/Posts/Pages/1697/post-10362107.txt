Pondering the Raxxla logo and what it might mean...
Milton's Paradise Lost quotation used in the final MB Tours TB: "fast by hanging in a golden chain. This pendent world, in bigness as a star; Of smallest magnitude close by the moon". I suspect this is a clue that Raxxla is hidden in a planetary belt, & that ties in with my interpretation of Li Qing Jao's garden design. The left part showing the Paradise Lost cosmology, the middle should be the target system map and the right hand part should logically be the location within the system! ("Paradise" represented by the 6 trees). Looks like a planetary belt to me, probably orbiting a gas giant.

So what could the logo mean in this context, specifically the dotted hexagon? A planetary belt is full of asteroids, so perhaps a very valuable asteroid? "Lonsdaleite also called hexagonal diamond in reference to the crystal structure, is an allotrope of carbon with a hexagonal lattice". If that's the solution I would hope to see a cheque from FD for its full retail value!

Or perhaps an asteroid base full of Guardian tech? Or maybe the front projection of a Coriolis station?

I'm sure I've seen Coriolis and asteroid stations orbiting in belts around GG, but can't remember where & my Google fu is weak today (sleep still disturbed after copawlot's latest seizure, at 03:50 the other day). Can anyone remember any examples? I just want to check the orbital distance of a Coriolis or asteroid base around a gas giant...
