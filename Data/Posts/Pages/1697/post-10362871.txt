They did exit I flew past one myself. Couldn’t dock with them.

Early beta phases FD began using procedural generation to build such objects from a database of fixtures, there was a newsletter about it too and some artwork. Sadly this was the culmination, but didn’t expand behind this, I can’t recall if there was any back-tracking on this or not, I would not be surprised, it was a feature I was looking forward to at the time (diversity) but was sadly a little disappointed they were so rare; they may be in game but probably only in a very low percentage.
