That burial method has always read suspiciously similar to that of the in-game Trinkets of Hidden Fortune.

The Trinkets in game were linked as FD confirmed via a support request, linked to that story (dark wheel missions) but were at most a curiosity. What if the Trinkets have no real mechanical purpose, but are evidence of ‘environmental storytelling’?
Let me add another layer here. There appears that Far God has real Chapters in real places and one of them is quite interesting.

Chapter of Hikenk
Chapter of HIP 60016
Chapter of Isinor
Chapter of LHS 2165
Chapter of Vocovii
Chapter of Zamyruaymir

Additionally, the asteroid bases were originally known as Hermit Rocks/Hermit bases. Hermit and Hermitage are religious terms for places of solitude for religious disciples. Need I remind everyone that one of these is located in Lave where the "Lavian Phoenix Greeting Protocol" was located.

Lavian Phoenix Greeting Protocol

The old mercenaries preferred a silent hail when meeting in deep space . Approach dead ahead with gun ports open at ninety degrees to target. Stop at five hundred metres , rotate ninety to the left and wait for same response.

Once established, custom is Phoenix members help each other. Your new friend might fly your wing for a while, but they’ll be gone if something comes up.

No pilot violates the greeting. If they does, let it be know. The Lady of Fate don’t smile on traitors.

Also, I'll say it again (because I mentioned it previously): "the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies" is quite literal. There is no metaphor. Take it as is and find Lucy in the sky and DM me if you know where it is located.
