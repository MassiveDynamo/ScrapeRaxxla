The "why" of Raxxla not being found might very well imply a temporal component - much like the Roman umbilicus hosted a purported gate to the underworld, opened just thrice per year on dedicated holidays.

Also... if Satan was looking directly downwards to the Earth, he might've been on the north ecliptic pole, which is surrounded by the Draco constellation. By definition, It has a right ascension of 18h00m00s - perhaps we could search for what's around there?
In my search of Alliance systems I found two Draco systems and around sixteen Draconis; had a look in a few but couldn't see anything that matched the middle part of the garden design.
