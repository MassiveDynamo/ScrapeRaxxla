When flying in my Federal Corvette I don't pay much attention to my wanted status...
It's a nuisance when you're fighting in CZs in a system a few thousand ly from the bubble, get interdicted, and immediately flip your Corvette and annihilate what you thought was a pirate only to find it's a system security vessel from the opposing faction in the war that currently controls the system, and she runs a bit too hot to sneak past a scan at the slot in the system's only station, while the nearest factor is 2kly away
