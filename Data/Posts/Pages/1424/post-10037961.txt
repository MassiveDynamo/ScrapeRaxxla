Though y'all might find this useful. I've been looking at the other codex logos to gauge the level of symbolic complexity.

The Generation ships logo:

It's the shield from the front of gen ships, but in the centre is the symbol for Sol (cos they all came from Sol)

Notice how it's quite a lot fatter and the relationship between the central dot and the outline is fatter, compared to the very slim lines of the Raxxla logo's centre:


Consider too the other Codex logos, how simple they all are. Even the Dark Wheel logo is literally just a station with the PF wings on it, Colonia is a literal 'C' with the PF wings, Guardians are geometric triangles, Tharogids is the barnacle logo, etc. Nothing on there is complex at all, they're all pretty simple.

Obviously , but this is the latest in a very long line of things that leads me even further away from the idea that the centre of the Raxxla logo is a symbol for Sol or even 'solar system'. I'm leaning more towards the idea that it represents something else entirely and that the Raxxla logo is actually much simpler than we've been assuming.

Just thought I'd share my thoughts on this.

I created a little Fanon-theory awhile back, that im not saying its my official theory, just a fun little fan head-canon: That the Raxxla Logo denotes the unique shield shape of the Gen-ship, whose discovery by the predecessor members to the titular Dark Wheel (from which the group originally started their name) ultimately lead to the formation of the said Kliq within the Pilots Federation.
