Remember the story of Jasmina Halsey's vision? It appears that is actually legitimate. The "glow" only happens with systems with one or more blackholes and is visible even on GalMap for a good distance away. Blackholes also have crazy audio connected with them. This has now been validated as occurring elsewhere. Another notable example is TrA X-1. Interestingly, HIP 63835 appears to have been inhabited previously but only has a comms installation. System security is anarchy but there are automated defenses when you start trying to hack the installation with recon limpets.

Screenshot as proof (picture is much better than preview suggests):

Those of us who were there for DW2 and the construction of Explorers' Anchorage would have been able to tell you that you can clearly see where Sag A* is in the sky relative to the system that station's in, even without selecting it in the navpanel. It has that glow effect around it.
