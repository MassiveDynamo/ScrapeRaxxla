Honestly, this seems like datamining. Not that you would be likely to get anywhere with it considering The Church of the Path is in the system Shibboleth (an ancient Earth term for cultural passwords). This pretty much indicates you would have to know something important to understand properly what you are looking at. Shibboleths have long been used to protect secrets.
