Thargoid Probe secured and I did not even get wanted for doing it - it is also legal salvage. I picked it up from the Agri megaship in Delphi, which has five cargo bays, four of which are fairly close together so I kept scanning those. It took me a while to realise that I needed to subtarget using the left hand panel to use the hatch breakers rather than just selecting the cargo bay itself though.

I'm out of time today but I've made my way to Jotunheim ready to make my run tomorrow.
