I had a look at the Michael Brookes tattoo and it struck me this time that the 'gates of heaven' on the right has bright stars above and below it. I think that is a clue - but the image as a whole is the kind where you can look at it for years and then suddenly notice a small detail you have missed the whole time...
Another image of his, that he promoted on the Forum was of a commissioned shield. Form the most part innocuous, Micheal fighting a dragon with a big axe; but the top left shows a gate of heaven. Plus a crow with one eyeâ€¦.
