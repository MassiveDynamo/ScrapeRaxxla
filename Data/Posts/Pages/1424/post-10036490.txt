Update on Milton Conundrum.

Thanks in part to various insight and creativity in this thread I think I have a potential interpretation of the Raxxla logo, again nothing that hasn’t been proposed before singularly, but this is just an attempt to collate it. Granted the ideas here are assumptions, and by no means definitive.



The use of a dashed line in the logo, I propose might mean either something hidden or something behind or below another object, I’m proposing, two locations separated by distance?

I assume this may relate to the Hates of Hell (lower hexagon) and the Gate of Heaven (above).

There is an obscure reference to a Miltonic Hive, eg bees in Paradise Lost, which might explain the hexagonal reference; or its simply aesthetic, or it’s reflecting the shape of the 6 pointed element at the centre of the logo?

The 6 pointed element, Im assuming might represent the world tree Yggdrasil, 3 branches above, 3 roots below, with the Omphalos at its centre or base?

The circle with a dot is potentially the symbol for an Omphalos and then 3 faces of the fates or Morrigan; yourh, maturity and old age.

This all together could I suspect describe visually, a John Milton Primum Mobile, but I acknowledge this may just be projection on my part and therefore bias.

In this context it wouldn’t describe a location, but it gives markers to establish a ‘cosmological model’ where it might be!
