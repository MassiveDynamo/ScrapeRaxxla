Been pondering the generation ships hypothesis and checked mythology and other references for each plus wiki description.

Summary:
SPOILER: GENERATION SHIP PRECIS










































































































I think we can safely ignore the Golconda, it is too recent to be relevant, but a couple of themes strike me:

: Spear of Hope (Technician Farrow is homeless), Lazarus, Phanes (possibly), Phobos, Pleione (link to Odysseus via Calypso), Odysseus

Artemis, Lycaon

: Lazarus, Atlas

: Thetis
