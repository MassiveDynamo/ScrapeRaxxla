Remember the story of Jasmina Halsey's vision? It appears that is actually legitimate. The "glow" only happens with systems with one or more blackholes and is visible even on GalMap for a good distance away. Blackholes also have crazy audio connected with them. This has now been validated as occurring elsewhere. Another notable example is TrA X-1. Interestingly, HIP 63835 appears to have been inhabited previously but only has a comms installation. System security is anarchy but there are automated defenses when you start trying to hack the installation with recon limpets.

Screenshot as proof (picture is much better than preview suggests):
