Does this get you wanted? I thought using hatch breakers was a crime. I checked the Gordon Class Bulk Hauler around Delphi 1 and it has a cargo bay as well, so I can try more than one megaship if I can stay clean whilst doing it.

I'll try to find a Thargoid Probe again tomorrow and run with whatever I have on Saturday, when it is easier to put in an extended session anyway.

Really liking the ideas linking the Raxxla symbol with Norse myth and John Milton. This seems like a good line to keep tugging on!

I had a look at the Michael Brookes tattoo and it struck me this time that the 'gates of heaven' on the right has bright stars above and below it. I think that is a clue - but the image as a whole is the kind where you can look at it for years and then suddenly notice a small detail you have missed the whole time...
