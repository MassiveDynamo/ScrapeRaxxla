Thanks for jogging my memory, I recall that too now…agree yes that’s how I interpreted it too.

I understood he stood upon the first step of the staircase to heavens gate and looked backdown and saw the entire universe below, as his vantage enabled him to see as far between Libra and Aries...

It’s an area of investigation I’ve considered previously, I think it’s highly relevant but not entirely sure how.

Theres a bone of contention where the globe may have hung. Satan was instructed it was ’not Too far off’ from where he first fell, which was from the North wall. Where-as other interpretations imply its elsewhere because it was linked to heavens gate via the stairs, which fell on East wall.

Satan is noted also to have travelled at an oblique angle once , passing through Ophiuchus.

Note in game if you draw a line of sight between Fall and Pandemonium (or any of the Greek Underworld systems) it does intersect Ophiuchus!

Below is a very old map of and I drew in context to Pandemonium (at the bottom centre) it would seem relative, but the point of view could still be anywhere far above it - but logically not any further than the system Fall?

Interesting.

Aries and Andromeda is the same direction, so there is at least some consistency.

I also a bit intrigued that the devil so clearly enters 'our realm' via the Sun:
"There lands the Fiend (the devil), a spot like which perhaps
Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe
Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw"

I'm starting to wonder about that asteroid field without clusters, in the middle of the Sun again.
