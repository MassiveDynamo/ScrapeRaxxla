I think the Epic of Gilgamesh may be somehow linked, especially the concept for travelling to the cedar forest, which was also a mountain, and could only be accessed via a secret passage guarded by Scorpions, it led to a paradise type Otherworld too…

There area we all seem to be focusing upon has a number of systems named after mysterious lands!, much like the lost realms…
It's a classical epic poem with a long journey at the center of the plot, much like Paradise Lost, the Odyssey or the Aeneid.

...a journey everyone has to travel by themselves?

The memorial tour points to Milton; I still believe the Codex points to Virgil (with perhaps some Homer thrown into the mix); what if these allusions are not in conflict, but were all borrowed by Brookes for the construction of his own epic?
