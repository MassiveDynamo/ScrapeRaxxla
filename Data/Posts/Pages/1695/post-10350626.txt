It is Oltiqu. Ol' Curie station (reference to Marie Curie) is presently named New Chernobyl. The planet Hope is the first body in the system. Overall, it's a beautiful system. One of the stations is in the system - Wicca Town. The planet Wicca's World orbits Alioth 5. Wicca Ware Race was from Ol' Curie to Alioth.
