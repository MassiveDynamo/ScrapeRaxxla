Many of the systems I’ve so-far found myself with a link to some mythical land. Either appear (to my knowledge) in the area that could be associated with the Underworld, denoted around Axis Mudi as I outlined with my Lost Realms theory.

Which I believe is what the Codex directly relates to.

But there also seems to be a smaller zone higher up around Sheela na gig, which I feel is in the Empyrean or heavens zone… these all are close to my hypothetical outer rim of the Chaos zone (denoted by wind/storm god names).

To my eye there seems to be some kind of mirroring in there placements ‘as above / so below’ … unless this is all just pattern bias.

It’s interesting, and I’m still mapping these…

Those system I’m seeing in the upper region on their own are innocuous, but all so far might be attributable to living within a mythical island or paradise?

I suspect I am probably over thinking it to be honest.

Jotnar - land of giants.
Albina - exiled to a mysterious uninhabited island.
Aeolus - lives on an island paradise

Rough image below for context…
