I think the Epic of Gilgamesh may be somehow linked, especially the concept for travelling to the cedar forest, which was also a mountain, and could only be accessed via a secret passage guarded by Scorpions, it led to a paradise type Otherworld too…

The general area we all seem to be focusing upon has a number of systems named after mysterious lands!, much like the lost realms…
