Is it just me or does this sound like it lines up nicely with what we know of the Guardians?

Life is believed to have emerged on Hope some time after the star became a red giant. Research on the planet reveals it was far too hot when the star was on its main sequence. Life forms are quite different to the ones that gave way to human evolution, having evolved under a quite different spectrum. Hope is still a hot planet by human standards - the equatorial regions regularly attain daytime temperatures in excess of 60 deg. Celcius, which is intolerable to human life. The humidity is also exceptionally high planetwide, usually exceeding 80% r.h.
