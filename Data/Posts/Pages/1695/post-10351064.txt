There very likely is some common theme which acts as inspiration. I wonder however, that it might not be so very deep, as eventually everything becomes inter-connected.

I suspect whatever theme it is, maybe its more inspired by the works of Robert Holdstock, I think that might be the primary basis; m Milton too obviously and some where Lovecraft.

It’s been mentioned vaguely by Allen Stroud that DB possibly was not as interested in Holdstock than was MB, and likewise evidently from his academic writings so too was AS, who also mentioned how much MB particularly loved Lovecraft and how there were similarities.

DB had mentioned a few times how he was interested in Roman history; that’s evident I suspect in the implementation of Power Play, which I suspect was his pet-project given that he described it as being based upon Roman military politics.

Overall I get the impression Raxxla was probably more a MB thing, and therefore has more a Holdstock origin theme, as it was his original concept, developed well before the first game…and never appeared in any game thereafter.

I don’t discount a Roman influence, evidently, it like other pantheons has been used to name certain systems so likewise, placed intentionally, so I accept it will have relevance and likely equal meaning alongside all the others.

But the Roman influence as a primary source over others… I’m doubtful.
