Was trying to find a Lagrange point yesterday, but the primary/secondary distances disagreed a little with the online Lagrange point calculator I used. Could be an error in ED or, more likely, in my understanding. When you face a planet and target it you get the distance shown-is that to the centre of the body or the surface?
edit
ah, it shows the distance to the centre of the body!!
