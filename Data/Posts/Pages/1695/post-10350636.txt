Oltiqu/Gateway:
- wasn't in Elite 1 ("OL" isn't a valid digram in an Elite 1 system name, though as "TI" and "QU" are, it does sound similar to a lot of the Elite 1 names; "Sotiqu" did exist, for example)
- was in FE2 as the largely unremarkable "Oltiqu"
- was in FFE as the renamed "Gateway" Alliance system (which was used as the player starting system)
