I have been to Delphi 5a recently. Did a full surface scan and made a short stop for a little detour with my SRV. Found zip.

...what of course I did NOT do was give the orbit of Delphi 5a a thorough search for a veiled station. Guess I‘ll return to Delphi soon.

Besides someone had the idea Raxxla might be hidden in some kind of Hyperdrive cocoon und suggeste firing a FSD Disruptor at the black hole in Delphi(?). The idea is so daft and full of tinfoil I simply have to give it a try.

Sidenotes:

A) If I understand the Codex correctly TRDW is a truly old organisation. If they were already around in 2296 there base might have been/ might still be quite close to Sol. I will give this a try by first visiting the uninhabited then the inhabited systems within 11 ly around Sol.

B) Concerning „we had to make it a bit obvious“: The Pleiades are the major staging ground for Tharg attacks. Maybe they themaelves are searching for Raxxla there. Another reason to return to Delphi...
