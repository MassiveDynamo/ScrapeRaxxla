Well..

I've got a fellow player, who works on the Canonn R&D team, potentially making a tool to show a list of systems within a set number of ly that fits the parameters of a Gas Giant with 8 moons (Based off of EDSM data of course). He's a busy guy and may not get around to it straight away. But would definitely be a useful if we believe the station is in game.


Tell him that he needs to start over. It states that it orbits the 8th moon. If true, this only invalidates Gas Giants with 7 or less moons. This does NOT invalidate ones with MORE than 8 moons.

Also, for those that continue to say things like (Quote is from reddit) "If Canonn hasn't found it yet, it doesn't exist"... We have yet to explore even a SINGLE percent of the galaxy. Last post I saw (10 months ago, FDev's Twitter) states that 118 million stars have been visited, accounting for 0.028% of the galaxy. That leaves more than 99.9% of the galaxy left to explore.

To put it in easier terms to understand, that's like saying "Honey, I searched my whole mouse pad for my car keys, but can't find them!!" And having your Honey reply "Did you look anywhere else? Like your desk? Or the Floor? Or the counter by the door?".
