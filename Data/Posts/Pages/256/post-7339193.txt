Judging by that picture - it's most likely F-class star. might be A-class, but not so sure.
But there's no picture of a gas giant, so no way to understand which class we are talking about.
Still the moon looks landable, so that's another thing to consider.

Jorki means the opening video rather than the menu screen. The menu screen doesn't have anywhere near enough in it to pin down. The video, however, has Barnards Loop and Witchhead Nebula. The star we've been looking for is the yellow one in between the horns on the elite logo.
