Hi guys
Off tomorrow on DW2, so my Raxxla Questing will be on hold for a few months, but young Tyko Rasalas (he’s actually a clone, younger and with more hair) may well continue the quest after he’s got his new AspX engineered.

IFF the start screen video is a clue (& I still suspect it is, since it’s the only thing that’s “a little bit obvious”) then it’s more complex than I originally thought. It’s definitely a composite of different viewing angles, and object distances. I followed the star patterns but couldn’t find the three around the Griffin head that seem to indicate something special......

Judging by that picture - it's most likely F-class star. might be A-class, but not so sure.
But there's no picture of a gas giant, so no way to understand which class we are talking about.
Still the moon looks landable, so that's another thing to consider.
