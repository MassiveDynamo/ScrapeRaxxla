Van Maanen's Star has one of the best established back stories within the Elite universe. The short story On The Wrong Side Of The Law by David Massey (included in Stories of Life on the Frontier from Frontier: Elite II) chronicles Captain Jupiter's encounter with the Guardians of the Free Spirit when his ship experienced an Inadvertent Precipitation from Hyperspace (IPH) and he ended up at van Maanen's while carrying cargo considered to be contraband by the Guardians.

Captain Jupiter got a good look on his view screen at a few members of the Guardians of the Free Spirit and there didn't appear to be anything to set them apart from ordinary members of the human race. He was, however, required to remain aboard his ship and conduct all business through indirect communications channels so there's no telling what might be hiding down there on the surface of Major.

Poor Jupiter. He just wanted some coffee.
