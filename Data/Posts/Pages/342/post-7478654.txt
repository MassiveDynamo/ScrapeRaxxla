Some musings.

If Raxxla has been in game since release, or prior, and it is in or near the bubble as many suspect then it is very likely some one has passed through and even mapped the system.

Raxxla is a ghost planet but what does that mean? Will it not show up on scanners? Is it only visible at certain times? Does it show up but with a name other than Raxxla? Are there some other tricks involved?

Here is an idea. It appears in every way to be a planet but it is really not even there. It is a portal or door.

When Elite came out we couldn't land on planets because they had a body exclusion zone which was and is FDev's tool to keep us out of planets. But what if there was never a BEZ around Raxxla? We would all see it as a planet (probably with a random name) as we passed by. Who actually flies close enough to see the BEZ? In a situation like this we could approach it and enter, pre-horizons, but instead of getting dropped out of super cruise we go through the "door." The game mechanic could have worked from the beginning.

I remember accidentally hitting the BEZ of the black hole in or near Maia before there was anything else there. Things got really weird. It looked like I was watching myself travel in a different direction. My only concern was that I had just flown 500 LY and destroyed my Asp.

This doesn't solve the "Personal story." I like the idea above about the engineers. That is about as personal as Elite gets. Every one can take their own path but to what end?

Has anyone ever been contacted by an engineer outside of the scripted invitation? Maybe they are there for vetting us and after we reach a certain point we are given a little info. They weren't in game at release but I assume they were always planned. Perhaps we could find Raxxla on our own. Maybe they can help.
