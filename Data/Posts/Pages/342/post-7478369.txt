But this is interesting information about the systems in game from the original only being ones in the story the dark wheel.
Actually not all of the systems are there. Cirag does not exist, Tionisla is missing the Graveyard and Teorge is nothing like mentioned in TDW novella.
There are a few permit locked Worlds and 1 permit locked system (Isinor IIRC) in the systems that remain from Elite '84.

I have a feeling that TDW in the Novella is prior to the information from the Codex. TDW Novella has The Dark Wheel as a group of pilots but never mentions that they have a base, in fact the only thing close to a base is Rafe's Anaconda.
I have a feeling that this is why we have the information in the Codex about The Dark Wheel having taken over an older Toroid station, which then Harks back to Frontier: Elite 2 and First Encounters which pretty much share the same timeline within a few years. Those games were the first to feature the true toroid shape stations that look like the one from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Over time designs changed and they became the stations we see today as Orbis and Ocellus types.

This would go someway to addressing the existence of all 3 prior games as elements in the history of Raxxla and TDW would have been spread over them.
This would also increase our search to a lot more systems than the 35 from Elite '84 to more like 200 from the entire trilogy.
