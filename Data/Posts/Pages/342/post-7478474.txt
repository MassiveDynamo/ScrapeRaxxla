The Codex doesn't contain official FD statements, it contains official PF statements.

Huh?

Codex is there to let us find TDW and Raxxla, not to hold us back. There weren’t any valid clues before. It was all speculations on non-cannon lore.

I agree with Thatchinho. We have no statement from anyone at FD that the DW and Raxxla Codex entries hold real truthful clues, it could just be further obfuscation, even the phrasing is telling: “legend, wild stories, myth, fragmentary rumour, conspiracy theories”. And the Codex is provided by Pilots’ Federation (as part of the cockpit console, in which they control the fsd/nav computer which constrains our movements with permit locks), at best an obscure and secretive organisation who might have ties to TDW, &/or The Club...

This thread seems to be losing its balanced scepticism, an essential tool of any good questor. Not saying it’s all wrong, but I don’t think it should be taken on face value.
