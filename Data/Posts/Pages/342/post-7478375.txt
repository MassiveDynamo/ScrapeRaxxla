Long time lurker here. As much as i want to participate in this amazing mystery, i can't stop thinking that frontier will destroy this too. Nothing is stopping them from flipping a switch for something to happen when THEY want, or someone discovers Raxxla and it turns out to be a simple beacon with a paragraph of text, or even for the path of Raxxla to reveal itself, one should be quadruple elite (worthy), or even that the path is broken and Raxxla cannot reveal itself due to some bug.

But Greek is my native language, so if you guys need anything like translation or meaning to words or phrases, i would be happy to help.

Thoughts?
If i am not mistaken, Achelous (river) was the father of the Sirens and not one of the Sirens.
