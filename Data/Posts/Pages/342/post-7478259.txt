Has anyone taken notice of this. Or is this old news by now?

It goes well with the idea there is a reason they gave us the original elite to play. And not just because they wanted us to play it for nostalgias sake.

Reading the dark wheel brings out several features it would be nice if they put in the game. They should probably update the game to have all of them. Like autopilot and rear guns and monitors.

But this is interesting information about the systems in game from the original only being ones in the story the dark wheel. And the girl is name Elyssia. Just like the Elyssian mystery thing. So, this may be an alternative to it. Maybe it doesn't intend the original mysteries but to follow their namesakes from previous fiction. Unless that leads to both. The stories might follow this though. They were trading things in the story etc. Also, she if from the clone world I think. That might explain the other stories about clones. It may be tieing this all in together somehow. There are lots of other potential tie ins in this story.
