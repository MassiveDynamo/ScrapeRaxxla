I have not read And Here At the Wheel myself but now will have to, so I may be wrong with timeline and actual story, but that said something cought my eye while perusing old threads.

Harper replied to a thread some time back with answers regarding the book and questions people had regarding it. What stuck out to me it this:

1. TDW is said to have found Soontill, but it was a CIEP station that was supposedly there.
2. Garry assumed the name Ryder at one point in New California, when asked if it was significant or a coincidence he simple replied “Ahhh, I wonder”
3. Soontill and other CIEP stations were evacuated, but some survived and are still out there.
4. Gunn has a secret station located in a Red Dwarf system that is around a Green-White-Blue Gas Giant. The station is circular, formerly imperial, and obuscated in or around an asteroid belt. When asked where it is Harper says it’s a secret. (I assume there’s nothing stopping an asteroid belt from orbiting around an 8th moon of a gas giant)
5. Oberons coffin contained Latin text from TDW

So, is it possible then that the former CIEP survivors formed TDW in this former imperial station after they evacuated their bases? Is the Ryder we know to have founded TDW actually Garry operating under the assumed name Ryder? If so, maybe we should be looking in red dwarf systems with blue-white-green gas giants and furthermore in an asteroid belt (nobody goes in those. So it would remain hidden for a long time). And if so, perhaps the CIEP bases, most preferably in the as yet to be rediscovered Soontill, provide information on the area the CIEP survivors evacuated to?
