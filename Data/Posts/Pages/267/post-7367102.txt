The key to any problem, or puzzle, is to get to the root of it. Where did this all start? You really need to work from there to fix it, or solve it. Did you know that the first mention of
Raxxla in 2296, **as stated in the codex**, was by Art Tornqvist and a woman named Cora. Did you know that Art in Greek storytelling was in itself a central character to convey meanings within their stories? Did you know that Cora is a variation of Kore and that Kore is another name for Persephone?
Did you know that we found a Non-Human Relic on Mars sixteen years before the first mention of Raxxla?
Do you know the story of Mars? Have you been there? What does the Oracle tell you about it?
Your Oracle of Delphi is the internet. Fact. Google and Wiki at every step. Braben is one of the founders of the AI revolution and the internet, an AI, is our Oracle.
Do you even know the story of Demeter, of Persephone/Kore/Cora, of Hades, or of how the initiation rites were created? Do you know who each one of them were and what their special talents, skills, or abilities were? And do you even understand exactly what the initiation rites are? If not, than fix all of that. Wiki has a great amount of information on them. It all started with Demeter, she gave birth to Persephone and to the initiation rites.
Many times contacts and characters appear when you arrive at the correct stations,
**"Welcome commander...."**
What do their names mean? Who are they and what do they say? What about their economy or faction? Meaning, greek, myth and symbol. What does the Oracle tell you about them? Good intentions, bad intentions, no intentions, just not applicable? Does it resonate with what you are doing? Do they align with the step and the subject matter, and especially do they apply to the path you're on? First name, last name, stations, unique body names?
Have you punched all the possibilities of the step, people, places or things into your nav? Do they have different name spellings? Does your navigation panel find more than one possible location and is one of those locations better linked to the step you're on??? Do certain names, words or objects have symbolic meanings, or myths or stories associated with them? Is it in alignment, in any way, to the step or possible location??
The journey begins when you consult the oracle and the importance is in getting the right location, action and sequence. The people you meet along the way are very important and should be, for the most part, pretty obvious connections, but it will be a bit heavy on the cryptic side at times, so that's on you to figure out. It would be wise to explore your options. The Oracle/internet/google will spit out a bunch of possibilities when you try all the key words and it's up to you to decipher which one is in alignment with the story, steps, and subject matter, if at all. If not, than there's a good chance it's not the one.
And believe it or not, there are in fact blatant signposts along the way, I used these to determine if this was all in my head or an actual thing happening, because this was an actual thought I struggled with.

There. That is the remainder of what I will give. A set of tools and a sense of direction to help clear this mess I've created. Let's hope it works. Not all of you are going to succeed.
If you lack the ability to see in metaphor, well than good luck. If you lack a secondary monitor or oracle device to use while you plot your courses, it will make this much much harder. It needs to be used constantly.
This whole experience has been rather horrible tbh. So best of luck, be happy that you're not in this position. I thought I was so smart and now I see that pride and ego has gotten the best of me, and of others, it would've been better to stay completely silent.

Everyone wants a free ride to the galaxies biggest treasure and that's not how it works. Prove yourself and you might find it.
Raxxla may have been in every game there has been, but it appears to me that the methodologies of accessing it have differed from game to game.
The NDA/NDC is stated in the initiation rites it's not a form to sign or a box to click, it's more of a matter of respect for something bigger than myself, and I expect the next person will come to this same understanding.
It appears the Dark Wheel has in fact metaphorically killed off my CMDR through this process, much like Alex Ryder, Jason Ryder and the rest.

Best of luck to all of you.

Wait a second. I've heard this whole spiel before! Especially the braben being some pioneer of the internet.... I can't quite remember from where though.

That or guru is braben in an alt account tooting his own horn.

BTW, IR TEH eLIte ExplorER!!11!! Took me about 4 days of gameplay! Picked up all terraforms, Water, Earthlike, Amonia and eventually started also adding rich metal and Class II gas.. Seems to be where the money is. Visit a long away destination and pick them up and you are golden for cash. Takes a while though. I have 310 mill and started at like 28 mill before the trip. Almost back to the bubble. I'm at one of the nearby nebulas and visiting them all on the way back.
