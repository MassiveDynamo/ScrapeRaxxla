IMO Guru's text is all very nice BUT
No Beacons in the game at launch
Different lensing effect at game launch for Black holes
No Obsidion Orbital at game lunch.
Etc, Etc
.
So none of these clues could have been used at game launch, and its been in the game according to Fdev since day one.
and findable since day one

He highlights the 'Wing of 4/4' in his pic, No wings at lunch
No FDL at launch

IF these have all been put in since to guide us, then Fdev has lied about not giving more clues ......

Just IMO o7

Edit, And Fdev do not do NDC they do NDA ;-)
