To be slightly less flippant for a moment...

What, if anything, do we expect Raxxla to give us when we find it? Some super-power? Or more of a super-big-tick-in-a-box like you would get for finding a Codex item? Maybe the answer is "Nothing except satisfaction".

If that is the case, then is it possible that Guru's post and screenshot is actually part of a satisfaction "cut-scene", in the way that finding a mission target ship or location gives us a ship that says "I'm glad I've found you, please follow me"?

What makes me wonder if Guru was really onto something here was that we know that Raxxla is the "place that is not a place". What if it is in fact a person or ship, that is obviously motile, and therefore not a place in the accepted sense of the term, but who can deliver you the benefits or secrets of "Raxxla", whatever they are? If you follow my tinfoil here a little further and indulge me, then what if what Guru found was a series of un-announced missions and mission objectives, which, when completed in the right order, allow you to meet "Raxxla"? And that the document about the Demeter / Persephone rituals was something of a roadmap into what those missions were, when placed in the context of the Elite bubble?

Or maybe I should just go and pour another glass of whiskey...
