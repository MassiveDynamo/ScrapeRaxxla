While investigating his claim I made my way to the Persephone system, honked, and used the FSS to scan the two bodies (the star and the planet Kore) and the DSS for Kore. Interestingly enough when I went to the Cartographer it had said I had been the first to discovered a body in Persephone. I am chalking it up to a technical glitch as all has been discovered and scanned before, but I was hoping another CMDR could fly out and try scanning the system and report their findings back from the cartographer. I did not scan the Nav Beacon as it seems to nullify the rewards for discoveries. Thank you.
