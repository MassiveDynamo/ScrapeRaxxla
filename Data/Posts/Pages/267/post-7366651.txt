Hi.

I have come to tell you that i have not found Raxxla.






Jokes aside, if it's been found, then cool, it means it is actually out there and findable.
If not: oh come on, Guru! Okay, it was the weekend, but still.
(To those willing to fetch their pitchforks, just please don't destroy the Bubble in anger before i'm back in a month, thanks)
