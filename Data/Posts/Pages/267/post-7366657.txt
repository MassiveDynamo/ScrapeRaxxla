I honestly hope he's found it.

However, there have been numerous times across different threads that a CMDR "... is on the cusp of finding something out... Will report findings here soon". They typically come back to announce they are getting closer, and usually, nothing more is heard. In my experience it tends to get people's backs up. Understandably.

I see this as no different. If I'd have found it, I'd either (1) not tell anyone, or (2) tell people and at least provide a possibly redacted screen shot. I do not see what information has actually been transmitted in said post other than it's been found and there's no evidence other than poster's word.

So, I am out too, but hoping that it has been found.
