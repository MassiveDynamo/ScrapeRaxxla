By transposed he meant a 8 got turned into an 3 !

That's all correct. There were at least 4 bases. Gunns bases description is unreliable - blue green gas giants don't really exist in game. Judging by his comment FD gave some descriptions to him to incorporate, but things like the planet graphics and system contents are most likely to have got altered. This is borne out across all the books and in his comments.
