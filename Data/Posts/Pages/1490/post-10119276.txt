I happen to be at T Tauri ( great name for a system - a star type and a constellation member). The asteroid base is owned by Azimuth Biotech. Its inside a planetary nebula (anyone remember refs to a dust cloud hiding the DW hq?)
No reference other than the codex pic which shows a red dwarf or protostar. Protostars are fuelled by a collapsing gas/dust cloud, the core is heated by gravitational collapse. The in-ship hud when a protostar is targeted shows the star with dust cloud moving over its surface. Could also be a cool red dwarf (L0-L2, perhaps M7-9) in a dust cloud. Star temperature likely would be between 1900K -3000K.
