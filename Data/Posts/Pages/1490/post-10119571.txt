If TDW’s station is the CIEP station from AHTW then it operates with Standard Imperial gravity, so it’s likely nearer Achenar than Sol...

Googled it but got no results. the Emperor’s residence is on Capitol (Achenar 6D) which has gravity 1.4 that of Earth, so it would make sense for that to be “Imperial Standard Gravity”. So it will have either a larger habitation ring than Fed stations, or faster rotation rate.
