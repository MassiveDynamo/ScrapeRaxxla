So in the codex it mentions how some people try hard to exclude their offspring from its membership because its dangerous - ofc thats Robert and Jordan Garry, and quite possibly Jordan was a Ryder. So the codex is consistent with AHTW - almost telling us where to look. Robert Garry is still alive at the end of the book, having retired to unknown destinations.
