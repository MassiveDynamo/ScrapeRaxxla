Correct me if I am wrong here, but didn't "...And Here the Wheel" have The Architect reading a story to his nephew or something? I know there was a child in the story.
No - they played with blocks, building a bridge. There was a princess costume for a lost daughter as well. Quite a bit of personal info given about him.
