Remember that FD has never confirmed that the DW station is actually in the game. It is most likely not implemented yet. When they put it in, there will probably be hints in the release trailer and we can have a mass search, like we always do.

True - but i will be especially unhappy if its not in game. It is the only part of this “mystery” with the slightest bit of a thread to follow. - i hate cell phones
