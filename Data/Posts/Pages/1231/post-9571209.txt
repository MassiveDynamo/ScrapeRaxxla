Mmm
Slowly reading Allen Stroud’s PhD thesis that Corr Fellian posted a link for a couple pages back. The Codex is misleading! The thesis says this Federation Guidebook was provided to all authors and Frontier Developments...

The thesis p383 quotes from this lore bible “Mars and the Artefact In 2280, the first non-human relic was found in space. The object, no bigger than a child’s hand was collected by an orbital probe around Europa and quickly brought back to Earth. No information has ever been circulated as to the properties of this item or its origin.

In 2291, the second attempt to terraform Mars was successful. The techniques employed were crude by later standards and the project had taken nearly a hundred years, but finally, humans could walk on the surface and breathe without the need for oxygen suits or respirators.”

So, the “Mars Artefact” may have had something to do with the success of the second attempt to terrform Mars, but it was found orbiting Europa!!! Reminiscent of 2001 Space Odyssey!!
