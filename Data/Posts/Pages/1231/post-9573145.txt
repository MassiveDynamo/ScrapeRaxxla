I think the first game was set in 3125?
I guess i think of galcop in the original elite as in its prime . According to the wiki by 3123:
“Galactic Cooperative is reduced in its power to that of an interstellar police force due to its failure to fully defeat the Thargoid invasion”

which is why i lean to a little earlier
