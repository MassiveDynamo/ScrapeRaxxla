Although most of this Thesis was taken in and may be considered Canon you also have to remember alot may have been redacted/changed including the "found on mars" versus "found around Europa" Id personally not rule out the codex being a trow off however I would also take the Thesis with a few pinch's of salt over the current codex due to being recently relevant in terms of said redactions, Good lead however and may be worth looking into
Indeed, retconning is a bit like “the boy who cried wolf” - once called you never quite believe it, which severely reduces immersion & therefore game believability and enjoyment!

In any case I’ve already fruitlessly searched in & around Europa a couple of times, so just thought it was interesting.

P.S. no, think you’ve misunderstood. The PhD wasnt submitted as lore. It has an appendix which is the Federation lore document which was written by him as the baseline for all Fed lore and was part of the info pack distributed to all the book authors and used by FD. One of the six lore documents he wrote for ED.
