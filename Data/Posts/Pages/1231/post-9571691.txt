Oh yes, Iâ€™ve checked Sirius out before, several times, but thought now I had some reasoning to justify it...
The last thing I had to check was flying into Sirius B, on the basis that its in-game statistics are dubious, and NS/WD fsd boosting came in a while ago and I thought maybe FD might have decided to make a game feature out of a Raxxla trigger.
First attempt I overheated & dropped out just outside the exclusion zone, managed to get away then fsd boosted and jumped-no Raxxla.
