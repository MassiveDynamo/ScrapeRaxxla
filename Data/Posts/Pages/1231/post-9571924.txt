It's funny you should mention that; a LONG time ago (well, not that long, probably 3-4 years), I did some research around there too. At one point I was in/around Sirius A and got the 'frameshift charge' message one normally gets around white dwarfs - which is Sirius B IIRC. Wasn't able to replicate it - possibly a bug, or I was close enough to B to get the message (at what, 9K Ls?); although I was really close to A at the time (as in orbiting it, fuel scooping distance). So I put it down to too much cheese. Well, put it down to nothing, really. Probably nothing. I flew for a good hour or so in and around A and then moved on since I couldn't get the message again.
I had the same behavior while i was in procyon years ago to get sirius permit. I think it was just a blast from neutron star that came to my ship. At first time it surprises because you say "what the h***, there is nothing around me".
