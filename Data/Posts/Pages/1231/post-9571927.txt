It's funny you should mention that; a LONG time ago (well, not that long, probably 3-4 years), I did some research around there too. At one point I was in/around Sirius A and got the 'frameshift charge' message one normally gets around white dwarfs - which is Sirius B IIRC. Wasn't able to replicate it - possibly a bug, or I was close enough to B to get the message (at what, 9K Ls?); although I was really close to A at the time (as in orbiting it, fuel scooping distance). So I put it down to too much cheese. Well, put it down to nothing, really. Probably nothing. I flew for a good hour or so in and around A and then moved on since I couldn't get the message again.
Yep, it was a bug. You used to get that message anywhere in a system that had a NS or WD. I remember getting it out at the furthest station in Van Maanens!
