Any idea what date The Dark Wheel novella is set in? Cant see a date myself
It's not known. Many set it shortly before the the start of Elite in 3125. Others say it must be quite a bit earlier, because they use the Faraway jump system. In the game you can jump from anywhere. It's probably a 'Based on RL events and persons' story, within the ED galaxy. It's not to be taken literally.

One could try to track the Ryder lineage and find an approximate maximum age for the events in TDW.
