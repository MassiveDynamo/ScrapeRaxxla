If I had a mining laser I would definitely spend some time looking for Raxxla here. Anyone ever seen anything like it? A lagrange cloud IN an icy ring....

Yep many. Even saw energy life. Which eats shields and move to shields if distance is close and interfere scanner like thargoids do. Tried mining laser and xeno scanner on such. Also saw seed pods in rings.
I think only research limpet work on that, should be picking samples, up-to 100k/sample on market.
