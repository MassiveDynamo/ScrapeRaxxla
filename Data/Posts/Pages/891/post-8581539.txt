Mmm, that link shows no knowledge of the permit requirements, which makes me suspicious of the permit holder info.
The Updated Permits List (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/updated-permit-list.122593/) has no info. That thread refers to a Galnet article about Walden which implies there may be a secret research base on Lave2 related to Walden clones; might be a future FD storyline, or might be fluff. Seem to remember the author of Lave Revolution requested Lave 2 be permit locked, so I suspect the latter.

I assumed it had to do with which group had control of the most stations on the planet. Last time I looked that was the Lave Fortune Organization (Though I admit it was a long time ago that I checked).

SPOILER: LFO

edit.. but ya still locked by authors request as far as I know
