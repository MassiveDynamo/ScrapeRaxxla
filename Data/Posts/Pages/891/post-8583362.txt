Thanks FD! The first PowerPlay warning message this afternoon finally got rid of the annoying exclamation mark in the comms panel

Unfortunately the second warning message brought it back!
Sigh

If you put your comms into tabbed mode and click through to the ‘System’ comms tab when you enter a new system, it will clear the exclamation mark.

Unfortunately, this has to be done EVERY single jump to get rid of the [!].
