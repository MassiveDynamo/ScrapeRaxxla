I have permit to Isinor. That fraction is present on near systems. Maybe LFT 509 has or HAD fraction present near, then fraction could be kicked out and lost?

Slightly on the same topic: according to ED Fandom's wiki Lave 2 permit should be delivered by the Workers of Lave Liberals.
I became allies with them last weekend, then checked the three Lave stations but didn't found any permit mission so far.

Edit: I'll focus on the passengers mission next weekend.
