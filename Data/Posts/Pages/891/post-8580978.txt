Slightly on the same topic: according to ED Fandom's wiki Lave 2 permit should be delivered by the Workers of Lave Liberals.
I became allies with them last weekend, then checked the three Lave stations but didn't found any permit mission so far.

Edit: I'll focus on the passengers mission next weekend.

Mmm, that link shows no knowledge of the permit requirements, which makes me suspicious of the permit holder info.
The Updated Permits List (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/updated-permit-list.122593/) has no info. That thread refers to a Galnet article about Walden which implies there may be a secret research base on Lave2 related to Walden clones; might be a future FD storyline, or might be fluff. Seem to remember the author of Lave Revolution requested Lave 2 be permit locked, so I suspect the latter.
