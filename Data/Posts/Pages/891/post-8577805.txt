Ok so what I had in mind was rather simple, but I haven't found records of anyone trying or even considering.

The supernova is long gone, but the light, or signal from the initial explosion is still going through space right. So being in a right place in a right time, one could maybe pick up some...whispers from the witch space? Or something with the discovery scanner, while being oriented at the Cas A origin place.

Was something like this been considered?
This part is missing in game too. Otherwise on each jump close to any nebula you must see different views as it evolves. 70ly jump = 70 years newer image.
We see static images everywhere. So nope. Time / time paradoxes are absent in game.
Even simple in-system paraxles. When you move away from body with 1C+ you must see it backmoves on orbit, it does not happen.
