Maybe it could be explained by the frame drive somehow compensating for that, just like it does for the relativistic time deformation?
And the hyperspace jumps, do we have any idea what are the things we see or hear?

Anyway, there are two systems that were supposed to be the Cas A neutron star according to the expedition, plus i have found one more on a forum. Determining the points whehe the signal should be now is simple vector work, so I am planning on checking out the systems that lie in the vicinity.

Any suggestions on different approach to data collecting? I am fairly new to the game.
Not sure what to say ... I found class of "impossible" NS here, which are heavier then 3xSOL masses + temperatures of those are near 1 billion. Visited like 20 heaviest. Nothing found, except it is really nice view from the jump. 1 sample is Lighthouse near bubble - it is hot one. Try to jump TO it.
Another idea was "spiraling stars". Latest researches say it can be W-R star + some another close (i.e. double star). So lately i check those. Just checked "CD-xxxxx" stars, that was about 5 W-R with nebulas there.
