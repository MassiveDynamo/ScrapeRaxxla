This part is missing in game too. Otherwise on each jump close to any nebula you must see different views as it evolves. 70ly jump = 70 years newer image.
We see static images everywhere. So nope. Time / time paradoxes are absent in game.
Even simple in-system paraxles. When you move away from body with 1C+ you must see it backmoves on orbit, it does not happen.

Maybe it could be explained by the frame drive somehow compensating for that, just like it does for the relativistic time deformation?
And the hyperspace jumps, do we have any idea what are the things we see or hear?

Anyway, there are two systems that were supposed to be the Cas A neutron star according to the expedition, plus i have found one more on a forum. Determining the points whehe the signal should be now is simple vector work, so I am planning on checking out the systems that lie in the vicinity.

Any suggestions on different approach to data collecting? I am fairly new to the game.
