Hi all, Fairly new to the game, and would like to get involved in this.

There is nearly 900 pages here, thats alot to scan through!!!!
Does anyone have a summary of what we know so far, or directions to the start of the trail in game that i can go and get the information for myself?

Im not looking for someone to spend hours of their time filling me in, just hoping that someone has the start point. or points we are at now!

Ive read of sectors that we are trying to get to, but dont have the permits to do so. Namely LFT 509

Although i am slightly lost, having just watched a video of Raxxal being found.

Yep, see the first page.
However we know nuthink, nuthink!
Though we hypothesise a lot!

LFT 509 is currently thought to be a good candidate system for The Dark Wheel (TDW, see in-game Codex) hidden stealth station, thanks to an exploit related to the recently introduced Fleet Carriers.

There is no evidence that TDW know anything about Raxxla.

And there is a lot of trolling around related to Raxxla, beware!
