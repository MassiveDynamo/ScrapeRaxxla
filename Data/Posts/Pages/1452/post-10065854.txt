We are killing the Guardians. I am not joking, either. Delphi has Technetium. Atlas has Technetium. That should not exist there if those were Thargoids. The systems of the Pleiades are wrong star types for Thargoids. The surfaces of most planets are hot. We are being used to exterminate a sentient race. Whether we have a choice at this point, I don't know but none of this adds up to what we were told was the case.





Delphi has one of the highest concentrations of Technetium. We are being used by something to kill the Guardians who may be the only group that has answers.
