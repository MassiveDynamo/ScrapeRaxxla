The reason Technetium is special is all isotopes are radioactive and thus exists at best a few millions of years unless it is being produced. It is one of those things that is very rare on Earth itself but found in space a bit more frequently (just checked EDSM and a lot of bodies have it in Sol). Also, made a mention in "...And Here the Wheel". I thought it was going to be weird enough edge case that we could put the Thargoids lore to a test. Sadly, it appears both have some connections to asymptotic giant branch stars. I just wasn't exactly expecting the possibility that both species were linked to those stars. The only good thing, is we now have a very solid case for M-K class stars that are 2-8 solar masses and long-period variables (especially if they possess an orbiting brown dwarf as per "..And Here the Wheel"). Sometimes science works on testing theories and other times it just proves you still need better information. Back to the drawing boards.
