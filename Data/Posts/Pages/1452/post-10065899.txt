We are killing the Guardians. I am not joking, either. Delphi has Technetium. Atlas has Technetium. That should not exist there if those were Thargoids. The systems of the Pleiades are wrong star types for Thargoids. The surfaces of most planets are hot. We are being used to exterminate a sentient race. Whether we have a choice at this point, I don't know but none of this adds up to what we were told was the case.

Delphi has one of the highest concentrations of Technetium. We are being used by something to kill the Guardians who may be the only group that has answers.

This may be a misinterpretation. Thargoids Device surface sites are within tolerances for Thargoids (freezing - boiling temperatures for ammonia). Still, wasn't expecting them to also be tied to asymptotic giant branch stars. Thargoids may still exist. This isn't nearly as earth-shattering as I thought. It does, however, make things a great deal less clear. So, now are they basically the same species? Guardian logs suggested their limbs were similar. Great. No clarity. You think you are finally going to make headway. Yes you make some but it very much two steps forwards followed by one step backwards. Non-clarity we meet again. Well, maybe we get some idea of if Oresrian vs Klaxxian is a legit thing. I swear this game's lore is something else.
