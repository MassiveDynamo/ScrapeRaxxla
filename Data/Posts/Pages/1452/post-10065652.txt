SPOILER: JOHN MCKEE, MOSTLY HARMLESS PILOT APPLICANT, CYLLENE ORBITAL, ATLAS SYSTEM

Weird stuff in the Merope Bubble...

Edit: Trading beacon still want's beer
mmm, could be a reference to Thargoid Sensors/Barnacles etc? There are so many system descriptions that appear to be potential clues...

Just bought a temporary DBScout & jumped back to Charick Drift & tried flying down into the WD cone (in case that's the Omphalos) but far too violent motion. I'd say its impossible. ALso tried to reach the core again but fsd dropped out as usual. Giving up on this hypothesis!
