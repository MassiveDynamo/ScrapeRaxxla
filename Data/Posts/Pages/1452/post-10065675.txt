Just tried Saturn/Tethys (sounds like Thetis (gen ship)) as it has Odysseus the largest crater in the solar system ( according to Wikipedia ) which gives it the appearance of the Death Star, but found nothing at the coordinates of its centre, and cant actually see anything resembling it, so guess FD didnt feel the need to be realistic...
