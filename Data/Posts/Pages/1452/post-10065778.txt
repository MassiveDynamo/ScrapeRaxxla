Finishing off in Atlas, @Jorki Rasalas let me know if you want me to try anything.

I am still waiting for the realization to hit the player-base about the Pleiades and the kinds of stars you had to search for during Ram Tah's mission. Keep in mind, also Palin should not have gotten sick during Cerberus Plague. Read the damn codexes. We are being mislead and it's OBVIOUS. Start at the star type types in Pleiades then look at the surface temperatures of the planets.

We really shouldn't be attacking the aliens that came to the Bubble. We have a common enemy that is far more dangerous and it has been playing humans for fools.

P.S. - Not trying to insult anyone. Propaganda sucks and it is hard to detect. I really need you all to start paying attention before we have to sacrifice the whole Bubble. This will at least make updates interesting but damn. It boils down to there is Technetium in Delphi and all the systems inhabited by "Thargoids". The problem those aren't Thargoids. They are Guardians. WE ARE FIGHTING THE GUARDIANS. The system Delphi has one of the highest concentrations of Technetium possible (about 0.8%).
