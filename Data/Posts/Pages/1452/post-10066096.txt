Because IMO fdev went out of their way to show us words and numbers are 100% meaningless when it comes to materials and where to find them and what percentages exist., not ever once even close to correct, unless we all failed math and only fdev understands depleted and % and moregood, lessgood, etc
I would not say that. It is just that combining lore, descriptions, and a bit of knowledge can have unpredictable results. It, however, is one of the few pathways which on occasion can produce ideas that solidly put the odds in our favor. Even the occasional failures can be valuable learning experiences. Just checked and the only naturally occuring isotope of Technetium is Technetium-99 with a half-life of 211,000 years. Every other isotope known must be made in a lab and has significantly shorter half-lifes. The only other element known that has no stable isotopes is Promethium. Technetium is atomic number 43 and Promethium is atomic number 61. Technetium is the lightest known fundamentally unstable element.
