Indeed. But what I mean is that almost every culture has some kind of myth/legend/history which can be related to ED "clues".
Are we going to try every one we know or are we presuming that the FD story-tellers put some of their preferences in it?
Then the "MB being fan of Norse, Lovecraft, etc.." thing. But he left, so.. ? Do we know DB's preferences in that matter ?

This is the problem I have with the mythological approach. The ED universe is vast, so not surprisingly FD have used mythology, real people/places, etc as the source for place names. Now that does not indicate the myths are at all relevant. We know that Raxxla has been in-game since the start; anything related to the Codex is new, it might be additional information/hints or it may be obfuscation.
