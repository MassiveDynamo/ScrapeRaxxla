Indeed. But what I mean is that almost every culture has some kind of myth/legend/history which can be related to ED "clues".
Are we going to try every one we know or are we presuming that the FD story-tellers put some of their preferences in it?
Then the "MB being fan of Norse, Lovecraft, etc.." thing. But he left, so.. ? Do we know DB's preferences in that matter ?

I dont expect FD will dare to hold on ANY religious reference. I prefer Nordic omens because of weird behavior of Galaxy Map (could be a bug).
As for Astrophil and Spiralling Stars is it only as a bait like "Attention explorers, Raxxla is a wormhole!". When the time come, Raxxla will be activated and we will receive some tiny hints - visuals like tourist beacon message "There be Raxxla!" or Ram Tah decoding message hidden in an audio signal and naming nearby system.

Kinda like hidden message here (disclaimer - what is seen cannot be unseen):
