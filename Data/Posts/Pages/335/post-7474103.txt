If anyone is interested to join, I’m gonna intensify my search for TDW system within 100ly of Sol. It’s a lot of systems to cover by me onsies but I have, what I think, is good reason to do so.
As mentioned before our current FSD tech is quite new, only coming into use around 3300. MB said in an interview with truthsayer that before this they were using ion drives etc to move about, so travel was quite limited distance wise from sol.
Furthermore, it struck me that the empire, back in the 2400’s moved to Achenar (140ly from sol) in an attempt to get away from the federation, figuring that would be more than far enough. So this gives us two things. A distance that at that time was considered to be quite far from the then bubble AND since they moved that also gives us abandoned star ports, which sounds awful familiar. So if 140ly was considered far from the bubble at the time I think it would be safe to say looking for an abandoned empire starport, now inhabited by TDW, within 100ly of sol is generous.
