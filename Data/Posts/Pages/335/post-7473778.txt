See, that's what I was asking about when some random fellow told me you all have no ideas or clues...

Being late to the party, I wonder if I'll make it 6 million and ONE ideas, or if I'll just rehash old ideas as I embark on a little detective work of my own... I suppose I can eventually make my way through these 6000+ posts, especially if I skip past all the weird "One-eye Thor shall lead the way" ideas [haha]
Jorki knows his stuff. He didn’t say we have no ideas, he said we have no idea and it was in terms of the question asked.

We have loads of ideas! But when it comes to the question of how we’re actually supposed to find it, i.e. what FD has in mind, then yeah the honest answer is that we have no idea, i.e. we don’t know in any factual manner! (Except that it’s a journey everyone has to travel for themselves. Whatever that means in the context!)
