I think the personal journey thing is still valid. The Codex points us to get personal in the way of being invited by TDW.
No brute force will do it. Now, the question is how to actually attract their attention ?

Except I have a vague recollection of DB or MB saying that it was possible that someone might find it by accident. Hence any personal journey (which may be Elite ranking, providing access to SD, but in the original game there was only combat Elite. There might also be some clues that are not obvious, e.g. NPC names) might be the planned way to find it, but there might be other ways.
