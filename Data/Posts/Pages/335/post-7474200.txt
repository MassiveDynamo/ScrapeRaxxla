Ive read, reread and read again Astrophil and Stella. I have come to the conclusion Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars needs to be revisited as a clue for the following reasons:

A) Astrophil is a dude so while he could be a princess in 2019 that wasnt possible back in the 1500s.

B)Astrophel is misspelled

C)The book name is 'Astrophil and Stella' not 'Astrophel and the spiralling stars'

D) Stella is singular and spiralling Stars is plural.

In order for there to be an actual connect between this line and the book you have to explain away these inconsistencies and to be honest thats going to be difficult.

I think the clue here is the simplest interpretation of this line

Princess ________ (A star lover) and the spiralling stars.

Princess Astronomers are out there, such as:

Princess Charlotte of Saxe-Meiningen

Alternatively it could be referencing an actual childs book about an astronomer princess.

It could be that Astrophel is being used just as a name and it’s meaning is the clue alone and not connected to the sonnets. But, it should be noted, that Astrophel vs Astrophil isn’t really an issue here. It was either or back when it was written, but was codified later by an editor as Astrophil officially for the sonnets. But Astrophel is technically equally valid.
