Thank you! This is exactly the kind of thing (based on description, I haven't gone there yet) I was looking for.



Hey, that's what I'm doing

I'm starting at Sol and just visiting all the various systems around it with the purpose of scanning all the various unregistered beacons, crashed ships, tourist beacons, whatever, along with the 8th moon of any unnamed gas giant, just to see what there is to see. If nothing else, it'll be a fun road trip. Perhaps that's part of the personal journey - we have to scan all these clues ourselves IN THE GAME instead just reading it second-hand via the forums, and TDW will contact us.

Speaking of TDW, I realized pretty quickly that I'm going to be "bending" the law and encountering less-than-friendly forces during this little jaunt, so my explorer Dolphin won't do. I whipped up an "exploration" Vulture with some thick skin and teeth, called her "The Dark Wheel" with TDW as the callsign, just for fun (supposedly impersonating them gets their attention). Sadly I'm stuck in Solo on PS4, so we probably won't cross paths, but we can compare notes!

Oh for sure yeah, if I come across anything of note I’ll be sure to chime in. Or if you’re mentioning of going somewhere I’ve checked allready I’ll let ya know. What I’m doing is setting my route to hop only Stars I’ve not visited, and plot economy courses (that way 100ly takes like 15 jumps) from sol to 100ly out. Then turn around and repeat.
