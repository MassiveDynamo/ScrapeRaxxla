I'm currently importing the latest dump of stellar body info since my database is a year out of date.
I'm hoping that there's more good candidates of red stars w/ gas giants w/ 8 moons within appropriate distance to create the screenshot.

While that's going, I took 1 each of 8 goods (Lavian brandy, Waters of Shintara, HIP 7442 Wheat, terra mater blood bores, basic beer, wine, grain and 1 more thing I forget right now) and sold them at The Oracle @ Delphi in an Eagle.
Nothing happened, but I have 2-3 sets of more rare goods to try.
