Elite: Dangerous' first Triple Elite player just won £10,000
Elite: Dangerous developer Frontier just awarded £10,000 to the first player to reach Triple Elite status.

There was Cmdr onepercent... Renamed himself after 1% hull left after a scrap if I remember correctly... Having vaguely remembered and Googled him...It looks like whilst he was first to triple elite I believe the first to the individual ones where "CMDR Lordkee took home £1000 for winning the trade prize, CMDR Fromtonrogue won the combat prize, and the wonderfully-named CMDR Tequila won the exploration prize." Which is detailed at the end of the news article.

I should also have the newsletters if you want me to look for the prize winner notification..

Ah thanks. I did find the Race to Elite results reported in a EuroGamer article, and edited my post on Sunday with those results. Unfortunately the edit doesn’t seem to have taken. I’m having browser problems at the moment. For example when I look at or refresh this thread the current page often shows me as logged out, but when I reload from a save bookmark it shows me (correctly) loged in. And Reddit pages are now showing shifted left by a couple of characters. Think I’m going to have to do a reset on my iPad, but it’s 10 years old now & not sure it will recover!
Oh, and Norton is flagging this as an unsafe site!
