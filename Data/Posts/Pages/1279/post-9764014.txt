Has anyone experimented with sap 8?
Many has, but at the right place, the right time, with the right methods is hard to say.
We probably need a methodical approach to all these 'container & commodity tests'. There are more artifacts that are interesting to test in methodical manners.

How? Just keep it in the inventory? Drop & listen? Shoot at it? Offer it to someone? Sell it on the market?
Where? Suggestion of places? Stations? Megaships?
When? At a specific time? At a specific event? In a system state such as War or Boom?

I'm just spitballing how we could approach this more methodical. Ideas?
