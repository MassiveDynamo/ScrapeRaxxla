I still think Neptune is said gas giant and Triton (Being Neptunes 8th moon listed, Proteus being actual number 8 however) hold the Darkwheel station although permit locked as it is maybe crashed/destroyed which pushed them into Shinrarta instead..food for thought and maybe Fdev dont want us to find this out yet, or there is a way of getting Tritons permit without knowing yet
