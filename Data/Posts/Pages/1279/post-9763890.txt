Has anyone experimented with sap 8? FD could have just removed or hidden it, but it's still in the game. there must be a reason? Useless little thing is transported by a convoy of the best ships in the game, nothing suspicious. Has anyone tried giving it to the Thargoids to sniff? or drop with all their stuff. And don't forget about guardian. thanks google translate 1 post in all these years
