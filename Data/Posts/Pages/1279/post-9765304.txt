Thanks Cmdr, good to know, saved me some time for going and trying some shenanigans with them.... unless you're some form of misinformation agent and is attempting to dissuade me from trying and discovering some hidden content?
Nah just cheerfully playing you mate.
Thanks.
If it helps I have tried with some stuff myself back when Guardian relics where found to be accepted....all I done was waste time, money buying the items and boredom lol
