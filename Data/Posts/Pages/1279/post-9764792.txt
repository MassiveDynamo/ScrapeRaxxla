Ah thanks. I did find the Race to Elite results reported in a EuroGamer article, and edited my post on Sunday with those results. Unfortunately the edit doesn’t seem to have taken. I’m having browser problems at the moment. For example when I look at or refresh this thread the current page often shows me as logged out, but when I reload from a save bookmark it shows me (correctly) loged in. And Reddit pages are now showing shifted left by a couple of characters. Think I’m going to have to do a reset on my iPad, but it’s 10 years old now & not sure it will recover!
Oh, and Norton is flagging this as an unsafe site!
Well, reset my iPad. But still playing up!
