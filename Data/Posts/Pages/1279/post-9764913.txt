Yes, I suspect it’s Safari playing up. I’ve installed Opera, cos Chrome Edge and Firefox all need later versions of ios than I can install. But cant figure out how to synchronise bookmarks. Currently have Safari & PC Firefox synching via iCloud.
Might have to buy a new tablet, after paying the gas & elec , tv licence, window repair, podiatrist and pet food bills....life is expensive, then Pootin goes mad!

Suppose I could relegate this ipad to gameglass.

Mmm, the odd logged in/not logged in behaviour on this thread is still happening with Opera.
Anyone else having problems?
