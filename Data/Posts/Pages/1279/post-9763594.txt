Well, when was that?
I was harking back to what DW reported - that DB had said something like “we know where Raxxla is and why it hasnt been found yet” (although DW only said it the once & no corroboration as far as I know). If true it might mean that nobody had at that time got the Elite rank needed to gain entry to Shinrarta, where I suspect the next clue might be.

Edit: actually first one player to Elite might well have been reported in the Newsletter!
And have they stopped producing them? Cant remember when I last received one!
Elite: Dangerous' first Triple Elite player just won £10,000
Elite: Dangerous developer Frontier just awarded £10,000 to the first player to reach Triple Elite status.

There was Cmdr onepercent... Renamed himself after 1% hull left after a scrap if I remember correctly... Having vaguely remembered and Googled him...It looks like whilst he was first to triple elite I believe the first to the individual ones where "CMDR Lordkee took home £1000 for winning the trade prize, CMDR Fromtonrogue won the combat prize, and the wonderfully-named CMDR Tequila won the exploration prize." Which is detailed at the end of the news article.

I should also have the newsletters if you want me to look for the prize winner notification..
