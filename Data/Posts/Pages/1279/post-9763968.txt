That’s actually a good angle.

Sap 8 containers hold a foot long crystalline shard of unknown origin. These originate from the now removed Dark Wheel missions ‘Discrete Redistribution Agent Desired’. Or were at least linked.

Now first off, if FD removed the missions why haven’t they also removed Sap 8 containers?

Secondly the description of the Sap 8 sounds very much like Guardian shards…if they are Guardian in nature, they ought to make Thargoid’s aggressive, if they don’t what does that mean?

A number of assumptions could be as follows:

FD haven’t removed them because they simply forgot to do so.

They are irrelevant, due to that mission tree being defunct, so they are not worth the resources to remove.

They are guardian tech, linked to a defunct narrative, but never activated to work with current content (see above).

They are not guardian tech and something else entirely, likely linking to discovering the real DW or Raxxla from the now defunct missions (see above).

They are something else.

This is a good point to press towards FD. Because first off they confirmed that historical missions were removed; because we asked - if they are in game, said inclusion (if broken) is pointing the consumer to interact with ‘broken’ content and waste their time.

The same logic and questioning can be directed at FD.

Technically if they are ‘historically broken content’ first off they should not be in game, if they are they ought to be acknowledged as a ‘bug’. Because their inclusion advocates you ought to interact with them, if they are a bug, FD are encouraging the customer to play with broken content and effectively ‘waste’ their time.

Conclusion: Report it as a bug.

If FD say working as intended, question it’s inclusion against the above logic. Likely wont resolve in anything….
