Also, a quick question about the Sap 8 containers, have they been tested in any of the Thargoid structures, those that activate some kind of star map?

I know that guardian tech will get the structure going crazy and get you attacked by scavengers, but has anyone already tried it?
As far as I remember there was a group of players that tested these sites with all commodity's even rare ones, Unfortunately it doesn't accept any human type cannisters
