Think 1 & 2 sources are mixed up

1. Milky Way - was from MB interview with MJ
2. Its in the game - comes from DW account of his meeting with DB at the bar after an event (don't know if its elsewhere as well)
Yeah.

Also, still a bit of an odd situation with the DB interview.

V1: "It exists, we know where it is and we know why people haven't been able to find it..."

V2: "It's out there and we (FD) know where it is".
