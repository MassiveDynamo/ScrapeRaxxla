Just found this online. Not sure if anyone else knew about it or not but ive only ever seen Alien World by Stephen Eisler referenced hereView attachment 154301
Sorry i have no other info about its contents
I have this book - nothing relevant in it that I can find. But I miss things so get a copy if you're curious. I wouldn't recommend it as a great read mind-you of its time.
