We need to hope that the “penance” referenced in the last winking cat article was penance on Raxxla’s or Winking Cats part. Not ours. If it was on our part I’d say we failed. If it was on Raxxla’s then, we got a ship full of Jasmina Halsey-esque people locked away and sequestered from the rest of humanity

Think about it: The boys referenced in the article weren’t talking about the technology they’ll get to see. They were talking about the technology they saw. The people were so unified and singing because they just came from the paradise Raxxla has been described as.

That ship had probably been there since before the Ferilizer crisis. In fact the fertilizer crisis was most likely a ploy by The Club to ensure focus was shifted away from where the Golconda was.
The Scyth of Panem people were blamed and Commanders went and destroyed them for no good reason. Just because Raxxla sent people back and the club wanted to run damage control while we were distracted.

Am I making sense or just wildly rambling? I genuinely want to know.
