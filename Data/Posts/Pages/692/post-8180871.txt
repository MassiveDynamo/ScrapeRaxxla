I think you miss the point I was trying to make and is emblematic of how people cherry pick what they choose to believe or not to believe rather then just eliminate via logic. Personally I don't believe in there being triggers (due to other reasons). And if you did believe in triggers, you would have to proceed from what mechanics can be done in game, in order to eliminate the possibility that they are not a trigger.

I'm just saying its my challenge to those that believe in triggers. If truly a person believes in triggers then they will have to do CQC to Elite to eliminate the possibility of status being a trigger. Otherwise all other actions taken to search for Raxxla before completing this step is irrational and futile. Any logical person who believes in triggers will have to go down this path.

You say you can guarantee me it has nothing to do with Raxxla. What you are really saying is you believe it has nothing to do with Raxxla. You can't really guarantee it unless you have been to Raxxla no? Its the same argument from deists or atheists, of faith.

what I'm saying is a friend of mine Colonel_scouse is quad Elite and he has also been seeking raxxla for a long time and so far quad Elite means nothing to him either.

Also im pretty sure cqc wasnt something available when the game first came out based on this

Considering the state of cqc disrepair, If it was seriously connected to anything thats taken as seriously as raxxla it would have been fixed or at least acknowledged. After everyone went looking for Gan Romero they decided to stop making galnet fluff to prevent people wasting their time. Wouldnt it make sense to make sure the path everyone must travel for theirselves is actually able to be traveled by anyone? Which it presently is not in its currently far from it. It just seems like common sense to me but hey.....
