I would have to interject at this point. if CQC was important in any way whatsoever they would maintain it. it's completely unmaintained it's almost unplayable on console. I can guarantee you it has nothing to do with anything other than pew pew

I think you miss the point I was trying to make and is emblematic of how people cherry pick what they choose to believe or not to believe rather then just eliminate via logic. Personally I don't believe in there being triggers (due to other reasons). And if you did believe in triggers, you would have to proceed from what mechanics can be done in game, in order to eliminate the possibility that they are not a trigger.

I'm just saying its my challenge to those that believe in triggers. If truly a person believes in triggers then they will have to do CQC to Elite to eliminate the possibility of status being a trigger. Otherwise all other actions taken to search for Raxxla before completing this step is irrational and futile. Any logical person who believes in triggers will have to go down this path.

You say you can guarantee me it has nothing to do with Raxxla. What you are really saying is you believe it has nothing to do with Raxxla. You can't really guarantee it unless you have been to Raxxla no? Its the same argument from deists or atheists, of faith.
