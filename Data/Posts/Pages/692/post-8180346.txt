Agreed, and I forgot 5 was prob part of FR storyline anyway lol

someone asked about music on entering system - you get 1 music track music played when you reach your 'target' destination, which could be 1 jump away or 100, its just you got to your final destination. Learn this one and listen out for any different ones, some 'features' have their own music but not sure it happens on entering the system or just when your closer to them.
