Nope.



Also, Paige is/was a CM, and I would think the lore is much more likely to be tied with narrative and/or game director roles. The exec producer role seems to me to be more tied with general game production rather than world/universe building than in MB's era, but that's just the impression I'm picking up, and I could be completely wrong.
Cool, thanks for clarifying that.
