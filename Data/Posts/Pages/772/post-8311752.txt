Oh ho, that reminds me, I was looking into the comments that appear for the mission providers. Specifically the intro ones to see what was common, or unique and noted the 'Haylcon Days' on an occasional comment.
Most probably related to the combination of faction current state, government type and commander's rep. Have observed the "Haylcon Days" mention for about a week just recently (during Tip Offs grinding)

PS: to be precise - Confederacy/Boom state
