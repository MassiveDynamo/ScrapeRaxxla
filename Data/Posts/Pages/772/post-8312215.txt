So I came to Iapet with fighter ship - no DSS on board. Map showed "other" signal and that's all. Nothing on panel (1). Nothing on zooming map view.
Then i switched to ship with DSS. Coming close to surface showed in (1) "other", so I could target. At some point close it disappeared and lost target, about 200kms to go and was draw on screen.
I think ..that how should DW station work too because it "hides".
