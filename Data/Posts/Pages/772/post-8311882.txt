Also, Paige is/was a CM, and I would think the lore is much more likely to be tied with narrative and/or game director roles. The exec producer role seems to me to be more tied with general game production rather than world/universe building than in MB's era, but that's just the impression I'm picking up, and I could be completely wrong.

It seems that DW has taken offence at some comments and will no longer post/respond on these forums. We have lost our lore guru
Lore questions. :)
Is the dragon like thing/reptile on the Dark Wheel medallion (like the one given to Salome) supposed to represent a specific dragon? Perhaps Typhon of greek mythos? That is fan art and not canon...
