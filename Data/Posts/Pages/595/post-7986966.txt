Mmmh.. Right. So Raxxla would be in a locked sector. Get the permit to unlock that whole sector (never seen that in ED..) and then... look for Raxxla, in that whole sector.
Easy peasy...
Now, iirc they are locked systems in the deep black, yes ? Locked by the PF, yes ?
Why ?

That's the way I'd do it.
Get the invite to TDW (locked system near Bubble), then they hack you a sector permit for the area they think Raxxla is in, then you go find it.

Not sure if there are individual locked systems out in the black, but they'd be tricky to find.

I wouldn't try tying the PF locks to things lore-wise - they're a game mechanic more than anything.
