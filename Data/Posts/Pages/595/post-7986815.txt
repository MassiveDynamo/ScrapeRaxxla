Interesting. Raxxla gathering energy from both NS to power The Portal , or something like that... Makes sense.

wasn't that the planet in Sirius system? covered in cables in gather the energy?
Would make sense, Sirius Inc are definitely twisted! Occupied by powerful men using its power to control humanity!
