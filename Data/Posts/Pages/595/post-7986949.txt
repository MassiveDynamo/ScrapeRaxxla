Well he's not going to say "...except for the one with Raxxla in it" is he?
Mmmh.. Right. So Raxxla would be in a locked sector. Get the permit to unlock that whole sector (never seen that in ED..) and then... look for Raxxla, in that whole sector.
Easy peasy...
Now, iirc they are locked systems in the deep black, yes ? Locked by the PF, yes ?
Why ?
