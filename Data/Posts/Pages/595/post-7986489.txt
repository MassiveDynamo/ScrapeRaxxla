IF Raxxla is a NS, that spiraling star., jewel that burns.. How could there be people on it ?
Or should we consider this as retconned and Raxxla no longer being a planet ?
Or the jewel is the main star of the system which contains planet Raxxla ?
But then, "To the jewel..." and "To Raxxla..." wouldn't match pretty well, would they?
