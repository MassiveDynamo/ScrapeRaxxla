That's why Sirius corporation settled on Lucifer. The close orbit around Sirius B (white dwarf) lett them harness energy, by wrapping coils around the planet.

At least that is what the old lore says.
Well, with my theory on the clues pointing to Venus, and after the Devil's Dance Floor not having Raxxla anywhere to be seen, when I get back to the bubble, I was going to get my SRV out and scour Lucifer, looking for an omphalos rift. I cant think of any other morning star/lucifer/devil references in game, unless anyone lese has any ideas?
