I’m slowly heading back towards a nebula, I’ll monitor this and see if the spinning effect becomes more noticeable as I near it (may take a while, I keep finding more things to look at, plus playing around with new hosas binds...).
Did notice this afternoon the spinning was suddenly anticlockwise, instead of usual clockwise, & it seemed to start almost instantaneously instead of after a delay as usual.
