Hey Drew, I’ve a question for you. I started cataloging the HIP systems some time ago and came across one early on that bothered me as I could see no way to get to it: HIP 53. I can’t find any in-game info on the system having been visited or any mention of it as a “dev” system, but I’m curious if anyone else has actually managed to get there.

Edited to correct autocorrect.

I'll take a look tonight when I get online.

There have been a few HIP and HD systems (though possibly with other main names) that I've looked for but not been able to reach - usually because they're wildly out of position in ED. Beta Pheonicis is my go-to example of that, at something ridiculous like 13 kLy below the galactic plane, when it should be within a couple of hundred LY of Sol.
If FDev had actually given us a reasonable amount of bookmarks I'd probably still know where they are
