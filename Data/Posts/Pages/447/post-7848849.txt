Interestingly I have been digging into a bit of lore in the ED Universe and my travels took me to a place called Yamatri along with my history tour. I was passing through but noticed that the system is run by the Independent Light Wheel. It also has an unauthorized station orbitting one of the gas giants. Warning, do not bring cargo. You will be shot on sight. So there is a dark and there is a light. Interesting.
