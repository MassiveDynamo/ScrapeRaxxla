Solide piece of info gathering by CoR. It is however a bit strange that CoR are making a huge hypothesis based on Raxxla and Klaxian both containing an A and a X in the name.
This seem to be wishful thinking by someone who wants ‘The Alien World’ to be relevant. They go even further by equating all thargoids to the Oisir-Raxxlans. It's not clear why, but I guess they mean Oisir = Oresrian and Raxxlan = Klaxian?

John Jameson did not carry out the Mycoid attack in the 3250s. I don't see how they confused that one.
Other than that, the document is pretty good. CoR shines on the conspiracy stuff.
Their legend interpretations are however a bit weak.

Oooh, started reading the CoR document but not got very far...Though do I quite like Oisir=Oresrian and Raxxla=Klaxian!
It would explain the origin of the Oresrian& Klaxian names.
And maybe a hint of what to expect from Raxxla....though not totally convinced by that. Are we clear whether The Dark Wheel ever found Raxxla or not?
