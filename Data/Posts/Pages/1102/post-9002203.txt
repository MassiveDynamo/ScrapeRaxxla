Cool. Just means it is pointless trying to do things as an individual independent pilot pretty much. As usual.
Nah, it's not pointless, it just means it's slower / more challenging to do as an individual pilot. If you want it to be more challenging, then that's a good thing.

If it's about trying to solve it as quickly as possible, then it's always going to be done most effectively by a collaborative effort. No real way around that.


Anyway, coming back to your previous questions, the LP message had one set of info extracted, but there was an open question as to whether there was more that could be extracted.

The Adamastor also has a date with the logs deleted prior to the date it arrived at the system with the LP. That's not yet been properly accounted for. There's a few other things here and there which were still open to debate as well, which I don't think ever got fully resolved or confirmed.
