So, question for Simulcrae or anyone poking around Adamastor or Hesperus. Anyone know what the jump range of a Lowell Class Science Vessel is? 500LY?

Also, does anyone know if the Synufe listening post has actually been decoded yet (assuming there is a message still there)? About to head out there.

I always find it very curious how quickly these things are found, currently at HIP 33386 retracing the route, and looking at how many unexplored Type K star systems are nearby that might have been that listening post, yet someone managed to find that specific one within a day or two. OK, sure, someone might have already had it mapped to be able to see the system information and number of planets very quickly (or perhaps used EDSM searches or the like although that feels too much like a word I probably can't use here for me). Ah well, maybe I will stumble across something leading to the Hesperus if I retrace the route before the all-seeing eyes of Canonn, CoR, and file-delvers do.
