I always try to approach conclusions logically.
Here's a comparison between the Dark Wheel and the engineers. That can never happen!
Why not?

I think our irony and sarcasm may have been lost in translation - I don't believe any of us think the Dark Wheel would be one or more engineers, just that it would be an easy and tacky thing for FD to do if they wanted a quick in-game appearance. [*sadly past performance in Elite Dangerous often is an indicator of future returns]
I wouldn't say I believe this but I certainly wouldn't rule it out whatsoever. Think about some of the engineers. We have a Jameson, a Ryder, Felicity Farseer. I would assume it's obvious that Liz Ryder is a member. I also wouldn't bat an eyelash to find out Lori Jameson was a member too and Farseer definitely knows something she isn't telling. Not to mention the rest. They are all essentially the best of the best at what they do.

But I think ruling something out completely without verifiable proof of the contrary is a very bad idea
