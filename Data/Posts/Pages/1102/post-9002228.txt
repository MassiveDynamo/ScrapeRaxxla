Just randomly found a useful snippet of info in my logs. Hopefully it means we can actually put that 'numbered stations' stuff to bed once and for all if it comes up again.

""event":"FSSSignalDiscovered", "SystemAddress":633742594786, "SignalName":"$NumberStation:#index=1;", "SignalName_Localised":"Unregistered Comms Beacon"

Edit - having posted that, I'm now going to bet that it's been posted before, and still hasn't stopped the ol' numbered stations stuff.
