I think our irony and sarcasm may have been lost in translation - I don't believe any of us think the Dark Wheel would be one or more engineers, just that it would be an easy and tacky thing for FD to do if they wanted a quick in-game appearance.

Error. There was no irony. I said that if there is such a thing as the Dark Wheel and Raxxla in the game, they will always be under different names!

For example, you found the Dark Wheel, what will happen tomorrow? And so for example Dark Wheel is for example Corporations Sirius (the main base 8 years from the Sun) you do their tasks you do not know that work for the Dark Wheel. This is clearly written about in the Codex in the article about the Dark Wheel.
