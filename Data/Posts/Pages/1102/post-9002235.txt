Nah, it's not pointless, it just means it's slower / more challenging to do as an individual pilot. If you want it to be more challenging, then that's a good thing.
And it also means that any mystery will almost always be spoiled somewhere along the line, and as an individual you will very rarely, if ever, be the first to successfully solve a mystery completely on your own (Although I suppose you can use your imagination to pretend you were the first to do it and you had not seen anything about it before, that fits with the FD design paradigms). Or turn yourself into a monk and sever all Internet and other contact with the outside world, but even then you will find it only after the Hive Mind(s) has(have). Of course then you won't be able to play the game because, right, no offline mode, I forgot.
