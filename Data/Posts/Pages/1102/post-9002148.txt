The alleged human-Thargoid base was the subject of the book Elite: And Here The Wheel by John Harper, supposed to be on Soontill and the real birthplace of Robert Garry , but the base was wiped out during the conclusion of that storyline leaving just a scar on the planetâ€™s surface which is shown in-game.
