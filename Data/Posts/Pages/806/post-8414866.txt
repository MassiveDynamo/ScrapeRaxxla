The spot on Soontill is specifically from the book

*spoiler alert *






it's from the circles secret base which gets destroyed.

Sorry, i forgot how to put the spoiler box in here


Edit: rumor has it that the soontill we know is a fake so we don't go looking for the real soontill. But im sure thats just a bunch of tin-foil talking
