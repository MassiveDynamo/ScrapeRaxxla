I think raising the TDW influence was also attempted by Ben Ryder a few years back (find him a few posts in on the first page of this thread), They attempted to do it in Shinrarta Dezhra, but were also 'shutdown' if I remember correctly.

Could be that Shinrarta Dezhra is locked to the Pilot's Federation and thus all attempts will fail here, but that does not explain LFT 926.

Remember that Shinrarta is owned not just by the Pilots' Federation, but the Elite Federation of Pilots. The Dark Wheel (and the Club for that matter) is just a small subset (clique) of the EFP.
