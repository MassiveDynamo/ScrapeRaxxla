I was driven by highway plotter back to barnard's loop and stuck there of coz, then jumped around a little ....and got a thought.
I met system full of tasty planets like terraform, not mapped close. But system 1st discovery is by some guy "backer nnnn". I think last time this one was visited 4-5 years ago before permit lock on that low - range ships. Now you need to do detour and nobody goes to that remote corner ... what if raxxla / dw station is there? In forgotten region.

For example, "hidden station" from codex. Could be a tip that we need to rescan systems already scanned/visited old ago by using new FSS.
