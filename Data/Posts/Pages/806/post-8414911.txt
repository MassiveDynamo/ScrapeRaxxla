The spot on Soontill is specifically from the book
it's from the circles secret base which gets destroyed.

Edit: rumor has it that the soontill we know is a fake so we don't go looking for the real soontill. But im sure thats just a bunch of tin-foil talking
i might give that book a read. it spiked my curiosity. i wana learn more about that base and soontill in general. thank you for recommending it.
