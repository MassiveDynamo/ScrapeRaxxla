A bit OT, but I would like to mention that Venus i currently at it's strongest.
It's about 50 times more luminous than any star and is clearly visible long before it's dark.
It has been bright all vinter and is at it' grandest now. Go out and have a look tonight.
Yeh, watched once it in telescope this year...even saw half of its disk. However weather is so bad lately, didn't use scope for 2-3 years already >:
Also, if you have dedicated camera with optical zoom, you can try to do Venus, Jupiter. 20x is enough to see their disks. For Jupiter you will see 4 main moons too.
If you have manual control over camera, you want maximum diafragma and minimum possible sensitivity to avoid noise. Also you need long shoot time, however doing over 30s will show Earth rotation (without tracking mount).
