That is shadows. Just found similar on random planet, when you come close to it - it is cracks in surface and star is like 60 degree behind, so it drops shadows which look like ore or plant from big distance.
no i dont think that specific spot on soontill 1 is shadows. it's a non landable planet after all. so it has no elevation in terrain.

it's a permanent and propably hand made visual feature on the planet, to indicate where the base once was. according to the lore, the base had to be destroyed to hide any remaining evidence of the weapon technology that was being developped there.-(something along those lines) and from looking at it, it does look like some huge explosion has happened there. it's quite a unique visual feature i think. i certainly have never seen any similar feature on a planet elsewhere.
