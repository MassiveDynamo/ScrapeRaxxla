greetings commanders o7
i was doing some exploration around soontill and found an interresting looking beacon mentioning the prescence of a secret base on planet soontill 1.
SPOILER: SECRET BASE

also, if you get closer to the surface and from the right angle, you can see a strange spot on this otherwise quite blend, flat and uniform planet.
SPOILER: STRANGE SPOT
not sure if this is related to raxxla (or more likely the dark wheel), or not. but it sure did peak my curiosity.
upon further investigation, it seems that this secret base was mentioned in 's book : Elite : And here the wheel. does anyone know about this? might be something already investigated in this thread before, in wich case my apologies for bringing it up again. anything that has "secret" in it, immediatly makes me think of the dark wheel. lol

here's an interresting link to an elite fandom page that goes over soontill. for those unfamiliar with it. :
lots of mentions of '' and '' around soontill in that page.

That is shadows. Just found similar on random planet, when you come close to it - it is cracks in surface and star is like 60 degree behind, so it drops shadows which look like ore or plant from big distance.
