I’ve been on holliday for a few weeks now. Stuck on a forrest moon, among moose, wolves and things that fly and bite.
My ship is still out there, on the line. The line is steep on the disk, so stars thin out.
Haven’t tested flying the line in Sol yet. It’s on the list.

Sounds like fun … well except for the flies.. say hi to the Ewoks for me

Ya i was still liking it in relation to the toast… the old worlds being the core of galaxy 1 they literally were the mother of the other “galaxies” … what would be the jewel?…Tionisla? and then the parents grief etc… Turner & Argent? I dont think anyone has found Turners ship….
