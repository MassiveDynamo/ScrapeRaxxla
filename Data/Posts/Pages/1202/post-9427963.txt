Any luck with the leet line? I thought that was awesome!
I’ve been on holliday for a few weeks now. Stuck on a forrest moon, among moose, wolves and things that fly and bite.
My ship is still out there, on the line. The line is steep on the disk, so stars thin out.
Haven’t tested flying the line in Sol yet. It’s on the list.
