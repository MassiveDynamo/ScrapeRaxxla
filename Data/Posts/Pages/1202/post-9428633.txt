I like sol as a starting point… which is why i like the leet line pointing at the old worlds of galaxy 1. But i think the jewel in this case would need be closer or part of the old worlds to be on the “brow”

Ya the parents grief lovers woe always gives me grief…. Was spitballing that it had to do with Mic Turner/merideth argent… possible wreaked ship was Turners Quest? Ya i still havent fully read premonition … skimmed through it a couple times…. Must have missed that

Ya going stir crazy in the galactic core.
Think the wreck was called Escape Velocity?
