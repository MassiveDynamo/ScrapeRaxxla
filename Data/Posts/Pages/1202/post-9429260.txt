I think Raxxla is in the game but is locked. Lave 2, Diso 5, may have something to do with it. If you think about it from Frontier point of view, if Raxxla is to be found, that would mean GAME OVER. Until they will figure something else to replace Raxxla with (at least something near of importance), Raxxla will remain locked. I think all new events, Salvation and Far God may be something that will lead to another MAIN GOAL. Perhaps a Thargoid ship we will be able to obtain.
