What Iâ€™d like to know is whether anyone has sold all Dynasty Plot data to TDW in SD?
I believe I have, but wouldn't swear to it. I have been to all three Project Dynasty sites as well as the Zurara and am based out of Jameson....so it would stand to reason that upon returning, I would have sold the data there. But even if I had, I wouldn't have sold it to TDW as they don't own Jameson. TPF does, right? So maybe selling it to the land base might trigger something? Although, I have to wonder what, if any, connection Project Dynasty has to the TDW and why they (TDW) would want data regarding it.
