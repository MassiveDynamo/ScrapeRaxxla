Been thinkin' about that. Wasn't Raxxla supposed to be in a non-permit system? Kinda throws a wrench in my theory too, but...
Nope, all we know is it’s in the Milky Way (Michael Brookes) and it’s a definite place (Codex) and we don’t know what it is (David Braben). Nothing about a permit or otherwise.
