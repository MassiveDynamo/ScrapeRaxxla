So…

it’s been a while since Raxxla was confirmed as being in the milky way etc…

What’s the worst theory you’ve heard? (Personal opinion and should not matter who said it as they are all equally valid as we don’t know what we’re looking for!)

What’s the best/most probable theory in your opinion?

and finally….

What theory have you spent the most time on and why did you abandon it? (if you have!)

looking forward to Jorki’s answers

Hmmm worst theory? any theory that involves the 7ly jump range argument - usually i also dislike the ones that require systematic surveys.... I feel there should be a path that is followable to a reasonable location... of course I also think that reasonable game mechanics would include not having to constantly relog at a site to get enough of xyz to appease an engineer for some small upgrade... So ya I have little faith in a reasonable path at this point.

That said i am currently doing a haphazard survey (i refuse to be systematic) in the galactic core hoping there is something at the center... so ya

I just keep working my way around the clues we have... Silent Song of the Spheres, The Symbol, The Toast, Princess Astrophel story, The Omphalos Rift, etc.... When i get bored pulling at one string ... I move back to an old one and pick it up again... I guess my favorite would be the Toast because I think it is supposed to lead us to the Dark Wheel Station... which i keep holding out hope is the stepping stone to raxxla...
