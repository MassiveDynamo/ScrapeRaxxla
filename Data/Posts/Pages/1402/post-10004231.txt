Andor has its moments, yet a little dragged out, thankfully no space wizards with toaster knives. Dune was so-so, I’m actually more aligned with the Lynch version actually.

‘1899 / Dark’ were good, yet predictable. ‘Exception’ was rather imaginative… age and dotage does make us difficult to appease due to experience filters…

Didn’t someone propose a fan-film of Elite during the kickstarter (back on track)?
