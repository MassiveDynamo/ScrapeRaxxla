What if they really are clue from each section of the saying but you have to say be at the location spoken of in the first section to even see in the sky what they are talking about.
Interesting you mentioned that because there is a game mechanic for that to work. In GalMap, there is an option to display constellation lines. It is a function that really only works in the core of the Bubble (~100 LY max from Sol). The big constellations are also part of the Frameshift Suite music for the game.



If you don't have the game's soundtrack, it is amazing and well worth the listen - playlist on YouTube is here: Elite Dangerous OST playlist.
