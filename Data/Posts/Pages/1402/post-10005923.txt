Could it not also be the 6 clues in the toast. If you read it as it is punctuated.
1, To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
2, To the whisperer in witch-space
3, the siren of the deepest void!
4, The parent's grief,
5, the lover's woe
6, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts

I have long though that the toast was a map - a waypoint counter if you liked linked to the logo,
It was a path to create something in the centre - "To Raxxla!"

I guess like the address on a Stargate!!

Each phrase relates to a system, each system leads to the next and so on, this was a way to get to Raxxla or to trigger contact from the game / Dark Wheel.

But which systems.... I have tried many and got nothing, its difficult when you dont even know your on the right track.

Yes the 6 locations idea is another one, I’ve edited my post, that one’s an old / on one but potentially still relevant, we simply don’t know do we.
