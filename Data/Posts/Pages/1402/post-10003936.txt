Maybe that has to be shoved into the Omphalos at Delphi?

Anyhows back to some science... Seeing as Omphalos is just the centre of 2 different bodies or the naval point in some regards, it may take some calculating to figure out what the true Baricentre is of the Delphi system at any given moment. To be able to visit the location to shove it into yourd need to know which systems are even viable, imagine trying to dump something into the Roche Lobe exchange point between two bodies!
