Yes such a shame they never did Sci-fi…that too may had been relevant, sometimes it feels like a farce.

Ah yes, when screenwriters and producers had an inkling about entertainment value and originality. Carry On was of its time, sadly long gone. I’m afraid I’m turning into a grumpy old man (no dammit! I’m there already! )

I find most stuff on TV and films nowadays to be so trite I can only stand to watch 5 or 10 minutes. Most of it seems to be just endless boring repetition of an initially promising theme. Particularly Marvel, but also recent scifi. I had hopes for Endor, but 10minutes was sufficient.

I’m just hoping they don't spoil the next instalment of Guardians of the Galaxy..but Dune was a good remake (though should have had the explanatory commentary/introduction that the previous version had).
