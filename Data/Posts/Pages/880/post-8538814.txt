Hi again Roen. I love your perspective on these matters. Not celebrating Summer Solstice early I hope not? I'm personally in strong belief the Dynasty project was intended to locate Thargoids after the unfortunate mycoid incident, and guide them back into the bubble using Thargoid probes and artifacts. Thargoids cannot figure out astronomy without them. Perhaps Raxxla can only be found using Thargoid astronomy, not ours.
