I would argue that Guardian AI has been around longer is more advanced and has probably subsumed any rouge human AI out there. They dont need artificial shells... they just take over human ones. Like they did Halsey... And any one who believes there is such a thing as "fluff" is probably a good candidate for AI takeover... Are they in the Forum?... Frontier???
Agreed on many points, but I would say that the info we have taken in totality points towards the Guardian descendants being as a result of AI/Bio hybridisation.

And personally I don’t think subsumption of the rogue human AI would really fit with what the hints at their ethos. It’s not a very caretakery thing to do. It’s interesting to consider what other approaches might have been taken.
