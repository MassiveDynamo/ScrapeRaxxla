Those who survived the Zurara incident flew back to the bubble and named a system Kwatsu. Which is HEXEDIT to Raxxla. -- Now this is not Raxxla, but a clear hint that Zurara which was a megaship to colonize area had encoutered something so secret that the entrire crew and all the human "setlements" were systematically destroyed.... By this feature.

Thargoids were a threat to humanity, which started the mission of Zurara... But it did not quite end up as planned, because they hit another problem in the target area...
