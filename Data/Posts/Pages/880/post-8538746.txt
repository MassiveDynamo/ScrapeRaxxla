Why name the system so that it would point out the location. The lore of Raxxla coriolis space station moves to a new location when ever the system is consumed. Their lives depend on moving around. Besides, they are not happy to be found. - I do know this, Raxxla is there under the fog of old war. - They do not like us to be in their territory. So why not go there into their territory so massively that they must come out. They will protest.

The lore tells that Raxxlans did attack a megaship which entered their territory. - As I see this the only ship that is in strange place is Zurara.
Zurara itself was a mission to find a new place for humanity away from Thargoids, but they found something else. Henge the name Zurara points out to that direction.
HEXEDIT killed the crew, because they saw something else that was hidden, and still remains so. - We found the jungle but did not dig enough to find the fallen empire.
