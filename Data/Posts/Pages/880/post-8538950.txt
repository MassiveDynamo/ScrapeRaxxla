So to those who says the Raxxla is not in the "exe" file, are correct. The sector 9 is a memory tweak which clears Sector 1 and renames the systems of Sector 1. The gateway system will appear next to Tionisla when Ben Ryder gives you the "path" to get there. You will fly around Lave clockwise to unlock the hidden system... Well... No more spoilers from me...

I can not confirm the location in Elite Dangerous, since ED continues from position way after the battle... In ED time has gone far forward and if I remember correctly.
Raxxla is not a stationary station... It relocates when system is consumed...

PS: I will die due to cancer soon, and I can not help you further... This is my final... I will take the secret to grave and as for fun you can replicate it.
