Why name the system so that it would point out the location. The lore of Raxxla coriolis space station moves to a new location when ever the system is consumed. Their lives depend on moving around. Besides, they are not happy to be found. - I do know this, Raxxla is there under the fog of old war. - They do not like us to be in their territory. So why not go there into their territory so massively that they must come out. They will protest.
