For those who want some hints how to mess around with Amiga version...

If your playing old Elite with PC...
With a program called PC-tools you can edit memory with hex39 to get the money...

And for those who has MSX version of Elite...
During count down press keys in order.. H 5 F targetsystem ..
Replace target system with the system you want to jump to...

Have fun.
