I suspect Comms Array Delta 69 is just fluff hinting at Rogue AI (human), but the gravitational anomaly is intriguing. Hadn’t associated it with Raxxla, but thought Thargoid ship-anti-gravity drive would presumably produce a gravitational anomaly. Perhaps they have produced human-looking AI fifth column infiltrators ready for the coming war and wanted to see if it would pass inspection??

Oh, it ain’t the Thargoids. Ah’ve seen what the Tharg hypaspace tech does to a man, and boyy it ain’t purty. Don’t nobody want to see that kind a thing. Stays with ya forever. Trust me, I ain’t lion.
