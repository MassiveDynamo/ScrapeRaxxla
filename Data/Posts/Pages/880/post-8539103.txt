Agreed on many points, but I would say that the info we have taken in totality points towards the Guardian descendants being as a result of AI/Bio hybridisation.

And personally I don’t think subsumption of the rogue human AI would really fit with what the hints at their ethos. It’s not a very caretakery thing to do. It’s interesting to consider what other approaches might have been taken.

I guess i put the thargoids to more biotech with the guardians more of a crystal-tech... if such a thing can be. I kind of assumed that the AI like the rest of the guardian tech relied on that ... atleast in the beginning. Maybe evolving from resonnances in data crystals to something more like a living signal.... I also think the caretaker idea is of a more sinister variety... lets not forget that the Guardians themselves were purged in a form of genocide by their own AI... these wonderful caretakers.
