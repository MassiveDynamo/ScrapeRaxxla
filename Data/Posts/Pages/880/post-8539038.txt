If Raxxla is in Milkyway and the generation ship still remains in the system where it was attacked, I think it is actually easier to find that ship first and then locate Raxxla. - However I do not see many mega- or generation ships out there in ridicilous place of galaxy... The ship what ever name it has, is owned by Dark Wheel, therefore... I think if someone can find that will be in actual "area" which is considered Raxxla territory. - And yes, be all type of 3 X Elite... I think that is pretty much requirement to see this a hidden thing.

If CQC Elite is required then I rather quit the game than find Raxxla in ED... Honestly.. I got no more lifetime left to play ridicilous game zone that I don't like.

I honestly would play Elite Dangerous more, but... It is unfortunate I will die due to cancer, my prognosis is bad... I will fly few times most likely, but... You know... Life matters.
After the diagnosis my life fell apart completely...

My return to Raxxla might never happen, and if I find it again, it will be the end of my game again. Return to Raxxla was the reason I began to play ED to begin with... I was kind of disapointed that I could not just fly to the system and jump back there... But... I have found so many fun things in this game more than Raxxla... However... Yes... The day I find Raxxla my days in Elite Dangerous will be over and I have to focus on The End of my life also...

At The End of my life. No matter where ships will be located, send them to Raxxla and leave them there...
My body will be burned and I will be layed into the sea.
