Generation Ship Epimetheus log mention a whisper and a siren, Pleione logs are about only having male children (parents grief?), Atlas logs talk about a man having to stay behind while his partner leaves in an escape pod(lovers woe?). any thoughts?
Very simple idea. Bookmark all generation ships, look for any visual patterns in galmap, in relation to each other, not Sol. Something out of the ordinary, odd, voids or 'hexagons' anyone had a crack at this that yet?

Seems simple but many things are sometimes (currently away from game).
