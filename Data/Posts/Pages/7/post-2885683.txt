Hello Commanders, I'm sharing this with you in the case you missed it: http://www.drewwagar.com/progress-report/raxxla-the-definitive-guide/

From the wording chosen by Drew I'd bet that he doesn't know the location, only DB.

Then I have an idea, if you remove all filters from the map, you can see some "bright spots": maybe one of those "bright spots" include a very special system?
On the other hand, it could be in a zone with a very difficult access, such as out of the plane of the galaxy, with sparse systems. Which one would be the most probable choice by FD, knowing that "there will be no clues"?

Thanks for sharing, Cmdr. It wasn't missed
I've been wondering about the Raxxla location statement; I find it very curious, if the Great Galactic Father wouldn't know, then who would?
