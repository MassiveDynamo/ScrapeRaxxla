if this Roxxal theory isnt a hoax, ild suggest talk to red wizard about the UA and try to port it in witch space

Hi Cmdr, thanks for your input. The existence of Raxxla seems to have been confirmed, so no hoax.
I believe that the UA's has spent a great deal of time in witchspace transported by a large number of Cmdr's. An UA has even been transported to Sgr A* which in itself involves a lot of time in witchspace.
