Hi Cmdr, thanks for your input. The existence of Raxxla seems to have been confirmed, so no hoax.
I believe that the UA's has spent a great deal of time in witchspace transported by a large number of Cmdr's. An UA has even been transported to Sgr A* which in itself involves a lot of time in witchspace.

theirs a good chance that nobodys tired anything in witch space because they have ne clue about roxxal
