Thanks for sharing, Cmdr. It wasn't missed
I've been wondering about the Raxxla location statement; I find it very curious, if the Great Galactic Father wouldn't know, then who would?

This comes from July 8th 2014, where I met DB in person at the BAFTA awards. My write up of the meeting is here if you're interested. http://www.drewwagar.com/progress-report/the-day-i-met-david-braben/

I managed to chat to him afterwards in the bar. We were talking about the myths and mythos that had grown up around the game and how impactful the game had been open people of the generation that played the original game back in 1984/85.

The subject of alien races came up and, as a writer, he reminded me of an 'Alien background doc' given to the writers as research material. I do have this, but I'm not allowed (due to NDA) to publish it. Raxxla is part of that. None of the writers were allowed to explore Raxxla, it was very much reserved for 'in-house' development (not surprisingly!).

Then DB came out with his statement. I was a little surprise at what he said, but it was in a public space and others overheard it too.

Raxxla definitely exists in ED.

Cheers,

Drew.
