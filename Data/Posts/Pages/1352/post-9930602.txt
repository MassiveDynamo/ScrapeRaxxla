Well, it’s a bit of a logical jump to say no rank or permit, because anyone could get these. I got triple elite, King and Admiral on the basis they might be required for MB’s supposed “Raxxla storyline”, but they don't seem to have helped!

No I dont read it as multiple Raxxla sites, just one that you can repeatably find.

The codex hints at an Omphalos Rift as a gateway to Raxxla. The omphalos stone was used by Greek god Zeus to mark the centre (“navel”) of the world at Delphi in Greece. Some players have looked in Delphi system out by the Pleiades...to anyone who did so did you check there for comets?
I don't read the codex as the Omphalos rift leading to Raxxla.
Combining the codex and the original quotes from Rafe Zetter, I would guess that Raxxla is an astronomic body of some kind. The alien construct on it, is probably the Omphalos rift.

Descriptions of gateway
From TDW: "on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes"
From codex: "the Omphalos Rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed"

Descriptions of Raxxla:
From TDW: "It's a ghost world. A planet. A legend"
From codex: "Raxxla is a definite place, and that it holds a mystical secret"
