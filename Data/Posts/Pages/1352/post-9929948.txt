I get that moch of Salomé's plot was a red herring in one way but the 'finale' of the plot was completely 180° turn-around. This to me is something I want to investigate moreso om the TDW side as I feel it was a coverup turning it into a 'contest'.

Once I get out there I will have a few things I will follow up on but having trinkets for the trip is essential - not having luck finding on console. So this may postpome the trip until I'm on pc.
