I don't read the codex as the Omphalos rift leading to Raxxla.
Combining the codex and the original quotes from Rafe Zetter, I would guess that Raxxla is an astronomic body of some kind. The alien construct on it, is probably the Omphalos rift.

Descriptions of gateway
From TDW: "on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes"
From codex: "the Omphalos Rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed"

Descriptions of Raxxla:
From TDW: "It's a ghost world. A planet. A legend"
From codex: "Raxxla is a definite place, and that it holds a mystical secret"

Depends on how much the implementation follow that original novella. I can see that DB and MB might want to follow it, but with all the retconning......
