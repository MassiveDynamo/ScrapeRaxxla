People reports seeing it travelling past a system (Oorchsomething), so it's likely a flying object. It's shape increase for an standstill observer positioned on its route. But it is a 2D bitmap in the sky, so there's not a lot we can accurately deduce from what we see. Canonn "science" estimates the visible size at about 2UA, but it's likely a dramatic effect for scenario purpose. Whatever it is, it will surely be much smaller.
Unless it is not a flying object but a plasma projectile that will vaporise some planet/system in an upcoming cutscene
I would not expect realism on this one.. I wish Elite stayed on the side of "hard-science fantasy" but marketing might think otherwise.
