Ive tried to find the location, a long time ago, as I thought this was “ TDW hidden station”, but Im no good at matching star patterns.
There does seem to be something hidden behind the dodecahedral station!

Edit: but didnt notice that on my original posts of the menu start screens. Will check on gaming pc when lunch digested.
