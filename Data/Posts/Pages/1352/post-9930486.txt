I don't think Raxxla is a system, but something within a system : (DB) “You don’t know what it is”
So it is an "unknown to player" object. Something on a planet? Something orbiting a star (many players do not check their left panel when they hear "system discovery completed" when they jump in planet less system) ?
(MB) “Anyone can find it, and more than once” => So there's no need for rank, or special permit or anything. It is also something that can't be tagged as "discovered" apparently. Find it more than once.. ? There's multiple Raxxla sites? More likely, it refer to something repeatable, an action? So it could well be a door to somewhere new => find again, repeat the action... ?
