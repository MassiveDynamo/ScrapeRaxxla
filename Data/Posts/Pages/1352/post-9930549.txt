if it is a portal and not anything at all like I first thought, then a few other thoughts move around
and from what I saw flying to all the systems I could, to see from various angles, I saw the type of movement of a star many mil LS away.
change of my speed affected its appearance of size.
If you could measure the movement of any body in that system from outside, I think that is what is being seen. and everything is moving, so...

and a portal makes more sense than anything else I said.
it could still be something entirely different. something a Doctor might do.
