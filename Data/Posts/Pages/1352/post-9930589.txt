, because anyone could get these
Well, I'm not so sure. Anyone can get these requirements or levels, but if those levels are needed then not anyone can find Raxxla, only those who full-fill the requirements.
I doubt he would have phrased it like this if levels were involved. More like "Anyone can work his way to Raxxla" or "Anyone can achieve what's needed to.." etc..
Not that it matter a lot anyway

mark the centre (“navel”) of the world at Delphi
We could be looking for some kind of spiritual center.. One of the religious congregation holds missions & clues maybe?
