Well, it’s a bit of a logical jump to say no rank or permit, because anyone could get these. I got triple elite, King and Admiral on the basis they might be required for MB’s supposed “Raxxla storyline”, but they don't seem to have helped!

No I dont read it as multiple Raxxla sites, just one that you can repeatably find.

The codex hints at an Omphalos Rift as a gateway to Raxxla. The omphalos stone was used by Greek god Zeus to mark the centre (“navel”) of the world at Delphi in Greece. Some players have looked in Delphi system out by the Pleiades...to anyone who did so did you check there for comets?
Oh, which reminds me of a previous hypothesis:
Omphalos is an artefact with a funnel-shaped hole in the centre. Astrophel ("star lover") and Stella ("star") are mentioned almost in the same breath in the codex, so what loves stars & has a funnel-shaped hole- a Black Hole!

So we could be looking for a BH with special properties!
But Ive dived a few and that gets pretty boring!!
edit:almost as boring as searching for comets!!
