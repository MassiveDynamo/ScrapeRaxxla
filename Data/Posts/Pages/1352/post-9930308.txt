In regards to the Thargods arrival.

Not in game at present so cannot check myself but - If the object moves which it is perceived to do so, has its shape increased as it moves forward relative to the viewer or does it just look bigger from all angles?

Has anyone traveled to where it has been or attempted to view it from another angle, to identify that shape has reduced?

If the shape is relatively the same size in multiple directions wouldnâ€™t that indicate it is an explosive event rather than some huge object moving?

Is it possible the perception of movement is just poor animation on FD part and what is being seen is just an explosive event?
