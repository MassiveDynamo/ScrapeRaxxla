I get that moch of Salomé's plot was a red herring in one way but the 'finale' of the plot was completely 180° turn-around. This to me is something I want to investigate moreso om the TDW side as I feel it was a coverup turning it into a 'contest'.

Once I get out there I will have a few things I will follow up on but having trinkets for the trip is essential - not having luck finding on console. So this may postpome the trip until I'm on pc.
if it helps any
I get some trinkets every time I try
I am mostly hatchbreaking small ships and cobra's have been my biggest supplier of cool stuff.
I do it 2-4 km in front of the entrance to an anarchy coriolis station. being allied they don't shoot me unless I hatchbreak a ship that belongs to them.
for anarchy stations not allied with, outposts weapons are softer...the big stations will treat you the same as if allied until one of the ships you target starts shooting..not worth the effort
point here is its sooo much easier to remain alive if you are allied.

feel free to come see my carrier if you can't get any trinkets.
message me so I can change its status..
