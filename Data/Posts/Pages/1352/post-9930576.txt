I don't think Raxxla is a system, but something within a system : (DB) “You don’t know what it is”
So it is an "unknown to player" object. Something on a planet? Something orbiting a star (many players do not check their left panel when they hear "system discovery completed" when they jump in planet less system) ?
(MB) “Anyone can find it, and more than once” => So there's no need for rank, or special permit or anything. It is also something that can't be tagged as "discovered" apparently. Find it more than once.. ? There's multiple Raxxla sites? More likely, it refer to something repeatable, an action? So it could well be a door to somewhere new => find again, repeat the action... ?
Well, it’s a bit of a logical jump to say no rank or permit, because anyone could get these. I got triple elite, King and Admiral on the basis they might be required for MB’s supposed “Raxxla storyline”, but they don't seem to have helped!

No I dont read it as multiple Raxxla sites, just one that you can repeatably find.

The codex hints at an Omphalos Rift as a gateway to Raxxla. The omphalos stone was used by Greek god Zeus to mark the centre (“navel”) of the world at Delphi in Greece. Some players have looked in Delphi system out by the Pleiades...to anyone who did so did you check there for comets?
