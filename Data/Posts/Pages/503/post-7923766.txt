Sucks in air through teeth.....I know I'm in the minority, but I'm the other way around. Conda a nice general purpose ship, but for serious exploration, I like my ASP. My Conda flies like a brick and is almost impossible to park near anything interesting. Only thing lacking with ASP is jump range, and I have mine up to almost 70ly now
I started out in an AspX before working my way up to a Conda which I had for a long long time. Then I upgraded to a DBX!
