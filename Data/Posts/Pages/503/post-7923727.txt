Don't fool yourself, my dear and cute little migratory bird ! Old school Mark I Eyeball and parallax detection are hardcore masochism ! Imho !

Well parallax detection is how I'm currently exploring, though occasionally I'll cheat and use the FSS to figure out where I've missed something. It's actually a lot of fun, if you're not in a hurry. I'm not sure I'd take an ADS even if it came back

Incidentally, I stumbled across one of your systems yesterday, 700+ below the galactic plane and 5,000 out from Sol, in Triangulis Australis.
