Yes. I think too that E/F missions were tightly tied to MB conducting the story line. Now, that language pointed mostly to the nature of Raxxla. Any reason for it to have been changed ?
Who can say...I'm more saying that I think that using the language of those missions as any sort of data point to inform the search might be unneccesarily constricting.

CMDR Boffo Bagsquat: "Nah, mate, can't be there, that's not obfuscated in the outer rim."
