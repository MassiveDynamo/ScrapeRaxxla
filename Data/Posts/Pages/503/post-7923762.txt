Well said. It mirrors something I said a few pages back.

In my humble opinion, the Raxxla ship has sailed, FDev abandoned the questline to work on more "mainstream" gameplay when the playerbase decreased, and the entries in the codex are not new hints for the search but just concrete proof that Raxxla has been shelved as "lore". The codex mentions that people continue to search for it, they gave us a shout out, but aside from that it's all just flavor text. The only thing I see between the lines in the codex is "Raxxla is just lore, please stop looking for it".
I enjoy the search, it allows me to do some exploration when I usually had no patience for it, and distracts me from the fact that I have exhausted nearly ever other feature the game offers. But, I stand by what I said. The end to the hunt for Raxxla came when they added the references in the codex. That codex entry establishes it as lore, or flavour text. There's nothing practical to Raxxla, yet, but it would still be an achievement to find the unfinished path to Raxxla, whether it dead ends in a permit locked region or not. Aside from col 70, I like to imagine it's wrapped up safely in the Horse Head Nebula.
