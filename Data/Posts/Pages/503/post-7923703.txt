I mean, sometimes, when exploring you need the max possible jumprange.

Max possible is a fully gutted DBX. Mine has 74ly with a full 16 tons of fuel and no shield. I find flying my anaconda is like driving on the freeway looking through a letter slot. Plus, then I can call it hardcore exploration when neutron boosting like a paper mache toy boat in a bathtub.

Like... WOW. The Gorgon Research Facility is amazing!! This station wasn't here the last time I was and I have never seen anything like this. Thanks for the heads up Commander. I'm docked there now in open. a few Commanders about.

I don't think I've ever seen a station within a ring before, I missed the mark thinking I was approaching from the wrong side and took the scenic route for the last 150km. Here some eyecandy of that (the big rock is the station)
