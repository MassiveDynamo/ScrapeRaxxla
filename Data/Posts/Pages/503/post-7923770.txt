Right. My trusty and beloved AspX tagged 99.9% of all my tags across the whole MW. The rest, was my 83 Ly on fumes jumprange CondaX. Where only her among my fleet could reach. That's why I said "hardcore" Explo.
Guys, chill aspx and conda are both trash for explo. That's why my boy Gan rode off in a DBX.
