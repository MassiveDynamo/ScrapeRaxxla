While I'm in here, let me just throw this out, as well.....I think it's time we abandon the "obfuscated in the outer rim" and "a place that isn't a place, a door that is also a key" rhetoric or whatever the language was from the original missions being offered from Jameson Memorial.

And here's why....

I strongly feel that these were Michael Brook's additions into the game and were his way of feeding the community clues of some sort....or, failing that, they were just flavor text missions that hinted at and honored the lore of Raxxla. Either way, with his departure from the project, I think those missions dried up because someone around the table said "Hey, we're going to add in Raxxla stuffs when we drop the Codex later on, so let's just 86 the missions at Jameson." And that's that. All of this effort by FDev on the "new player experience" recently....it's clear that they are looking at bringing in new CMDR's and as such, these new CMDR's would have zero way of knowing about those old missions. So I think that if we are holding on to that language as a divining rod of some sort, I think we are maybe, needlessly, restricting ourselves.

Of course, your mileage may vary.

Fly aimless, CMDR's.
