On that note, regarding Allen Stroud response to Jaiotu, there is a Leo Faulcon that is a main character in his book "Where Time Winds Blow". It is about a planet with temporal anomalies. The planet and star are referenced in other books with references to Altuxor and Kamelios. It is even on the map of Galactic Cooperative in Tour of the Universe.

The problem is in locating the damned thing following name changes. I have found Hyperion, Aurora, Tau Ceti, Sol, Sirius, and a number of others. That said, there is no context for how big an area is shown. I suspect it covers quite a large region.

Info on book with Leo Faulcon:

Are Sirius, Tau Ceti, Reunion, Kameleos, Lynx III, Phoenix, Agara, & Hyperiona all in game ? They kinda look like a wheel. Just saying.

Side ramble
Alpha Centauri, PSPF-LF 2, & SPF-LF 1 have always been suspect to me , for various reasons. the later two because of the system descriptions. and the only video on Mr Brabens youtube acount , is a video of an RC cobra flying around.

Alpha Cantauri because its withing 3 parsec from sol , and thats the distance in the the book for the location of Primespot.

More ramble... the journey everyone has to make . I thought it was sag-a , then sol because you have to go 'home' sometime. but now I think its going to jail, at the The Pillar of Fortitude , because your not flying dangerously enough , unless you end up in the slammer. also in spf 1
