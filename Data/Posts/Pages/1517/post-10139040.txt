I’ve just added this to my FDev quotes thread.

Beyond - Chapter Four - Exploration Reveal18Oct2018 Will Flanagan (CM) with Adam Woods (Exec Producer) & Adam Bourke-Waite (Senior Designer). @1:29:58 AB-W said “that thing we haven’t shown” (Raxxla codex entry) “there’s elements of that that are probably my favourite parts of this”.



Always trusted A B-W. I think when he as Senior Designer comments that the implementation of the mystery are one of his favourite things, then the clear implications are:
1) it in-game
2) it will be a find
3) knowledge of the mystery is limited within FD just to DB and MB.

Which perhaps lends weight to some other things.

You found it then! I was going through the beyond vids but hadn't got to that one...

Interesting.... AB-W said “that thing we haven’t shown” (Raxxla codex entry) “there’s elements of that that are probably my favourite parts of this”.... So he's suggesting there was something in that release specifically for Raxxla as I don't think he's referring to the codex entry itself...

Quite a lot in that release in terms of new functionality... I wonder which bits might be used in those elements that were his favourites?
