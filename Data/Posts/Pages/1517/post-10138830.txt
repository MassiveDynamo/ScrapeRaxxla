How true 07

Equally this is what frustrates me sometimes. The codex is obviously giving us some confirmative information, but where, why, what! There exists so much yet unknown and we’re forced to speculate.

But maybe all along that could just be the point of the codex. Confirmation it’s in game.
Yes. Apparently DB wasn't too keen (didn’t note the reference for that) on the Holdstock novella, so I suspect this is the replacement for it.

He wont give us too much information on it outside that codex entry...
