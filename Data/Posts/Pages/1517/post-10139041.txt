On that note, regarding Allen Stroud response to Jaiotu, there is a Leo Faulcon that is a main character in his book "Where Time Winds Blow". It is about a planet with temporal anomalies. The planet and star are referenced in other books with references to Altuxor and Kamelios. It is even on the map of Galactic Cooperative in Tour of the Universe.




The problem is in locating the damned thing following name changes. I have found Hyperion, Aurora, Tau Ceti, Sol, Sirius, and a number of others. That said, there is no context for how big an area is shown. I suspect it covers quite a large region.
