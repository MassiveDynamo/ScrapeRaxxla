And let’s ask, what new information did the codex potentially provide, and how can it be relevant to the content patched?

“2296, from the journal of Art Tornqvist, a shipboard mechanic based in the Tau Ceti system. He writes: 'Cora comes home soused and raving with wild stories, a new one every night. She claims she's found a map to some pirate stash, and all I have to do is loan her my ship so we can go dig it up”.

“Much like the ancient myths of Atlantis, El Dorado and the kingdom of Prester John”.

“an alien artefact, the Omphalos Rift”.

“children's story Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars”

There’s a lot of locational information in there, which we’ve speculated upon already. Maybe that’s intentional, maybe it’s not maybe that’s projection on our part? But that was the first time they linked Raxxla with a ship board mechanic - an engineer!

Then there were new Scenario Missions, I wouldn’t presume these hold Raxxla but what if they held textual references (long stretch) which gave out more environmental storytelling?
