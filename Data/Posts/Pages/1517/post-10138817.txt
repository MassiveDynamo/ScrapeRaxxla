I’ve just added this to my FDev quotes thread.

Beyond - Chapter Four - Exploration Reveal18Oct2018 Will Flanagan (CM) with Adam Woods (Exec Producer) & Adam Bourke-Waite (Senior Designer). @1:29:58 AB-W said “that thing we haven’t shown” (Raxxla codex entry) “there’s elements of that that are probably my favourite parts of this”.

Always trusted A B-W. I think when he as Senior Designer comments that the implementation of the mystery are one of his favourite things, then the clear implications are:
1) it is in-game
2) it will be a cool find
3) knowledge of the mystery is not limited within FD just to DB and MB.

Which perhaps lends weight to some other things.
