Yes. Apparently DB wasn't too keen (didn’t note the reference for that) on the Holdstock novella, so I suspect this is the replacement for it.

He wont give us too much information on it outside that codex entry...
Yes, do recall Stroud saying as much in this thread as well, that Holdstock was very much a Brookes thang, not Braben’s. I could easily imagine the Codex usurped any historical work undertaken by Brookes albeit repurposed!
