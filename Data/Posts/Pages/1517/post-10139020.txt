Citation?

I am citing this just to make the point this comes across as wishful thinking (but why someone would wish it quite frankly leaves me deeply confused).
Devils advocate!

Post in thread 'The Quest To Find Raxxla'

Post in thread 'I've found Faulcon from Faulcon deLacy.'

As much as conjecture than anything else. I’m simply assuming it was implied that any Holdstock reference was constructed more so by Brookes than Braben, simply speculating.

Plus since Brookes left, and the DW missions were shelved, and there was a significant gap between then and the codex, it’s not outside the realms of possibility that anything already penned - if relevant, could have been totally usurped!? Although I doubt that.
