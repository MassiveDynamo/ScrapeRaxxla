I’ve just added this to my FDev quotes thread.

Beyond - Chapter Four - Exploration Reveal18Oct2018 Will Flanagan (CM) with Adam Woods (Exec Producer) & Adam Bourke-Waite (Senior Designer). @1:29:58 AB-W said “that thing we haven’t shown” (Raxxla codex entry) “there’s elements of that that are probably my favourite parts of this”.



Always trusted A B-W. I think when he as Senior Designer comments that the implementation of the mystery are one of his favourite things, then the clear implications are:
1) it in-game
2) it will be a find
3) knowledge of the mystery is limited within FD just to DB and MB.

Which perhaps lends weight to some other things.

How true 07

Equally this is what frustrates me sometimes. The codex is obviously giving us some confirmative information, but where, why, what! There exists so much yet unknown and we’re forced to speculate.

But maybe all along that could just be the point of the codex. Confirmation it’s in game. Having such positive reminders now and again is very encouraging thanks for posting.
