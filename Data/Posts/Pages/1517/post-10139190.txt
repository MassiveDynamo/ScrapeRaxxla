You found it then! I was going through the beyond vids but hadn't got to that one...

Interesting.... AB-W said “that thing we haven’t shown” (Raxxla codex entry) “there’s elements of that that are probably my favourite parts of this”.... So he's suggesting there was something in that release specifically for Raxxla as I don't think he's referring to the codex entry itself...

Quite a lot in that release in terms of new functionality... I wonder which bits might be used in those elements that were his favourites?
It is perplexing.

This update essentially saw a big update in exploration: After the initial scan of the system, you will then be able to tune your scanners to find stellar bodies and other phenomena. Not only is this new system a more realistic, satisfying and engaging exploration experience, but now you will be able to make more informed decisions on where to look next, and you will be more rewarded for your time spent exploring.

This essentially boils down to, when exploring you now see everything on the map because the fog of war has been lifted, as to if they implemented anything new regards stellar bodies regarding Raxxla is an unknown but the focus was upon the new mechanism surely?

Before exploration was hit n miss, we might not see everything necessarily, not without some (necessary and applicable!) work, so previously unseen persistent POIs logically would hence become visible, allowing for wider choice?

Of course we still don’t know what it is we’re looking for
