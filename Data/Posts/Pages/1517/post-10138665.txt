A peculiar set of systems draw my attention. Try searching XO on the galaxy map.
Visibly hand-picked systems from Xo-1 to XO-5, around the Bubble and very distant from each other's.
They are on EDSM, they have been scanned but rarely. One of them even have only one visit logged.
Interestingly they all share the same planet layout, with metal, earth like and ammonia world.
I might make the trip.
