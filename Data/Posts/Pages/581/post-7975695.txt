I'm watching MB original YT vids again to see what is what, lot of interesting stuff in it, also answered my earlier question about how much was DB/IB storyline and how much was the authors, this is the 4th vid I think, start at the 1st for clarity:

Trying to watch a lot of the old vids to see what is in store. The way DB was talking during and after Kickstarter is of a game that ED atm is almost a shadow of! His dream if he can carry it off, or even half of it by the look of it, is that ED will develop and grow in so many ways to become a real living breathing universe even more than it is now. 10 years could well be a development phase.

Raxxla may have been ret-conned slightly to actually make it real. It was never meant to be real in the first place remember and even now we get 'unsubstantiated' and 'myth' and 'considered a myth' and phrases like that all the way through the DW & Raxxla Codex entries.

Basically the original Dark Wheel book was the very first GalNet release, just in a paperback edition.

Makes me laugh that we could have been searching for Gan Romero for 30 years, is he in the game this time? Who knows.

The only person who actually substantiates any of it in-game is Felicity Farseer - 'I know they're real...'

The books may be the answer...we know they are not GalNet this time.

Interestingly DB said at one point they have locked off whole sectors of the map for future content but that they don't necessairly know what that content will be, some of it may yet to be written or changed, the game has been built to allow for that.
