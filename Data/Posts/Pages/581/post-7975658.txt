Oh no... Again that Bilderberg-like Club ? Like in the FR mYsTerY and in the everyday very real life ? Please, no ! I hope it will be something new and more... exotic.

According to Drew W. the Club is a relatively new organization. Younger than TDW. The potential inhabitants of Raxxla should be way older.

Even if what Rafe said was true, it's not certain that there still are people there. Things change over the centuries.
