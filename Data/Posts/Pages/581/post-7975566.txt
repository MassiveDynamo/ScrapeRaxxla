Are you saying it's coded into all the .exe files?
Was just a little of my well known irony/cynicism in the way to remember that the "clues" should not be tied to linguistic specifics. Imho.
Troy, Troja, Trojan just like the Cassiopeia, mother of galaxies, etc.. things don't work quite well in every other localisation.

personally, I kind of hope its The Club (Or Sirius?)
Oh no... Again that Bilderberg-like Club ? Like in the FR mYsTerY and in the everyday very real life ? Please, no ! I hope it will be something new and more... exotic.

I did wonder if the whole point of the Salom√© storyline was to expose the Club (which was a DB invention).
Which makes us appreciate the difference between a real sci-fi / fantasy Writer and Story-Teller (DW) and a Software Engineer, when it comes to imagination and creativity.
MB is both, though.
I mean, all the Rift Quest was surrounded by myth and fantasy clues and comments. There be ghosts turned out to be the very human dead crew of a very human stranded ship.
Meh..
