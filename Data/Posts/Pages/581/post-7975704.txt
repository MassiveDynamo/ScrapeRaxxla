Jorki...This is ED! Do you really think we will find Raxxla and not have to fight off 200 Elite ranked ships? lol. If Raxxla is in the game, I feel sure that people are already there, personally, I kind of hope its The Club (Or Sirius?)
It also mentions that people may already be there in the Codex (a tyrant or sinister cabal) so I suspect its not retconned
True, had forgotten the codex phrasing.
