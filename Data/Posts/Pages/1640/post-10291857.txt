Then having Siddha Terminal in Pandemonium is a clue to look for a Sidhe mound, reinforcing the possibility that we are looking for a tomb that is a gateway to the Otherworld.

We have Lugh, Ogma, Brigid, Danu and the Morrigans, Goibniu, Nodens (Shibboleth of Nodons?), so if these are gathered at a certain level then Raxxla may be just below that (although from memory Brigid might be a bit off to one side... need to check in-game).

I still feel that something is missing to pin this down to a single system. 'The personal journey' keeps ringing around my head. Even then, if we had a single system matching the cosmological description, there's something more that has to be done to find this thing, whether it is way off in deep space or in the middle of a crater somewhere... . If it is just a POI somewhere, then everyone will just head there like it's nothing once the location is made public. I don't think it will be quite that easy.
