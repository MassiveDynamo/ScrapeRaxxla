Now, it just so happens I have a stash of Ancient Keys and Trinkets of Hidden Fortune on the carrier. Just tried flying approximately where that orbit line is with one of each in the iEagle, nothing. But open to suggestions
Keep them in your hold and jump from there to Sol... Crash into the moon... Do a traditional Raxxlan rain dance...
