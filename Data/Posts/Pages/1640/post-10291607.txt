Seems like someone's having fun with the system messages....

o7 Cmdrs today I received the following message, have you received it yet? Can this be the default location of Raaxla? greetings

slightly diff code on this one:
Hacked messages in HIP 20577
Looks like hackers have found a way to put big red messages directly to anyone who enters a system. I'm not sure if this could be used to push malicious clientside code but I'd try to stay away from hotspots. (Not my picture btw)

This poor bloke got so excited after receiving the message and being hassled by Space Lettuces he forgot how to land and blew up his ship... oops...
