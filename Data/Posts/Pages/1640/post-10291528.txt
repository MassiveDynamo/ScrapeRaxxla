^= Raxxla is a single , and a hidden too, and an actual . (as opposed to many things, a 'state of mind', or a constellation of stars, or something we see all the time but don't know what it is, for example).

Raxxla is singular, hidden, hard to find, but you can repeatedly get to it if/when you know how, if thee are 'access' requirements, everyone can achieve that requirement. (it's not random, it doesn't move, it's not only available to a select few).

I don't think Brookes would have described it using these words if he meant something different.
