EDIT!!!
This was misinformation, I didn't check my sources. The below relate to Voyager 1 being added to the Sol system back pre-launch. NOT RAXXLA.
Here the post with the real links to this info: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10291530




"...something..."
"...find it..."
"...very hard to find..."
"...in the game world..."

^= Raxxla is a single thing, and a hidden thing too, and an actual thing. (as opposed to many things, a 'state of mind', or a constellation of stars, or something we see all the time but don't know what it is, for example).

Raxxla is singular, hidden, hard to find, but you can repeatedly get to it if/when you know how, if thee are 'access' requirements, everyone can achieve that requirement. (it's not random, it doesn't move, it's not only available to a select few).

I don't think Brookes would have described it using these words if he meant something different.
