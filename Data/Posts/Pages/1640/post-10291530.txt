Edit: The other's I got from Jorki's thread here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/fdev-ed-relevant-quotes-videos.553526/#post-8671776

Oh I found one of them: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/gamma-2-secret-added.71798/#post-1189481

Actually, not even sure that relates to Raxxla. It might have been literally anything! LMAO. Jorki's thread says "MB on Raxxla", but there's no mention of Raxxla at all in the OP.

And Here's the other ones: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/gamma-2-secret-added.71798/page-4#post-1189799

So... Sorry @Jorki Rasalas but I think you need to remove the "MB on Raxxla" from your post there, cos they 'aint about Raxxla - at least, they're about something, but it's probably not Raxxla.

Thanks @AAABattery for making me go find the source for those, should have done that myself way back!


EDIT: Edit: Reading that thread, the secret was Voyager 1.
