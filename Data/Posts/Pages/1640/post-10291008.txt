Once you are in the system, it is described as Anarchy. I've spent some time going round the space POI, and as you say, they all appear to be Degraded Emissions (Threat 0). Never found anything out of the ordinary in any of them. Likewise, never seen anything unusual on the surfaces of the planet or it's moon. My personal theory is that perhaps there was once a station here, destroyed under mysterious circumstances; the orbit line is where it was, and all the POI are debris from the station. I also suspect that it was a bit of backstory/plotline that never got implemented before the game's release.
I wouldn't rule out the books or the RPGs having relevant lore. There is a another similar system named Placet near the Old Worlds region that was apparently abandoned. Very odd place. I believe Placet is covered in "Docking is difficult". At present, we only have a partial story on Placet. Placet is in the bottom left of the map of Old Worlds Coalition region.

Actually, there's another on opposite side of Bubble (nearer to Canonn Science region) called HIP 15310. Completely abandoned.
