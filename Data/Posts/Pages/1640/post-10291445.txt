One similarity has occurred to me as a result of reading about the Oisir-Raxxlans' intentions, as shown in the passages above and earlier in this thread, and something in The Ragthorn:
In both works, there is a ritual to be observed and in the case of the Oisir-Raxxlans they were supposed to build their pyramids face-down but on Earth made the mistake of building them face-up. A character in The Ragthorn makes the same mistake and something that should have been set in place face-down was instead placed face-up.

This makes me think that we should either be looking for something that is face-down or, if we have to activate a structure of some kind, that positioning something face-down that would ordinarily go face-up is crucial to the process.

It might seem premature to think about this but I am not convinced that, even if we can find Raxxla, it will be straightforward what we have to do with it.
