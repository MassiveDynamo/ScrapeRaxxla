I’ve just been able to combine my cosmological Miltonian / Holdstock model with the Thargoid Maelstroms.

It identifies a clear zone of influence, identifying that systems named after thunder, storms, lightning gods all collectively build a spherical zone around Sol. Its zenith fits perfectly with the Morrigan, and also the boundaries of Hell. But the centre of the Maelstroms aligns upon this circumference as well.

Again I postulate this only identifies Michael Brookes built a John Milton and Robert Holdstock model in game.

I believe parts of the Codex were written allegorically to describe this very construct and at most that Raxxla sits upon the out-rim of this zone, as ties in perfectly with the location of Paradise in Milton’s text.

To the jewel that burns = I believe represents Milton’s Pendant Universe hanging from the walls (or Brow) of Heaven.

On the brow of the Mother of Galaxies = is the deity of Chaos, who is the mother of all elements in Paradise Lost, I believe this means the brow of Chaos, or the brow of the zone of Chaos.

So Raxxla I strongly suspect sits just outside this zone of Chaos, most likely within the uppermost hemisphere very close the zone of the heavens aka the Empyrean.
