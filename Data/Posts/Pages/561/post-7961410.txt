About DW station, there are 2 keywords "disused" (does it mean it is abandoned by original owners?) and "unnamed giant".
Not sure how can that happens. Humans name everything they own(no exceptions), i.e. while station was "used" it had to had name ...
Maybe codex means "uknown name for her". Then need to find abandoned system with giants. Or very old system with depleted resources which has low population those days.
