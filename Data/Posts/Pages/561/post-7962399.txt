It depends if you need to travel 1000ly to get the "unique" material to make it work. I can imagine it will be available close to the bubble, but if you have taken your carrier out to The Abyss, is it going to get stranded there?
Mmmh.. The Abyss has no longer been a problem since the Engineers patch. It even has green systems out in the very rim. But, right, all depends on what fuel they will need. I was thinking about iconic "almost reachable" systems... And, ofc, locked regions borders...
Well, the truth is I am looking for a good reason to restart playing and grinding tenths of billions to afford a full equipped Explo Carrier.
