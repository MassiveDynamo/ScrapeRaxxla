The Quest To Find Raxxla
I believe Galnet reported that the Martian Artifact was no larger than a child’s hand. If that is true then it can’t be any of the Guardian artefacts that we are currently aware of. Well there is no valid description of these artifacts based on size and weight. It would be to easy of a clue if...

This is more of an FYI post for those interested in TDW 'invitation' way of finding Raxxla, so stop reading now if that's not your style.

Also note: I still haven't received an invitation from TDW, so obviously I'm still a hack!

Anyway, I'm still (as time permits) plugging away at OLTT in my unique way of only taking Founder or Elite missions directly from TDW on Jameson Memorial. I've noted that I'm still yet to receive a duplicate mission from TDW faction ally to one of their locations for the same goods as per this example data set below.



I'll end up visiting a single location, for a single faction target, for different goods - then when they run out of goods type missions 'In the name of Democracy' , I'll get missions for another faction.



I did seem to notice (although I haven't verified) that the missions 'dry up' for a faction when I become allied with them. Take that with a grain of salt at the moment, but I'll keep an eye on it. When that has occurred (twice that I recall), I then get missions to another random faction that I've never dealt with such as:



I have noted all the factions I'm receiving missions for are on Macros' list that he's allied with. So I'm approaching this as a get allied, and deliver all the stuff they ask for style engagement.
