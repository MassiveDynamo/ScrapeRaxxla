Hard Explo: any thoughts about that incoming 500 Ly jump range Carriers ? Mmmh , Boss ?
It depends if you need to travel 1000ly to get the "unique" material to make it work. I can imagine it will be available close to the bubble, but if you have taken your carrier out to The Abyss, is it going to get stranded there?
