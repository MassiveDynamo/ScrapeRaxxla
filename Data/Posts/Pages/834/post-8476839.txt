A few months ago I went out to Star of India and confirmed seeing this on the system map. They appear at first as a speck of light and slowly grow into the weird Smokey things pictured. I searched a bit and flew around but never saw anything out of the ordinary.

Oh I believe these phenomena are there, Han_Zen is one of the good guys & I believe him. Just thought it might be an artefact of the nearby nebulae. However several people have reported them as growing & shrinking with time, which is not behaviour I would associate with nebulae. So just got rid of a visitor (socially isolated!) , will grab an AFMU then I think go on a neutron run (though also got to walk the copawlot). Spansh says SOI should be around 20 jumps vs 33 that galmap router thinks.
