I recently checked region names in codex and found region named "Izanami". The legend behind Izanami is pretty close to the "lover's woe" from dark wheel toast . But this is still nothing precise to narrow search location.
Edit: actually there is the system in bubble called as the izanami lover "Izanagi".
Edit 2: and their daughter in bubble too "amaterasu".
Edit 3: not only galaxy region called izanami, but system in bubble too.
Edit 4: on planet 4 A in izanami system i found crashed conda with thargoid sensor. And I don't know if it's conda known before.
So on the treasure map theme, taking your izanami theory into account:
The jewel that burst brightest: Polaris
The whispers in witch space: Syreadiae JX-F c0
The sirens of the deepest void: ???
Parents grief: aganippe???
Lovers woe: izanami
Yearning of vagabond heart: Polaris again???

Perhaps Polaris is not the jewel that burns brightest??

Or...also interesting that the 1st and last are both Polaris....this would be required if you were marking the co-ordinates of a closed polygon?
