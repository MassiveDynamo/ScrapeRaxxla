120.5kls above SOI, nothing detected....
heading below it, nothing so far
WHY is it so hard to match any stars between what i see and the system and galaxy maps??????
edit: Now 146kls below SOI. Nothing to find in-system!
edit2: definitely not asteroid-related SOI has only the single star in-system, no other bodies!
