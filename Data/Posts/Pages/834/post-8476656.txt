I recently checked region names in codex and found region named "Izanami". The legend behind Izanami is pretty close to the "lover's woe" from dark wheel toast . But this is still nothing precise to narrow search location.
Edit: actually there is the system in bubble called as the izanami lover "Izanagi".
Edit 2: and their daughter in bubble too "amaterasu".
Edit 3: not only galaxy region called izanami, but system in bubble too.
Edit 4: on planet 4 A in izanami system i found crashed conda with thargoid sensor. And I don't know if it's conda known before.
