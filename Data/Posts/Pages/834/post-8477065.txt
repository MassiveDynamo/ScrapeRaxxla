My stance on it is this, any claims of it being found, without evidence that can be checked and observed by other cmdrs (peer review and repeatable results is a cornerstone of scientific discovery after all) is most likely a fake and will be disregarded by myself and i think a lot of others share this opinion

Well this just doesnt make sense.... all we have are claims that Raxxla is even in-game, nothing else, everything is specualation... to completely disregard somthing because your jealous they got there first, or becase you believe it to be photoshopped, but cant provide CONCRETE proof for the photoshopping, just sounds ridiculous to me...

And you opinion that any claim to have found R, must have evidence to be checked and observed by other CMDRs is also just wrong. As another person has already said, most likely anyone who does discover it, would post somthing almost the same at this. Cyrptic and blurred but showing "proof". If it was myself, I probably would not even have had posted the second pic, you'd have gotten the first one from me and thats all!!

Raxxla is such a big thing to long term players, anyone who goes and simply gives away its location or how to get there, would just be destroying the entire legend of Raxxla and taking away a big reason alot of people play the game long term, I dont think any dedicated enthusiasts would ever give away more than somthing like those screenshots. Enough to proove its in-game but not specific enough to simply give away the location or route.
