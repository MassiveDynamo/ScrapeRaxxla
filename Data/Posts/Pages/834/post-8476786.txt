So on the treasure map theme, taking your izanami theory into account:
The jewel that burst brightest: Polaris
The whispers in witch space: Syreadiae JX-F c0
The sirens of the deepest void: ???
Parents grief: aganippe???
Lovers woe: izanami
Yearning of vagabond heart: Polaris again???

Perhaps Polaris is not the jewel that burns brightest??

Or...also interesting that the 1st and last are both Polaris....this would be required if you were marking the co-ordinates of a closed polygon?

Another way of cutting this (that works) is:
1
The jewel that burns brightest: Polaris
Whispers in witch space/sirens of deepest void: Syreadiae JX-F c
Parents greif/lovers woe: aganippe
Yearning of vagabond heart: Polaris

That gives us a triangle.

Would somebody on here who plays on PC and is good with graphics packages be willing/able to come up with a rough mid-point of this triangle?
