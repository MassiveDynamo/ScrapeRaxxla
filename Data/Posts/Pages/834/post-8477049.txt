When you get out there, listen...do they sing?

They go:
boop dede boop dede boop dede boop, well goodness gracious me!...
dig that crazy Jazz!

(edit: you need to be able to lock onto them to check that, & this seems impossible from system map)

Well, got here, see what you mean, definitely animated. Got hires vids. Not sure what resolution I need to drop them down to to be able to post here (& how?-Imgur seems finicky on vids). But nothing to orient them against. Definitely two anomalies here. Swapped to the other side of the star & think they've changed position (but not sure). Between system star in foreground & starmap background certainly. But not convinced the starmap background is a true representation of the stars visible from this position- seems awfully similar to background I was looking at in the Alpha Centauri system map before I set off this afternoon.

Taken copawlot for his afternoon walk; currently pondering the nature of reality, quantum dynamics, and weird system anomalies over a large G&T!

edit2: Nope, just logged back in & large anomaly is still showing above SOI
