So on the treasure map theme, taking your izanami theory into account:
The jewel that burst brightest: Polaris
The whispers in witch space: Syreadiae JX-F c0
The sirens of the deepest void: ???
Parents grief: aganippe???
Lovers woe: izanami
Yearning of vagabond heart: Polaris again???

Perhaps Polaris is not the jewel that burns brightest??

Or...also interesting that the 1st and last are both Polaris....this would be required if you were marking the co-ordinates of a closed polygon?

But why we assume that "The jewel that burst brightest" is Polaris and not the Sirius or Canopus?
