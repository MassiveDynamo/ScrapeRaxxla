The only two systems I have found them consistently are Alpha Cygni(Deneb) and Star of India. There are two of them in each system. In Deneb they are quite close to each other, in the bottom right part of the map. In SOI there is one center / top of the star (it's behind the star unless the sysmap is zoomed out a bit) and one low left.

It takes about a minute in the map before they start to show.
I was in a planetary nebula last nite with a massive O star. I was staring at the system map for sometime and was pondering about those anomalies you reported in an earlier post. What I noticed was that all system maps are animated. I thought about this watching the flares coming off the O star. Any ways, all systems maps have stars in the background and got to wonder if those anomalies you reported are animated background pulsars or neutron stars?
