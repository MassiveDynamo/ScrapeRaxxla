So i just went down to a thargoid maw, plugged in a probe, scanner, and link, and while the stars showed up, the audio files did not have any noise. Want me to make a video to show what i mean?

Also, i have no real cash on me at the moment, and i need to put this into a video. What video editor should i use? I wanna make captions and stuff.
