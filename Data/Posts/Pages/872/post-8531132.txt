Is that true? Only a 1 ly range? Is this provable? Is there a system with any bodies over 1 ly apart to test?
I cant say, i'm just proposing a hypothesis.

Everywhere i looked people seem to be satisfied with "DS/FSS has unlimited range after 3.3" but where is the confirmation for this? If it had unlimited range i could scan nearby systems as well (i know they are not loaded in the game engine thus couldnt be scanned, but the argument persists). If it has a limited wide range, what's beyond that? Can anyone prove it's nothing?

I think it's an important point to bring because it's an obvious limitation, since we cant detect Raxxla without these tools
