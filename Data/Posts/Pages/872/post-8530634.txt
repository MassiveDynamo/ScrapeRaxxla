Some systems have multiple designations. Check it out on the system info
I meant this list. I locked in all of them but no one was near LFT 509 and all of them points on themself on galmap. Because of that i assumed that hip 34104 or completely hidden from navdata base of our ships, or never exited in first place (if it's a bug. But i don't think thats even possible)
