It would be nice if fdev had some employees that were actually able to answer questions. From what ive seen so far the general response is 'i dont really know'. You could get the same amount of info from a random person in your neighborhood realistically
It’s better this way. It’d be hella lame if things kept on getting solved completely out of game via people contacting support and support giving things away. (Or others.)
