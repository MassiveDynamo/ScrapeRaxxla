There are stars in the ED database that haven't ingame star system. This is because some errors with importing data from the real star chart/list (I don't know right words). That astronomical charts was used in the ED creating. All it is known issue for me. So this HIP 34104 is same thing. I think in the real world that system is part of gravitational united group of stars (include LFT 509).

That’s why I raised a support ticket! Doesn’t hurt to clear it up and rule it out.
