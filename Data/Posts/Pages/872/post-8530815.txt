I really like the Guy Fawkes mask, maybe I should get one too. Blow up Archambault Terminal with 36 barrels of gunpowder! Uh I mean a thermonuclear bomb. I bet Gan Romero moved into LFT 509. Hope he does some work for the controlling faction (probably), expanding it and hoping the destination system is capable of issuing permit missions is the only way of getting there. /edit can't do "outside of system" BGS influence since 3.3 or what was it.
