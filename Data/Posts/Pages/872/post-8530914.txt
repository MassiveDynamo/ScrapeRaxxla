Reminds me of Rhod Gilbert's mince pie....and I'm sure there are 1 or 2 Raxxla hunters that have had a breakdown in Knutsford services as well!!!!
If youâ€™re going to break down at any services, break down at Knutsford!


Just joking of course.

Should do it at Gloucester services or Tebay (Southbound).
