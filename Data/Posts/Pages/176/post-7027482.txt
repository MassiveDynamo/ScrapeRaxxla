Yep, right ,Doc. (as most of the time). I was just tinfoiling a possible link between Raxxla --> Raqs -->The Dancer --> Hercules ...
IF RH was a fan ... it could have inspired him and then DB ...
At the stage we have reached...[haha]

Tinfoiling is good, but the correct names for Arabic dance are Raqs Sharqi or Raqs Baladi or Raqa Shaabi. Raqs LA seems to be a bit of creative marketing.
