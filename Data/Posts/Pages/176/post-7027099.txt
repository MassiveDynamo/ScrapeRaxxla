Yep, right ,Doc. (as most of the time). I was just tinfoiling a possible link between Raxxla --> Raqs -->The Dancer --> Hercules ...
IF RH was a fan ... it could have inspired him and then DB ...
At the stage we have reached...[haha]

While I don't know if Holdstock was fan of Dune or not there is at least one panel in his Alien World that depicts the Fremen with some sand worms (his description is entirely unrelated to Dune however). I don't think RH chose the pictures for The Alien World though ... his job was just to try and build a universe around a group of unrelated imaginative artworks.
