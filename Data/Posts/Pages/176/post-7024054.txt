Well my little plan failed, miserably. Finding out the name of the Military outfit in the Pleiades (Black Flight) inspired me to mess around their activities and see if i couldn't discover something new. My plan was to change my callsign to my ship's ID then change the ID of my DBX to match the Black Flight's SV(I) system. Thats only what i changed. Their pilots IDs are always SVI while their Ships are SV and number. Changing my ID would require changing my Gamer tag on XBOX, and i didn't want to do that. Still, my furthest hope was that by full convincing members by the outfit i was one of them MIGHT lead me to get the permit for HIP 22460. Part of me believes that there are some systems with permits that require a special task or mission in order to become unlocked. Distinct from the typical method of allying with a faction. Particularly the named Permits that nobody has yet gotten into yet.
