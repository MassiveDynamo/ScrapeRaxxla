I suspect it would lead nowhere & that DB said (or meant to say) “ number stations” which are the Listening Posts.

Quite right, it was a long shot only of passing interest due to my vague recollection of the original vid. Already all of the star ports I'm visiting all have a number. I expect it was a typo on DB point - he didn't say 'star ports' but 'stations' he most likely did mean number stations . Never the less I have nothing better to do in game so I'm going to log these down as I tool around.
