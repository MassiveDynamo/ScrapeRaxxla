So the logical subsequent question is has anyone compiled a list of all these station numbers against station name and location? I suspect it would lead nowhere & that DB said (or meant to say) “ number stations” which are the Listening Posts that transmit coded signals akin to the Cold War number stations.

There was also a hint that audio signals at stations might contain clues. I seem to remember one station had a picture of DB in its spectrogram, but there might be other things to find.

As well as starting to move my ships to “safety” in Colonia (fully expecting the Klaxian invasion to occur during my absence on the DW2 expedition) I wanted to visit Jaques and see if there might be any clues to odd behaviour/Raxxla etc, but didn’t find anything in my brief visit so I Sideycided back to the bubble and am wondering what to investigate next.
