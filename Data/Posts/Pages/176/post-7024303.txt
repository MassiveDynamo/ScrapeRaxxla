I wonder if RH, and subsequently DB, are fans of the Dune novels...[weird]
there is an Arrakis system in the Bubble iirc...

No need to be a fan of Dune since there is a real Arrakis system about 90 light-years from Sol. Also known as Mu Draconis. Frank Herbert's Arrakis was a planet in the Canopus system.
