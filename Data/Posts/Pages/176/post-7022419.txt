Which reminds me, the other day I came across a permit locked system quite close to Shinrarta, it was in the nav list while I was collecting Colonia passengers at Tchernobog. But then I had a visitor & didnt get around to checking it out, anyone done so?

Here are the permit locked systems within 80ly of Tchernobog. I think I have permits for most of them.

System Allegiance Population Powerplay Distance ly
Tiliala 4 Independent 39,200,000 E: Felicia Winters 30.12 ly
Shinrarta Dezhra 5 ? 85,206,935 - 31.36 ly
Crom 1 Independent 15,000 E: Arissa Lavigny-Duval 36.93 ly

Now I'm back from Colonia thought I'd quickly recheck. The permit locked system is HR 4413, 15 ly from Tchernobog; it's in the navigation panel list but doesn't appear in an EDDB search on permit locked systems near Tchernobog.
So, am I being a little over-suspicious here??? (no, I'm not paranoid, they really are out to get me!).
