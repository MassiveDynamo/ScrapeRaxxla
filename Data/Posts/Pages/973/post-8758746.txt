For me, the takeout would be "fly between the stars" that would imply that something is hidden and you must fly in SC from a 2nd star towards another system... funny enough Shinrarta has a second star and on top of that there's the video link saying there's something to be found there.

About the same NPC chatter on different locations, these NPCs fly around several systems... maybe to disguise the system in question... but anyhow... I'm still trying to estavlish where's "east/right" from the second star in Shinrarta Dezhra... any indication towards where it may be is very much appreciated.
