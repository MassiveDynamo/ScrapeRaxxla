"Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" mention and reference now make sense. I'm really liking this puzzle, and yes it is quite obvious. If they had given out any more clues, it would have been solved a long time ago. Got lots of supportive in-game audio and video to share soon in Sag A, 18k ly to go.
