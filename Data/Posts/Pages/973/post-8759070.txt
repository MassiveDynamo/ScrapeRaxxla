This game has lots of references to many stories, tales, myths and so on... relating to several civilizations, fictionals or real... there's no way to test a theory except by actually doing it.

Also, by flying in a straight line from the arrival star to the second one in Shinrarta, you can turn "right" the only "catch" is "right" being any of the 360 angles unless maybe you can match it with "east".

And this is my question from start... if anyone has a hint where would the galactical "east" be... even a small clue would suffice... more importantly, I'm not asking anyone to follow this NPC chater for me... I'm just sharing it here.

Thanks once again for any direction to where the galactical "east" would be.

All I have is a Galnet article describing someone discovering the “True” North Star for Sol. Not sure if that helps your quest.
