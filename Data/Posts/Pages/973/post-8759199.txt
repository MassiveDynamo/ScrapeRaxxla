Koben, does the orrery view from the system map help? I've used this while hunting around Sol. The other thing I would consider is to select a body in the appropriate direction on the galaxy map and then head in that direction in supercruise. I don't think there is any accurate way to do what you are asking.


On another matter, the Obsidian Orbital station has some imagery on it that looks very much like a system with one star, a couple of planets and then 10 'spiralling' stars (below). Are there any references to this that I could be pointed to please.

Those stars definitely seem to be spiraling. Nice observation !
