Mate, there is a galactic North, South, West and East...
Only that we, the players, have agreed on based on a 2D representation of a 3D model. Cardinal points are only meaningful when one is operating on a body that generates a magnetic field. And that certainly doesn't translate into "left" and "right" as @Vetinari has pointed out. Look, we've chased a load of silly theories and some far more palatable; heck, I even flew 44Kly's to scan a red dwarf and six ice cubes, but I wouldn't waste a minute on this theory. It's clearly flavor text riffing off of Peter Pan....but you do you, CMDR.
