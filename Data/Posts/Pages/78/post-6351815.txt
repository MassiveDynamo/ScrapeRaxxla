IIRC MB said something along the lines of it being more of a spiritual successor of TDW rather than it being a direct sequel. Can't remember where I saw that though.

Haven't read it so can't comment on the actual content.
Its only a sequel because it's in space. That's the only similarity they have, as far as I can remember.

Looking for Raxxla?

Look down the back of the sofa, everything is always down the back of the sofa.
More likely behind the fridge. If you lose something it's nearly always there.
