Well.

That's an incredible set of links. Reminds of BBS Radio 1's "tedious link" they used to do, which was never tedious and always entertaining!

Honestly, FDev have gone to great lengths to make the puzzles for the UAs, UPs, Millionaire's treasure hunts etc require a lot of out of game tools and information sources, so it's entirely plausible that this is how they expect us to find Raxxla.

So if we go there and play "Break on Through" with our ship sounds to a barrel of trinkets then we'll find Raxxla!
