I've not yet got round to that one (currently on Lave Revolution), has anyone read Legacy? I know Raxxla and the Ryder family decedents feature heavily in AHTW, but I wondered if there was any continuation of any of the themes from TDW in Legacy?
Have you read these posts ?

Seems the Raxxla-in-game is more a sequel to TDW than to Legacy. But I may be wrong due to my teribble anglich.
Anyway, there is a BIG similarity between the Rift and the Raxxla storylines ...
Drew W left and the Rift mYsTeRy is off. Michael B left and the Raxxla Quest (Elite missions) is off ... imho

You mean 5c is a musical key?
So we've been looking for the wrong kind of key!
C5 maybe ? But no G Mixolydian system in EDSM...
Perhaps in a system with these planets and orbits ?
