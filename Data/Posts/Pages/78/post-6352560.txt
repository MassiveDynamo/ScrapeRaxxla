I also found this thread: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/16354-quot-official-sequel-to-quot-The-Dark-Wheel-quot

Which suggests this book is Elite: Legacy.

Is that confirmed?

Yes. Elite: Legacy is "the official sequel" to The Dark Wheel though, as others have pointed out, there doesn't appear to be any continuation of The Dark Wheel storyline in Legacy.

John Harper's And Here the Wheel plays a much better sequel to Holdstock's novella. We get introduced to the descendants of the Ryder clan and a little bit of the drama regarding The Dark Wheel and the quest to find Raxxla. Since The Dark Wheel is no longer considered canon in and of itself And Here the Wheel was the only canonical reference for Raxxla or any of The Dark Wheel's characters until the release of Drew Wagar's Premonition.
