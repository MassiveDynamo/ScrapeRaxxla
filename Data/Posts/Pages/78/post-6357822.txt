... That's an incredible set of links. Reminds of BBS Radio 1's "tedious link" they used to do, which was never tedious and always entertaining ...

I'm not familiar with Tedious Link but I remember an old BBC television program from the 1970s that would play here in the States on PBS. "Connections" was hosted by James Burke and would trace how something like the motion picture camera could be traced back to advancements in castle fortifications in the middle ages.
