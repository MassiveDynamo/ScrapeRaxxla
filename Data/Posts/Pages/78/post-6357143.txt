C5 maybe ? But no G Mixolydian system in EDSM...
Perhaps in a system with these planets and orbits ?

(That's what I call 'tinfoiling', pal !) [yesnod]
Well, yes, maybe a lot of tin is involved, however, it's a more interesting lead than searching every system with in x klys of the bubble

One of the missions is called "silent songs of the spheres"....

Can the discovery scanner sound be tuned to different notes?! (yes, this is madness)

Maybe using the ship sounds to play a tune related to the word "door" (break on through to the other side by The Doors?) in the correct key in the correct system whilst carrying (or targeting) a SAP 8 core container, trinkets of hidden fortune (or some of the other weird cargo) might just show us the way?
