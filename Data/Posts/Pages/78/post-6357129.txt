On the night/morning of November 1st/2nd 1917 the Hooker 100 inch observatory saw first light. The aperture was directed toward the planet Jupiter and, to the horror of those in attendance, six fuzzy images of that planet filled the eyepiece indicating a flaw. Investigation into the problem revealed that workmen during the day had left the observatory open. The sun itself may have shown directly on the mirror ... thus heating it and warping the focal point.

There was nothing to be done but wait for the telescope to cool. For three or more hours they waited nervously. Jupiter had slipped over the horizon and so the telescope was turned toward a new target. A star. The image in the eyepiece was crisp and clear!

I need your help folks. I need to know which star that was!
Unfortunately I've not got a clue
