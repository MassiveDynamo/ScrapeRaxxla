That's cool then. I've never felt Raxxla and the Rift are related but whenever someone mentions them both in the same breath (so to speak) it makes me wonder if I missed something

I did find something I can't track it down, anyone have any ideas about this:

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous ED kickstarter page:

"Pledge £35 or more
Download a digital copy of the official sequel to “The Dark Wheel” novel, plus all rewards above."

I also found this thread: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/16354-quot-official-sequel-to-quot-The-Dark-Wheel-quot

Which suggests this book is Elite: Legacy.

Is that confirmed?

I've not yet got round to that one (currently on Lave Revolution), has anyone read Legacy? I know Raxxla and the Ryder family decedents feature heavily in AHTW, but I wondered if there was any continuation of any of the themes from TDW in Legacy?
