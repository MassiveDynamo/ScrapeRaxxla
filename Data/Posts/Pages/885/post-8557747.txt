Sorry to go a bit off topic, but I was rather shocked when I pulled into Begal Point this evening to find that the 2x tourist beacons are now accompanied by 2 x fleet carriers, 4 NPC cruise whales and an NPC pirate! I'm 65k ly from the bubble getting scan by a pirate and then slaged off for not having anything worth stealing!!!!

I was even more shocked when I had almost finished dumping 1/2 billion of UC data when I noticed the (after 25% carrier fee) at the bottom of the congratulations on being first to discover screen.

Basically....the pirate gave up on me, but I still ended up getting robbed!
Besides wisdom, did you find any clues out there then? Clues like measuring the speed of the arms, like the galaxy is spinning so quickly that Raxxla may have been tossed out and this is why we haven't found it yet?
