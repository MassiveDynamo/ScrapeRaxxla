If looking from sol (which you should be considering thats where all constellations are viewed from) the actual stsr that sits on "the brow" of cassiopeia is v1022 Cassiopeiae as that is the star under caph on the eyebrow depicted in most constellation images, it is just beside schedar in terms of proximity with a good few gas giants and planets, not one gas giant has 8 moons however there is an ammonia world with exactly 8 moons, iv searched this system extensively as possible with what we have and cant find nlthing other than a ton of signal sources however other than that nothing i can find.
