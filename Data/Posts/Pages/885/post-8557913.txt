My only advice, which should hopefully go without saying: if it's a planet that's been mapped by another player, you can ignore that. That also applies to exploration in general: save on redundant work, y'know.

And with so many years of the game having officially launched, I felt it's safe to assume that every single planet in the entire "Bubble" has been probed thoroughly by at least nine different novice players.
