P.S. I see the "Lori Jameson faction" ship is at her base. Are there any observations of "engineer faction" NPC away from the engineer's base? I think that would be needed to demonstrate this is a real thing & not just part of the base visual fuff.
It was just an observation I did a while ago. It's there for observation if someone want to dig into it. I've been busy on other fronts.
