Each engineer has an "invisible" minor faction in their system, with 0 inf. Here's Lori's: https://eddb.io/faction/75300 . Some (Turner and Farseer, for example) have other minor factions. Some engineers that aren't even in the game have these invisible minor factions, which kind of threw me for a loop.

Weird things happen at engineer bases - we saw black flight ships at Palin's old base the other day...
