Besides wisdom, did you find any clues out there then? Clues like measuring the speed of the arms, like the galaxy is spinning so quickly that Raxxla may have been tossed out and this is why we haven't found it yet?

The galaxy isn't spinning fast, you've just started on the lavian brandy a little early for a Friday afternoon!

P.S. I see the "Lori Jameson faction" ship is at her base. Are there any observations of "engineer faction" NPC away from the engineer's base? I think that would be needed to demonstrate this is a real thing & not just part of the base visual fuff.
