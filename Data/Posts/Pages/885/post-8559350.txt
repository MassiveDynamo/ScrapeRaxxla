And with so many years of the game having officially launched, I felt it's safe to assume that every single planet in the entire "Bubble" has been probed thoroughly by at least nine different novice players.

I'm currently participating in the Great Raxxla Potato Hunt , and there are quite a few planets which weren't probed at all. Scanned - yes, almost all of them perhaps, but not probed.
