@Jorki Rasalas When I was looking for club-related minor factions, I did a data crunch to look for oddly-named minor factions. These were the engineers I found: Captain Banner, Elui Shera, Kit Lange, Matt 'The Gunner' Sorbis, Plasma Piotr, Trin Falcour. AFAIK they were all abandoned in 2016 - for example, I think Matt 'The Gunner' Sorbis morphed into Tod 'The Blaster'.

The list of the 450 most oddly-named factions is at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet...EE968srZAsIvkUGi9RZJFceAg/edit#gid=2141119808 in the "Odd Factions" tab.
