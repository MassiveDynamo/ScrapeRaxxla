Does anyone know where exactly tourist beacon #1 is located?

Thinking of running humanitarian transport, trades, and passenger runs out of Achenar and Sol. Maybe it is possible there is string of tourist beacons that established a better timeline and key systems.

2296 is so damn early Raxxla almost certainly is discovered in the process of the colonization of Achenar. Yes, entirely possible that is far too overly simplistic but it is the most likely. Also, weren't the early builds the zone in line between Sol and Achenar?
