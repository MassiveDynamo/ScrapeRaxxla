I'm sorry, but my translator translated that phrase as if Raxxla was a nickname and there were many of them.
Not ruling that out as a possibility. Sadly, we have but the most vague hints of what this might be in actuality. The thing is at best case we have a handful of confirmed colonies:

Sol (and stuff at the further parts of our home system)
Alpha Centauri/Eden - later deemed unfit due to Proxima Centauri
Tau Ceti - first successful human colony
Beta Hydri
Altair
a few corporate systems to support fledgling colonies via mining
Achenar (supposedly settled sometime in 2250s) - still not sold that the primary colonization vessels here didn't already have Hyperspace/Witchspace access given 2230 rapid and uncontrolled expansion
Facece or whatever it was called at the time (settled within the same decade as Achenar)
Minor corporate mining colonies to support the early Republic founded by Marlin Duval
I suspect we have fuel scoops before even the first generation ship departs given Sirius Corporation's existence starts in Sol. Additionally, their whole operation revolves around Hydrogen and Helium as power sources (see Helium-3 in Deliver us series and Sacra Oculus). This idea is further bolstered by "Logistical Nightmare" beacon in Beta Hydri.

Omphalos Rift may well be somewhere around the center point between the Federation colonies and the fledgling Democratic Republic which becomes the Empire in 2296. That said, Facece should be considered a viable possibility given that system's resemblance to the details from the Soontill story. If it was found either pre-2296 or in 2296, the system labeled Soontill is very likely an attempt (albeit a poor one) to cover up Raxxla/Omphalos Rift.
