Some time back i tried to use the planetary orbit model on NASA's site to see if i could get any of the main planets to line up with the gaps in an orrery view (worth a shot), sadly their model doesn't go up to 3309!

Weâ€™ve discussed this sort of thing before, but I think the result was that FD didnt set their planetary orbits to anything in particular, and arent accurate enough against real life to allow conclusions to be drawn.
