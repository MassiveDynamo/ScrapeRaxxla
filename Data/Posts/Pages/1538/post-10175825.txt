Axis Mundi and the Deepest Void?

If you draw a sphere of influence out from the system Axis Mundi towards Pandemonium, the system Tartarus falls upon its outer rim?

What could that mean? At most it could possibly establish Tartarus as being the ‘deepest void’ actually referred in the Codex, or just coincidence?

Note that if you shift this sphere so that’s it’s perfectly aligned with Pandemonium and Tartarus the centre now falls upon the system Asphodel, a field of flowers in the Greek underworld. All 3 of these systems also rest upon a relative Y coordinate!

At most it should establish they are hand placed and ‘do’ represent an ‘underworld’, and I am confident that given all the other evidence in this area Tartarus is in my opinion, almost certainly the ‘deepest void’ utilised within the Codex.
