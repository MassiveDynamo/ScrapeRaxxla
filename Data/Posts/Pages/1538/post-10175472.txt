Yes, been testing that installation in the past and recently, although last week I was not able to recon-scan the com-datapoints. It just failed. 'limpet failed'. This may have been during the DDoS attack / server overload at AWS/Frontier.
Oh? hadn't heard of that.
Don't think datapoints etc will be involved. It's a 2015 puzzle...probably just got to find the right hole to pop down...
