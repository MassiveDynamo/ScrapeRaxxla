Yes, that fits in with my experience. I was flying around the structure trying to see any possible “omphalos points” for a while before I got the trespass fine, then bounty & everything opened up on me. Just upgrading my combat Krait with energy weapons and fatter PP ready for an attempt...but with my hand problems I’m not hopeful. Thing I might try to take some video/pix & then explore the “trespass zone” limits.
I used my Orca as its never been used for much since i bought it in Colonia (kept it for sentimental reasons!), it runs at 22.6% heat which is a bit high for a stealther but what i did was to bang 3 heatsinks on it with an Operations multi controller.
I went Silent running and just keep popping the sinks whilst i hacked the data and looked around.
I got fines and the fuzz are coming message but staying in Silent i didn't get attacked.
The guns did finally open up on me in the trespass zone when i ran out of sinks
All great fun after 5 pints of Old Rascal.
