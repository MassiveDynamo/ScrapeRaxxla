I had a good look around Delphi in the Mk3, nowt, then took my hacking Orca to fiddle with the data ports, again nowt.
There is a small area in the middle that is a trespass zone but again nothing happened for me.
Like you say it must be a certain time or trigger, also checked out the crashed Annie on Charon again in case i missed owt last time.

Its still a bit Toyah Willcox around there.

Yes, that fits in with my experience. I was flying around the structure trying to see any possible “omphalos points” for a while before I got the trespass fine, then bounty & everything opened up on me. Just upgrading my combat Krait with energy weapons and fatter PP ready for an attempt...but with my hand problems I’m not hopeful. Thing I might try to take some video/pix & then explore the “trespass zone” limits.
