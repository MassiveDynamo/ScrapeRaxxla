In the Dark Wheel they spent some time describing the face of Patrick McGreavy....



Let me help you here: Facece.

Where is the first Coriolis built (Peter's Base)?

Facece (it's other name is Vetitice)

What planet is there?

Peter's Wreck

Who is the likely real identity (well one of them) of Jaques ("the supplanter")?

Peter Jameson

The injuries of Raffe Zetter are consistent with those of Jaques?

Yes, absolutely.

Is there a Y-class brown dwarf in the system?

Yes

Consistent with Soontill myth?

Yes

Guess who killed their son (assuming of course John Jameson was not in fact either a clone or cyborg).

Peter Jameson

Did Caleb "Salvation" Wycherley have injuries consistent with those of Jaques?

Yes.

Was Caleb "Salvation" Wycherley found with circuits and a possible cyborg?

Yes.

Everything connects to Facece.

Also, who produced Mycoid and tested it at Sohalia?

Peter Jameson aka Jaques (from which he was "cured" by Imperial Navy Research Arm)?

Who was rumored to deliver the Mycoid to Sohalia?

Imperial Navy agents.

Jaques is not a nice old man. He may not even be human. He also runs a damn good chance of being a part of the Guardian AI. You all should be terrified of that prospect.

It takes a devil to know one.

I may fight on the side of humanity and our better angels but do not make the mistake of thinking I am one of them. I just take personal issue with all the rubbish that the founder of Pilot's Federation (and his lackeys) put humanity through. Nothing would make me happier than taking him down personally.
