I went back to Delphi Control Chapter for a full search, photographed from all sides, but could find no entrances. From a scan there’s one emergency escape hatch but couldn't break in. Tried a few more times to drop out of minimum SC speed at Pluto-Charon barycentre (2.04 Mm from Pluto, 17.5Mm from Charon) but never got the bodyid=31 in my journal...so if this is the location then I suspect it’s impossible....overcome by fernweh...losing the will to live play ED...
There's strangely a fighter bay underneath one section but no way of interacting with it.
