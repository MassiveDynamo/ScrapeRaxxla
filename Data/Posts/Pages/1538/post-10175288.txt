A thought occured...
We are told in the codex that TDW are “a legendary group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters”

Such adventurers & explorers undertake “ventures”

Parties of people who undertake ventures are Venturers

The faction who hold the Delphi Control Chapter installation at Pluto-Charon barycentre is
Sol Constitution Party...

Parties undertake ventures...so possibly an obfuscated name?

Sol Constitution Venturers? ... SCV

A wheel is a cycle, like a cyclic shift, perhaps a Caesar cypher...
SCV one place shifted becomes TDW

The Greek Omphalos Stone was located in the temple at Delphi...

Just a thought
I had a good look around Delphi in the Mk3, nowt, then took my hacking Orca to fiddle with the data ports, again nowt.
There is a small area in the middle that is a trespass zone but again nothing happened for me.
Like you say it must be a certain time or trigger, also checked out the crashed Annie on Charon again in case i missed owt last time.

Its still a bit Toyah Willcox around there.
