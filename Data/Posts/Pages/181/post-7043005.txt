The real question is: Would a ADS still be able to detect it? Does a ADS detect celestial objects based on their gravitational pull on the host star/s? Or based on any point of gravity within what counts as the system?
The "rogue planet" is classified among the stars. So may very well appear as a system in the GalMap/NavPanel.
