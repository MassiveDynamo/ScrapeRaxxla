I believe someone looked at the Journal file format when it came out & that has object types that include those. But canâ€™t find my link to that journal spec. Should be googlable!

I quoted these files time ago here. Were initially posted by FDevs themselves. (link in HunterwithGreenScales Reddit post, thx Cmdr MarkusCZ)
The thing with the rogue planets is how would Stellar Forge manage them without a system ?
Because if it is inside a system, it therefore would be subject to the local gravity. Wouldn't it ? So no longer a rogue as long (millenials, millions of years ?) as it stays in that system.
