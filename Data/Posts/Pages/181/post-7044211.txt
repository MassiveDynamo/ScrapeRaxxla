Crab Nebula is a Stellar remnant nebula, I think. It has a pulsar in the middle.

The list of RL rouge planets is just two long. Only PSO J318.5-22 and SDSS J111010.01+011613.1 are confirmed and not a possible brown dwarfs. Even SDSS J111010.01+011613.1 is an edge case, as it's very close to dwarf mass.

Anyway, even the concept of "rogue planet" is quite unclear imho, as it is arbitrarily based on relation with Jupiter masses...

Two confirmed rogue planets but half a dozen candidates, so far. Edit: has anyone visited the RL rogues in-game?

Not really arbitrary related to Jupiter masses, just that the mechanism to eject a planet from its parent system may involve a large mass object (e.g. a gas giant like Jupiter) migrating around within that system and if it gets too close to a planet may slingshot it out of the system.
