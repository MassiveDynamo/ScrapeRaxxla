It would just be traveling in the system, somewhere. As long as it has escape velocity, it would not be a permanent member of the system.
It would still take many years to go from one system to the next.
Pluto uses 248 years to go around the Sun.

The real question is: Would a ADS still be able to detect it? Does a ADS detect celestial objects based on their gravitational pull on the host star/s? Or based on any point of gravity within what counts as the system?
