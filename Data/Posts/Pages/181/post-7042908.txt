I believe someone looked at the Journal file format when it came out & that has object types that include those. But canâ€™t find my link to that journal spec. Should be googlable!

From the journal schema, can delete if folk think this is a bit too "data-miney" for the thread :

Rouge planets would be like any other planet in a system, except that they wouldn't orbit any star.
They could potentially switch systems, but this would be rare. Systems are big and planets move slow, so it wouldn't happen every Thursday morning. [big grin]

I am still feeling triggered!

Comets would probably do this, we know they're in the game. It's why I think they're not enabled, essentially technical difficulties around when it would transition or issues with it essentially being in multiple (instance) systems at once.
