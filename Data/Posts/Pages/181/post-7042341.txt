The thing with the rogue planets is how would Stellar Forge manage them without a system ?
Because if it is inside a system, it therefore would be subject to the local gravity. Wouldn't it ? So no longer a rogue as long (millenials, millions of years ?) as it stays in that system.

It would just be traveling in the system, somwhere. As long as it has escape velocity, it would not be a permanent member of the system.
It would still take many years to go from one system to the next.
Pluto uses 248 years to go around the Sun.
