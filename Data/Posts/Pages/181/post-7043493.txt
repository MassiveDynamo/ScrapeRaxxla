I think the implcations of it being from the Star Descriptions list is that the Rogue Planet would be a jump destination in itâ€™s own right rather than a body in a system.

Are there any "Nebula" or "StellarRemnantNebula" that you can jump to though?

They are also listed in the Star Descriptions list, and while such things are named in the galaxy map, I don't recall any being a specifically targetable destination: you jump to a star in a nebula.
