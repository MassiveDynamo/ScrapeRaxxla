It would just be traveling in the system, somwhere. As long as it has escape velocity, it would not be a permanent member of the system.
It would still take many years to go from one system to the next.

Like the Voyager probes: they are exiting the system, but can be found via the POI system.

Likewise the comet at Pareco, it's in system, but can't be honked.

If Raxxla is a rogue dwarf-planet, with say a station orbiting it (and maybe shielding it from scans with alien-handwaveum), both could be say travelling around the bubble, and we just need to know when it's going to be in a particular system, and at what coordinates to intercept it.
Say it was in Lave, and has moved to Shinrarta, and is now in Epsilon Indi, but your chances of finding it in-system are like finding Voyager without any clues...
