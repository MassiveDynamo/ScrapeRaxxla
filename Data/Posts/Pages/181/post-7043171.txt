I remember the exotic star class. The classes were listed in open text files in the beginning.

I can't remember any rouge planet, but that does not mean it's not there.

Rouge planets would be like any other planet in a system, except that they wouldn't orbit any star.
They could potentially switch systems, but this would be rare. Systems are big and planets move slow, so it wouldn't happen every Thursday morning. [big grin]
Hmm, I think the implcations of it being from the Star Descriptions list is that the Rogue Planet would be a jump destination in itâ€™s own right rather than a body in a system.

From what I remember of how the Stellar Forge works, I would guess it could be a result of:

- there not being sufficient material in the original gas cloud for any bodies produced to achieve fusion

- a random event displacing a planet or somehow preventing star formation

Just speculation though!
