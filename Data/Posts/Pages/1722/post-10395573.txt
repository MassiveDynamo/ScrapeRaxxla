The first key test for the station audio I think is to determine that it's not just generated by randomly playing a beep sound with no meaning.
- do two players present in the same instance at the same time receive the same beeps?
- do two players present in difference instances at the same station at the same time (but the instances started at different times) receive the same beeps? (either relative to the external clock, or relative to the instance start times)
I agree, I've not seen this tested on the forum thread(s) yet strangely, but the youtube vid I watched where someone talked about this said that they believe the sound is instanced for the individual "client side" (4:20 in the linked vid), but they were not specific about any other details and didn't sound like they'd tested it.

I've seen no actual tests for this yet.

He also says the signal doesn't appear in all stations, actually none he checked in the Empire "at all", and some elsewhere. He's not specific about how many he checked.

My gut feeling is that it's a random string and the "glyphs" are just the marks created by the sounds, rather than intentional characters intended to give meaning. Edit: because a long enough random sequence will produce meaningful clumping over a long enough period of time, especially given the large number of 'characters' present.

But hey, I found images hidden in the Landscape Signal that no-one else can apparently see, so who am I to judge.
