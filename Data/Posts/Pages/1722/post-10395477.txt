I found 10x 4 character long sequences that appear twice each in the file.

YBYC: 361 characters
39LG: 179 characters
C7L7: 3680 characters
8NVT: 1871 characters
G1WL: 3883 characters
: 1381 characters

Each pair is seperated by the number of characters listed.

This is from a 'translated' 6 hr audio file from one of the stations.

their combined hex is - 16 9b 3e 60 74 ff 2b 56 54 69 70 e5 42 59

That's very interesting! Do you have any thoughts on what it means?

I suppose it's a big ask at this stage, but have you been able to compare that 6hr audio with one from another station to see if they're the same?
