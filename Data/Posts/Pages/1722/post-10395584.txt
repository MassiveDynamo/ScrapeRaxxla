It was certainly smaller than the Alioth one but I think they did have more than the 11 - though, on the other hand, they didn't have all of those, either:
- Riedquat started as Anarchy (and a Federal one, at that)
- Orrere might have been Federal or Independent, I can't remember
- Orerve I think was definitely Federal
- Uszaa again Federal or Independent

Of course, at game start even the Alioth bubble was fairly sparse, with a lot of Federal and Independent systems mixed in. They only had a bit over 200 systems total.

(Simple and mostly reliable test: check if the system has a native non-player Alliance faction; if it doesn't, it wasn't Alliance in 3300. Having one doesn't necessarily mean that it was, but it makes it more likely)

Doesn't matter what allegiance they showed at game release...the clue was " in Alliance space" and I think that would include systems that are Independent or other superpower but within the Alliance "sphere" of influence.
