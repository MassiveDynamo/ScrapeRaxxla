Lave in ED started in 3300 as an Alliance system along with most of the other "old world" systems and a few others in that geographic area, so any measure of "original Alliance space" could include its mini-bubble.
I stand corrected!!
@Ian Doncaster When I've got time I'll add a minibubble around Lave to my analysis...size of said minibubble at release of game?
Was it an actual bubble, or just the 11 "old worlds"?
