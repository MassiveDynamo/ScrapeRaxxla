I honestly don’t think there’s a mechanism to assist finding Raxxla, except possibly Trinkets, which may or may not be, more linked to the DW?!?! Which I agree might be more of a trigger involving pirates.

Grasping at straws here. I can’t place it but was there a story about a gen ship, trinkets and pirates?
