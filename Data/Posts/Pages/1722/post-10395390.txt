I'll have to search, but wasn't there a comment from Braben about just needing a regular sensor but more people would be better?
Alleged comment mentioned several times in the last few pages. First suggested by Cmdr Koben in this thread. No supporting evidence.

Even if true we don't know where to look, how close we need to get, whether we need to be carrying Trinkets...in fact we know nothing about how to actually locate it!
