I don't suppose that using procedural generation from a table of the alphabet and 0-9 numbers you could, say, create a strong of nearly random numbers for your sci-fi game stations to broadcast?
Trivial, as a matter of programming. Would have been trivial on the BBC Micro.

It would be exceptionally difficult to tell that apart from a sound effect generator with the rule "pick one of the N beep sounds randomly and play it next, then set a random delay" where the random choices are based on some arbitrary internal state, though, which would also generate the "signals don't appear to repeat and appear to be different between stations" effect.

The first key test for the station audio I think is to determine that it's not just generated by randomly playing a beep sound with no meaning.
- do two players present in the same instance at the same time receive the same beeps?
- do two players present in difference instances at the same station at the same time (but the instances started at different times) receive the same beeps? (either relative to the external clock, or relative to the instance start times)

If both of those are true then it is possible that they have more significance, as care has been taken to synchronise them.
