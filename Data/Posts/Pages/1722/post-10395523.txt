@Ian Doncaster When I've got time I'll add a minibubble around Lave to my analysis...size of said minibubble at release of game?
Was it an actual bubble, or just the 11 "old worlds"?
It was certainly smaller than the Alioth one but I think they did have more than the 11 - though, on the other hand, they didn't have all of those, either:
- Riedquat started as Anarchy (and a Federal one, at that)
- Orrere might have been Federal or Independent, I can't remember
- Orerve I think was definitely Federal
- Uszaa again Federal or Independent

Of course, at game start even the Alioth bubble was fairly sparse, with a lot of Federal and Independent systems mixed in. They only had a bit over 200 systems total.

(Simple and mostly reliable test: check if the system has a native non-player Alliance faction; if it doesn't, it definitely wasn't Alliance in 3300. Having one doesn't necessarily mean that it was, but it makes it more likely)
