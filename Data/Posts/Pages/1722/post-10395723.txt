I'm doing some investigations with several aspects.

Here are the truths.

Raxxla Codex
Tourism Gardens (Milton)
Numbers stations (gathering data, need more data)
Brooks tour - "And fast by, hanging in a golden chain,
This pendant world, in bigness as a star
Of smallest magnitude, close by the moon."

I've included the raxxla icon for ease of comparison with the rear of the coriolis, the fact that the image 'fits' at about the distance you need to be to hear (see) the numbers is coincedental at this point. The design, I am waiting to see if there is a difference in tourism station 'rears', so far after 3 checks they are similar.

Quick edit - images from
Fernandes Port
Koyeris system
