Didnt it come from one of Drew Wagar's fan fiction stories?
Good to hear you're feeling a bit better!
Yes, I believe so - Mutabilis or one of the Oolite ones which are not canon IIRC. Allen Stroud's official book with the story line around Lave was not Raxxla-related and does not even mention it I think. @Vetinari sorry to hear you have been ill - get better soon.
