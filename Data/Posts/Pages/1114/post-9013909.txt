The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy is a tempting suggestion... It very close and is in a polar orbit to the Milky Way, it also apparently has a stream of stars that have been ripped out and are being pulled into our galaxy....
The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy would be a good candidate for this theory as well. The main body of the galaxy is apparently only 25,000ly from Sol, the rest was pulled apart into stellar streams, some of which may intersect with our galaxy. I was looking for signs of it a couple years ago before I got burned out.
