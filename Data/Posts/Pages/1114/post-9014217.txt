Catching up, been mostly asleep since Friday due to Covid, over the worst now I think.



Think this was old lore. There a (iirc) Beacon in Lave certifying Lave 2 as Laves 'lost moon' which kind of references the old lore, ties it up and settles it.
Didnt it come from one of Drew Wagar's fan fiction stories?
Good to hear you're feeling a bit better!
