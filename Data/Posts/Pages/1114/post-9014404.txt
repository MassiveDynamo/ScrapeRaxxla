Yes, I believe so - Mutabulis or one of the Oolite ones which are not canon IIRC. Allen Stroud's official book with the story line around Lave was not Raxxla-related and does not even mention it I think. @Vetinari sorry to hear you have been ill - get better soon.

Correct. Mutabilis. Not canon.

Cheers,
