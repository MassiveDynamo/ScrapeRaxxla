Has anyone visited Adamastor and checked cargo and hackable radio transmitter? I've used hatchbreaker and recon limpets and got no cargo & no data, although the data transfer display seemed to be doing something. Frustrating! But it's probably me misusing them as I've not used these things for a long time.

But apparently in a livestream an FDev said something like "have you checked the cargo and data"?
