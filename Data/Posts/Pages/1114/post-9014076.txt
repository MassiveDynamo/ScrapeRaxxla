Catching up, been mostly asleep since Friday due to Covid, over the worst now I think.

There was that thing about Raxxla being near Lave and roaming around, so possibly looking for some rogue planet type of thing, like someone else said in another thread.

Think this was old lore. There a (iirc) Beacon in Lave certifying Lave 2 as Laves 'lost moon' which kind of references the old lore, ties it up and settles it.
