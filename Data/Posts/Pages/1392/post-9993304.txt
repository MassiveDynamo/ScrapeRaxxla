Looking at NASA's System map Mimas is outside of the ring formation, ive also flown around many times over the past couple of days and its not there.

Or just bad design, bug report it. Not everything in or not in game is intentional.

There is no Saturn hexagon, even though it’s been known since early 80s. Duplicated stars off separate databases, some with known errors were never corrected. Just because it’s in game or is not in game game does not denote the hand of god, it usually just identifies the hand of the slapdash or complacency of accepting secondhand data as true.
