Thanks @Darrack that's great info. Interesting that this suggests that a decision was made to exclude Mimas (Hyperion is a weird wibbly rock, but Mimas is/should be an actual round moon!)

Everyone, the kind people at EDDB discord came through with some great info - convo posted below.

TLDR:
Mimas was added to the EDDB on 5th Feb 2017 (3304)
No way to know if it was manually added
It's listed as a BLACK HOLE
Speculation is that since the type id for a black hole is '1' it may have just been the default entry type.

SPOILER: EDDB MIMAS DISCORD CONVO

Make of that what you will, Raxxla hunters!
