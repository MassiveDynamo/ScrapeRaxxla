That's okay. I think most of this is based on a Michael Brookes edit of a document I originally wrote. It looks accurate. I can check it against the documentation I have, but I'd rather not start doing that too much (see reason below).

I can't recall the final decision on 'Quirium'. The concept of 'Quirium' was one that was intended to be phased out in favour of the Sirius Corporation's monopoly/influence.

In general, I'm reluctant to go into too much detail here as the drafts I have will be pre-edited versions and would be subject to change by Frontier after I had completed the drafting.

With regards to the 2b to current FSD drives. As I mentioned, I will try to reach out to Frontier and resend the last document I wrote about this (and Stardreamer). From that point, it would be up to them to use/tweak/publish/etc. Generally, that's the way I've tried to work with all this.

Thanks! Totally understand that you don't want to get into the weeds
