Always worth a shot O7

One better might have been. ‘Do the codexes in game relate to lore based information or identifiable content which can be visibly confirmed currently by players currently interaction, it is unclear what their purposes are, as FD has in at least 1 occasion confirmed said codexes information related to content which cannot be interacted with, and is likely archived. Do all the codex’s point to something in game, if this is not true why is there this inconsistency?

The prong is to tip the hat and reveal a tell, ping interest off the Dev team, cross examination with their own information, don’t mention Raxxla, get them into an analysis of logic, put them in a linguistic cul-de-sac that demands a response.

Bait and switch.
