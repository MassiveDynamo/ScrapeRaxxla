Had a reply from CS re Saturn
Hey there CMDR,

Thanks for getting in touch with us.

When Elite Dangerous was created, Saturn actually had 62 moons! Only six of these are landable in game.

At this current point in time, Saturn has up to 83 moons, with 63 moons confirmed and named and another 20 moons awaiting confirmation of discovery.

We cannot comment on whether or not more moons of Saturn will be made landable in the future.

I hope this clarifies things for you! Please let us know if you have any other queries.

So no confirmation of the missing two, but it could be intentional if they paid so much attention to the current system.
They must be getting fed up with Raxxla related questions, for their patience and fast reply's
