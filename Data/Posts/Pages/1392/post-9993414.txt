It did it again! Ship jump range 60+ ly, got in game for a short while this afternoon & found one jump was only 11 ly! No NS in the route, so whatâ€™s happening??
The route plotter sometimes plots inexplicably short jumps in (longer?) routes.
I would guess it happens around the middle point, as if the plotter works from both ends towards the other and the feelers don't quite meet each other.
