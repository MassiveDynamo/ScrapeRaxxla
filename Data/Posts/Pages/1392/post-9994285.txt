Just saw.... FSS Updates to include "Thargoid Rouge Signal Sources"....

I've said it before, and I'll say it again...

Raxxla is a Rouge planet, we just never had any tools or proof until now to prove that.

We now have the thargoid UA signals moving system to system, and a Rouge signal added to the FSS.... plus Rouge was already a "star" type.

All of the mechanics for Raxxla to be a traveling Rouge.

We have to find the "path", or take the "journey" to find it...
I called this my best, most likely theory like 2 years ago, and it's just being proven more and more now...

So, any thoughts on where the trail might actually begin? Or how we track/find the path Raxxla is on?

It's likely to be similar to the moving UI when it's in a system, moving, but not as fast, and yea... I'm more excited about the hunt for raxxla now then at any point in the last 2 years...
