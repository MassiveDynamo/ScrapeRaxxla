Mmm. There’s a theory that there may be a grapefruit-size black hole in our solar system (can’t remember where I saw that). So it might be worth searching around Mimas’ orbit to see if the Omphalos Rift appears/you fall into it.

Edit:think it was supposed to be in the Oort Cloud, perhaps a possibility for Planet X?
In which case not an explorable region for us atm? ie not in SOL
