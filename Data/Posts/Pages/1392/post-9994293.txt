Just saw.... FSS Updates to include "Thargoid Rouge Signal Sources"....

I've said it before, and I'll say it again...

Raxxla is a Rouge planet, we just never had any tools or proof until now to prove that.

We now have the thargoid UI signals moving system to system, and a Rouge signal added to the FSS.... plus Rouge was already a "star" type.

All of the mechanics for Raxxla to be a traveling Rouge.

We have to find the "path", or take the "journey" to find it...
I called this my best, most likely theory like 2 years ago, and it's just being proven more and more now...

So, any thoughts on where the trail might actually begin? Or how we track/find the path Raxxla is on?

It's likely to be similar to the moving UI when it's in a system, moving, but not as fast, and yea... I'm more excited about the hunt for raxxla now then at any point in the last 2 years...

My guess is unless someone makes a staggering discovery or uses some third party hack they wont introduce Raxxla just yet.
I think the Thargoid thing is a completely separate story (for now), im more inclined to think that Raxxla has more in common with the Guardians.

Im just of the idea that Raxxla after all these years is just such a huge deal than to be brought out as Elites Chrimbo special.
