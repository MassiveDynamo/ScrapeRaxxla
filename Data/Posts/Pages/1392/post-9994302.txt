My guess is unless someone makes a staggering discovery or uses some third party hack they wont introduce Raxxla just yet.
I think the Thargoid thing is a completely separate story (for now), im more inclined to think that Raxxla has more in common with the Guardians.

Im just of the idea that Raxxla after all these years is just such a huge deal than to be brought out as Elites Chrimbo special.

Oh yes, thargoid and raxxla are two separate things, I'm just using the thargoids as proof of how Raxxla could exist, even if they are different stories entirely

What i was trying to say, until now really, we never had anything to prove "rogue" things could or did exist in game, beyond the star class in the manual. Now we have 2 pieces of proof, the thargoid UA moving thru systems, and the FSS upgrade to see the UA.

So now it's a lot more likely that Raxxla could be a hidden Rogue planet, and we might finally have a tool to discover it... but we still need to find it and track it reliably, never mind getting to it yet...
Add-on: Raxxla likely won't show up from a different system, only the system it's in, and who knows from what distance... still a needle in a galactic hay stack, but atleast we have a tiny fridge magnet now? Lol
