What's this? You meant to jump 60ly and only jumped 11?
No, my ship is capable of 60+ly, so I was very surprised to find a hop that was only planned to be 11ly.
I think Zieman is probably right-the route planner must work together from both ends of the route and could end up with a short hop near the middle. Though I don’t think I’m near the middle yet!!!
