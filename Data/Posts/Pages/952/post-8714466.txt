Yes, I agree. I suspect AHTW etc were all written before the retcon, which was FDâ€™s attempt to rationalise everything.
Soontill and and CEIP were invented because Raxxla and TDW were basically off limits, for the non in-huse authors.

The retcon didn't change much. The only major change, was that the Alliance / Thargoid meetings in the late 2350s were deleted from history. The rest of the mismatches between the books and the game are just sloppiness and poor communication. The in-game mismatches (between actual events and codex / beacons) are mainly due to bugs that lead to things happening in the wrong order.
