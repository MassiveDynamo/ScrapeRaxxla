Would these Thargoid treasures have any connection to the latest burning stations? A certain shadowy organisation distributing shiny alien tech as a means to influence the political landscape?

Until the retcon I would have agreed with you. But if TDW are “explorers and treasure hunters” they probably won’t be interested in the political landscape. Thargoid explosives are more in the domain of INRA/AEGIS & hence The Club, who most definitely are interested in the political landscape (& maintaining their position/control).
