Funn little side quest, for anyone in the bubble: Find Rafe Zetter's Anaconda, in Tionisla. It is supposed to be stationary at 0.1 ly from the star.

I cant help myself, Im triggered every time. Theres at least one place in that system where theyve hidden 1000s of ships for 100s of years, every time Ive been there theyre just hidden, even a recent addition, an ancient cobra cant actually be found or seen. I think this one thing would make me more happy than anything else in game.
