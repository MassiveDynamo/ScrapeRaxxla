It's still trying. Crunching away. I've maxed out the physical memory of the machine and it's now paging to and from the hard disk, on a 32GB machine.

Not sure how possible this is gonna be via my methods.
I wrote me a small program and can do that as a datastream => No mem problems. But where is the download of a file with all the systems + bodies. I only find systems with coos â€“ no bodies. (~7.8GByte)
