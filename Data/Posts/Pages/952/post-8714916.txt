The in-game lack of Tionisla Graveyard is a huge immersion breaker. It was a key part of the original Holdstock novella for heaven's sake! as well as more recent lore.
I suspect FD just can't create a good representation (include cost-effectively there if you want) given the instancing limitations. After all it is supposed to have thousands of ships of complex shapes orbiting a planet, with a station for the administrative authority....

great shame though!
