@Jorki Rasalas I am going through Lost Realms over a cup of tea and reading the story of Avalon pages 18-29.

A story well known to many but I’m reading this in the context of simply information gathering, treating the text as an original influence for Brookes in game.

Lost Realms opens up with a discussion on Eden, listing various other realms as similar examples. Then theres an interesting insight with the first chapter on Avalon on page 19 with the boat that carried Arthur, “rowed by three dark robed women”…

Later these same women are revisited on page 26, “Arthur is taken, in a barge occupied entirely by women, one of whom if the Fay - Morgan. Repeatedly the image of three women or three queens, is encountered in the literature, Black clad mournful they are the three faces of the tri-partite goddess of ancient times - fecundity, motherhood and the hag of death”.

Fecundity means fertile. The tri-partite goddess is the maiden, the mother and the crone; symbolism for the female life cycle and phases of the moon.

I can’t not help but think this might be just the source of inspiration, in game for why Hecate, Demeter, Artemis link to Brookes ‘Elite Legacy’.

Going to pick through this text for some time. Not sure if it will lead anywhere, but Ai do believe it further solidifies the Yggdrasil, Underworld theory - and at most may help better define this area, is it a focus point, does it point elsewhere, time will tell…
