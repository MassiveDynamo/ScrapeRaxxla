Preaching to the choir. It has been my dream since first reading The Alien World to see that truth of that book come to life, as I always Knew it would. And well, here we are. I've been saying it for years. The fact that this has led to PMD2009 48 and Orion is just, well, fulfilling. I am incredibly eager to see the next step unfold, regardless of the outcome.
It's actually Part 1, just never bothered correcting the thumbnail.
I think we have to be a little careful here, there's an elephant in the room/book, we can defo use the text (even if TDW is described as a place) but we need to ignore the visual references in the book, they are a collection of pictures from artists with narration added afterwards.
