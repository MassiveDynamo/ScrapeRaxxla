The three women could also be the Fates (Moirai) … who in Platos Myth of Er are tied to the celestial axis and Fortuna…. The three inputs in the Thargoid device … Also there are a variety of axis mundi myths… with rivers. Trees. Poles,…. And Mountains. Maybe look at Mount Meru. Axis is always associated with snakes and birds. Cobras ..and Eagles…. I even wonder about Onion Head…. The Avestan Homa and Vedic Soma/ Amrita are tied to the creation myth and the celestial pole - Samudra Manthan…. Even the names and various logos of Companies in this game… ya im just rambling on -but even if we never find it - i appreciate what Fdev have done here.
