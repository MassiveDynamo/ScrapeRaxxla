This afternoon I dropped in on all the belt clusters of the B Belts of the B stars in Quivira and HIP 114458. I also mapped the gas giant with rings (planet B2) in Quivira and the 8th moon (B 2 h) in HIP 114458. Nothing unusual to report.

It is very easy to burn out doing this kind of searching. I'll do the A Belt of the B star in HIP 114458 next time I log in.

A part of me feels uneasy that Raxxla might be lurking in a belt cluster, especially if the belt cluster is in an inhabited system. I can understand it not being found if it is millions of Ls into deep space but these belts are surely being mined by NPCs and right after I drop in there is usually a NPC or three following me.

I feel that I am looking in the wrong way, even if I am in the right region of space.
