Picking through Holdstocks Lost Realms, and I’m focusing on how certain names are grouped together.

I’m going to attempt and replicate this in game, this may add a few more ‘sectors’ eg ‘Holdstocks Eden’s’ or ‘Lands of youth’ etc.

One thing struck me on an initial search, is a few systems (I need to tally and cross check this - so totally tin-foil) have references to other myth, eg a planet named after a god, or more interestingly ‘mountains’.

@GURU-951 you touched upon a mountain theory in the past. I believe this still has some relevance, as I wonder if it’s some form of identifyer?

Brookes used the term several times in his blogs about mountains. Elite Legacy also referred to Saxon mountain men, and Lost Realms also mentioned ‘world mountains’…it’s likely just another clue towards Yggdrasil but I wonder if it’s more like an identifying signature?
