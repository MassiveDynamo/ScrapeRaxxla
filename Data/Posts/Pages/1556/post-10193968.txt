Orion correlation theory - Wikipedia

Our sacred duty as CMDRS was rebuilding Raxxla after a fortuitous set of mistakes by the Oisir-Raxxlans. This is why only humanity has snake symbolism everywhere. Unlike every other species, humanity was not enslaved. We became the equals of the Raxxlans.


Preaching to the choir. It has been my dream since first reading The Alien World to see that truth of that book come to life, as I always Knew it would. And well, here we are. I've been saying it for years. The fact that this has led to PMD2009 48 and Orion is just, well, fulfilling. I am incredibly eager to see the next step unfold, regardless of the outcome.
It's actually Part 1, just never bothered correcting the thumbnail.
