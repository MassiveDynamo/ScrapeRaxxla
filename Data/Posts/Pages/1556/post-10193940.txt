So I tried with some alignments and the Brookes Tour. I figured the Thargoid Axis and the Adamastor route were good tests.. The Adamastor and the Hesperus were supposedly heading in the direction of Barnards Loop - but from the bits of the route the Adamastor was initally taking (before being diverted) - it was headed towards the Witch Head. I thought it interesting that the line between Artemis and PMD2009 48 crossed at its rough half way point with the half way point of the Merope -Col70 line. But that area had been extensively surveyed already. I went out but didnt see anything....
