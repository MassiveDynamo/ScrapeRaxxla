Lets not forget Femi Dakarai
Just realized BigSix (the audit firm) may be coded language referencing Raxxla. The codex image linked to Raxxla - note the 6 dark sections. Seriously, need to figure out what the hell this thing represents. Is this Omphalos Rift? Though, in a way it looks like an Orbis. In any case, Femi Dakarai clearly found something he wasn't supposed to have found and was removed.
