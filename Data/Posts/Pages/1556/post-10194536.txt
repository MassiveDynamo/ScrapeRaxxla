Posting this because CMDR @Dylan D made a discovery that seems interesting and may be linked to Halsey and possibly Raxxla itself in Ross 860. For the record, I still believe our understanding of installations is woefully poor. Anyway, posting it for visibility sake especially as this may require signals analysis. Please pay attention to some of the structures he got pictures. This seems to jive with the Raxxla logo.

Freelance Report: R̶̳̊ẹ̶̽d̴͈͐ä̵͎c̷̥͐t̶̢̅e̵͉̅d̴̜̂ Discovery
After exploring the original Spaceflight One route that Jasmina Halsey traveled, I've found something very interesting. Discovered or re-discovered, this has been the closest I've gotten to Raxxla. But I'm not there yet. My heart literally sank as the realization arrived. Its more than just...

A further reminder. The Dan Romero / Halsey vision of a heavenly glow has been validated as in-game and connected to blackholes. I think we need to treat the installations and other permanent POIs as possibly part larger components that make up Raxxla in totality.

The Halsey "heavenly glow":


This may be connected to events linked to Stargate Trax and its' sub-branches from "Tour of the Universe". Events happen on December 24th, 2286. There is a secondary event that occurs on June 15th, 2306.




Both Antares and Starship One are apparently ships that disappeared into the Stargate. Both were Saud Kruger Narwhal Liners. We need to understand what happened. The dates match with Raxxla. If there are Stargates, they must be found.

We have a map from the Galactic Cooperative with approximate locations though distance is not provided.



Ross 860 and Luyten 205-128 may be our best bets at understanding what this Raxxla business is all about.
