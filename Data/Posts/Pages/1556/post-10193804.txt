There are a few more systems in that area I have probably not found / plotted. Reading Holdstocks Lost Realms only today identified at least two new ones I had never heard of - linked to realms of eternal youth.

Initially before Holdstock I focused on the Codex text, before I read the Lost Realms text I actually found a number of odd named systems which I interpreted as being linked to the codex, but could not marry them thinking they were too wide; Holdstocks Lost Realms is a little more expansive - including lost islands, fairies and lands of eternal youth etc. and some of these marry the list I have…

The area is no larger for it, as they too are focused around the same axis, I just need to plot some more to find them all…

Interestingly one or two are off the beaten track… I wonder if it’s a breadcrumb trial and it leads elsewhere? Too soon to say, I’ll be re-focusing on mapping these systems against the Holdstock notes and publishing a new map.

But either way my thinking is they purposefully obfuscated Raxxla within a potpourri of other lost realms!
