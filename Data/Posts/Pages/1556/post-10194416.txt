The three women could also be the Fates (Moirai) … who in Platos Myth of Er are tied to the celestial axis and Fortuna…. The three inputs in the Thargoid device … Also there are a variety of axis mundi myths… with rivers. Trees. Poles,…. And Mountains. Maybe look at Mount Meru. Axis is always associated with snakes and birds. Cobras ..and Eagles…. I even wonder about Onion Head…. The Avestan Homa and Vedic Soma/ Amrita are tied to the creation myth and the celestial pole - Samudra Manthan…. Even the names and various logos of Companies in this game… ya im just rambling on -but even if we never find it - i appreciate what Fdev have done here.
Yes, the number three keeps coming back.
Even the Raxxla symbol in your avatar - the three arcs about the sun-symbol, then six shapes on the outside.
I wonder if it is a hint about the system to look for:
A single star with three inner planets, a belt (maybe with the same number of clusters as dashes outside the three arcs), then six large planets.
Even if that's not it and it's instead displaying a 2D representation of a sphere in a cube, or something else, the problem is more that there are too many pointers rather than too few, with myths from many cultures appearing in system and planet names...
