Sirius Corporation has 5 people killed including the lead investigator of the Antares and Starship One disasters in the GalNet "Five Killed in Shuttle Accident". The problem being: this was no accident. This was burying the past.

Everyone onboard the shuttle was killed including Sean Richards, a senior consultant engineer who helped to compile the incident report on the recent disappearance of Starship One. Richards had also formed part of the task force some 50 years earlier with the Antares enquiry.
