Picture was from Wikipedia. I just remembered from numerous documentaries that main pyramid complex seems to match Orion's belt and this idea has since been expanded to other ancient sites. Cited it precisely because Holdstock mentioned the pyramids directly.
Completely agree, sorry never meant the Pyramids bit, early on on my Guardian explorations i tried to find similarity's to the pyramids (as you rightly point out they are mentioned in the book).
When i first got the book back in the 80's i didnt feal that the text matched the pictures, a friend of mine who was an album cover artist knew some of the folks that actually did the pictures, Holdstock/Eisler i believe used the pictures, they were never intended to actually relate to his writings so im careful not to relate the pictures to ED.
