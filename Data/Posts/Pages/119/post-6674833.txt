I am practically new to this and it might have been searched before in previous posts i but what if we stick to the "A door thats also the key"?

It might be nothing but Porta is the Greek word for DOOR and Porta orbital in 39 Tauri is around aD pontes which is described as "a paradise , The Planet of the Zodiac , and a holiday destination "..... with population of 150 million.

This may be stupid but some secrets are hidden under our noses sometimes. Maybe a Triple elite pilot getting there with some specific cargo could trigger some sort of interaction?......

i will give it a try later this week.
