Going off the theme that "RAXXLA" is somehow an indicator of a set of coordinates ...

I don't know ... maybe we take a similar tact as the Rift only, instead of a line from Reorte to Riedquat, we draw a line from Sol through coordinates 20, ?, 21 and search every "Y" coordinate that falls along the "X/Z" axis?

Just sticking my head in to say 'hi' to the folks whose name I recognize and to say Jaiotu, you still have some of the coolest theories. Clearly in that series XX would have been 42 so 20,42,21.
