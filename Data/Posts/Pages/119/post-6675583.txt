Another thing i haven't tried out yet and don't know if any1 did, is try to bring a UA in Shinratra Dezhra and locate a Encoded or degraded USS. I want to sse if UA interact with Datamined wake exceptions or Eccentric hyperspace tranjectories there . The basis here is that ship wrecks related to scanning eccentric hyperspace tranjectories, anomalous FSD telemetries, and weird wake exceptions to a system in which The Dark Wheel and Pilots Federation have so much influence and its already a candidate might not be a coincidense.
