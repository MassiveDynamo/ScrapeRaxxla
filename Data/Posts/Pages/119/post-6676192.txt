I don't think Raxxla is a planet... The thing is, that we are asking ourselves for years now, where Raxxla is. Mabe we need to change our perpectives. Think of Raxxla as something else. Maybe the question isn't "Where is Raxxla?" but rather "What is Raxxla?" or even "Who is Raxxla?"

Think of it. Hiding a planet is difficult these days with this technology. Hiding a person is way easier. Or this person is hiding.

I'll just quote Rafe Zetter from The Dark Wheel on this one: 'Raxxla's no alien, Alex. It's a ghost world. A planet. A legend . . .'
