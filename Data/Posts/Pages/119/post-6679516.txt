The only thing they found out is Soontill. No more mention on Raxxla?...Only people with full knowledge of the lore can be more specific.

The understanding that I get from reading And Here the Wheel is that the CIEPers broke away from TDW because Soontill seamed like an easier target and apparently it was because they did locate Soontill and setup a base of operations from there. You are right ... there is no indication that The Dark Wheel ever found Raxxla though it is interesting that The Dark Wheel minor faction seems to have settled down in Shinrarta Dhezra and we don't really see there vessels out scouring the galaxy as one would expect if they were truly still off on the quest.

The only mentions in the "new lore" that I'm aware of are in And Here the Wheel where we learn of CIEP's connection to TDW and the Ryders and in Elite: Legacy where it is mentioned that Julia had dreamed of being the first to find Raxxla. Of course the Children of Raxxla are mentioned in Drew Wagar's Premonition but I don't think Raxxla itself is discussed. This is all strictly from memory though and I may have missed something.
