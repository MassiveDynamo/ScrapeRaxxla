After a little digging and research, I’m convinced that the system that contains Raxxla has 3 planets. There are two sources for this: the main source is The Dark Wheel symbol. It has 3 planets, each a different size, located within one of the rings on the symbol. They are out of place with the rest of the symbol, and really stood out to me. The second confirmation of 3 planets is this old picture of a Raxxla footpedal, that has 3 planets, each of different size, and a picture of a constellation. There is also a bright star on that picture. Note that the Shinrarta Dehzra System also has 3 different sized planets not really connected to any star, but the star can be seen in the distance. This info seemed to be a noteworthy piece of the puzzle, but maybe I’m just late to the party.

A couple of other clues I may have found were from overlaying and flipping The Dark Wheel symbol onto the galaxy map, following the spirals. We know that Raxxla is located in the “outer rim”, but it will be hard to determine the exact location. The Dark Wheel symbol has an “outer rim”, but I can’t decipher where Raxxla would fall on that rim. Perhaps where the 3 planets line up? The Dark Wheel symbol includes the Elite symbol, denoting needing Elite status for something. Specifically, it looks like the Elite Explorer symbol. The most difficult part to decipher about the symbol is the keyed middle rings, not sure what those are for.

I guess this all depends on who made that symbol and whether or not it is official. Looks like the Children of Raxxla use it too.
