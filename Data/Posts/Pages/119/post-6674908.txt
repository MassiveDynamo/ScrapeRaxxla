i am definately not that dedicated... I don;t even know if CQC is even a thing after all this time and really if its required for Raxxla search (assuming it exeists) then let that secret never be unveiled. At least from my perspective.

LOL. Yes ... it would be very cruel if CQC rank were a requirement to unlock Raxxla. I don't think there are enough people still playing it to make achieving CQC Elite possible (and yet that little red 'Helpless" rank sits there and haunts and torments me).
