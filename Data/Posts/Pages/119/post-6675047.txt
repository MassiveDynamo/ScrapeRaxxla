LOL. Yes ... it would be very cruel if CQC rank were a requirement to unlock Raxxla. I don't think there are enough people still playing it to make achieving CQC Elite possible (and yet that little red 'Helpless" rank sits there and haunts and torments me).

Wave back at it whilst viewing it through a glass of Lavian Brandy!
