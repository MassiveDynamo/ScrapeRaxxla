‘those with eyes to see’

This line always had me thinking about John Milton, who was blind. But obviously this could just be an invocation for us to read ‘Princess Astrophel’ (Elite Legacy) for clues!

Then with all this hullabaloo with Greek gods, trees and the underworld, it got me thinking of Micheal Brookes tattoo again. At the bottom centre there is a figure, seemingly beset by flying demons.

What if these were actually harpies, and that figure was actually Phineus, who was a seer, given the gift of prophecy by Apollo.

In his writings Milton relates his blindness to that of the character Phineus.

Sadly can’t find him in game…
