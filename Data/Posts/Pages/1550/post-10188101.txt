Good catch with the triviatii system! Interesting….. Ya always a sucker for Hekate hunting.
Hecate->Triviatii...the three-way path/journey:

“The Threefold Way is a shortened version of the Noble Eightfold Path. The Buddha taught that the path to nirvana requires three main approaches, which together are known as the Threefold Way. These can be summarised as ethics, meditation, and wisdom.”

Where does this lead???

Ommmmmmm.... I have absolutely no idea!
