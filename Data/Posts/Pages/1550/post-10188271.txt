Back to the Gateless Gate?
Gateway, perhaps? Didn't Michael Brookes say something to the effect of kind of obvious?

- Michael Brookes: "It's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where at this stage. It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves." - There will be no clues, "but I think you'd have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious so people know what they're doing."

This is after all they system with the planet Hope. It was also one of few systems other than Lave that confirmed names had been changed over time. The system was previously known as Oltiqu. Furthermore, it was where the Wiccan Ware Race originated out of Old Currie station which is now known by New Chernobyl. Hope it seems is a dangerous thing. Old Currie here being a reference to Marie Currie who discovered Radium. The system also has the stunningly beautiful Wicca Town orbis station.

NOTE: Gateway was instrumental in deducing the current name of Veliaze (see "Galactic News: The Thargoids") is Zelada.
