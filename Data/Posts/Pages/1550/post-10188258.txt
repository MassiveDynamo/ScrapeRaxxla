Synuefe YW-T b36-3? something significant about that? Only 2 stars...
I see that if the journey is from life through the Underworld to Paradise...then Paradiso and Arcadian both only have two stars (though latter also an asteroid belt).
Been to Avalon but saw nothing.
If I calculated correctly it should be in the same plane as Sol, Regor and COL 70 Sector FY-N c21-3, with a 120 degree angle between the three vectors.

Iâ€™m on the phone only, so there is a chanse of errors
