It's the same thing. If a rouge planet passes through a system, it's a guest there. Given that it has enough momentum, it will eventually leave again.
If it doesn't, it may get absorbed in the system and eventually get a stable orbit.

Yeah. Well, I was forgetting that, in this game where even light is faster than light, a rogue planet also could be FTL ....
What I mean is, there is some lore describing Raxxla as a "rogue planet", so at some time it was. If now it is bound to a system or visiting...it must have moved very fast since.
But NVM
