I don't believe that there is any canon lore implying that Raxxla is a rogue planet. If memory serves the Rogue Planet concept comes from Drew Wagar's very excellent Oolite Saga which is a work of fan fiction. Don't get me wrong; that doesn't disqualify the rogue planet theory it just means that it isn't backed up by any canonical sources.

Fair point. Always the same problem. Finding something we don't know what it is exactly... in a haysack.
