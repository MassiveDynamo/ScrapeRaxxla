Interesting, but doesn't it seem a bit far fetched to want Raxxla to be both a rogue planet AND a guest body in a system ? Isn't it more logical if Raxxla were either one OR the other?

It's the same thing. If a rouge planet passes through a system, it's a guest there. Given that it has enough momentum, it will eventually leave again.
If it doesn't, it may get absorbed in the system and eventually get a stable orbit.
