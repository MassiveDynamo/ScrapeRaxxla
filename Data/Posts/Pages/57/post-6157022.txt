So, no longer a rogue planet ?

“Rogue planet” can have a couple of meanings. The conventional astronomical one is that it’s a planet that does not belong (natively or captured) to a star, and wanders a lonely path through space. There was a recent astronomical titbit in the BBC News/Science that such a planet might still be warm enough to sustain life through radioactive decay at its core. The alternative is that Raxxla has an alien structure that can cause it to move between star systems; in one story (in DrewW’s Oolite saga, not ED canon) it was a moon of Lave before it moved elsewhere.
