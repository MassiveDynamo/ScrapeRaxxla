Itâ€™s in-game/Galnet so is ED canon. I would love to have a good of the FD internal lore book! What was the date setting for the Dark Wheel, does that fit this date?

I think the original Cobra Mk III was released around 3100AD. Since Alex Ryder and Elyssia Fields stole an old one from the Tionisla Graveyard the events of The Dark Wheel would have to have happened after 3200.
