Total speculation: I'd assume from that date that early in the establishing of the Faraway network an expedition ran across Raxxla. If that's accurate then it lends a lot of weight to the idea that Raxxla must be in the bubble - maybe even very close to the core worlds.

The Dark Wheel novella also indicates that a mishap in Faraway could result in time travel. It could be that Raxxla doesn't exist yet and instead of going out in search of Raxxla we should be staying home and building it.
