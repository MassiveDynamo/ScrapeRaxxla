Yeah. Well, I was forgetting that, in this game where even light is faster than light, a rogue planet also could be FTL ....
What I mean is, there is some lore describing Raxxla as a "rogue planet", so at some time it was. If now it is bound to a system or visiting...it must have moved very fast since.
But NVM

I don't believe that there is any canon lore implying that Raxxla is a rogue planet. If memory serves the Rogue Planet concept comes from Drew Wagar's very excellent Oolite Saga which is a work of fan fiction. Don't get me wrong; that doesn't disqualify the rogue planet theory it just means that it isn't backed up by any canonical sources.
