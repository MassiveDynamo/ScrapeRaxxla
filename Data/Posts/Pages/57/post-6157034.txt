In Salomé's message from Beagle Point during the Distant Worlds Expedition she said that the first mention of Raxxla was recorded in the year 2814. While it is possible that Drew Wagar just made that date up I sincerely doubt it. I think Drew got that date from Frontier. Not fully sure how much we can trust Salomé's message since it sits in a "not-quite-canon" space ... though her message was live streamed by Frontier Developments themselves.


It’s in-game/Galnet so is ED canon. I would love to have a good read of the FD internal lore book! What was the date setting for the Dark Wheel, does that fit this date?
