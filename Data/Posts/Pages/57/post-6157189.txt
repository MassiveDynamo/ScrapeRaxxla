In Salomé's message from Beagle Point during the Distant Worlds Expedition she said that the first mention of Raxxla was recorded in the year 2814. While it is possible that Drew Wagar just made that date up I sincerely doubt it. I think Drew got that date from Frontier. Not fully sure how much we can trust Salomé's message since it sits in a "not-quite-canon" space ... though her message was live streamed by Frontier Developments themselves.

That's shortly after the Faraway network was established, the dawn of commercial Hyperspace travel -literally - in the older Lore it was established in the 2800's and dismantled around 3100. While that might have been retconned, the 2800-ish date is still listed as the start of commercial hyperspace travel: https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/07-JAN-3303.

Total speculation: I'd assume from that date that early in the establishing of the Faraway network an expedition ran across Raxxla. If that's accurate then it lends a lot of weight to the idea that Raxxla must be in the bubble - maybe even very close to the core worlds.
