I think I prove the important story is Sun Dragon .

No one CMDR was supposed to have been this powerful.

Buckle up, The Dark Wheel has been found. Nothing good will come of this development. My warning that we don't actually want to find them has come to pass.

Brooks Estate is there with a clever misspelling to hide the connection. Tau Ceti has Ortiz Moreno City. Sol has Mars High amongst others.

You asked for this. I warned you all years ago that you should be careful about what you wish for. Sometimes those come true. SWARM is in Pi-Fang (yes, NPC faction) and I am not sure you want to know the implications. Let's just say when Braben said hard, dystopian science fiction he didn't exactly kid. As a preview of coming attractions, read up on the lyrics of Electric Wizard which has a song "Ivixor B" which is cryptic reference to Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide. Enjoy the nightmares.

I'll never see the world behind the stargates.
