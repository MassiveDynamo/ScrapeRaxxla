Because most casual players don't even realize what ( or if ) they've discovered?
Sure. I don't know what I'm looking for out here so someone who wasn't looking for it might not recognise it either. But that doesn't give me any hints towards what I should be looking for either...

Also because of the whole vastness fact of , even after 10 years, players have only explored " barely 1% of existing EliteD universe" and all that?
True in the case of a random system. I'm poking around in and near one of the most well-explored nebulae in the game that's been a waypoint of multiple organised expeditions. Every system here has been repeatedly scanned and many of them have full sets of first mapped and first footfall tags too. If there's something here, it's either hidden in such a way that normal exploration tools won't find it, or it's in plain sight in such a way that normal exploration tools won't highlight it.

Which is of course very hard to tell apart from "there's nothing at all here, maybe the weird arrangement of SAO stars is just one of those things"
