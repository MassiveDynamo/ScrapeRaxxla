Some reminders and some new information.

- This is the the 4th game in a series. Therefore, the past cannot just be dismissed as irrelevant.



The Alleged Toast of The Dark Wheel is part of the Raxxla entry. The Knowledge Base is a product of Elite Pilots' Federation in Shinrarta Dezhra. There is a great deal of secrecy surrounding Pilots' Federation and Elite Pilots' Federation of which The Dark Wheel is one clique. Financially, The Pilots' Federation financially controls most of the Bubble at least indirectly (though there are significant questions regarding native factions).

Regarding, the part of the Raxxla Knowledge Base about "Princess Astrophel and the Spiraling Stars", I believe that is a metaphor for the real story which may well be hinted at in Elite: Legacy.


I believe this story is Sun Dragon by Michael Brookes and its companion website that has since gone down Tau Ceti Mission. It was developed in parallel to the Raxxla puzzle. The Tau Ceti Mission was an expansion of sorts to Sun Dragon. Sun Dragon is presently on Amazon and various e-book stores.

What was the phrase in Elite: Legacy?
... a single book about a young man's quest to save a princess from an alien dragon. My father must have bought it on the black market. He couldn't have gotten it from anywhere else.

Fortunately, I have the complete Tau Ceti Mission.
