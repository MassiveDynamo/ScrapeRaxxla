Many of the aspects of the Devine Comedy marries the theoretical aspects in game. Oddly none of those actually physically correlate as much as they do with Milton’s Cosmology, which can be interpreted to be in game. But the story of Dante’s is about love of and it involves a mountain, and important a spiralling path whose summit (Eden) is beset by stars…?
The reason I lean towards Spiraling Stars referencing Sun Dragon is Draco, the spiraling constellation guarding the northern celestial sphere as viewed from Earth. Draco means Dragon.

We've lost several female protagonists over the years that got involved in The Dark Wheel. One of them even visited Mars High in Sol. The legends are unanimous on one point - that a great celestial bear (Ursa Major) is visible from a key system proving the rumors of Raxxla is real. TDW makes countless references to Sol directly as does Lavian Brandy. Maybe understanding what went down with Tau Ceti and Mayflower 97 is the key. There is the massive problem of Capella after all.
