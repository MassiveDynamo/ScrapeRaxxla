I've always been pretty convinced that the Dark Wheel in SD is a fake, and the secret missions against them stopped because the player base expanded it to much.

Unfortunately as one guy I cant shrink it back down to SD and also feel bad for the other players - but a public figure like that goes against everything the Dark Wheel shows to originally stand for.

I do always wonder if it was decreased to SD again if some of the missions will come back.
