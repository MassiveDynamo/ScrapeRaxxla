Seems worth a trawl through the exploration databases for it, though it'll take a while for me to get the right sort of search to pick all of those conditions up.
Having done this experiment, I think I can conclude at least one of these things must be true
1) The Codex picture isn't of the Dark Wheel station
2) The DW station is not actually around an 8th moon of a gas giant
3) The DW station is in an extremely unusual system - possibly fully hand-edited, but otherwise "world of death" level rarity - which has probably not yet been discovered at all
4) The star is a distant red giant (or some other extremely large red star) after all and there's some other explanation for the visual artefacts which make it look like a nearby red dwarf.

8th moons around cobinary gas giants (or around gas giants themselves orbiting a star) aren't unheard of - but either the gas giant is the heavier object in its cobinary system, or the radius of the cobinary system is far too large - even allowing a separation of 200Ls where the star would be a tiny dot rather than the necessary 10Ls seems to only allow for Y-class stars to be part of this configuration, not even the larger brown dwarf classes.

This makes sense - a complex moon system shouldn't be stable within a few Ls of any stellar-mass object - but means that the picture is likely just of some random Orbis orbiting a planet near a star. Disappointing if so given that it's one of the few pieces of apparent information available, but never mind.
