The timing doesn't work for that - the Dark Wheel's first (possibly accidental) expansion out of Shinrarta wasn't until late 2018, and the missions had been gone for years by that point. The deliberate attempts to get it into control of that second system to make a second expansion didn't start until even later - May 2020.
Well my memory was out then

I thought the missions were 2018 and TDW was gaining rep at the same time. Ill sit back down
