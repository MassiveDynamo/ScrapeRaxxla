This lines up nicely with the regional hubs that are the Nostrum Starports - on of which is in Tau Ceti (Ortiz Moreno City). You've probably heard me call them stations. Of note, there is Brooks Estate in Pi-Fang that is another. I am not sure if the spelling is altered to hide the connection. That, too, is one of the special starports.
Didn't a Nostrum starport explode in Tau Ceti killing thousands?
