I take the 'toast' in the Codex to be word-of-god regarding what the Dark Wheel know about Raxxla, I have assumed (but there's no info either way) that the 'toast' contains all the info the Dark Wheel knew historically about Raxxla, and that it forms the basis of "the Quest" as undertaken by the early Dark Wheel.
I've been considering the interpretation of "to" in the toast lately. The obvious one of course is "in honour of". But what if it means "towards" (as in "to the batmobile"). Could it be a map? You go to the jewel, and then from there you go to the whisperer (which maybe isn't obvious as that from anywhere else), and so on. That would at least be a multi-stage puzzle which gave you some hint that you were on the right lines as you went along, especially after you'd got a few of them right.

This one came to mind while poking around NGC 7822. I'd followed the arrow here, and then noticed ...

... this mysterious hole in the galactic plane that I was sure wasn't there before. It's not Raxxla, it's just the Crescent Nebula, viewed from a particularly fortunate combination of distance and direction, but maybe the toast is a series of clues to be followed in that way.
(Nebula visibility and even appearance has changed enough times since the game's original release that they are probably not the waypoints themselves, though. NGC 7822 is a tempting but unconvincing candidate for the "jewel" while the Crescent Nebula doesn't look like a wanderer or siren and anyway the deepest void is in the other direction. I'm not claiming this as the actual start of that path, if that's what it is)
