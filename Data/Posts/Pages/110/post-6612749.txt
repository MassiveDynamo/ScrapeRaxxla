Anyone know the type of Hyperdrive during the events of The Dark Wheel book? From what I understand, it was the quirium drive? I may be wrong, it's a bit early for me to dive down into this rabbit hole before my coffee so I'm sure I'm gonna miss a thing or two. As we all are, I'm trying to find Cirag. In the dark wheel novel, they're in one place and suddenly they drop out of hyperspace before the planet.

Although sometime before, they're in ''South City''. It states that it's a section of a Coriolis station. So there's no exact way of locating their previous destination except that there is only one South City in Elite: Dangerous and it's in the system HURUKUNTAK as an outpost, there is only one Coriolis station in that system. (I'm sure that trail has been picked up sometime in the past few years). When Elite: Dangerous was made, I believe even Drew had to change the locations of a few places in a book I believe, since the positioning of the galaxy in the older games wasn't accurate. Nevertheless, i think Cirag is within the systems of the old worlds.
