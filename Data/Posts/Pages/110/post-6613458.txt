I get same message all the time in V886 Centauri while doing some bounty hunting. I'm a regular there because it's close to Founder's World. So I guess it is not Sirius exclusive.

Awesome. I'll try and replicate it. If we can prove that it isn't unique to Sirius then we can (almost) eliminate it as a possible clue.
