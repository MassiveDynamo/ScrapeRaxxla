Back in Sirius today. I got the "Frame Shift Drive operating beyond safety limits" message 10,000Ls away from Sirius B while approaching Patterson Enterprise. Has anyone confirmed that this happens anywhere other than at Sirius?

I get same message all the time in V886 Centauri while doing some bounty hunting. I'm a regular there because it's close to Founder's World. So I guess it is not Sirius exclusive.
