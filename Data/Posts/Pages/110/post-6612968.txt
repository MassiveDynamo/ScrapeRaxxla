In fairness, for it to be possible to do via finding a planet called Raxxla, then it would have to be known as such to UC / the PF / your ships Navcom. Which would kind of need the folks on Raxxla to have an arrangement in place with UC, etc. that the big flashing 'this is Raxxla' sign pops up if you scan the planet. Which would be a kind of odd thing for them to do.
