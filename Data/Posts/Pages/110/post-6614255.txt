Hello fellow tinfoil-wearers! Have you seen the last three comments from November 4, 2017 on the Raxxla-page of the Elite-wiki? They were all made by the same person (according to the saved IP - that btw. belongs to an ISP only about 100 miles from Frev HQ) and provide some interesting info i haven‘t seen before.

Here are the 3 posts:






Especially the directions from Lave to Ben Ryders Gateway at a hidden system 1 jump away from Tionisla cought my interest. The second quote is also quite mysterious, as afaik the original Elite did not have Raxxla in game. I also did research on that „Micro Bit Computer Magazine“, but could not find any trace it ever existed.

What do you guys think? Is this already known info? A troll trying to mislead, ramblings of a madman or actual hints from someone involved with Fdev?

It's definitely a troll. The game was implemented in kilobytes and has been pulled apart and folded back together so many times that if Raxxla were hiding in the code we'd know.

The game was written long before Holdstock was hired to write the manual and The Dark Wheel novella ... and we know that Raxxla was Holdstock's invention as it appears in The Alien World a few years prior.

Braben and Bell would have had to totally recode the game and exceed the limited resources of thec8 bit computer era. Anyone who played the original would quickly identify that the depth of gameplay described goes way beyond what Elite had to offer.

Also... Check out my link a few pages back to an old interview with David Braben where he confirmed that Raxxla did not exist in the original game.

There have been many unofficial ports and mods to the game over the years though. Quite possible someone shoehorned their own version of Raxxla in there ... it just wouldn't have any bearing on Raxxla in Elite Dangerous.
