Anyone know the type of Hyperdrive during the events of The Dark Wheel book? From what I understand, it was the quirium drive? I may be wrong, it's a bit early for me to dive down into this rabbit hole before my coffee so I'm sure I'm gonna miss a thing or two. As we all are, I'm trying to find Cirag. In the dark wheel novel, they're in one place and suddenly they drop out of hyperspace before the planet.

Although sometime before, they're in ''South City''. It states that it's a section of a Coriolis station. So there's no exact way of locating their previous destination except that there is only one South City in Elite: Dangerous and it's in the system HURUKUNTAK as an outpost, there is only one Coriolis station in that system. (I'm sure that trail has been picked up sometime in the past few years). When Elite: Dangerous was made, I believe even Drew had to change the locations of a few places in a book I believe, since the positioning of the galaxy in the older games wasn't accurate. Nevertheless, i think Cirag is within the systems of the old worlds.

Yes. Those drives were fueled by Quirium.

As far as "south city" ... my bet is that it was a reference to the internal geometry of the station and not to the name of the station itself ... however you still could be on to something. In South City Alex Ryder met a man named Patrick McGreavy who was deformed by parasites that he contracted on Dykstra's world. Maybe we could find Dykstra's World and from there gain clues to locate Cirag? A long shot ...
