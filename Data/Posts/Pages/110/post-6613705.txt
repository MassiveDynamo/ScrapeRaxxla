That means it's almost certainly not as easy as just finding a planet named Raxxla currently.

Please tell me if I am wrong: in ED game story line, for a planet to have any non procedural name, doesn't it need that the PF actually gives it this name ?
If so, how any unknown planet could appear with any name ? Raxxla will never appear as Raxxla, imho.
(Some time, I must learn to read all the posts before posting mine...ninja'd; I let this one here, too lazy to hexedit it . Out of rep, Thatchinho... (By the way..Thx Mod !)

Ah, no it was Scytale!

I was first tempted to make Doc believe it was due to his addiction to that ingnominious Bourbon it is said he is so found of, but ...naaah...too much respect for him
