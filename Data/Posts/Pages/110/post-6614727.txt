Hello fellow tinfoil-wearers! Have you seen the last three comments from November 4, 2017 on the Raxxla-page of the Elite-wiki? They were all made by the same person (according to the saved IP - that btw. belongs to an ISP only about 100 miles from Frev HQ) and provide some interesting info i haven‘t seen before.

Here are the 3 posts:






Especially the directions from Lave to Ben Ryders Gateway at a hidden system 1 jump away from Tionisla cought my interest. The second quote is also quite mysterious, as afaik the original Elite did not have Raxxla in game. I also did research on that „Micro Bit Computer Magazine“, but could not find any trace it ever existed.

What do you guys think? Is this already known info? A troll trying to mislead, ramblings of a madman or actual hints from someone involved with Fdev?

You know: Its certainly creative Trolling. But.......... i'm just gonna head to Lave REAL QUICK. Just for fun anyway.
