Back in Sirius today. I got the "Frame Shift Drive operating beyond safety limits" message 10,000Ls away from Sirius B while approaching Patterson Enterprise. Has anyone confirmed that this happens anywhere other than at Sirius?

I have tried to replicate it in other systems, without success.
I’m still not convunced it’s a Sirius only thing though.
