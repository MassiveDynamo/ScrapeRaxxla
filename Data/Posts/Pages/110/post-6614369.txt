It's definitely a troll. The game was implemented in kilobytes and has been pulled apart and folded back together so many times that if Raxxla were hiding in the code we'd know.

The game was written long before Holdstock was hired to write the manual and The Dark Wheel novella ... and we know that Raxxla was Holdstock's invention as it appears in The Alien World a few years prior.

Braben and Bell would have had to totally recode the game and exceed the limited resources of thec8 bit computer era. Anyone who played the original would quickly identify that the depth of gameplay described goes way beyond what Elite had to offer.

Also... Check out my link a few pages back to an old interview with David Braben where he confirmed that Raxxla did not exist in the original game.

There have been many unofficial ports and mods to the game over the years though. Quite possible someone shoehorned their own version of Raxxla in there ... it just wouldn't have any bearing on Raxxla in Elite Dangerous.
yeah, there are definitely several things in those comments, that donâ€˜t add up. probably indeed just a (quite entertaining) troll.
