Nothing exciting to report from Epsilon Orionis I'm afraid mate (other than it being quite a nice system). No nav beacon though.

The route wasn't bad, it's just the route plotter struggling when it would need to divert around a bit of a permit locked route.

Image of the route below if you're interested:

SPOILER

The place isn't totally uninteresting. Main star is an actinic blue. The orbiting black hole is fairly small at 8 solar masses so you can get within 26 Km from it's center. The system nearly has all jumponium except arsenic. Two of the landables are about 2700 diamater so searchable if you like and the third landable at 7G is a challenge.
