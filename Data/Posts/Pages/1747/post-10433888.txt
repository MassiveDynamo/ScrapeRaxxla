I realised that I've set landing to None; I've set it back to All, so you should be able land (and purchase from Secure Trading).

I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
np and i was just able to DOCK and.... i was able to purchase 3 'Trinkets' !!! THANKS so much and i hope this helps me possibly discover more about Raxxla someday. o7

btw, i just realized this Trinket is marked as "stolen" ... Does this mean the ship i'm carrying it on will always have to cold-running sneak into any landing stations without ever getting scanned by patrols or whatever? -- And does it also mean that my Fleet Carrier, which will have the transferred Trinkets aboard now, will get into trouble when i jump into certain types of systems?
