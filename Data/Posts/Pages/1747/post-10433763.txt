Now what I find astonishing, is the line of site runs exactly inline with the signals midpoint!

Angle between E-M and T-S lines: 85.5 degrees

E-M line closest approach to Shamash: 14.63 LY
E-M line closest approach to Nefertem: 14.69 LY
E-M line closest approach to T-S line: 12.47 LY

Closest point on T-S line to E-M line: [42.83, 29.56, -15.20] (almost at the midpoint, slightly on the Shamash side)
Closest point on E-M line to T-S line: [36.80, 38.30, -8.63] (again slightly closer to Shamash than Nefertem, so shortly after it's crossed the equidistance plane) - point CPEM.

It's not quite exact but it's close to within a fairly small fraction of a LY both ways. LFT 729 is the closest actual system to the CPEM point (at 1.82 LY away, rather further out)
