I believe it represents the spin of a non sequence star that is our target. With eyes to see for sure.

Step 1: Get a flattened and corrected Raxxla logo
Step 2: Rotate counter or clockwise the image of the logo in a loop
Step 3: Adjust the frames and speed to reveal clue

I also think that the letters in the name Raxxla also stand for the rotational speed of the non sequence star. Letter number in alphabet is the rotational speed of that body. Match them to identify the body and plot your path.

I always wondered why the image released on the codex was stylized and skewed unlike the other symbols. I believe it was intended to delay anyone from recognizing that the image needed to be spun. First you would have to flatten and correct the image as sort of gate keeping.
FYI: You won't get a reply from most of this lot unless you at the very least talk about mythology in some way

It wasn't hard to do this so here's a bunch of rotating Raxxla logos at various speeds. I'm not really sure what you're talking about tbh, the rotational speed of the logo doesn't show anything more than anyone would expect, but I hope this helps you find something. I trust that you can do your own calculations about the rotational speed of the star you're looking for

SPOILER: ROTATING RAXXLAS
