It's first come, first serve, I'm afraid.
Silent Sphere Song is currently in Crucis Sector CL-Y c33.
i am at your Carrier right now ( only about 4 hours after your announcement post ) and it won't let me land. Keeps saying "docking DENIED" with onscreen message saying "you don't meet the permission requirements" .

Very disappointing and i'm very confused right now , after i made the very far trip all the way out to your carrier.

Your carrier info tab says "Docking access: NONE" --- What's going on? Please let me know, thanks.
