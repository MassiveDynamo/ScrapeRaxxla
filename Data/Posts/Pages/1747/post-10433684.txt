Following on from my last post I’ve done some additional examination of the data which I still hold as accurate but I decided that I was making the assumption that the line of sight went through Sol.

A bridge to the Empyrean?

For this examination I contemplated on why the Genship Artemis might be of interest, likewise I noted that the original line of sight although very close to Thetis etc, it was not exact, and for some reason I had not included the sphere of influence for the ‘signal’.

So I shifted the line of sight to run directly from Erebus to MU Cassiopeia.



With this established I extended it outwards and noticed it still falls very close to Thetis, probably far better than my original hypothesis!



In this picture we see the sphere of influence of the Thetis signal from the two bodies based upon the information provided that said signal originated at a certain distance. I’ve included a wireframe section too to show its midpoint.





Now what I find astonishing, is the line of site runs exactly inline with the signals midpoint!





The probability this is a coincidence I find implausible.
