Examined:
LTT 2513: All four belts, ring at LTT 2513 4 (Impossible task to look at every rock, just took a short flyby at a random place)
Exactly, an impossible task. Since deep space, rings and such do not have, as far as I know, coordinates; I don't believe Raxxla -or a clue to Raxxla- is hidden this way. That would be a poor design and too easy a choice.
At the very least, if it is placed (and not hidden) in such a way it means we are supposed to find a clue, a message, or something that will narrow the search efficiently.
