Oh that’s like SO ancient history. But it was the original exploration mechanism that got me to back the game, the mechanism DB promoted as a real thing… it never came to pass, likely due to time requirements as they got the game launched, they used to give the impression various things would get ironed out later, never happened. There were a lot of cool things they dropped - sad to say.

They sort of implemented it. Pretty sure GalMap default view is either security level or economy. Default filters then will "black out" these systems and your ship will route accordingly. I believe default route plotting isn't exclusive to populated systems but it certainly prefers them. As an explorer, you become rather accustomed to filtering instead by star-classification (to optimize fuel scooping). Maps though are like language - perspective is everything. Anyone who has played awhile likely almost unconsciously will flip the filters to less limited options. This is partly why the old charts weren't an exact match (beyond the name changes). The wording implies those were the populated systems (that weren't permit locked).

Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear."

The Pilot's Federation are not your friends (actually it is more complicated than that). We went down the path of censorship even before the first Elite. If you want to know who the monsters are, look in a mirror. All monsters are human. Some of us just realized the truth of the matter and started holding up mirrors to wake up the rest of our fellow CMDRs.
