Within the map (sorry tattoo); is this lady Athena?

She’s the only Greek goddess I know of with a spear…

Now within my recent marriage of the Yggdrasil and Underworld hypothesis, the system Athena is very close to the central axis of Yggdrasil, as are most of the Greek gods?

But who is the smoking hot one next to her, is that a fiery sword shes holding or a torch?

Or how about Minerva?

‘Minerva is commonly depicted as tall with an athletic and muscular build, as well as wearing armour and carrying a spear. As the most important Roman goddess, she is highly revered, honored, and respected. Marcus Terentius Varro considered her to be ideal and the plan for the universe personified’

‘From the second century BC onwards the Romans equated her Athena.’

Minerva also made the first tree (olive).

Minerva is also in game and slap bang in the central column of Yggdrasil, more so than Athena…
