Within the map (sorry tattoo) is this lady Athena?

She’s the only Greek goddess I know of with a spear…

Now within my recent marriage of the Yggdrasil and Underworld hypothesis, the system Athena is very close to the central axis of Yggdrasil, as are most of the Greek gods?

But who is the smoking hot one next to her, is that a fiery sword shes holding or a torch?

She’s just pleased to see you!
