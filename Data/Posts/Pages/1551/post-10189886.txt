Oh that’s like SO ancient history. But it was the original exploration mechanism that got me to back the game, the mechanism DB promoted as a real thing… it never came to pass, likely due to time requirements as they got the game launched, they used to give the impression various things would get ironed out later, never happened. There were a lot of cool things they dropped - sad to say.

To be fair IIRC it was discussions in the Design Development Forum back in 2014 when they were trying to make a game that the playerbase wanted to play, but then had to turn that into coherent concepts and code that could actually work in practice.
