Within the map (sorry tattoo) is this lady Athena?

She’s the only Greek goddess I know of with a spear…

Now within my recent marriage of the Yggdrasil and Underworld hypothesis, the system Athena is very close to the central axis of Yggdrasil, as are most of the Greek gods?

But who is the smoking hit one next to her, is that a fiery sword she holding or a torch?

My vote is for Lilith. Is Lillith an alternative spelling of the Biblical Lilith? There is a system by that name. Salomé is a character very similar to Lilith and was responsible for John the Baptists death (perhaps alluding to John Jameson in the lore).

Lilith and Salomé were pariahs.

Anyway, in Elite Dangerous there is a system Lillith.

Also, Hecate was originally a protective goddess that morphed into something seen almost as evil by the modern patriarchal churches. I should say that the snake symbolism used to be positive but got twisted post patriarchal faiths in the modern era.

One odd bit of lore, the Raxxlans took over via subterfuge and religion was inevitablely noticeably twisted according to Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide. Keep that in mind.

Also, posting this music video Halsey did for Diablo IV as it is kind of relevant and reminds me so much of Salomé in Elite Dangerous:
