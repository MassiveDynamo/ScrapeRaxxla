Well… just keeping an open perspective.

Then again I would not be surprised to see something like a ‘Professor Phrixus of the Phineus Institute’ pop up in the next year or two… saying they have seen something - only for they’re HQ get vaporised by Thargoids

But I do presume some elements of whatever original story there was, might have been discarded, some incorporated - who knows.

But yes, just because we haven’t found something doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist..

AND harvested by the new Thargoid to create Zombiegoids! (See obsidianant’s new vid!)

Exactly. Just because the old E/F missions were deleted doesn't imply the whole Raxxla narrative was deleted. I still think those missions were mere obfuscation. They were given by the PF acting against TDW SD faction, so it is possible they were part of a “Real TDW” narrative that was deleted/simplified/exacerbated. It is only our assumption that they were a means to gain knowledge of Raxxla. I suspect they were deemed on hindsight to be overly simple or overly obfuscating (i.e. were total red herrings).

Though it does seem The Club narrative has been terminated (they probably escaped to Colonia a while ago!)
