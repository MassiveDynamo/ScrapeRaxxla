Not entirely relevant but re-reading ‘Elite Legacy’ and had forgotten, there’s a clear reference and an example to what a ‘dark system’ was.

“He might not be very chatty, but his ship is distinctive. I had my friend run the ship registration through the system. He flies an Anaconda and apparently he was jumped as he passed through one of the local dark systems, LHS 142.”

LHS 142 is a red dwarf, this marries that DW reference about red dwarfs and dark systems. We know from previous articles and comms off FD that dark systems were to be part of the undeveloped exploration mechanism, those references also hinted it was in such systems that the majority of mysteries might be found?
Curious, what was this 'undeveloped exploration mechanism' that you've mentioned? I'm kinda out of the loop of things.
