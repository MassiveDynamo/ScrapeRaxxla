Exactly. Just because the old E/F missions were deleted doesn't imply the whole Raxxla narrative was deleted. I still think those missions were mere obfuscation. They were given by the PF acting against TDW SD faction, so it is possible they were part of a “Real TDW” narrative that was deleted/simplified/exacerbated. It is only our assumption that they were a means to gain knowledge of Raxxla. I suspect they were deemed on hindsight to be overly simple or overly obfuscating (i.e. were total red herrings).

Though it does seem The Club narrative has been terminated (they probably escaped to Colonia a while ago!)
If you have the warm and fuzzies towards Jaques, I am afraid you are destined to be disappointed. I still haven't exactly figured out what Jaques deal is but my instincts say he may not be entirely trustworthy (especially as I think he represents multiple major characters in the lore). That said, there is some weird as hell stuff going back to the olden days where Saud Kruger had a hell of a lot of influence on ship design - see the damn near universal holographic ship interfaces. I still suspect Colonia Highway is merely to streamline our extinction. At this point, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it ultimately comes out that Jaques was never even human and is the Guardian Construct in human form. The Engineers are also extremely suspect (see Palin getting sick during Cerberus Plague era). Actual humans should not have been sickened by Cerberus Plague.
