Well… just keeping an open perspective.

Then again I would not be surprised to see something like a ‘Professor Phrixus of the Phineus Institute’ pop up in the next year or two… saying they have seen something - only for they’re HQ get vaporised by Thargoids

But I do presume some elements of whatever original story there was, might have been discarded, some incorporated - who knows.

But yes, just because we haven’t found something doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist..
