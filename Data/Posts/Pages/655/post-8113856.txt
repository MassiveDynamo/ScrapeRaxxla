That’s actually an interesting point. DW’s quote of DB’s utterance was in July 14 (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-day-i-met-david-braben.25158/post-536632), which from the change notes thread was at the time of beta 1.04; I think DW said this was when he met DB at Lavecon (5-6 July 14). I was under the impression from somewhere that DB had said Raxxla had been in-game since the gamma; Gamma 1.01 was released Nov 2014. So was it actually in-game earlier? Am I mistaken in my gamma belief?
Could be it was in-game from beta 1.04, or earlier, but still being realised? Seems reasonable to assume that its implementation took a fair degree of polishing since it’s a major easter egg and DB’s baby.

But yes, Raxxla has been ‘in existence’ since circa 1984!
Gamma was when the galaxy was opened up. Before that(beta period) the game space was limited to cylinder from the Eranin region, almost to Sol.
There was also a regeneration of the galaxy at gamma launch. Many systems changed quite a bit.
Gamma was when we got the galaxy we have now. Even if Raxxla was coded earlier, it would probably not have been 'in the game'.
