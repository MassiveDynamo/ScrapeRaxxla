Not sure what has been done by others in this Raxxla search.
So I visited the only system mentioned in the Codex - Tau Ceti.
Followed the tourist beacons to a few other systems then pretty much ended up at the Requiem for Salome place.
Only thing I did notice is that the line took me all the way in the direction of Bernards Loop.
Probably meaningless.
