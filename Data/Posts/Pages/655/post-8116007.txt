Ah, yes, it's the bubblehead. Think it's 1 heart and 10 Meta-Alloys. Sites I tried for the Meta-Alloys in WHN was destroyed, I had more luck in the Pleiades.
You're right, according to inara (not in game), 1 Heart, 10 Meta-Alloys. Not 20, my bad

[Edit: I found a few sites yielding 3 MA / relog, a 5, some with less. Most were destroyed.]
