Might be getting too involved with words and trying to find meaning here, lets imagine a scenario.

Company A is planning to build a game and its in development. Several ideas of what could be included are discussed. At a meeting ideas are ruled in or out. At that point onwards the included ones can be said to be 'in the game' even though its not been developed yet. eg

Are space legs in? no theyre not (not yet, we can add them later maybe)
Are planetary landings in? no theyre not (not yet, its something we want to add soon though)
Are several types of space station in the game? Yes they're in the game. (even if zero code has been written at this point)

is Raxxla in the game?.....Yes

The question wasn't, is Raxxla in the Beta and the Gamma or just the Gamma?
