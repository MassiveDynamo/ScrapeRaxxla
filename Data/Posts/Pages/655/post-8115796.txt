Different, the 1 Arx is a wire frame original Elite version, the heart is a shrunk down ED universe Interceptor.
I have two like that, kinda. 1 has three gold stars under it (1st xeno defense) the other does not (third place last season). Sorry to brag I'm just proud of my squadron and all our hard work.
Look at those sexy trophies!
