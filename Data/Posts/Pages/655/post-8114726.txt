Not to my knowledge

I spent the evening looking for the UA Shell arond Merope (was going to pick one up so i could open the door at a Thargoid base) but couldnt find it - Thargoid activity seems to start around 97ly from merope and then you get alot of thargoid activity starting at around 75ly from merope... but didnt see the shell... I also managed to get ganked by an NPC while in Merope ... I was busy looking at signal sources and got pulled out of hyperspace and made minced meat of ... i forgot i had a hold full of tasty guardian tech and my explorer asp is held together with tinfoil..... Just bummed about all the exploration data I was hording...

Picked up 2 Thargoid Sensors in Asterope in NHSS Threat 5 POI's; you're welcome to them...The hearts I need myself for the Thargoid decals
