Were you able do get some screen grabs?
I think I did, but there’s nothing to see, other than the Nav panel message. I’ve now visited the two in Pareco, Halley’s in Sol, and all (13?) in Shinrarta. For me Halley’s is (so far) the only “comet” that is named in the Nav panel. For the others the nav panel just shows the uss name, e.g. “Shinrarta Dehzra (Threat 0)”; the name displayed is the same for all comets in a system, only the position changes.

This is troubling me as others seem to have had Nav panel notification of other “comets”, as in the Pareco comet thread https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ormal-space-close-to-them.350586/post-5486213.

So I dont know if Im doing something wrong, or if the game has changed. My concern is that the “comets” seem to be a likely method FD may have used to hide Raxxla/Omphalos-I’m hypothesising one of the “comets” actually does do something when you find it, iff you find it...

Moreover, FD seem to be moving the goalposts. The different spellings of Pilots Federation in Shinrarta Tourist Beacons were said by FD (in response to @Rochester query) to be valid, but they now all read the same. Now the display of “comets” also seems to have changed...
