@Pyroboros : Yes, I “found” Halley’s comet in Sol yesterday and it did indeed say so in the nav panel. But everywhere else I look I only seem to get the “comet uss” plus either “deep space” or “shipping lane” in the nav panel. I cant remember when shipping lanes were introduced into game, but they do seem to be masking the “comets”.
Were you able do get some screen grabs?
