Mmm,
since my comet hunting isn't going well thought Iâ€™d try my hand at pirating some Trinkets of Hidden Fortune to improve my luck.
So, sat at the nav beacon scanning all cargo ships (scanner on a hat, not good for the thumb tendonitis!!) yesterday afternoon, nothing. Logged on again this afternoon, immediately got an adder carrying some! unfortunately the Trinkets didnt work for him as his drive was tougher than his hull. But they did for me as he was wanted & I got an 88k bounty!
No luck for the rest of the afternoon though!
