To my mind Rifterâ€™s Lounge sounds like the bar that the squadron meets up in rather than a squadron (though we will need a bar, with cheeseboard, petit fours and a large decanter of Lavian brandy (at the very least)).
And that's exactly what it is! Rather than 'Leader' I'm currently 'Barman'.

And yeah, it's just a bit of fun for the Beta, I'm not suggesting it as a name for the Squadron in live!
