I saw Jorki mention opposites of Dark Wheel at one point, but it needn't be a wheel in that case. Could be The Bright Wing....

Or perhaps just the Illuminati

Hey, welcome back, long time no see compadre!

I think the Illuminati already know all the answers, perhaps:
Bright Ovals?
White Riddlers?
Grey Fryers? (yorkies like a fishnchip supper after a hard dayâ€™s exploration )

Edit: Sombre Searchers?

edit2: still prefer Questers!
