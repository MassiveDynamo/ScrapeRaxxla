Perfect possition.
Was curious on the origin of the name ... but no one seems to know - the oldest reference I found was in "The Geography of the Heavens" by Burrittt 1833
But he didnt seem to know where it came from either... Looks like there was a quilt pattern called Job's Coffin possibly originating in String Figures (like Jacobs Ladder) The Romance of Quilt Names.... ya was bored.
