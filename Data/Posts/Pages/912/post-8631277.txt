Still playing around with Kepler. He thought the Golden Ratio was a precious jewel... So i tried applying it to the Merope/Col70 alignment to see what I could see... gerr messed up ... recalcuatingggggggg
I'll be entering Keplers Crest in the next few days and doing 2 lengths (up to Xibalba then back down to the rift) so I'll be in the area for a good week or so. Any tinfoil you want checked whilst I'm there, let me know.
