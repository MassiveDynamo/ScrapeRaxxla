Will play more with it this evening... Nice- youve almost finished the rim tour? Looking foreward to the slide-show!
Almost. So near but yet so far! think I'm going to stay out for a while though and scratch that TDW itch by zigzag across the galaxy so I can sell them data from every single region. I'll regret it if I dont do it. The pain is I'll have to revisit a few rim regions as I was silly enough to sell some UC data at beagle points DW2 FC. Reckon I can do it in around a month though, if I put my foot down, and I've already been out for 4-5 months
