The poem The Ruines of Time was written by Edmund Spenser, to Mary Pembroke/Sidney. It's a strange eulogy to her dead brother Philip Sidney(Astrophel).

Most of the poem consists of a female Roman spirit (the genius of Verlame), complaining about the Roman empire in ruins. She also sneaks in a bit about the dead Sidney.
The last part of the poem does however describe Philip Sidney rising to the heavens and becoming a star sign.
The description of the starry locations begin at line 589 (it's a long poem ): https://www.bartleby.com/153/19.html

I identify the Swan (Sidney) as Cygnus, the Harp as Lyra and the armed knight and winged horse as Perseus and Pegasus, but I have trouble with the coffer made of heben (ebony) wood, the stately bed Adorned all with costly cloth of gold and the arke of purest golde. All suggestions are welcome.

I'm wondering if the symbolism of the Raxxla symbol may be related to six locations, surrounding Cygnus in the sky?
