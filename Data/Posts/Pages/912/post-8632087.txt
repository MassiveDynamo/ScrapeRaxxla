I'll be entering Keplers Crest in the next few days and doing 2 lengths (up to Xibalba then back down to the rift) so I'll be in the area for a good week or so. Any tinfoil you want checked whilst I'm there, let me know.
Will play more with it this evening... Nice- youve almost finished the rim tour? Looking foreward to the slide-show!
