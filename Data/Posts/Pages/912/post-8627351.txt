Thoughts on princess astrophel and the spiraling stars...

Kepler wrote a science fiction novel ... Somnium (one of the earliest books of science fiction)

The book starts out with the narrator reading about the heroine Libuse - celebrated in the magical arts, after which he falls into a sleep dreaming about the stars and moon.
Libuse being a magical princess who became queen and founded the city of Prague. Somnium is an interesting look into the life of Kepler ..(his mother was tried as a witch). . but also it talks about a gateway from Iceland - (which he points out was ancient Thule) where daemons can travel between Lavania (the moon) and earth - During the Eclipses.

Ya Kepler and the harmony of the spheres along with this story tied into Plutarchs story of the (which kepler supposedly said partly inspired him) ties in the neoplatonism ideas..



So ya maybe when we can land on the moon.... ?

It’ll never happen, the PF will prevent it
We’d sink into all that cream cheese and not be able to take off again
And thus spoil Wreaken Mining’s blueberry cheesecake franchise
I won’t say where the blueberries come from!
(But it’s Moon Rabbits!)
