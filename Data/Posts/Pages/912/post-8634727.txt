I found a small distinction between the L, T and Y type dwarfs in how they are handled by ED.

In the galaxy map's 'STAR TYPES:' listing, L and T-type dwarfs will be listed in unscanned systems. Y-type dwarfs are not listed, unless they are the primary star or the system is scanned.

This may be a remnant of what was meant to become 'dark systems' and 'dark stars'?
