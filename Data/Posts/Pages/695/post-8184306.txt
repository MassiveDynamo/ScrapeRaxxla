Just had a thought. Just how cool it is that none of any of this we talk about here seems to matter. Not much seems more important than anything else. It's just a ton of information and leads and connections and ideas and thoughts. Endless hypothesizing with no apparent result from any angle. Not outwardly anyways. What the hell are we dealing with!? Who the hell created this thing?! lol.
