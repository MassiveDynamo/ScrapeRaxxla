It’s really well hidden. What irks me though, is IF anything comes of all this, then the writers have been breaking their backs doing all this research and tying all these little nuggets of hints into these articles and a large portion of the community calls it “worthless fluff”. It’s only worthless to them because it doesn’t give them what they desire on a silver platter.

Even after the revelation that a cabal was manipulating literally EVERYTHING, the masses still carry on doing their bidding no questions asked for the credits. Blindly completing whatever mission will give them the most return with little regard for the consequences.

I hope we can solve it for the writers and devs that put so much time into it. To show the naysayers and doubters that it was laid out in front of them the whole time, if they paid attention.
Time will tell.
