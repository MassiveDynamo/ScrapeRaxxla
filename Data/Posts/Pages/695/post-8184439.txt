Guardians probably.

So I did a little research on the name Ram Tah. It turns out to tie back into my ideas about Jason Ryder's Quest being found in the Argo Navis constellation through the story of Jason and Argonauts and their quest for the golden fleece. The Guardian Bubble permit locked Wolf Rayet, Gamma Velorum being in the constellations sail and being the only locked star in the constellation ties this story parallel to the Guardians.
"In Greek mythology, the Golden Fleece is the fleece of the golden-woolled, winged ram, Chrysomallos, which was held in Colchis." - Wiki
"In Greek Mythology, the symbol of the ram is based on the Chrysomallus, the flying ram that rescued Phrixus and Helle, the children of the Boeotian king Athamas and provided the Golden Fleece."
Remember Boeotia in Aganippe and the Demeter connection to Alexander/Ryder the great and Jason/Ryder and the Argonauts.
So Ram ties to Argo Navis, thus to the Guardians.

What about Tah?
The only things I can find are that Tah auto google translates to Czech and it means Move.
However according to the wiki, it states that it's and alternative English name of the Arabic letter Ṭāʾ ط
Which translates in Phoenician to mean Wheel.
The Phoenicians were told to be from Atlantis.

Further evidence in my eyes about the quest for the golden fleece and the Ryder family's quest.
The goal seems to me to be about making actual Guardian Contact by recreating their stories someway. But how?

SPOILER: TRY TO KEEP UP WITH THE TURNING OF THE WHEEL.
