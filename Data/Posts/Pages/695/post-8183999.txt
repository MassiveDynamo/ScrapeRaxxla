This is a stretch on my part and I have little evidence to back it up but here goes.

Based on my belief that Raxxla is remnant Guardian AI it would seem that both the Guardian AI and The Club have something in common.

The Guardian AI realized that the majority of the Guardian Species was a “lost cause” and a dangerous thing to leave in existence. So they pretty much permitted them to destroyed themselves.

The Club has been secretly guiding humanity for a long time and only somewhat recently started working on Project Dynasty which seems to me like their way of saying “humanity is a lost cause” they’ll permit the Klaxxians to wipe humanities slate clean, and start fresh with what survives.

The Guardian AI should not “throw stones”, because they did something similar in the past to what the club is doing now.

This is pure conjecture on my part though.
Also as a side note: Kore means green (like the logo) in a language that most would not suspect as being related at all to the ongoing mystery.

I won’t go into detail about this language stuff just yet because then you’d all really think I’m completely mad but I’ve noticed a pattern that is strange and would add a third level of secrecy to Galnet. It’s worrying me to be completely honest.
As someone else mentioned though the pattern of dates may be critical. So far, whenever I try to get a time frame narrowed down the pattern holds for a bit and then falls to pieces. Perhaps the window when it’s not attainable is throwing it off. I’m not sure.

I think I need to either take a step back or strap in and plunge head first down the rabbit hole. So many articles to read through.
