Hey folks, I think I finally figured it out!!!! All we need to find Raxxla is a roadmap!!

Week 1: Look for Raxxla
- consume many biscuits and much Lavian brandy

Week 2: Find Raxxla
- consume many biscuits and much Lavian brandy

Week 3: Enjoy Raxxla
-consume many biscuits and much Lavian brandy.

Notes: Raxxla not available on consoles for at least six more months. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. No lore guaranteed.

That has to be it!!! Simples!

Too soon? I'll get my coat.

I started with the biscuits and brandy and now i canâ€™t remember the rest of the roadmap.

Could you repeat it or is the rest optional?
