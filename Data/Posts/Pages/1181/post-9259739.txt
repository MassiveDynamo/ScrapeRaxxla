Attention!
I think we need to change our approach to this whole thread.
1) If Raxxla is easily spotted if you're in the right system, it's very unlikely it's in a popular, named or even already discovered system.
2) If it is in a popular system than we probably need some way to actually find it, for example see a weird gravity reading on our gravity meter or something along those lines.

So Raxxla is either in a popular system and needs a special method to discover it
OR It's in a random system and we need a way to find it. Or something along those lines.
So basically, it's out there and we need to find it. That's a novel new approach. ;-)
