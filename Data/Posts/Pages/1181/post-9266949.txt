Nah. As far as I'm concerned, I quit hitting on onionhead years ago. Still have some side effects tho
But on another hallucinogenic note, I'm on Odyssey and I'm seeing some weird dots and lines in the loading screen "behind" the orange rotating ship. Like a {gasp} code/cypher thing. But unfortunately, my vastly underwhelming computer skills haven't produced a decent screenshot or movie capture of it.
Can anyone confirm them, or am I going to have to go to detox again?
