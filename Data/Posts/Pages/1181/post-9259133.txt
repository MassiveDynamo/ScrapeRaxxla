Neptune can be seen as the original 'obfuscated on the outer rim'. Neptune and Uranus were unknown in classical times. The were only discovered after good telescopes were developed. Neptune was discovered last of them and still mark the outer rim of planets, in our solar system.
If "the outer rim" refers to the system, and not the Galaxy of course. ;-)
