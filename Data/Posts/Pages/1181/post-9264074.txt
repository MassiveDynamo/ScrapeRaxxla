I got another 2 tinfoil theories! The first one having to do with the Raxxla logo. The middle dot in the circle might be resembling a sun. This has been said before. But the 3 lines around it might mean astroid belts. So Raxxla might be in a system with 3 astroid belts around 1 sun.
The second is that there may be a clue in the system description. Some systems have a short discription and maybe there is a clue in one of these. Got to be careful to not confuse actual lore with discriptions players made tho.
