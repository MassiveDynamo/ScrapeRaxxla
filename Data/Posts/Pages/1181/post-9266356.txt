Hey folks, I think I finally figured it out!!!! All we need to find Raxxla is a roadmap!!

Week 1: Look for Raxxla
- consume many biscuits and much Lavian brandy

Week 2: Find Raxxla
- consume many biscuits and much Lavian brandy

Week 3: Enjoy Raxxla
-consume many biscuits and much Lavian brandy.

Notes: Raxxla not available on consoles for at least six more months. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. No lore guaranteed.

That has to be it!!! Simples!

Too soon? I'll get my coat.
