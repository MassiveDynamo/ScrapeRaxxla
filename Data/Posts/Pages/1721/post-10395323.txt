First and foremost I am certainly not trying to dissuade you from your investigation. If investigations reveal a clearer signal that has a similar intensity and clarity as the LS itself which proves beyond doubt there is something there, that is beneficial for everyone. I no longer have my own recordings because there was nothing to me that showed any noticeable improvement in the signal readings - this included tweaking the spectrogram settings. I am aware that does not help your investigation, so I apologise for not considering sending those through at the time.

Some clarification on what I actually did, so as to mitigate any misrepresentation:
I took multiple ~5-10 min recordings around 2000-2500 LY both east and west of the bubble.
They were pointed directly toward Sag A* and were in high quality FLAC format.
My camera was over 1000 metres from the ship, located far away from the local star and placed the star behind me to avoid any potential interference.
I had also studied your siren recordings from 2023, even the ones facing away from the signal. This included checking left and right channels independently.
These are the recording file names so you can check the audio I'm referring to:
A
A1
A1:2
A1:4
A1:-2
A1:-4
A1:A
A1: D
A1:-Y
A1:-W
B1
B
C1
C1:2
C1:4
C1:6
C1:8
C1:B

I would advise that your specified of 8192 window size in my view is hindering any potential visibility because a higher window size only enhances the very low frequencies.
1024, 2048, and 4096 are the sweet spots for the upper, middle and lower zones of the signals respectively.

I also checked dozens of your hyperspace recordings of 28 Nov 2023 to see, like you say, if hardware was a factor in somehow revealing it differently, and to independently look at it with different eyes. Nothing was visible to me in the background noise that wasn't a product of pareidolia. So at the very least, you can take this information as a data point for your investigation regardless of its validity in your eyes.

Thanks for the reply.

I suppose time will tell.
