When i hear Alliance space in that context, I think of the Old worlds / Lave region. It would be a bit strange if FD made the Raxxla mystery without any connection to that part of space.
The Old words were moved up where they are now, between FFE and ED. They probably had a reason for doing that, other than the leet Right ascension of Lave.
Right ascension: 13h 37m 12.643s / Declination: -36Â° 46'56.66''

Perhaps Raxxla is at 76?
Mmm, but IIRC someone at FD said ED is standalone, not reliant on any previous lore- I think they tried to align things with previous versions but I don't think they would have felt constrained by them.

Old Worlds
The Old Worlds are a historic region within the core systems that was first discovered and settled in the early 25th century. It found prosperity as a major producer of hydrogen fuel and developed its own distinct culture before becoming the nexus of the Galactic Cooperative. GalCop's collapse...

In ED Lave is 144ly from Alioth, so a guesstimate of 66ly for Alliance space is fairly conservative, however Lave was the hub of GALCOP. From the Wiki "The demise of GalCop led to the decline of the Old Worlds, which remained stagnant well into the 3300's, but also fostered the eventual rise of the Alliance out of the Alioth system in 3230" -(sourced as Elite Premonition). So Lave in ED has no bearing on Alliance space.

In my analysis I wanted to stay away from any pre- or mis-conceptions from what may or may not be lore. I used what we have been given and fairly identifiable as potential clues.

I do suspect that Simulacrae might have a point- it may be worth reconsidering those other garden designs in Li Qing Jao to see if anything else Raxxla-related can be inferred. I focused on the obvious Paradise Lost garden & thought the other gardens were just decoration, but...?
