Well I think the concept is insinuated rather than described narratively. I think it’s alluded that was the original objective of the ‘big plan’ before the fall. But not entirely sure if it actually happened?

The entire theology is rather odd, especially when it’s identified that everything ‘happens’ outside of time, but everything happens chronologically, many parts are I suspect intentionally in opposition and a contradiction, as Milton states some things are beyond man’s ken.

I’m no theologian.

So originally I suspect it was to be raised above everything, as the new heaven, that was the ‘original plan’ but then Satans fall occurred - but ironically everything is pre-known and by gods own design, no one has free will. So it’s technically all laid out to fail from the outset… it raises more questions than answers. I think that’s the point. Because Milton paints god as rather negatively and manipulative (although that’s probably a 21st perspective).

So in theory yes, it was ‘going to be raised up’ but the last we see, it’s still on earth as Michael evicted it’s tenants and the pendant globe is fixed in place by Satans viaduct.

So if represented in game alongside a Miltonian model, it logically should be just below the Empyrean, or just on the outer rim of Chaos, or both; probably on the North / Eastern wall?

If it's still on Earth and held in place by Satan's Viaduct I suspect it may be in North Yorkshire!
