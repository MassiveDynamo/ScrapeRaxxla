@Han_Zen wrt to distance from Alioth: A thought has just occured- Raxxla is /was a rumour. And as @Ian Doncaster suggested the other day could have started by a dying explorer mumbling some words on his deathbed after returning to civilisation. If that explorer was based in Alliance space then the distance of those two systems from Alioth is explainable, ~60ly is a reasonable distance for deep space exploration in the early days after the colonisation of Alioth in 2452 ...Alliance was founded in 3230, Elite Legacy is set in 3301, so the rumour might well have passed to Julia that something valuable/unusual called Raxxla had been found in Alliance space long ago.
When i hear Alliance space in that context, I think of the Old worlds / Lave region. It would be a bit strange if FD made the Raxxla mystery without any connection to that part of space.
The Old words were moved up where they are now, between FFE and ED. They probably had a reason for doing that, other than the leet Right ascension of Lave.
Right ascension: 13h 37m 12.643s / Declination: -36Â° 46'56.66''

Perhaps Raxxla is at 76?
