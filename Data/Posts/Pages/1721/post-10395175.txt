Currently investigating penal colonies.

“The Beaumont system was a frontier world far below Achenar.” Elite Legacy.

In game below Achenar there is a tight fulcrum of several such colonies. I find this interesting. Visually when filters are applied these look suspicious due to their formation, and general distance to other systems of note, although there’s probably a simple lore / logic reasoning for this.

I do wonder if said ‘beautiful mountain’ is hidden somewhere close here (if it’s not simply metaphorical or just unrelated). A few of them have odd names so I wonder what relevance that might hold however I can’t recall if such system types existed early on in game or if they were added much later?

Fell asleep during warp and ended up in deep space someplace unremarkable, so may hobble back and get some proper g-sleep at a local port.
