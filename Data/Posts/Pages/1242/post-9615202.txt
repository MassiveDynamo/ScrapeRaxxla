By taking the wheel station pic from the codex, comparing it with a similar station (Aulin/Aulin Enterprise) and adjusting to match the colour of the rear lights I showed ages ago that the codex pic is in all probability a Red Subdwarf, type M vi (search within this thread). I dont think any credence can be placed on any of the “hint pics” that we come across; the star type, background sky box, moons and perspective/distances are all manipulated by FD to avoid making it too easy. And on principle you should disbelieve anything you see/read on Reddit etc.
Just look what happened when FD forgot to do that obfuscation-Jacques was found too early and so were the Guardian ruins.

Why should a station give out strange sounds? Now if a permit locked system gave out detectable sounds that matched the sound from visible in-game system stations then that’s what I’d call suggestive!
It's not fair at all if they manipulated the picture . Even on biscuit i buy, they write that the food could not be like the picture.
By strange noise, i talked about the primary star focus when you target a system.
Honnestly i really hope TDW or Raxxla are not hidden behind some permit lock or words by saying "it's in the game, but you don't have the permit for it".
