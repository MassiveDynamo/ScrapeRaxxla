It's not fair at all if they manipulated the picture . Even on biscuit i buy, they write that the food could not be like the picture.
By strange noise, i talked about the primary star focus when you target a system.
Honnestly i really hope TDW or Raxxla are not hidden behind some permit lock or words by saying "it's in the game, but you don't have the permit for it".
No, I dont subscribe to the hypothesis that Raxxla is hidden behind a permit lock, unless it’s one that is easily obtained (e.g. Sol, Van Maanen’s Star etc etc)

But I think FD do indeed manipulate pics-they won’t make it easy for us!! And dont forget most of the Codex is clearly waffle or obfuscation. I’m going to post my current hypotheses soon, since I cant play due to my hand problems, which seem to be getting worse!
