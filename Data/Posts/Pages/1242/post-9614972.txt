In fact, last year with in-game fleet carrier exploit making us able to get permit locked system data, people found TDW system: LFT 509.
The station is not orbiting a moon but inside the asteroid belt of the secondary star (red dwarf).
But as you know, LFT 509 is locked (since Horizons wing release).

PS: the debate around TDW beeing at Polaris VS LFT 509 concluded it was at LFT 509.
Mmm
While I believe, due to the FC exploit, it is now well-known that LFT 509 and Polaris both have GG with 8 moons no permits are available to allow detailed search of those systems and no TDW station has been found. Besides, with the ambiguity of the wording (of the codex entry about Lyta Craneâ€™s knowledge of TDW and any such 8th moon) it is highly likely that she is either lying, to generate income from her fanbase, or she has been deliberately deceived by TDW themselves.

It may also be worth pointing out that Sol/Neptune/Triton might be worth checking out. Triton is IRL the 8th moon of Neptune, which is a GG and is also the 8th planet of Sol. It also just happens to be unknown permit locked. Coincidence? Conspiracy? Mmmm!
