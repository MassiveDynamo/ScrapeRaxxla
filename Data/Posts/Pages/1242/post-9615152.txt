It could explain the strange noise from Polaris in normal space when pointing to it in a close system.
The same strange noise can be heard in DONNER system close to Witch's Reach. "Donner" in french means give. It only has a brown dwarf (T).
By taking the wheel station pic from the codex, comparing it with a similar station (Aulin/Aulin Enterprise) and adjusting to match the colour of the rear lights I showed ages ago that the codex pic is in all probability a Red Subdwarf, type M vi (search within this thread). I dont think any credence can be placed on any of the “hint pics” that we come across; the star type, background sky box, moons and perspective/distances are all manipulated by FD to avoid making it too easy. And on principle you should disbelieve anything you see/read on Reddit etc.
Just look what happened when FD forgot to do that obfuscation-Jacques was found too early and so were the Guardian ruins.

Why should a station give out strange sounds? Now if a permit locked system gave out detectable sounds that matched the sound from visible in-game system stations then that’s what I’d call suggestive!
