It would be a bit absurd if Raxxla was Halley's comet. The comet can be observed every day in RL, with the right equipment. It should not be hard to find.
From an ingame perspective we just have to accept that the sensors on and the visibility from our ships, are sub par.

The sensors can not detect smaller bodies. Looking out the window, its even hard to see the moon from earth. The windshield and the Remlock clearly messes with the way we see things.
Dear Faulcon DeLacy
After many years of satisfaction with my ships, as supplied by you, I am unhappy to have to write to complain about the poor quality of equipment you are now fitting. As my good friend Cmdr Han_Zen says “the sensors on, and the visibility from, our ships are sub par.”

Clearly the electrostatic dust removal mechanism for the cockpit windows is not working very well. Moreover I have been searching for the source of the Raxxla myth for over 4 years, but I find that I cannot detect any small astronomical bodies. I cannot even detect Halley’s Comet which is clearly in Sol (my great grandpappy several times removed wrote in his daily diary that he also failed to see it in the early 21st Century, but that was due to atmospheric conditions applicable at the time; it was often cloudy and raining at his place of abode in the South of somewhere he called England). But in this day and age there is no excuse for fitting suboptimal detection equipment in our current ships.

Please fit better detectors in future!
Yours irately
Yorki Rasalas, King and Admiral of Mu Leonis
