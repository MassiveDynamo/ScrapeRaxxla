My take on the red star is that the start in the codex is not the primary, and that possibly it is an L or Y class as these are also 'gas-giants' in the in-game description. You may say the colours are not right, but there is quite a variation in colour temps in game (I have seen an M star with 7k surface which is white, for instance) so it may not be that straight forwards.

Other types include carbon stars like the S type which are big enough and red enough to make the picture in the codex. This is all in the thread:

With thanks to Jordan Qwent who worked really hard on this stuff..

As ever there is enough wriggle room for many hypotheses to co-exist.

Did start to look at L, Y and T types on yesterday’s search, but the only in-game examples I came across in the bubble were decidedly purple and in no way resembled the codex pic, even to the surface markings, so I discounted them. But carbon star mmmm, “jewel that burns”? Diamond is carbon, and carbon will burn.....
Don’t think I’ve visited a carbon star......
