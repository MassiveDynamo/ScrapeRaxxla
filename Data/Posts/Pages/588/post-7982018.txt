Now whales are confirmed as being extinct on Earth in 3305 so you could be on to something there Its at least a 'fact' and it may well be the first fact we have actually had.

DB has talked about future missions involving taking a 'big game hunter' to another world as a passenger mission and I read in some tourist beacon recently that that system or planet was trying to bring whales back from extinction with DNA (like Jurassic Park). It wasn't the deepest void though but maybe theres another planet....

oh and I'm vegetarian so I wont be doing those passenger missions. I won't transport Animal Meat either, real or synthetic. I do smuggle drugs & weapons and I may do slaves though, go figure
