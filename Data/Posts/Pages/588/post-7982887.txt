@Jorkki - sorry no don't have the link, its on the Frontier YT channel not a thread that I know odf. I've watches so many vids recently I cant remember which one it was. Probably one of the 'dev' videos recorded during the kickstarter campaign as he was talking about long term future plans. (it was more than likely an early one as am making my way through chronologically) DB was wearing a jumper I think but I realise this doesn't help much I'm fairly sure the idea is mentioned in more than one vid and maybe even by Michael Brookes in another one - those ones are fascinating btw from our lore perspective.

Not even gonna pretend I understand half of what is being talked about above but I think I'm learning so am happy.

I forgot I wont transport fish either that CG recently I was more than happy with my Grain and Fruit & Veg drop offs Quorn is 'myco-protein' so I think is closer to a funghi, Synthetic Meat to me is the stuff 'grown' in labs from animal DNA, its still 'real' meat it was just never 'alive' on an animal as such.

My favourite put-down so far from my mates against vegetarianism? - 'If we aren't supposed to eat animals, why are they made of meat?'
