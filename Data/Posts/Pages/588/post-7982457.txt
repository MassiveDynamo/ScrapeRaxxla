Edit: certainly might be a supergiant star for the codex DW station pic, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that’s where the station will be found; the Horizons pic is definitely not a red supergiant system, so suspect these are only flavour (almost said fluffy) hints rather than real clues...

My take on the red star is that the start in the codex is not the primary, and that possibly it is an L or Y class as these are also 'gas-giants' in the in-game description. You may say the colours are not right, but there is quite a variation in colour temps in game (I have seen an M star with 7k surface which is white, for instance) so it may not be that straight forwards.

Other types include carbon stars like the S type which are big enough and red enough to make the picture in the codex. This is all in the thread:

With thanks to Jordan Qwent who worked really hard on this stuff..

As ever there is enough wriggle room for many hypotheses to co-exist.
