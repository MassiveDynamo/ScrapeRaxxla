You wont transport synthetic meat? Isnt that just Quorn????
Are you a vegetarian, or some kind of 5th level vegan that refuses to eat anything that casts a shadow?

Surely a piece of quorn, placed on a light surface on a sunny day, would cast a shadow?
As would a nut, or piece of vegetable, fruit, fungi or bread (presumably unleavened because of the yeast)

Perhaps 5th level vegans only come out in the dark? Like dracula?
Mmm, no, don’t think he was vegan...


@Vetinari- do you have a link to that thread? I wasn't aware of it & will have a read.

Edit: certainly might be a supergiant star for the codex DW station pic, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that’s where the station will be found; the Horizons pic is definitely not a red supergiant system, so suspect these are only flavour (almost said fluffy) hints rather than real clues...
