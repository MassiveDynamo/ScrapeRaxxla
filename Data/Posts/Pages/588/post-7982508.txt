Since we're in the premier tinfoil thread, for those who like spectrograms...

A handy little resource of the plasma wave recordings made by Voyager-1.
In a nutshell, the song(s) and when combined, a symphony of the spheres.

The official, contemporary word on Gravity from a "real" physicist no less...

I'm gonna go out on a limb here, and speculate wildly that if light is not capable of achieving escape velocity from a black hole, some force MUST be moving out of the hole faster than light and drawing it back in. If that's an action of Gravity it MUST be overtaking light, so why not build a Gravity FTL drive?

Worthy of further research is the work of T. Townsend Brown, way back in the 1930s, who used high voltage in conjunction with a parabolic dish to manipulate "electro-gravitics", a field of research that was about to bear fruit by the 60s but for some reason suddenly went black and disappeared from sight?

Some would argue the "Fluxliner" has already been capable of FTL travel since around that time and Ben Rich, ex-CEO of Lockheed Skunkworks has even been directly quoted saying "We now have the technology to take ET home" in the 1990s and keys to it's function lie in the realm of ESP research.

Wikipedia says @David Braben studied electrical engineering so, what does he know?

Is it possible that instead of trying to propel a vessel forwards beyond light speed, the FTL mechanic may involve identifying the unique gravitational signal from a distant star, tuning the vehicle to that signal then using it to 'surf' along the gravitational waves toward the distant object using relatively low current?

Having made thousands of 'simulated' jumps it certainly seems like this may be the case.

[Edit: How does any of that help us find Raxxla? Um, dunno. Maybe we're trying too hard?]
