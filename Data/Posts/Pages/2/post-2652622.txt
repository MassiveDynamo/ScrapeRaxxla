Mission: What Was Lost Will Soon Be Found

Mission: What Was Lost Will Soon Be Found (The Wheel Of Time Turns).
Summary: Retrieve Black Box from given system. First Black Box located in a WSS. Listening gave only faint regular beeps. Top and Bottom pics shows respectively the top of 3 orbs or spheres? Trying to sell astro data with Black Boxes in cargo yielded no results, no new astro data was revealed. Recorded sound fragments contains a voice saying: "This is never gonna stop Clay, this challenge will never stop".
Hypothesis: Black Box contains data crystals containing the ships log with mission details and the ships course. Data crystals/spheres are the basis for the Mission: Obfuscated In The Outer Rim / Mission: Silent Song Of The Spheres, although it is strange why the cryptographers is in doubt of it's human/alien origin, if it was simply a data crystal from a ships log.
