Oh, sorry for the misunderstanding, I've only got conjecture on my own part, you are following the leads as you see them

You can find the mentioned location in the GalMap;open it and find the coordinates, it'll be a box with potentially more than one system, and if you are lucky;just one.

How can i tell which grid is which? Can you give me an idea how to use your method?
I am not that firm in astrology, yet i have some serious fun joini9ng up this treasure hunt.

Found some "rare" bodies:
Class M Dwarf-Star with Ring





If i remember correctly the FFE plot spun around Polaris,
including the "Turner Class" ship.
Polaris is one of the brightest stars visible from earth.
Have the other objects in the "brightest star list" been checked out?
I think you need a very bright star, best with a big solar mass used as
a stellar beacon for long range travels.

Any ideas on how i can check what their designation is in E: D?
