Heya,
I was doing some digging on the UA and this mission got my attention.
I have since been directed here and I see you have these missions listed so I'll pass this onto you if it makes any difference I dunno.
This one is from Harma, Gabriel station, Silver Cartel faction.

If this helps, I also found Hafnium 178 convoy in this system (Phraces), all the rings are pristine. Also an UA convoy was found in a nearby system, Krisha.
Also loads of Trinkets of Hidden Fortune in nearby systems. I have been taking them from haulers in the area and selling at BM.

Just some info.
