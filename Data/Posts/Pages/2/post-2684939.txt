I like to try my dry brain cells on this topic aswell,
as i did theorize on the UA thread here are my thoughts.
Maybe you can helP?

Still working on my "Quest for Raxxla",
i'm a bit lost...
I counted every letter in the fabled "Raxxla" and substituted the name with the number of position:

R A X X L A
18 1 24 24 12 1

Now astrologers do not use an X/Y/Z coordinate-system,
and i highly doubt, that a three or four digit relative position in each axis is enough to
navigate the galaxymap of E: D.

But they use another system consiting of three values per variable to locate an object,
the "Right ascension", short RA and the declination, short dec.

In this system the name Raxxla and the allocated numbers indicate a position at:

RA 18h 1min 24sec
dec +/-24Â° 12' 1"

My google skills however do not yield a result in a named system,
can anyone point me on how to navigate to those 2 possible locations?
I am not sure even, if those coordinates take the earth as the origin or maybe SagA*?
Any ideas?

The reason i post this, is because of FFE lore, there is a system with a "Hypergate" rumored to exist, and very hostile human military remnants guarding it.
Maybe you got the key and i got a trace?
I do rule out Polaris out as an option, simply because lacking accessability,
and some UA owners already tried going there with no success (maybe due to a bug?).

Now i looked into the "aladin" star-atlas and found a star right at the coordinates:
"18 01 24.082 -24 12 2.26" in the positive angle there is a super bright star very close,
but nothing right next to the coordinates.

Now to find out what designation the coordinates have...
