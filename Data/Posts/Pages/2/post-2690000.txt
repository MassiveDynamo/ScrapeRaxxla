How can i tell which grid is which? Can you give me an idea how to use your method?
I am not that firm in astrology, yet i have some serious fun joini9ng up this treasure hunt.

Great pictures, Julio!
If I may come with a suggestion: Take the pictures from the Debug view, that way you'll don't see the cockpit.

Open the GalMap, and simply scroll to the coordinates, sadly the ones I suggested is a grid containing no stars.
