Thanks for reminding me, bitstorm. A somewhat impatient mission client is 'suggesting' to send someone else (mission post updated).



Thanks Cmdr. All and any info regarding these missions is most welcome
My most recent theory (thanks to Cmdr nilreb for pointing me to the What Was Lost Will Soon Be Found missions) is that the data crystals originate from Black boxes from ships that has been to the Outer Rim trying to locate Raxxla, Although I have not discovered any specifics on the map, the coordinates or the context.

SPOILER

Ok
Well I went to Mullane Ring and found the other mission there too, fyi.
Are these missions available in all stations and factions?

About black boxes:
"The flight computer from a destroyed ship. Recovered flight computers can offer details on the movements and intentions of ships before meeting their demise....."

Anyway to read this data?
In theory, the black boxes from the missions have the data of where that particular ship has been or was going which is important (according to the mission givers), in solving a mystery.

Is "and on the many earths" a clue. perhaps?
