I and I Redeye said:
Ok
Well I went to Mullane Ring and found the other mission there too, fyi.
Are these missions available in all stations and factions?

About black boxes:
"The flight computer from a destroyed ship. Recovered flight computers can offer details on the movements and intentions of ships before meeting their demise....."

Anyway to read this data?
In theory, the black boxes from the missions have the data of where that particular ship has been or was going which is important (according to the mission givers), in solving a mystery.

Is "and on the many earths" a clue. perhaps?

I believe the missions are available in all stations if your rank and rep are adequate. I have not found a way to read the flight recorders yet, but I believe that's what the Dark Wheel is currently trying to accomplish.

"and on the many earths" could be like a clue, albeit a very vague one.
