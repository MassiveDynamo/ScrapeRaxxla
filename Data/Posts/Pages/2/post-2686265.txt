Here is what i found at my conjecture:

I'm not sure how i shall find that destination...

Oh and on hiding info in the name:
The best hidey spot is the most obvious!^^
They said they have the coords... just can't find it.
That might refer to a missing object in space, or maybe simple problems of keeping information intact over ages.

On conjecture:
The constellation i am in is named "hercules" who did pass "cerberus" to venture into the underworld...
Is this coincidence? Is my mind playing tricks?

96 herculis is a system with 3 suns. 3 heads?

Oh, sorry for the misunderstanding, I've only got conjecture on my own part, you are following the leads as you see them

You can find the mentioned location in the GalMap;open it and find the coordinates, it'll be a box with potentially more than one system, and if you are lucky;just one.
