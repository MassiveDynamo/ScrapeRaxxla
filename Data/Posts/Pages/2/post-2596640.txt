Thank you bitstorm, this is additional information I haven't seen about the mission regarding what the factions are looking for in the containers. I'll be sure to try the Silent Song mission without the actual spheres if possible. Not sure how to test the Outer Rim mission, as there's no cargo to non-deliver.

I have a few questions, I hope you can answer for me:
- How did you come to think about trying to see what would happen if you tried to deliver without the actual containers?
- Did you try to complete the mission and deliver a stolen container(s)?
- Your two screenshots are almost identical, was that intention?

And yes, the Dark Wheel faction does seem to be a rather complicated faction

1) Just experimenting with the mission, trying to figure out if there's a link to the Unknown Artefact.
2) Not sure what you're asking here, I've completed this mission many times. You still get the bugged mission text on completion. Are you specifically asking about the version given out by The Dark Wheel? Yes I completed that nothing out of the ordinary happened.
3) The latter is the only screen shot I have of The Dark Wheel mission, I added the mission header at the top. I thought I'd taken a screenshot of the initial mission page but it seems not. =(
