Good luck commander.
Raxxla and Dark wheel does seem to be the first major piece of Elite Lore to be put into the game, hopefully your search will lead to somewhere.

I got a funny suspicion through we will have to wait until Frontier narrative designer to join the team before this is fully implemented into the game.

I hope I'm wrong through.

Thank you, Cmdr. I'm quite sure that I'll be spending a lot of time chasing Raxxla, perhaps even enough time to give any alien culture enough time to actually build the constructs I'm searching for should they not exist yet
