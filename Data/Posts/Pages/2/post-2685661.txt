Here is what i found at my conjecture:

15 jumps left to HIP 88264....
Enthusiasm critical, coffee critical...

EDIT: Arrived, scanning system.

Scan complete... nothing...

Hi Cmdr, only conjecture I'm afraid. Finding Raxxla using encoding from the name itself would be rather sneaky, but probably not without the reaches of the imaginations of FD. Not logged in atm, but what about grid reference 181,24,24, planet @121LY?

I'm not sure how i shall find that destination...

Oh and on hiding info in the name:
The best hidey spot is the most obvious!^^
They said they have the coords... just can't find it.
That might refer to a missing object in space, or maybe simple problems of keeping information intact over ages.

On conjecture:
The constellation i am in is named "hercules" who did pass "cerberus" to venture into the underworld...
Is this coincidence? Is my mind playing tricks?

96 herculis is a system with 3 suns. 3 heads?
