On that Black Box one, do you know if going back to the mission giver without the item as per my comment above (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=168253&p=2595789&viewfull=1#post2595789) was tested or is it unknown?

Thanks for reminding me, bitstorm. A somewhat impatient mission client is 'suggesting' to send someone else (mission post updated).

Heya,
I was doing some digging on the UA and this mission got my attention.
I have since been directed here and I see you have these missions listed so I'll pass this onto you if it makes any difference I dunno.
This one is from Harma, Gabriel station, Silver Cartel faction.

If this helps, I also found Hafnium 178 convoy in this system (Phraces), all the rings are pristine. Also an UA convoy was found in a nearby system, Krisha.
Also loads of Trinkets of Hidden Fortune in nearby systems. I have been taking them from haulers in the area and selling at BM.

Just some info.

Thanks Cmdr. All and any info regarding these missions is most welcome
My most recent theory (thanks to Cmdr nilreb for pointing me to the What Was Lost Will Soon Be Found missions) is that the data crystals originate from Black boxes from ships that has been to the Outer Rim trying to locate Raxxla, Although I have not discovered any specifics on the map, the coordinates or the context.

I have yet to discover a tangible link between Raxxla, the UA's and the Hafnium 178.
