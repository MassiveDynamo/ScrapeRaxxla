Like Baldrick I have a plan though...to follow some leads in the near future, could do with at least one PC and one PS player just in case some logs etc only work on one platform if anybody interested in a domesticated goose-chase (its not quite wild, it will lead somewhere and will provide mysteries and puzzles and answers for newer players like me and maybe some new insights into a bigger picture if there is one if we all work together)
Is it a Cunning Plan?
Where abouts were you thinking? If it's anywhere near Sag A* I can postpone my return to the bubble to check up on things.
