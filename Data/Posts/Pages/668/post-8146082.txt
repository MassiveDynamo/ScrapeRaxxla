Id go with the English version of descriptions of Raxxla as that the language it written in, any translation may not have the same word meaning exactly so will always be the nearest word.

What is a rogue planet? I thought it was one of the AB/BC/CD named ones that don't orbit 1 star, if so theyre everywhere, am I looking at the wrong thing?

@Rochester, fully agree with your post plus that the Codex if anything was intended to bring it all together and make it tidier / less confusing. If there are hints they are in game somewhere, probably 'for those with eyes to see' and hidden in plain sight. Theres one semi-obvious reference to the DW at one beacon, but not in a good way and not sure where it supposed to lead. Problem is half the logs on installations don't work so don't know if anything is missing which would help.

Like Baldrick I have a plan though...to follow some leads in the near future, could do with at least one PC and one PS player just in case some logs etc only work on one platform if anybody interested in a domesticated goose-chase (its not quite wild, it will lead somewhere and will provide mysteries and puzzles and answers for newer players like me and maybe some new insights into a bigger picture if there is one if we all work together)
