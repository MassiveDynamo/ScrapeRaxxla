My intial meandering towards tourist beacons as one way to find Raxxla isn't based off any evidence, nor do I actually believe they literally point the way, I'm certain they dont, but.

I believe what I was trying to do in my last post, was to encourage myself enough to investigate the possibility that they do, or at least; hold enough consistent information which could be examined.

What I think I was trying to hint at was, is there any meaning to this information. That is does it (intentionally or unintentionally) present any relationships; between certain stars, names or dates etc?

Now it just so happens that some other kindly and ingenious commanders have already worked tirelessly in the past to build such a directory (or matrix) of said tourist beacon data. Its available right here on this forum.

Now I may / or may not (as this is what I do in RL and I'm hesitant to 'work' at a game) be able to apply key-word analysis and relationship map these texts.

Its a bit like mapping someones data, in that you can map their behaviour from simple bits of information.

Is there in this data (or other such data) any direct (or indirect) indication of something? If you recall the COR once mapped simular data to highlight the likelihood of the existence of the Club...could tourist data (or to be more specific 'ED lore') it also show the fingerprints of a developer?

I may or may not have at it...up until 5 minutes ago I'd only realised someone had already built an Excel database, thats half the work done already....but.

Tis a shame in any rate, when you're no longer actually playing the game to unlock its mysteries but instead spend your (what free time you have) pouring over spreadsheets...

But its a potential lead, and when you have eliminated the improbable, whatever remains, however unimportant, may have, or it may not hold some meaning.
