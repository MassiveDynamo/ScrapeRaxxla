Is it a Cunning Plan?

I woudnt go that far..Im near Sag A myself so thought it may as well start in the Conflux sites and work down after Ive been to Colonia. Its as much a 'mysteries of ED' tour as anything. Following some trails etc btw do any of the logs works on the Event Horizon for you? Getting no info from them, same for flight log on DSSV? This is why I need a PC & PS player so we can be 99% sure theres nothing there or its a bug on XB for example.
