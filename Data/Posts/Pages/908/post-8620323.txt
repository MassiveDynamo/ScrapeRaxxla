To reiterate, the statements from 2014 may not be valid at all. But look at the wording, if this is true then we may have to 'actively scan the area of space' before we can 'travel through hyperspace to it' in that area. What the Stephen!?
I can't believe I've witnessed anything like this in the game as of mechanics. I find it hard to image how they have done this - since we have 'real star mode' in the map.
But if it's true then we may have not been able to 'uncover' these regions / systems / areas yet.


Interesting, I hadn’t seen that quote by MB before, but it does seem to support Rogue Planets as their own system type! Presumably they should show in “other” system tyoe in the galmap filter.

However that DB quote is from 2014 when they were still defining the game so it may have been overtaken by events. Certainly the concept of “dark systems” from the FD-sponsored books, which seems to be rogue planets, has been said (I have no reference) to be implemented as LYT type stars. I don’t think we can “scan for systems” as per the quote, only for bodies/objects within systems. We don’t seem to have a generally available mechanism to name our discovered systems (there woud be quite a few Jorki’s Rest around!) apart from Founder backers.
