Those are 2014 quotes, since which a lot has changed. The described scanning process was radically altered by FSS as well. Also there is to my knowledge no way to 'actively scan space' for dark systems as described - or have we all missed a major aspect of exploration (I don't think so) - Dark Systems is usually meant to mean systems with Brown dwarves etc. only afaik..

I was wondering the same but waited until someone whod played for longer said something. Does any of that bit about Dark Systems fit into any gameplay at all from that time or was it another idea that got shelved? (like Rogue Planets afaik) Have we been missing something a 'tiny bit obvious' all this time? Are there areas of the galaxy that arent mapped until a payer gets within so many LY and we dont even know it?....cue Donald Rumsfeld.

But 1st need to confirm presence of rogue planets. I would suggest everybody to get a habbit check left panel EACH jump, especially in deep space where it is not flooded by stations.

What am I looking for? I wouldnt know if a 'system' in the Nav Panel was significant or not would I? I usually scan for permit locked but a lot of times its just a meaningless name and string of numbers? Anything in particular to look out for? Any string of numbers or something, I still dont understand exactly what they mean but I know others including you can decipher them so just tell me what to look for.

Arent Rogue planets in game the ones that co-orbit a binary system not orbiting just one star? They have an x - designation on system map?
