To reiterate, the statements from 2014 may not be valid at all. But look at the wording, if this is true then we may have to 'actively scan the area of space' before we can 'travel through hyperspace to it' in that area. What the Stephen!?
I can't believe I've witnessed anything like this in the game as of mechanics. I find it hard to image how they have done this - since we have 'real star mode' in the map.
But if it's true then we may have not been able to 'uncover' these regions / systems / areas yet.
