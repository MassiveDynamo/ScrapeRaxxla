Not sure about Rouge Planets .. but how about a potential Rouge System for you :

Theta Orionis C - this should be the center of the Orion Nebula however it is on the opposite side of the bubble from the nebula. This star is supposed to be responsible for the ionizing radiation that illuminates the Orion Nebula...
