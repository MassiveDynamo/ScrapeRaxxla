Those are 2014 quotes, since which a lot has changed. The described scanning process was radically altered by FSS as well. Also there is to my knowledge no way to 'actively scan space' for dark systems as described - or have we all missed a major aspect of exploration (I don't think so) - Dark Systems is usually meant to mean systems with Brown dwarves etc. only afaik..
