OK, so after searching through the names of the 10,000 systems within 140 ly of Sol, one stood out in regard to my "sight" clue hypothesis
That system is SEER, 84.5 ly from Sol. Spent an hour or so flying around, checking out several USS, & trying to find anything at the orbit centres of the 3 stars (no other bodies) but nothing found.
