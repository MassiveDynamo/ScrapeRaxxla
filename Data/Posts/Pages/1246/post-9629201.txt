The Dark Wheel invite needs to be obtained by completing the 12 labors. This is why there is a clue 'we know why people haven't found it'. Cmdr's tend to play one facet of the game. How many are doing "Elite" level combat + espionage + trade + larceny + exploration + passenger, etc ??

None....

Good luck Cmdr's !
