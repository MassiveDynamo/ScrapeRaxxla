Again, Raxxla in the game predated Thargoid and Guardian relics.

Has anyone checked into the intact fighter that can be found in USS's. I noticed that unlike the other pieces of debris, it cannot be moved from it's spawn point. It also has these callsigns on it -- 1LAR1A-X and 3-R1K-A 4821. Almost seems like a possible cipher.
Well, the word "RAXXLA" is definitely in there somewhere. Just need to work out how to unscramble the coordinates.
