Getting to the asteroid base in the Heart nebula yesterday, I noticed that all the surroundings around were scanned, but they were scanned very poorly - some stars were scanned, but the planets were not. Because of human laziness, the object of the search can really be right under your nose and no one will see it. The embarrassing thing is that Drew Vagar asked Braben about the Raxxsla and he said that some pilots had visited that system, but apparently it was not scanned, but simply refueled and flew on. Considering that all inhabited stars and their neighbors are somehow open and scanned, does this not indicate distant regions of space? I think that these are either distant, still unexplored regions or closed sectors like the Polar Star (Polaris).
