Jut remember you can track Halley's comet which travels the same speed as the lower speed of supercruise...coincidence? its catchable and Pareco may just have been a hint that we can drop on them

using the skybox, hip 41299 and the distance of 17262ls i am on route to see if i can find it, the distance would be past the current position of makemake and the distance well exceeds the probes
