The Dark Wheel invite needs to be obtained by completing the 12 labors. This is why there is a clue 'we know why people haven't found it'. Cmdr's tend to play one facet of the game. How many are doing "Elite" level combat + espionage + trade + larceny + exploration + passenger, etc ??

None....

Good luck Cmdr's !

Done them all, and many of them at that including all dark wheel original missions, maxed powerplay in all powers, have every permit in the game available/known right now also allied with most factions within the bubble and many other things so if it is linked to all this...I am RAXXLA
