Am I far enough yet lol...now heres the confusing part......after 3000ls it changed to 0.10ly however 3000ls is not 0.10 of a light year....

If anyone knows the true conversion please let me know, the goal is 17261ls away from earth, I am at 0.17ly in supercruise currently, if you could give me the converted 17261ls to the supercruise ly that would be even better and i can manage my speed to slow down just beforehand and do the rest fo the journey at 30km/s
