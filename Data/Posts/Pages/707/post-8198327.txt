Is there any Lore behind Trevithick Dock other than it being the original starting point for players in LHS 3447?
has some similarities to SD in that it’s an independent system controlled by the Pilots Federation Local Branch, just like SD and Jameson Memorial and now it’s even permit locked unless you have no rank whereas SD is locked until elite. Making mirror images of each other.
there’s a story behind Jameson Memorial and SD itself, wonder if there’s anything to connect it to LHS 3447.
