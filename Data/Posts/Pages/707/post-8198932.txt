alright. nevermind then, my apologies commander. i guess TDW in SD is a legitimate one. i will take your word for it... you seem to know your stuff. i hope that leaves us somewhere usefull now. where do we go from here? i was merely pointing out the not so obvious different views on the puzzle, not making conclusions. and for the sap 8 missions, how good and usefull is all that text, if it has been removed from the current game... you know what i mean? just a thought.

as for me, im heading to the void sector, quite a long journey it is. if any commanders are living in colonia, im passing by soon to say hello, and disturb your peaceful existence in there haha. (just for a short while) if there are things you think are worth investigating for this thread's topic, around colonia/void sector, please do let me know. i will be your extended hand in the void.
