the real dark wheel, the fake dark wheel. The dark wheel hasn't found raxxla....it's one of the reasons why it still exists. They're looking and still dont know. So pursuing the dark wheel is like watching that stupid treasure of oak island tv show on the history channel. A waste of time.

If anything, the dark wheel is competing with us to find it. However, in the game, i doubt such a thing is simulated. However it would be really cool if whenever you find raxxla, a fleet of spec ops ships appear and attempt to kill you before you can make it to any station to make the data known to the rest of the bgs. Then the game will be trying to get the data thru so you can be given the recognition....or perhaps nobody would be able to and the narrative gives it to the dark wheel .....you having played the role of leading them right to it.
