Okay so Trevithick (Trevithick Dock) was the inventor of the high pressure steam engine and the steam locomotive. The major invention was first unveiled and displayed on Christmas Eve.
Beagle 2 Landing is named after the British mars rover that lost communication with control right before final landing and deployment. It was lost on Christmas Eve.
I can’t find any dates for John Jameson (death birth etc) or the founding of SD/Jameson Memorial. If it has any Christmas Eve connection that may be a clue if the 2 starting systems and the “end” system all have ties to Christmas Eve.
the day a “New Star Appeared” according to the story anyway.
