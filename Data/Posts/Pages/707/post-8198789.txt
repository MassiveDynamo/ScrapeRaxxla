there's no one listed as controlling factions with the minor factions that are available there. but when you turn in your exploration data you gain reputation with pilots federation local branch proving that they are the ones that control the station. I hope this squashes any further confusion so we can move on with tinfoil please LOL JK

Shrug it was in context of what FullM3talX was speculating about. If we are full on speculating then it would seem more probable that the PF IS the front (since it is universally known) and TDW faction is the hidden hand in the back controlling things. Because no normal people in the galaxy would know about TDW faction since it is locked off in SD prior to its expansion in LFT 926. Again refer to my previous post about Trade Elite being a $50B billionaire in today's money.

Edit: I mean think about it. You become a billionaire, PF gives you a very special permit to access a very special system, which the TDW faction also has, and we are suppose to think that they are nothing special? Hmm ok...

Edit 2: Just realized how ridiculous 3xElite is in today's context. Essentially its like Bill Gates who is also a top level Pirate Ninja UFC champion who is also a part time Astronaut pilot on the weekends aka Batman.
