Realistically the circle of independent Elite pilots was more of like a separate group because of a schism between Alex Ryder's children Oberon and Neptune. however it turned out Robert Garry was a direct descendant of Alex Ryder and the last surviving heir apparent I don't really think he needed an invitation at that level.

We didn't really get any confirmation on what goes on after all of that crap happened. It's a little hard to speculate on what events might have transpired. It's possible that the engineer Liz Ryder is a descendant of Alex Ryder for Euribia blue Mafia. but I'm sure that there's people that have Max reputation possible with her and I imagine they would speak up if she was a key involvement in this.

I have to also agree with machina ergo sum about tdw being the actual shadow controlling faction and PFLB being a puppet .
