we know that the dark wheel likes secrecy, like top tier secrecy. and for them to have a base in that one most famous, and first system you get access to as you achieve elite status, doesn't sound like how the real DW does things around. it's way too easy and in the open. besides, nothing much seems to come from that faction other than some normal missions. people have tried everything by now, and surely something would have come up if they were legit.

but who knows...
edit: also what Jorki Rasalas said above.

I don't think you understand how significant it is to have access to SD.

1 credit is the equivalent of $50 in today's economy. A Trade Elite requires 1B credits or $50B in today's money. No 10 on the 2019 top 10 list has $50.8B.

Now this is the type of real Elite that has access to SD. Literally no one else in the galaxy has access to SD.

Here's another perspective from googling. In today's money, apparently the top 0.001% in the US earns $59M and there are "only" 1412 of them (who pays their taxes anyway). And these people in ED terms, are way below Elite level.

And yet we have Elite level missions to steal SAP 8 Core containers from The Dark Wheel faction ships. So are they important or no?

I'm not exactly sure where your idea of getting negative faction comes from logically other than an offshoot of brute forcing every possible scenario which will then go down a never ending rabbit hole, much like those people trying rare good triggers, which means its futile.

You think the Dark Wheel advertises on a station board in plain sight?

The best secrets are always hidden in plain sight. Only for those with eyes to see. That character has her own motivations to say what she says and we can only speculate in that context.
