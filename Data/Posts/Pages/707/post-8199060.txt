i was merely pointing out the not so obvious different views on the puzzle, not making conclusions. and for the sap 8 missions, how good and usefull is all that text, if it has been removed from the current game... you know what i mean? just a thought.

Sure and I am trying to understand as to how your idea was reached to get "negative" reputation other than as a result of trying something different because "everything else" seems to have been exhausted.

As I've said before in other places, there are various mechanics and mysteries not widely known and available for solving. Maybe try going for those first.

Good luck in Region 42.
