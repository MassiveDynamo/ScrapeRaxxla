i agree with all what you said @Machina Ergo Sum. i think the difference is, you're looking at it from a lore point of view. and from that view, it makes sense that accessing SD is a big deal only reserved to very few pilots. im looking at it from a gameplay point of view. surely you wouldn't put a very important secret of your game, in the very first logical achievement that every player would think of having, wich is elite status? wich can be aquired by delivering a few hundred tons of void opals to a max selling station? is that what it takes to find and possibly join the dark wheel? the game even congratulates us for the first elite, and waves the shinrata permit at our faces. it sounds too easy to me from a gameplay side.

as far as i know. those SAP 8 missions only have special in their name. other than that, they played out like a completely normal mission. not to forget that they dont exist anymore. (wich opens doors to many speculations on it's own)

i dont know why gaining negative reputation with them sounds such a wild idea to you. think about it, the mechanic is there... you can actually do it in the game. and the codex hints at the possibility that the DW faction in SD could possibly be a fake. it also states that they train their children in secret, and only reveal to them the truth of their membership, once they do certain acts that proves their aptitude. i say, lets go set some fires in their stations. and see what happens lol
