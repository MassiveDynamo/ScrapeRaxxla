So a pilot achieves an Elite ranking (which is supposed to be top tier and super difficult in the ED lore), be given access to Shinrarta Dezhra by the PF where The Dark Wheel faction grants him the ability to buy everything at a discount at a station they control and yet somehow he should doubt that an organization with this level of influence and power in the entire Galaxy is not the real TDW?

Mmm ok...
PF controlls Jameson Memorial, not TDW.
