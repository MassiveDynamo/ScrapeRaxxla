It’s controlled by the Pilots Federation Local Branch. TDW is a minor faction in Jameson Memorial, they don’t control it.

Similar to the ground base in the system with the DW Installation then, according to GalMap owned by PF Local and DW is minor faction. PF don't run it though as controlling faction, cant remember who it is.

Confirm dust is from core roid mining, looks cool in that light though.

think Beagle Landing was named when the scientist died in memory of him, that was the reason one of them was named anyway, not sure its that one. So maybe not Christmas Eve related.

Anyone checked out EDSM dashboard map recently? Mine shows Santa leaving Beagle Point on a route to the bubble, is it a message, am I special?
