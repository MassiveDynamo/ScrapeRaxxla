Yep, should have learned not to post here. Back to avoiding forums.
Too bad you removed it. I think you would have picked up a few supporters of your idea.

People can be a bit blunt here sometimes though, if they don't see what you're seeing.
That doesn't mean we should shoot down each others ideas.
Ideas needs to be expressed, have their own life and keep being refined. A sound idea will survive, a great one will attract followers and evolve.

@CmdrNous : I hope you'll reconsider and come back one day again though.

To us all - this is a place where we should not have to worry about ridicule. I mean, come on, look at the topic we're discussing.
We all are crazy. Fernweh crazy.
Allow ideas to be expressed. They need to grow before they become good and sound theories.
