4. Raxxla picture includes symbols with known meaning, used in previous clue diagrams.

Underline added. My problem was with the assertion of 'known' things which within 5 pages would become a fact and mislead everyone, we've had enough trouble with unconfirmed rumours or just plain lies repeated as facts by other people who believe them to be true. Fine as a theory, nothing can be discounted as a theory, I love theories, but every so often someone comes along with 'facts' which have been discounted or aren't facts but theories. I asked for citations / evidence of these stated facts that's all. I've been proven wrong on this thread and have no problem recanting or finding the evidence that led me to that conclusion, If theres evidence lets get it in the open. If its just a theory or someone stating something as fact elsewhere when it isn't then lets not repeat it as a known fact.

The known facts are on page 1 in the OP, they still get updated afaik when evidence is provided. They are very few.

The whole thing is grey, there is no black and white...yet......although there is a lot of silver.
