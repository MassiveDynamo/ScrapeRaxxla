One more CMDR joining the Quest !

Currently reading this thread but it's taking me much longer than expected as I try to open old links and inform myself of what has been done and discussed. Sadly, even at the stage where I am now (page 85), I noticed exactly the same points were brought and discussed by multiple people many times over. I guess not many do read the whole thread. Anyhow, there were some very interesting insights and spots that I plan to revisit, in case some details were overlooked.
