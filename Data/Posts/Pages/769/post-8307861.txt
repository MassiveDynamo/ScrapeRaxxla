No luck opening the door using the systems mentioned here.
First tried the route with my Federal Corvette. Nothing. Then fitted a Cobra Mk III with no cargo racks. Nothing. Then fitted cargo racks and traded at every system, except Aona. Nothing.

I wonder where Ciraq is...

What book was that list taken from?
