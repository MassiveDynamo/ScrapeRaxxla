It means that raxxla was accessible when hyperdrive technology was in its infancy. That you could reach it from sol using nothing as advanced as what we have (in-game) today.
It will be in one of the closest star systems to Sol.

I agree with the sentiment of this, I have been basing my last couple of months Questing on it. However I agree there is some weight to be given to the alternative argument that TDW may have found Raxxla, (but then lost it??? Unlikely, unless it randomly moves when we may never find it other than pure happenstance, which would be dreadful gameplay/design). Certainly they are a band of adventurers, explorers, myth hunters etc who may well have pushed the boundaries of what was possible at that time with hyperdrive tech. Also we were told that early exploration was done with unmanned probes so they could have gone much further. But I think if you take these two views together, then Raxxla shouldnâ€™t be all that far from what is the current bubble, which has expanded since the very early explorations. Havent got time to search out the actual figures, but lets say the initial drives allowed jumps of 1ly/week, then maybe 300 (totally dreamt up, no factual basis) jumps would be a practicable limit for such explorers, so Raxxla should be within 300 ly of Sol. Definitely within a 3000ly radius sphere, but I suspect much closer. There was some early suggestion that the goids are looking for Raxxla (source? Was it OOTD? canonical??), which could imply out towards the locked Col70 region, orbit but more likely around the Pleiades given their fondness for that region. Hypothesis- the UAs were searching for Raxxla, which is Merope5C, now prove me wrong!!
