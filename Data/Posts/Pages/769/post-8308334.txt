Again...remember that there were two Raxxlas. The real planet, protected by a Raxxlan race, and the Coriolis station, which was essentially a stepping stone to another galaxy. So unless Braben, or someone at FDEV says the actual planet is in the Milkyway? I'm going to put my $$ on a station. It's most feasible. I couldn't see how they'd justify a moving of a planet all the way across deep space to another galaxy. The coriolis station is what used to be located in Lave and had since been moved. Not the planet Raxxla, which Ryder ultimately located in Andromeda.
I think all the info about the Coriolis station, is from fan fiction(Oolite). There are no official descriptions of Raxxla except for Rafe Zetters words, in The Dark Wheel.

Rafe's words: "Your father was chasing the mythical planet Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it not? If it does, then on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty, and treasures, and aliens, and life…"

and : "Cirag is Cirag, and Raxxla—if it exists—is in another Galaxy".

In the context of TDW, another Galaxy means not in Galaxy 1, in the Galcop network.
