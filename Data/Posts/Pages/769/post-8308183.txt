In another thread a cmdr said 'its a game not a funeral' the context is unimportant buti was about to reply 'And Here The Wheel' started out with a funeral, sort of. The Garry clan pirate a ship and it turns out to be a coffin with Oberon's corpse.

Immediately i stopped and came here to spout off madly about a theory involving all those funeral ships that are almost as common as the cruise ships and wedding barges.

Has anyone tried to pirate them with either hatch breaker limpets or something? What if that triggers a chain of events in some manner? I dont know what i would expect to happen but im not much of a pirate. Never managed liberate hostages or anything yet either...
