Unlikely, unless it randomly moves when we may never find it other than pure happenstance...

An interesting concept that's been passed around a few times has been that Raxxla is in a Lagrange Point. It could explain the "movement" mentioned.

Some thoughts to spark conversation:
TDW in Shinrarta Dezhra is a fake front run by the real Dark Wheel. META.
Raxxla logo looks like the panel inside stations at the back (this tinfoil is heavy). Platform 9 and 3/4 anyone?
Old theory about logo: It's a map; travel from a starting point to the 3rd closest system and then to the 33rd location in system. To my knowledge this has not been tested from Delphi (If my calculations are right, using Delphi as 0 lands you in Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-7 while using Delphi as 1 results in HIP 17692)
Speaking of Delphi, might be significant: The Greek "Omphalos stone" (assuming the Omphalos Rift is related, of course) was considered the center of the universe and it supposedly allowed communication with the gods. It was also known as the "naval of the world". Zeus sent two eagles to fly around the world at equal speeds and then placed the stone where they crossed paths at Delphi. This stone became the symbol of Apollo. So, find the "center" of Delphi? Or 5a? Or maybe theorycraft two unmodded Eagles and see where they end up?!
Class Y stars contain the line "...[Class Y stars] are effectively very large gas giant planets, with some stellar properties" and commonly have rings. TDW "gas giant"?
"The parent's grief, the lover's woe and the yearning of our vagabond hearts." might be one object instead of three separate leads. Would greatly narrow down parameters. Also note: "lover's woe", not "lovers' woe"; singular possessive, not plural.
