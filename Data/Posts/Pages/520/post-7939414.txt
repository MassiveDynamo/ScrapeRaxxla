i posted this image about a month ago. so far, we have no reason to suspect that Raxxla is linked to the Guardians. i have no theories that correspond with this image, other than the striking resemblance to the Raxxla codex logo. had i been in a different ship, i think i could have gotten an angle that would make the resemblance near exact. one thing to note is this image is upside down when compared to the logo...

i'm not even sure why i'm bringing this image back up. i guess it just keeps haunting me.

It's fundamentally a hexagon, and hexagons are common. I'd need a little more correlation before I started making connections.
