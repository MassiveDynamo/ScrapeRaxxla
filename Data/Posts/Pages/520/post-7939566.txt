It's fundamentally a hexagon, and hexagons are common. I'd need a little more correlation before I started making connections.
I'm with ya, i understand that it's sorta a product of the geometry at work...

The parts i find most curious are the inner circle, the three lines that surround it, and the 6 sections formed by absence.

I'm not even interested in trying to connect the guardians to Raxxla. I just find it very compelling that nearly every aspect of the raxxla logo is represented in that picture, except for the dashed lines, as far as i can tell (perhaps has something to do with the sounds the beacon makes?).

As a matter of example, there is a lot of design in this game that has to do with 6s and 3s, but nowhere else in the game is there anything that resembles anything close to the Raxxla symbol, as far as we know...
