On a serious note, I keep wondering if Guardian technology is actually human. We know that time travel exists in the ED universe, so it's not too crazy. Not sure how that would tie in with anything, though.

That looks a lot like a clue, and (sing it with me now, you know the words) There Will Be No Clues
