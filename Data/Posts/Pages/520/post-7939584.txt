SPOILER

On a serious note, I keep wondering if Guardian technology is actually human. We know that time travel exists in the ED universe, so it's not too crazy. Not sure how that would tie in with anything, though.
I didnt know time travel was confirmed in ED. Sorry, but do you have a source?

Would be interesting if raxxla was actually a time gate of sorts. We still have much to learn about the guardians. All of the info we have so far is spoken from the perspective of Ram Tah, and there's reason to believe he's not particularly trustworthy or honest with the general population of humanity. I suspect the nature of the guardian-thargoid war to be much different than his reports, for instance.
