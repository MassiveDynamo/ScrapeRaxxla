I didnt know time travel was confirmed in ED. Sorry, but do you have a source?

Would be interesting if raxxla was actually a time gate of sorts. We still have much to learn about the guardians. All of the info we have so far is spoken from the perspective of Ram Tah, and there's reason to believe he's not particularly trustworthy or honest with the general population of humanity. I suspect the nature of the guardian-thargoid war to be much different than his reports, for instance.
I'm looking around for a source for that, but I'm pretty sure I read that mis-jumps left people in different times, and sometimes even turned "inside out." I think it had to do with early jump drive tech.
I may be mixing Elite lore with some of Robert Holdstocks works, though.

Edit: Looks like I was wrong about that, unless I'm missing something. I think it goes back to Alien World by Steven Eisler (Robert Holdstock) which describes a generation ship being sent back thousands of years to a galaxy they called "The Dark Wheel." I had a whole theory going about that before somebody pointed out that it wasn't related to Elite.

Does anybody know if there are examples of time travel in Elite? It seems like the lore is heavily based on Holdstock's works, so I would think it could be possible.
