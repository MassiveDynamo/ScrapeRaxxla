There is only one book that mentions Rxxla and can be deemed lore for ED, and that’s the original Holdstock’s 1984 TDW novella; however I’m fairly sure that has been discounted as canon by FD. Therefore on lore grounds we have absolutely no idea or even grounds for guessing what Raxxla is in ED!
Raxxla is mentioned by name in Premonition, And Here the Wheel and Elite Legacy.
