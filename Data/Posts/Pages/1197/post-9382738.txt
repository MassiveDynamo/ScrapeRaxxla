Ceres was in FE2/FFE. There was nothing on it but ice, back then.
I don’t know why the dropped it. There are far smaller bodies in ED.
Yes, it’s absence is highly suspicious! I suspect Ceres is the Guardian ark ship, stealthed (the real message behind the codex DW station). But the question is how to find it!!
