Thanks for all the links, Jorki! I am in the Sol system now, gonna look around and experience the oddities of the asteroids myself. First thing I am gonna do though is fly out to the voyager probe. Not just to see it, but also because it is in a region where the theoretical Oort cloud should be close by, the inner one at least. Anyone ever found something belonging to that cloud? Seems a good candidate for mystery objects to me. Definitely a "place" where you could easily hide something important and make it hard to find because it is so far from inhabited space in Sol. Also, since it is supposed to contain many comets, that is what spiraling stars could refer to as well, since we call comets/meteors falling stars.
