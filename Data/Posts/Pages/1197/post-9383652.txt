Thanks for all the links, Jorki! I am in the Sol system now, gonna look around and experience the oddities of the asteroids myself. First thing I am gonna do though is fly out to the voyager probe. Not just to see it, but also because it is in a region where the theoretical Oort cloud should be close by, the inner one at least. Anyone ever found something belonging to that cloud? Seems a good candidate for mystery objects to me. Definitely a "place" where you could easily hide something important and make it hard to find because it is so far from inhabited space in Sol. Also, since it is supposed to contain many comets, that is what spiraling stars could refer to as well, since we call comets/meteors falling stars.

You’re very welcome!
Welcome to Sol! I’m floating around in the asteroid belt somewhere, not had chance to fly since Monday afternoon. But then, until I have a viable plan for a search I’m not sure there’s any point, I’ve already done a whole skinful of boring “find the asteroid”.

Yes, it’s worth visiting both Vgers, and New Horizons too. But it’s a long journey out to them, hope you’ve got the advanced Flight Assist fitted! There are IIRC four USS marked “ancient probe” but one of them is a tourist beacon at Vger1. Dont think anything has ever been found out in the Oort cloud in-game, but it would be a good place to hide mysteries. Especially off the ecliptic, the search space is vast!!. Good hunting!
