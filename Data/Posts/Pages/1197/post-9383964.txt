Yes, it’s worth visiting both Vgers, and New Horizons too. But it’s a long journey out to them, hope you’ve got the advanced Flight Assist fitted!
I sure do! Perfect to make a new coffee while waiting to arrive, and maybe read something on the side Visited all the ancient probes, then went asteroid hunting. I haven't really formulated a plan yet, so I just got myself familiar with how to find the invisible areas where the HUD suddenly jumps to the asteroid hologram. Speaking of jumping, the bouncing around the system orrery view is really weird.

So far all I managed is screenshotting the edges of where the fields start. Sketched out a rough outline for 1 one of them, currently trying to do the same with another one. This is a very rough estimate how the area looks like, so don't rely on this too much when trying to hit that asteroid zone.
