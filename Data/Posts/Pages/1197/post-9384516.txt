Just wondering whether young Tyko should go on a long distance expedition and leave Jorki to Quest, there’s the Apollo XV expedition setting off in two days time...touchdown at destination on 30 July...would be a nice way to mark my 69th ring in the tree of life!

But this train of thought triggered another thought (destination isn’t all that far from Hawking’s Gap) - has anyone done all three Dynasty locations, i.e. got all the logs from all the Formidine Rift, Conflux and Hawking’s Gap bases? Any DW invitation received? The only real knowledge we have about TDW (apart from the meagre offering in the Codex) is Drew Wagar’s Reclamation and Premonition books where TDW is at the heart of the storyline; Luko, Rebecca and Salomé (& Elyssia Fields?) were members... Perhaps FD set those logs as the trigger for DW test of skill & courage? Jorki’s visited FRift & Conflux but not the Gap. Cant remember what Tyko’s visited & cant at the mo get to gaming PC to check.
