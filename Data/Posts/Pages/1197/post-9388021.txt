All right... So this is my 3rd response here. As of late I have been watching far to much of Ronald D. Moore's BSG. During the intro, at the part where the galactica jumps, it sounds like the word raxxla is said. In my mind this means one of three things. BSG has something to do with raxxla or vise versa, or the hindu chant that is supposed to be the intro music is related to raxxla, or lastly, I am finally succumbing to space madness. It is probably just nothing but I thought I would put it here anyway...
