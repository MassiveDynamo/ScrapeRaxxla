But this train of thought triggered another thought (destination isn’t all that far from Hawking’s Gap) - has anyone done all three Dynasty locations, i.e. got all the logs from all the Formidine Rift, Conflux and Hawking’s Gap bases? Any DW invitation received? The only real knowledge we have about TDW (apart from the meagre offering in the Codex) is Drew Wagar’s Reclamation and Premonition books where TDW is at the heart of the storyline; Luko, Rebecca and Salomé (& Elyssia Fields?) were members... Perhaps FD set those logs as the trigger for DW test of skill & courage? Jorki’s visited FRift & Conflux but not the Gap. Cant remember what Tyko’s visited & cant at the mo get to gaming PC to check.

Ya i meant to visit them all… but think im one short…. That filthy to-do list. Currently working on trying to narrow down the galactic omphalos.

Ps - happy new tree ring!
