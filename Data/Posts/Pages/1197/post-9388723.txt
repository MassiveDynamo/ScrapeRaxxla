All right... So this is my 3rd response here. As of late I have been watching far to much of Ronald D. Moore's BSG. During the intro, at the part where the galactica jumps, it sounds like the word raxxla is said. In my mind this means one of three things. BSG has something to do with raxxla or vise versa, or the hindu chant that is supposed to be the intro music is related to raxxla, or lastly, I am finally succumbing to space madness. It is probably just nothing but I thought I would put it here anyway...
Good evening sir, nice to see you. We have a new type of flight suit just in today and I’m sure you’ll like it. It’s very special. There’s plenty of room for adjustment with all these big buckles. Yes, that’s right, put your arms in first, then we’ll just tighten these buckles here. Oh your arms are fastened around your back? It’s the latest style sir. Suits you!
Please go with our two burly assistants here, sir, they’ll take you to a nice calm place for you to relax in.....

Right Fred, you can inform our Cylon overlords we’ve got another of them, holding in cell block H. Tell them to hurry collection, it’s getting crowded after we caught all those Krishna Faction pilots
