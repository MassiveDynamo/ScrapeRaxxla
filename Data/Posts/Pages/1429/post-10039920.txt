See that bit doesn't quite sit right with me. It's like European countries in 1946 up and starting to send daily rockets to the moon. With what industrial capacity, hmm? If you have the means of producing stuff like this and supplying the means for them to be at least plausibly self-sustaining, what exactly do that many people have motivation to leave this land of plenty for?
This is very true, however living in a City (Nottingham) which sent a huge amount of folks to America and Australia as part of crime and punishment i was surprised to research some while back (for a separate project) that many of the boats were funded by wealthy family's looking for a new start.
With Nottingham being an extremely prosperous area around that time it was weird looking at the documented records of the shear volume of people who must have been quiet comfortable in life just heading off into the sunset.
