I'm gonna vent out some frustration

Since you touched on that one, me and a friend have been discussing:
-Whoever is the most advanced in the Raxxla hunt, thinks just like that.

SPOILER: LONG AND TOXIC ARGUMENT

Whoever wrote that is speaking very much from a position of, frankly, shocking ignorance and mind-numbing stupidity.

You do realise of course that it wasn't possible to make Grelics before the Salvation Proteus wave, right?

It's not that people didn't try literally every combination of every item in the Thargoid machines, it's that a new behaviour occurred, Grelics were discovered almost immediately after it became possible to do.

If you put Guardian relics in the Thargoid machine pre-proteus wave the machine reacted incredibly violently and nothing else happened.

Maidor you need to go back to whoever made that post/comment and literally laugh in their faces at how insanely stupid that comment actually is Thanks for sharing that, good laugh
