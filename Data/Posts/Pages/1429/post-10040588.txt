Whoever wrote that is speaking very much from a position of, frankly, shocking ignorance and mind-numbing stupidity.

You do realise of course that it wasn't possible to make Grelics before the Salvation Proteus wave, right?

It's not that people didn't try literally every combination of every item in the Thargoid machines, it's that a new behaviour occurred, Grelics were discovered almost immediately after it became possible to do.

If you put Guardian relics in the Thargoid machine pre-proteus wave the machine reacted incredibly violently and nothing else happened.

Maidor you need to go back to whoever made that post/comment and laugh in their faces at how insanely stupid that comment actually is Thanks for sharing that, good laugh

The point is reinforce pratical experimentation with documentation.

As noted, just because it happened, doesnt mean it was shared.

There was no documentation. Documentation of the tests, not only reports of results or theories is a very important aspect of science.
A lot of people will repeat the same experiments of others, creating a very long spiral of repetition without advancement.

There is a basic design principal to develop anything, such as ''solutions''
-Analysis>Theory>Prototipation>test>documentation>Analysis

It means that without proper documentation, any Analysis made after undocumented tests is expeculation.

The great majority of ‘mysteries’ uncovered by players is known to be gated by FD (not everything) as part of or linked to their narrative.

Eg a Cmdr can go to place X and do Y action on date Z and see nothing. Two weeks later FD install an update and boom something is now there, or something now works…


I wonder, if it was really impossible to produce green relics before, and it became possible.
Than someone was there doing it now and found it out because the time is right.

What about those people who did try that and never recorded? Why did they never record? They kept on doing it until it worked recently?
Because that person spent time dabbling in the ''definition of insanity'' [ repeating the same process multiple times expecting diffrent results ] and got nothing.
Narrative came along and suddenly made it possible.
Seems like very unlickly. But that is the problem, it's just unconfirmed.

This is an issue for a collective analysis to develop into a theory
Leading to some of people being inclined belive that they are working alot alone in this journey
