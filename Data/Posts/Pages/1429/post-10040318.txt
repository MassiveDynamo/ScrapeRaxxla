It is getting really, really tiring having to extra work just because no one bothered to understand the story. I just do not understand why if something was provably in Elite Dangerous you wouldn't then familiarize yourselves with that individuals backstory if they had appeared previously in the series.

A first-timer (this is my first time playing the series) absolutely should not be having to explain this to folks that should have known better.
Hey, if it's getting too hard for you to drag us fools along then you can take a break for a while, come back when we've all caught up?

Or, go find Raxxla - surely by now that's fairly easy for you based on your study of the 'real' game lore?

... I'll wait.
