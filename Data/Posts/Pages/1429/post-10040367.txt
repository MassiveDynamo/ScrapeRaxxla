Or, go find Raxxla - surely by now that's fairly easy for you based on your study of the 'real' game lore?
I wish. If it were only that easy. That still leaves a lot of the galaxy even with what I suspect may be ultimately helpful. There is also the matter that stuff like orbital and surface installations seem to have extra layers that aren't well understood. They aren't there just for quick credits.

PLX 695 was a warning that understanding one layer often reveals things go deeper still.
