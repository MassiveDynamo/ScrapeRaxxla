Hey, if it's getting too hard for you to drag us fools along then you can take a break for a while, come back when we've all caught up?

Or, go find Raxxla - surely by now that's fairly easy for you based on your study of the 'real' game lore?

... I'll wait.

It is nothing but personal frustration. I am fine and I always get through the frustrations of doing this. Let's just say, I am one of the few who gets why CMDR Guru951 went through what he did. I just had frustrating run-ins with groups that loudly proclaim to be seeking to understand the mysteries of the game only to stop if/when the investigation proves uncomfortable or is not what they had envisioned in their mind with preconceived notions. No one here are fools. I hold all of you in high regards. The bit in Jasmina Halsey's codex about "archetype conversion story" was The Pilots' Federation being perhaps too brutally honest with the direction the story takes once you invesgate enough. The story just isn't what one would call straightforward.

Please know that I don't think less of anyone. Everyone wants the same thing. The problems I face are somewhat self-inflicted as angles I investigate have a tendency to challenge cherished beliefs. It is unfortunately a necessary part of the process.

I'll just leave this here:
