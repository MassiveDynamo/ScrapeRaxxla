The great majority of ‘mysteries’ uncovered by players is known to be gated by FD (not everything) as part of or linked to their narrative.

Eg a Cmdr can go to place X and do Y action on date Z and see nothing. Two weeks later FD install an update and boom something is now there, or something now works…

*edited: or that content is bugged, or as with the PF/DW missions, nerfed and not communicated.

This thread is ‘tin-foil’. A medium for exploring creative ideas as well as baking potatoes.

In the absence of hard scientific data, creativity can identify trends and behaviour to explore and possibly explain ‘intelligence gaps’; however one ALWAYS has to be aware of bias. For the best part the majority on this quest follow that ethos.
