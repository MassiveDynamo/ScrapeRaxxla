For unknown reasons 3 is ridiculously important to story. 3 superpowers, 3 major species, materials give 3 when collecting, Odyssey bacteria when they fully mature have patterns at center highlighting 3 zones, many other species seem to reflect a tendency to reinforce triples. I don't entirely understand why but triples are important. This extends to mythological references in the game (maiden, mother, crone and boy, man, and elder). Also technically, the game series has 3 major parts:

-Elite Classic (the original) - 3100 - 3200 based on dating from in-service dates for the ships
-Frontier / First Encounters occur in parallel between 3200-3300 based on letter in manual
-Elite: Dangerous (3300-present)

One other note: the story seems to reject simple opposites or binaries. Even the players actions can be thought of in triple form:

-CMDR intentions
-CMDR actions
-Impacts to BGS/consequences (CMDR actions always impact more than mere reputation and influence)
