The great majority of ‘mysteries’ uncovered by players is known to be gated by FD (not everything) as part of or linked to their narrative.

Eg a Cmdr can go to place X and do Y action on date Z and see nothing. Two weeks later FD install an update and boom something is now there, or something now works…

This thread is ‘tin-foil’. A medium for exploring creative ideas as well as baking potatoes.

In the absence of hard scientific data, creativity can identify trends and behaviour to explore and possibly explain ‘intelligence gaps’; however one ALWAYS has to be aware of bias. For the best part the majority on this quest follow that ethos.

Yes, but for most things it is CMDR mediated. Sometimes the ripples of CMDR actions take a bit to reveal their longer-term consequences. No CMDR is an island unto themselves.
