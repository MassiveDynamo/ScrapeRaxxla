I am still curious as to what specifically triggered that. Currently, fear of the Guardian AI is the leading candidate. Was the Martian Relic Guardian?
The ban on sentient AI in the ED universe, is mostly practical. In FFE a large part of the federal, independent and alliance population were androids. They had the same rights as all other citizens. Many of them held important positions, like CEO of Sirius corporation.
In the Empire a similar portion of the population were made up of clones. Many of them were heavily modified, to do a specific type of work.

FD wanted to scrap this part of history, for ED. To our knowledge the clones and androids never happened. To help clarify this change in direction, the AI ban was put in.
