And this begs the question how they managed to scale up this kind of level of industrial output, the sheer amount of extractive industry and manufacturing capacity, not to mention the agricultural output necessary to seed that many self-sustaining enclosed biomes, after basically reducing a huge chunk of the planet to uninhabitable wasteland, without really first tackling most of the existing problems on Earth.
I hope those kinds of things get answers when get landable Earth-likes and terraformed worlds. There are many worlds that carry unique stories in Elite Dangerous. First, though, I have a laundry list of increasingly complex planetary environment types that have a lot of potential that I would love to see added. I have a lot of hope given what the newest version of game engine has already accomplished.
