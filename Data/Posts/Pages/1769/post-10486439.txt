Yes, what is in the ‘current’ ED game is lore, until FD decides it’s actually not, but not all lore in game is actually linked together. Some may exist independently.

Want to understand a character, read up on what’s in game only. If an aspect of that story has been adapted from an external source, it likely only relates to that instance, or provides extra depth, but any literary historical link may not be relevant or supported, or it’s been edited to fit?
