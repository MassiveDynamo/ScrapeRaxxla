I think Han_Zen may also have pointed pointed out the same time that Lyra was often represented on old star maps as a vulture or an eagle carrying a lyre, and hence is sometimes referred to as Vultur Cadens or Aquila Cadens...the Eagle ties in with the myth of Zeus using two Eagles to find the centre of the Earth where he placed the Omphalos Stone.
It also nicely aligns with Legacy. Rex Cavus (King of the cave/hollow / the hollowed king) seeks an unknown something using Eagles - Darik and Julia's ships - to help him find it.
