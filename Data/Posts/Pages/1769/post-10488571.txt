I wonder how may total hours of gameplay this thread has generated?

Searching for in- and out-of-game clues, examining tourist beacons, exploring the bubble and the depths of the rest of the galaxy, one wild goose chase after another, the theories about discovery, the differencing opinions, hidden triggers, crashing into the LAWD 27 belt cluster 3 (I wonder if the Mandalay could reach the cluster).

The thread reflects the dedication and creativity of the Elite Dangerous community in solving one of the gameâ€™s most enduring mysteries. I love it.
I would love to have a plugin for edmc or similar app that tracks our progress and investigations.

Especially if we can get an actual community together and build towards sorting through all the leads, false leads and just give an easy to follow direction.

- hey your near x system, check out y there for us.
App logs the data and we can easily follow up with that.
