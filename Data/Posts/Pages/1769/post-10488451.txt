I wonder how may total hours of gameplay this thread has generated?

Searching for in- and out-of-game clues, examining tourist beacons, exploring the bubble and the depths of the rest of the galaxy, one wild goose chase after another, the theories about discovery, the differencing opinions, hidden triggers, crashing into the LAWD 27 belt cluster 3 (I wonder if the Mandalay could reach the cluster).

The thread reflects the dedication and creativity of the Elite Dangerous community in solving one of the gameâ€™s most enduring mysteries. I love it.
