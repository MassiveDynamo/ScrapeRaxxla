So if they've been added to tourist beacons over the years then they are ED lore?
Yes. Ive always understood in-game Tourist Beacons to be a pukka source of lore. It looked to me from various posts that MB took personal oversight of them. Which is why I found the various spellings of Pilot(')s(') Federation in TB within Shinrarta so significant, and supported the hypothesis that this was part of an in-game "journey we all must make". I'm sure MB could spell, so it wasnt down to poor grammar & hence must have had a hidden meaning. It led to my hypothesis about the five+ different factions within PF and one of them was the real TDW, distinct from the TDW faction operating out of Jameson Memorial. That hypothesis was supported by becoming separately Allied to at least two of them (IIRC Davanix said he was Allied to an extra one via Combat in support of a PF Community Goal). However when those various spellings were corrected a year or so ago it seemed IMHO to be confirmation of a retcon of any TDW storyline.

Augustus Brenquith getting significant mention in two TB but nothing else in-game about him seemed also to be a hint to something...
