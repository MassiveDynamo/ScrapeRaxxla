Regards those spellings, yes I did question FD support over them, and they said working as intended, but they seem now to have been fixed (?) it could simply have been due to a typoâ€¦ ?

Yes, I remember you doing so & it was that "working as intended" response that I thought lent weight to the hypothesis, together with the fact that you could become Allied with one while already Allied with one or more of the other spellings...But now those various spellings are all corrected, so either a retcon or someone with better grammar proofread them. Either way the hypothesis seems to be dead now....unless people are still getting multiple Allied with different spellings? ...

Though wasnt that FD "working as intended" response later deleted?
