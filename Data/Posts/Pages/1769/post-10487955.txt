Quite a substantial verification there Thanks for stopping by Allen!
The murky fog of Raxxla has cleared ever so slightly.
It's panto season so, Oh no it hasn't!


Just about finished testing my latest hypothesis- that Lyta Crane is not a real character but an anagram with a hint at the Lyra (Lyre) constellation. I seem to remember Han_Zen ruminating on this a while ago. Her name can be rearranged as CANT Lyrae; CNT dont seem to have any meaning, but A(lpha) Lyrae is Vega- "The Jewel of the Lyre" and one of the brightest stars for Northern latitudes. So I postulated Vega as the Jewel in the toast, searched Spansh for nearby BH or NS, and have been NS boosting & jumping around- Raxxla hasnt shown in the Nav panel list of nearby systems & nothing out of the ordinary, except I found a HGE in Beta Sculptoris that had 50 Military Supercapacitors...treasure indeed!

Edit
Oh, and I'm carrying a couple of TOHF...just in case!

Edit2
I think Han_Zen may also have pointed pointed out the same time that Lyra was often represented on old star maps as a vulture or an eagle carrying a lyre, and hence is sometimes referred to as Vultur Cadens or Aquila Cadens...the Eagle ties in with the myth of Zeus using two Eagles to find the centre of the Earth where he placed the Omphalos Stone.
