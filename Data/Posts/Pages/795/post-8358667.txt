Oh..and on reddit people say you cannot be onboard during jump ...so if jumps to outer system...well, u need figure out a way to follow using another ship
...but I guess they misunderstood, u can't look out from bridge. But you should be able to be docked there ... any way. 5 bils to visit some 200-300 extra far stars? >: I have another 99 billion stars around never visited.
Yeah I think it is even worse. You can't even be logged into the game when the carrier jumps. And then it is gone.

300 - 400 stars seems much to be just at the rim of the galaxy. I was thinking just 1: Raxxla.
Perhaps I should log in and check the galaxy map and see how many systems are reachable with 500 ly jump range at the rim. And how far out I can get with that amount of jump capacity.

Rumor has it that scientists think that a filament of stars are located all the way to Andromeda galaxy from the Milkyway galaxy. That is 2 537 000 ly. Interesting.
That is 39 trips to Beagle Point from the bubble.

Doable? Sure is. 500 ly jump range is enough? Doubt it.
Worth trying?
SPOILER: IS IT WORTH IT?
