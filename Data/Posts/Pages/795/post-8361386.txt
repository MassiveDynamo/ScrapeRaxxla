There's some systems close to the bubble, but high above the galactic plane that are unreachable with current ships.
There's also some known pockets of space you can get to with a neutron jump, but can't return from.

Still, if you need a 500ly jump to reach Raxxla, that seems like it would violate the spirit of 'Raxxla has been in the game since alpha'.

FDev doesn't seem to care about the raxxla mystery at all though, so FCs seem unrelated.
Likewise, it would have been awesome if your FC had Universal Cartographics on it, would be easy to fly a squadron out to an unexplored area & create a bubble of exploration.
