Well, spent an afternoon goid scout hunting in Celaeno (thanks @alexzk! Good tip, the nhss are nice & close to the station). Did a few threat 3 to acclimatise, and warm up my hands & wrists before threat 4- think I’ve got a spot of tendonitis! Yep, 16 scouts killed gives 1% Deadly increased rank. Except I finished playing at 48 kills & still 2% Deadly; think the server/network was running a bit slow, probably due to heavy load with current situation! Did have a few bugs, including exiting SC on approach to the station & found myself inside the station external structure!

Still no video recording. After play finally deleted Afterburner & Riva, downloaded OBS. Now looks like I’ve got video record but no screenshot. Slaps forehead!
You know, I just went back here after week practicing on Anacondas in bubble using plasma gun ...signal 4 is sooo easy now Like babies.
