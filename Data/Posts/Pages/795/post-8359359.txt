FC seems like a bust at first glance but it might be useful for us treasure hunters. Useful for unreachable systems at the edge or maybe an unknown path further into Thargoid space? Cost isn't the problem though. The main issue is with the 1 jump every 2 hours and depending on the scarcity, the tritium grind.

Edit: Another problem for us is this "Fleet Carriers will not be able to enter any Permit Systems, even if the owner holds a permit for that region of space. "
