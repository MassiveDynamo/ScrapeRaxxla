Ok Ive downloaded Assassins Creed Odyssey recently as 75% off and have finally made my way to see the Oracle of Delphi, I could only ask one of two questions, who is my father or where is my mother? Nothing about Raxxla but will keep looking, Im currently trying to break into her house to see her again. Whenever I think of fdev I picture Abstergo in my head...

Club/DW & Wheels Within Wheels - They may be part of the same thing without even knowing it, X files style. Rebecca's memory was screwed up to say the least and Salome was never a paragon of virtue herself or that interested in letting the populace know, she was quite happy to keep it all secret when it suited her needs...or do we know exactly why for example she raided Palin that time, did we ever get a resolution? She certainly seemed happy as a David Koresh type figure while supposedly being so honourable as to give up the throne. Janus indeed.

DW in SD iirc is described as basically a front to keep the PF happy and off their back or distracted by misdirection but that would mean they are connected to the real DW, wheels within wheels. If Im reading those old Elite missions from DW correctly and dear old Felicity.....who either knows a lot more than shes saying or is the worst kind of fake news broadcast out there, still don't know which.
