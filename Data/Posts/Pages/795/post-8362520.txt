The 'Its been in the game since Alpha/Beta' is attributable to The Zuara (at first it was a Conda). Not sure its ever been confirmed as being attributed to Raxxla as well.

I think the earliest we have is Drews conversation with DB when he said 'Its in the game' (current tense) so at that point it was.....supposedly, if it ever was/is/will be you never know with Mr B. Not sure when that conversation was but think it was early on and that got cross-connected with the Zuara quote.

Raxxla was never DB dream for Elite as such so that's probably why little attention has been paid to it, plus as the games biggest mystery do you really want it solved in year 1? With absence of hints we create our own treasure hunts. Would you spoil that as the dev?
