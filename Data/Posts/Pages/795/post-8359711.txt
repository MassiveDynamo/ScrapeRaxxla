According to Obsidian Ant they've said you can jump with the carrier. So maybe make your mission board to ask commanders to deliver vodka, and then go visit Lemon Slice Nebula or something? Elite angerous. Ain't gonna do mining though. No UC doesn't matter coz FSS is grisly anyway.
Spend 5bil+ to buy vodka ? There are cheaper ways ... for example u can land on any planet and drink it for free.
