Nah ... I feel like Santa forgot gift for me. I'm not sure if I even gona try beta.
My 72ly Conda has all I need out there. I have been crashing 4 times already, and restored itself fast with 0 looses.
I was thinking ...FC could be convenient for AX in pleyades ... but again, ship delivery costs 6mils + 75 mins. FC costs 5 bils and 120 mins per jump Also I don't do AX each the day >:
Also I was like I would mine in Void just to avoid space madness. And again - FC is too slow to support me there + nothing to do with ore. I can just stop conda and fire lazer in rocks doing nothing - same effect.
