What if Raxxla is really far out inside the starting system?
Or so close to the starting system that no-one would ever consider returning?
Not sure ... I barely recall where I started I was focused on getting into station and make some longer jump then 8ly ..that all I recall about 1st days. Somewhen week later I had 20ly "very long jumper" and made 2 days expedition to Polaris, to see it is permit locked
