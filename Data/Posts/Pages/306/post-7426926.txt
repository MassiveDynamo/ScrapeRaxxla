Question. I should to ask it in Thargoids thread. But... They using their artefacts for the navigation. I mean that combination of the sensor, probe and link in the unknown machine. Is it possible to use some other machine to locate Raxxla? Using other kind of artefacts. Human machine and human artefacts... Or Raxxlan machine...

I know that unknown machine reacts to Guardian things. But will it react to Human things?..
