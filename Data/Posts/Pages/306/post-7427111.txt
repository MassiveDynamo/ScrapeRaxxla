Kinky! Is this stuff we already know?

How do you get access to those 3 overlays in blue, purple, red they used to make these pictures. I think this one is closer but the purple is upside down.(NVM, I think I found out how.)

And this one looks like it has more drawings to the right, left, and bottom that they didn't highlight.

And I just noticed something else we could explore. The forum backgrounds. Do they have hints in them anywhere. There are several images. Are they cannon or could they be useful.
