Its the spectrogram of the sound you get after activating the Thargoid structure. It is widely believed that the system on the left is Merope but so far no one has been able to confirm the second system due to permits needed.

It's basically confirmed to be COL 70 sector fy-n c21-3. If the wrong system was used, the triangulation would not work.

It works 100%.
