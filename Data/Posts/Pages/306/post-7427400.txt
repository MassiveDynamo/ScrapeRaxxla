There are four systems on the map. Merope and COL 70 sector fy-n c21-3 are fixed. The one on the bottom is the system where you get the map in the Thargoid device. The one on the top is the target system, to find the next site.

Three known systems, to get the next one.

Three isn't really enough to get a precise position. You will often get one false solution. The Canonn tool matches the results with known systems coordinates in EDSM, to filter out the false positives. Quite clever.

Yeah the way they managed to pinpoint the signal source made my head hurt trying to understand. Also late time I activated the map room I noticed that the map would drift slowly out the room not sure if it was a bug or not, but to get back on topic I'm not entirely convinced that this is the same route to Raxxla. Do we have any concrete evidence that Thargoids and Raxxla are even connected in a small way?
