It's basically confirmed to be COL 70 sector fy-n c21-3. If the wrong system was used, the triangulation would not work.

This is 100% true but I wasnt sure that we confirmed thats what COL 70 sector fy-n c21-3 looked like just that this was the system the probe came from. Its been awhile since I looked over all that so could be remembering it wrong.
