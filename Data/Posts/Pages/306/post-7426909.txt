Geometry is fascinating, but here it is a result of the routine in game code.
The same overlay is used on many objects and sites in the game.

More fascinating for me is that there are objects in front of "bunkers doors" at new guardians structures (the one using a key) that have VERY similar engraving (picture, non-active mechanism?) to Raxxla symbol. 2 layers with 3 *wings* (one above the other, upper one rotated 30 degrees (IIRC) like a rotating lock. I posted a picture somewhere and to me (for now), resemblance is astonishing. Could be also the result of above mentioned routine, but in this case an artist puts an extra effort on it to make it 3D-like, so I find it suspicious.
