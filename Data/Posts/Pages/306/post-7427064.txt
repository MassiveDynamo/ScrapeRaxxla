I think it's a good possibility that the Guardians were and the Thargoids are aware of what we call Raxxla is and have symbolism that reflects it.

It could also be that the word "Raxxla" exists in the languages of Thargoids and the Guardians as well as those of man. Perhaps originating in the language of some other, much older, species.
