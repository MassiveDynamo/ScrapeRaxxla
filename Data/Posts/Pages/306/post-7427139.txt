BTW, how the heck do people get those images from sounds?

Kinky! Is this stuff we already know?




How do you get access to those 3 overlays in blue, purple, red they used to make these pictures. I think this one is closer but the purple is upside down.(NVM, I think I found out how.)

And this one looks like it has more drawings to the right, left, and bottom that they didn't highlight.

That first picture, its Thargoid related right? Were those two systems, one on left and one on right, triangualted and find in game?
