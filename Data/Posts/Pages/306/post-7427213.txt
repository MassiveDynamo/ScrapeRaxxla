That first picture, its Thargoid related right? Were those two systems, one on left and one on right, triangualted and find in game?

Its the spectrogram of the sound you get after activating the Thargoid structure. It is widely believed that the system on the left is Merope but so far no one has been able to confirm the second system due to permits needed.
