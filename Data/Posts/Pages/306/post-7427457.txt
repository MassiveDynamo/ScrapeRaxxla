How is it possible to navigate using two systems as the anchors in 3D? There are theoretical ability to existing the two systems with same distances to Merope and Col 70. Should be the third point. Or the DB of known coordinates of systems where recorded data for the current system.

Hmm, I'm sorry. We are going to off topic. And this was discussed in special threads probably.

Oups, I read your messages more accurate. Still I can't understand it. So nevermind
