You are right.

They can be calculated to galactic coordinates though. Traditional Galactic coordinates are rotation angle and elevation angle, compared to a line from Sol to Sag A.

Both these systems need a distance, to give ED coordinates. They are lines from Sol to as far as you want.

EDSM gives both Galactic (with radius) and Equatorial coordinates from ED coordinates so there are ways to convert, if you know the distance. If not, you end up with a equation that gives x,y,z based on (r).

Here is NASA's coordinate system converter:

A line would do, I guess, would take a good while though! And need to be very accurate.

I do wish I had decided to start playing ED on PC rather than PS4, I imagine transposing some lines onto the galaxy map would be comparatively trivial, compared to trying to find specific systems on the line, so I can manually plot a route down it....
