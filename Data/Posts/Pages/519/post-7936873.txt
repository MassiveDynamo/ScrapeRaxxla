To be fair, the "There will be no clues" comment was made by Michael Brookes in an interview. In the context it could just mean; I want give any clues in this interview.

True, but IIRC it was coupled with the statement "It's a journey everyone has to take for themselves", which is almost certainly not a reference to the interview.
