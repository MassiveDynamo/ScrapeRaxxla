To be fair, the "There will be no clues" comment was made by Michael Brookes in an interview. In the context it could just mean; I want give any clues in this interview.
To be fair, in this interview he just confirmed the previously stated " you already said that there will be no clues" (mmmh.. that's true..) mitigating it by the well known tiny little bit obvious - thing.
He just couldn't resist..
(So, there will be no clues. BUT part of it is a tiny little bit obvious, so people know what they are doing.)
But.. who the hell actually knows what he is doing ? Mmmhh ?
