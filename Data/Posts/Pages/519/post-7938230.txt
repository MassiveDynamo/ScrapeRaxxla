I hope this wasn't mentioned earlier although I'm sure at some point it was and I might have over looked it. At some point we were all talking about how the middle of the raxxla image looked like it could be a 'crosshair' from one of the various hardpoints/dss/whatever...

Anyways, I was looking on a planet close up on the system map and wouldn't you know, the cursor had the same evenly space three curved lines. I was matching it up to a big crater on the planets surface when I first noticed.

TL;DR
I think we could find possible clues or something in the system map for any systems we may have suspected could be part of the search. And if it turns out to be helpful then it might have been kind of obvious....?
