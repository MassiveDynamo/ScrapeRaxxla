Not an astronomer, by far, but I assume RA and Declination only gives you the direction of a star or whatever as seen from Earth. No distance, then no coordinates. But I may be completely wrong... Herr Professor-Doktor , please ?
You are right.

They can be calculated to galactic coordinates though. Traditional Galactic coordinates are rotation angle and elevation angle, compared to a line from Sol to Sag A.

Both these systems need a distance, to give ED coordinates. They are lines from Sol to as far as you want.

EDSM gives both Galactic (with radius) and Equatorial coordinates from ED coordinates so there are ways to convert, if you know the distance. If not, you end up with a equation that gives x,y,z based on (r).

Here is NASA's coordinate system converter: https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/coordinate_calculator
