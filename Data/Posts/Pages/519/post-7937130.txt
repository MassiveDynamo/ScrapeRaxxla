Jepp.

You could do a coordinate search in Simbad, to get an approximate direction to a RL star. Then check with edsm on proc gen systems in that region, to get a more accurate direction.

If you get to far out before finding a good system, you get very long steps. Then you can divide all 3 coordinates by the same number. The vector remains the same.
Thanks for your help!
