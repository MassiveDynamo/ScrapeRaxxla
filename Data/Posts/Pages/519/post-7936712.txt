Can anybody translate equatorial co-ordinates to galactic coordinates? Or better still, is there a tool that will do it?

I would very much like to know what systems, if any, are at the following locations, but my math simply isn't up to it.

Right ascension: 1h 1m 3s / Declination: 18째 8'00.000''
Right ascension: 8h 18m 3s / Declination: 1째 1'00.000''
Right ascension: 18h 1m 24s / Declination: 24째 12'01.000''
Right ascension: 6h 5m 18s / Declination: 14째 23'05.800''

Any systems at these locations are my new Raxxla candidates
