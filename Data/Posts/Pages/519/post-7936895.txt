You are right.

They can be calculated to galactic coordinates though. Traditional Galactic coordinates are rotation angle and elevation angle, compared to a line from Sol to Sag A.

Both these systems need a distance, to give ED coordinates. They are lines from Sol to as far as you want.

EDSM gives both Galactic (with radius) and Equatorial coordinates from ED coordinates so there are ways to convert, if you know the distance. If not, you end up with a equation that gives x,y,z based on (r).

Here is NASA's coordinate system converter:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_coordinate_system Yes. I found this. This was the link that convinced me my math skills were not capable of doing the conversion. Unless we are talking set theory/multi bag theory, I'm a bit useless with maths
