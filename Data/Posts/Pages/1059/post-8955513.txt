Thought Experiment pt ii

My guess is that you hid the object in one of 2 general places.

Your own area, somewhere you could keep an eye on it, somewhere you know well (possibly an area from childhood)
or
Somewhere on the opposite side of the world, maybe a desert, ice cap or ocean, somewhere you may or may not have been, just somewhere you think is remote and hard to get to.

If right it means its unlikely youd go half-way and hide it there, its not in the next country, its either close or far far away its not in the middle.

Theres an outside chance some of you painted it blue and installed it as an art project on a plinth in Leicester Square, hidden in plain sight so to speak.

So IF Raxxla is hand-placed and not RNG placed, it may lean towards being in or very near Sol or the bubble, or its the other side of the galaxy.....not in between...maybe...if I was anywhere near right in the first place

Interesting - I guess I think while it is hidden and supposed to be deep in the void - it is also a story element and has a "way to be found" and thus will be atleast relatively close to the bubble - something a little further than the distances of where thargoids and guardians are found. I honestly hope Raxxla is not in the Bubble but i guess its a possibility. Im also still thinking its meant to be a two parter in that understanding the story element to an extent will help point us to the Dark Wheel Station - probably in the bubble or close which will inturn point towards Raxxla ... hidden further afield but in my mind still on our half of the galaxy. But ya - who knows
