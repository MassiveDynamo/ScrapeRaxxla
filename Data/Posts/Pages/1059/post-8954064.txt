Asellus Primus is very close to Dahan; the moons in Dahan all have non-standard names, for example "Dahan 3A" (normally it would be "Dahan 3 A" with a space). So it's worth investigating systems around Asellus Primus, though my best guess is that Dahan is the system to be found.

And Dahan is suspected to be a "map" (especially the planet Hathor)
