I think Asellus Primus used to be a starting system so that may influence the naming perhaps? It doesn't explain Dahan though?
I mean it's possible that it was one of the first systems they were hand-tuning and got the naming wrong for moons (and consequently Dahan).

Anyway, the surrounding systems are interesting; I wanted to investigate Dahan anyway, so your hint came in really handy. Time to analyze the data again.
