Ok Current working theory - (Something for Jorki to poke holes in )

I am assuming the Parajit Story is what is meant by the Story of Princess Astrophel And the Spiraling Stars - re this post
I am also assuming that story is also referencing Vedic/Hindu creation Myth in general.
Another Assumption is that the Club has something to do with it and thus the Dynasty Expeditions...
Currently focusing on the Conflux Settlements as a possible target

I think that Raxxla is a gateway - not to another galaxy.... but to a hidden arm of our own galaxy - the sacred stream Saraswati (What if the Rifts aren't Empty...)

Looking at the Triveni-Sangam - also known as the Agnya Chakra - (third eye) being possibly near where the Confluence sites were located ... at the confluence of two galactic arms ...

will try to put something together this eve
