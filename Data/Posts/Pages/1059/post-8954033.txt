Hi All,

Wherever possible I've been investigating the options for Raxxla (whatever it is?!) and TDW as much as possible within the boundaries of the games parameters.

So to that end I've been investigating an early video of DB's where he displayed this image of the Gal Map which he had highlighted SOL, Asellus Primus and Shinrarta Dezhra. I've had a poke around in the systems and had a thought about the Asellus Primus text that struck a cord when people earlier were discussing Rogue Planets et al.

----------------------------------
SPOILER: DB'S GAL MAP

Asellus Primus:
Rich, low population high tech economy (independent corporate state).

An independent corporate-run binary system, with a central white F7V star and, further out, a captured planet-less M3V red dwarf. The capture event millions of years earlier doubtless stripped Asellus Primus B of any planets that might have formed with it. Asellus Primus is known for its high tech manufacturing. Also known as 23 Theta Bootis.

----------------------------------

Is it possible there might be a 'lost' planet either within that system, or nearby?

I'm by no means an astrophysicist, but thought it might be worth raising the idea.

Fly Dangerously,

p.s. I like the name of the FC parked at Asellus Primus B - is that someone from this threads ship?
