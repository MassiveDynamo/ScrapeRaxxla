I need your help, tell me how many stations with such a design and where are they?
Looks like a Tourist station. All over at POI planets usually, or POI written planets such as 'this world is visited by new lovers wishing to jump of its high cliffs'. Stuff that you cant necessarily see anyway. Theres a Tourism filter in the GalMap but think some are inside other economies as just one world of interest so dunno if that shows them all.
