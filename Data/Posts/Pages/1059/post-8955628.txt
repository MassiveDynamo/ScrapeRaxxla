Thought Experiment pt ii

My guess is that you hid the object in one of 2 general places.

Your own area, somewhere you could keep an eye on it, somewhere you know well (possibly an area from childhood)
or
Somewhere on the opposite side of the world, maybe a desert, ice cap or ocean, somewhere you may or may not have been, just somewhere you think is remote and hard to get to.

If right it means its unlikely youd go half-way and hide it there, its not in the next country, its either close or far far away its not in the middle.

Theres an outside chance some of you painted it blue and installed it as an art project on a plinth in Leicester Square, hidden in plain sight so to speak.

So IF Raxxla is hand-placed and not RNG placed, it may lean towards being in or very near Sol or the bubble, or its the other side of the galaxy.....not in between...maybe...if I was anywhere near right in the first place

Portals tend to work better when they are close and take you somewhere far away. If aliens built a portal on Raxxla, it was probably because it was useful to them. They probably didn't have permit restriction, so cutting travel time is most likely why they built it.
If hints of Raxxla were found before 2296, these aliens must have been hanging about in the Sol region.

I think close has a higher probability than far away.
