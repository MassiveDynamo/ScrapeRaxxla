I have an idea that if successful will lead us a few steps in a circle right back to where we are, but with some Confirmation Bias as well:

Im going to give you an object.
You are going to 'hide' that object.
There will be a world-wide treasure hunt for the object, everyone can play.
There will be no clues.
You can hide it anywhere in the world, as accessible or inaccessible as you like. Only proviso is it cant be locked away in a vault or bank or something like that, it must be publicly available. It must be 'findable', however difficult it is to actually find it even if within 1m of it. No clues though.

Where do you hide it? No need to answer just think about it, where would you actually hide this object.

Ill be back tomorrow to share my theory, but it wont actually help even if 100% successful.

How big’s the object? My labrador can eat quite large amounts, very quickly
I’m not going to wait til it reappears!
