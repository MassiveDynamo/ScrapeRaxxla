A few days ago I mentioned, I was looking for "Hermes" and did not find it. But I found Odins (with the extra s), which must be about Odin because of the system description. Thus I concluded that the "Herme"-system must be the Hermes-system.

Now, I must have been completely blind and idiotic because the Herme-system does have a description. I'm not sure how I missed it because this is the description of Herme:

The home of Soul Sector Syndicate, a group of commanders from a wide variety of systems and professions. They originated in the hazardous resource sites of the Soul Nebula, and as their numbers grew relocated within the bubble to continue their expansion.

Here a quote from Wikipedia about Hermes:

He is also considered the protector of human heralds, travellers, thieves, merchants, and orators. He is able to move quickly and freely between the worlds of the mortal and the divine, aided by his winged sandals. Hermes plays the role of the psychopomp or "soul guide" â€” a conductor of souls into the afterlife.

Remember the Raxxla-line about "the yearning of our vagabond's hearts"?

So, what do we have right beside the Soul Nebula? The Heart Nebula.

Wish me luck, I'm going on an odyssey.
