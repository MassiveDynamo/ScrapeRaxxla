A few days ago I mentioned, I was looking for "Hermes" and did not find it. But I found Odins (with the extra s), which must be about Odin because of the system description. Thus I concluded that the "Herme"-system must be the Hermes-system.

Now, I must have been completely blind and idiotic because the Herme-system does have a description. I'm not sure how I missed it because this is the description of Herme:



Here a quote from Wikipedia about Hermes:



Remember the Raxxla-line about "the yearning of our vagabond's hearts"?

So, what do we have right beside the Soul Nebula? The Heart Nebula.

Wish me luck, I'm going on an odyssey.

As a big fan of Soul searching... I dont want to dissuade you from your quest, but just so you know... Fdev in their wisdom has allowed player groups to write up their own system descriptions... so I would take that Soul Syndicate with a grain of salt.
