Please tell me if I am wrong: in ED game story line, for a planet to have any non procedural name, doesn't it need that the PF actually gives it this name ?
If so, how any unknown planet could appear with any name ? Raxxla will never appear as Raxxla, imho.
(Some time, I must learn to read all the posts before posting mine...ninja'd; I let this one here, too lazy to hexedit it . Out of rep, Thatchinho... (By the way..Thx Mod !)



I was first tempted to make Doc believe it was due to his addiction to that ingnominious Bourbon it is said he is so found of, but ...naaah...too much respect for him

Well if the PF are really the Dark Wheel, or rather the DW is one faction within PF & The Club another.... then PF (or the sneaky beakies that are actually in control of PF) already know all about Raxxla, and probably holiday there twice a year to top up their suntans, rejuvenation levels and tighten up their human skin suits. Theyâ€™re Guardians I tells ya! Ricardio Bentonio has been telling us all along.

Never really got into bourbon, but treated myself to a bottle of 15year old Dalwhinnie at the weekend. Smooth, but not very long lasting! [blah]
