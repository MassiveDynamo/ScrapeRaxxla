I invite everyone to join in my personal weekend challenge,
"to binge watch 'Lost in Space' before Trump and Putin start throwing missiles around."

[OFFTOPIC]I have to work this weekend

Though I did just sign up for a free month of Netflix just for Lost in Space. I'll be binge watching it along with a few other shows during my free month. Then I'll cancel the service again and probably won't reactivate until the next season of Stranger Things.[/OFFTOPIC]

Back to Raxxla though; I'm still not convinced that the missing city lights on The Founders World is a big deal. The population of the entire system is pretty small; just 85 million (and that includes those living at Jameson Memorial and the other facilities in the system).

There are quite a few possible explanations for the missing lights:

1. The entire population on The Founders World may be located at a single settlement. Since the length of a day is 42 earth days you may simply be viewing the planet when that settlement is not on the dark side.
2. The planetary population might be nomadic in order to avoid spending 21 days in total darkness.
3. The surface population might be so widely dispersed that no single settlement produces enough light to be visible from orbit.
