I scanned all the Primary stars and Nav Beacons in the 7 primary star systems in Orion but have now decided to do all of the rest making up the whole constellation, then into the Pleiades. Thanks for the respectable response.
My angle is that TAW and TDW are the closest and most reliable information we can draw on for this search. My efforts are an attempt at seeing if the Orion Correlation Theory is in game. In TAW they say that the Oisir built the pyramids as part of the portal machine, the Talmor Lens, and IRL Orion and those pyramids are interconnected. Im looking to bridge the two pieces of information. The great pyramids are said to be the physical representation of Orions Belt. I'm going off of that. I haven't see anyone else try it.
