The place isn't totally uninteresting. Main star is an actinic blue. The orbiting black hole is fairly small at 8 solar masses so you can get within 26 Km from it's center. The system nearly has all jumponium except arsenic. Two of the landables are about 2700 diamater so searchable if you like and the third landable at 7G is a challenge.

Oh don’t get me wrong, the system’s nice! I spent a while just taking in the starlight! I just meant there was nothing I could spot of Raxxla or other plot significance.
