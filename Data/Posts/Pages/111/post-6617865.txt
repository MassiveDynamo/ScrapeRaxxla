Dont miss that part where they found Egypt and built the pyramids wrong but built them nonetheless. And also were than known as Horus by the locals. The Talmor Lens really sparked my interest when the newest Guardian site was found and it projects beams of light into the sky. Talmor was my first thought when seeing that.

Yep. And no ... haven't forgotten the pyramids. That part is in my transcript of the main body of text regarding the Oisir-Raxxla sector: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HuDtu7J_IMWF7791wL6Qg6rBgP88JhW9AUoAkWEkwoY/edit?usp=sharing

My thoughts went to the Talmor Lens as well.
