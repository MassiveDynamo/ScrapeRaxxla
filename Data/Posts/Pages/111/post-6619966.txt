To anyone,
Try to sum up as short as possible your most important ideas and leads to the riddle. What do you think our closest answer is?
*edit. smh. I now realize that that's we've been doing this whole time.

Founders World. Hidden in plain sight, controlled by the PF, Dark Wheel in orbit, Elite rank to access. Not too close to core worlds, well within what could have been found 500 years ago, not on normal maps, didn't exist in any other game. PF are hyper rich. Elites retire to surface (through Gate) when they get bored of this universe. No city lights Because they all go through the gate.
