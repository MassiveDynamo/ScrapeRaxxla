Hello fellow tinfoil-wearers! Have you seen the last three comments from November 4, 2017 on the Raxxla-page of the Elite-wiki? They were all made by the same person (according to the saved IP - that btw. belongs to an ISP only about 100 miles from Frev HQ) and provide some interesting info i haven‘t seen before.

Here are the 3 posts:






Especially the directions from Lave to Ben Ryders Gateway at a hidden system 1 jump away from Tionisla cought my interest. The second quote is also quite mysterious, as afaik the original Elite did not have Raxxla in game. I also did research on that „Micro Bit Computer Magazine“, but could not find any trace it ever existed.

What do you guys think? Is this already known info? A troll trying to mislead, ramblings of a madman or actual hints from someone involved with Fdev?

Ricardo Bentonio has been muttering about lizard people from Andromeda in Galnet posts (though admittedly not recently, perhaps the Club got to him?); David Icke apparently theorised that humans descended from lizards in Draco. If these lizards were/are actually Guardians then that might explain some aspects of ED lore.

Or am I rambling in the wrong thread again?
