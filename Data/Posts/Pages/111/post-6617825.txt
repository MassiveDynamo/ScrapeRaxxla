I scanned all the Primary stars and Nav Beacons in the 7 primary star systems in Orion but have now decided to do all of the rest making up the whole constellation, then into the Pleiades. Thanks for the respectable response.
My angle is that TAW and TDW are closest and most reliable information we can draw on for this search. My efforts are an attempt at seeing if the Orion Correlation Theory are in game. In TAW they say that the Oisir built the pyramids as part of the portal machine, the Talmor Lens and IRL Orion and those pyramids are interconnected. The great pyramids are said to be the physical representation of Orion. I'm going off of that. I haven't see anyone else try it.

Ah. Pulling out my copy of TAW:

"Building the Talmor Lens. A Raxxla taskship orbits a deserted world, building satellite connections with the machine on the planetary surface below. This planet is a small, sterile asteroid-type. These were favored locations since there was no need for conquest.

The associate image is "First Men on Mimas" by Graham Wildridge which, unfortunately, is split between pages 18 and 19 making it difficult to scan.

The Talmor Lens is one of the most fascinating aspects of The Alien World, IMHO. Makes me wonder what the Guardians were doing building their structures on all of those small airless worlds.
