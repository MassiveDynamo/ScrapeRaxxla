Supporting evidence of my earlier claims about the Orions Belt/Barnards Loop connection. Orion Molecular Cloud Complex

Also, 3 stars of Orions Shield/Bow, in Pi Orionis, are located in Col 70.

Its very interesting but I'm not exactly sure how it supports a claim that Raxxla is connected to Barnard's Loop. There are lots of very interesting interstellar phenomenon but they can't all be connected to Raxxla.

Please not that I'm not trying to rain on your parade. Its certainly a theory worth pursuing and I'd be 100% behind an effort that would prove or disprove the possible connection.
