Oh don’t get me wrong, the system’s nice! I spent a while just taking in the starlight! I just meant there was nothing I could spot of Raxxla or other plot significance.

Kudos to Fdev for their simulation of actinic light, sometimes I can almost feel my retinas vibrating.

The trick is the routing. I followed a previous path up and over colon 70 and couldn't route to the target until it came in close to line of sight.
Then we know fdev routing gives up pretty quick for the sake of speed, "just cuz ya can't route there don't mean ya can't get there".

Plot what plot,,, an assumption of concern is "finding evidence of the real existence of Raxxla" as meaning he had been there?

yes it does
no it dosn't
