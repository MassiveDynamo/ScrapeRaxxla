Why are the resources in binary?!?!
I was just going to ignore the latest fake. It's not nearly as cleaver or convincing as the Dyson sphere fake, but it's been driving nuts for hours....

Forgetting the obvious forgery, what about it is suppose to be evidence of Raxxla? Just the binary resources that spell "error" and the unknown composition?

Am I being thick and missing something? Genuinely.
