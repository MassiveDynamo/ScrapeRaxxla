Youâ€˜re even older than me! (1952 vintage!)
Oh, age is relative. I also vaguely remember the time before smartphones and WiFi, the internet, and automated cleaning bots. Not quite sure what people did back then though. Chores probably.

BTW I just realized those Meganeura dragonflies are like sudden image of Tothos, according to ancient Phoenician sources.

"...But before these things the god Taautus, having pourtrayed Ouranus, represented also the countenances of the gods Cronus, and Dagon, and the sacred characters of the elements. He contrived also for Cronus the ensign of his royal power, having four eyes in the parts before and in the parts behind, two of them closing as in sleep; and upon the shoulders four wings, two in the act of flying, and two reposing as at rest. And the symbol was, that Cronus whilst he slept was watching, and reposed whilst he was awake. And in like manner with respect to the wings, that he was flying whilst he rested, yet rested whilst he flew. But for the other gods there were two wings only to each upon his shoulders, to intimate that they flew under the controul of Cronus; and there were also two wings upon the head, the one as a symbol of the intellectual part, the mind, and the other for the senses."

Redemption and good weather in exchange for letting Archambault Terminal pass through the sacred fire as a mystical sacrifice.
