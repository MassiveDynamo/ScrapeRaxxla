Nearly on page 900....whoever is the 1st post on page 1000 has to buy the whole thread a drink! Mine's a double Lavian...unless it's me who has to buy, then its Tea.

I bet its @Jorki Rasalas - anyone fancy a sweepstake? Although I cant imagine Jorki getting a round in...your a Yorkshireman aren't you Jorki?

Edit - I hope the forum doesnt have some arbitrary technical limit, like 1024 pages per thread :-/

Yep, I'm a tyke!
The teas are on Pete for being first to post on page 900!!!
... mine's a Long Island Tea, made with Lavian brandy!!!
Usually some all-seeing moderator decides we have emitted too much hot air, need a new thread, creates it and locks the current one. Round about...
now! ..............
