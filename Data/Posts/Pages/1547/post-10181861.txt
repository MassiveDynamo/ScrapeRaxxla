Any ideas on what the dots represent on the map? If memory serves there is a secondary set nearer the core of the galaxy. I will try to get better screenshots when I play.
If you zoom in close enough you will see they are numbers for each sectorial line, much like a dart board would be my best example off the top of my head and the bulls eye being the region/galaxy cores center although not Sag A* , iv been trying to find a system that's exact center for quite some time i have some possibles explored and bookmarked but it was more difficult than anticipated
