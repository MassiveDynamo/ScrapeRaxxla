“O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and spilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs, who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals, Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon, look favourably on our sacrifices!” -

"Satan here held his Babylonish court, and in the blood of stainless childhood the leprous limbs of phosphorescent Lilith were laved. Incubi and succubae howled praise to Hecate, and headless moon-calves bleated to the Magna Mater."

The Horror at Red Hook 1927; By H. P. Lovecraft

This first passage Lovecraft took word for word From Hippolytus’ Refutation of All Heresies, 1868; describes the rituals undertaken by the priests of Hecate.

A very Lovecraftian influence!

Then we have Michael Brookes Elite Legacy which too references Demeter and Persephone (but doesn’t name her)!

Greek mythology was one of Lovecrafts primary influences.
