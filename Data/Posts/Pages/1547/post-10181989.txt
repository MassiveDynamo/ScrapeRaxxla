I would caution you against drawing a line at brown dwarfs. In Elite: Dangerous they are a "star" type.
While they are a star type i Agree however the debate in astronomy is low mass ones can be considered as a gas giant which is debated, also if you remember brown dwarfs etc. where supposed to be dark systems we where we would need to manually find and plot, stellar forge made that difficult so they gave them the same input as all other systems, now what if doing so they then added a different mystery around them hence my post ;-)

There are many "star type systems" in Elite that shouldn't be at all or are completely different to real world (Yes im also talking pre 2012-13 discovery's) also lets not forget that and even frontier new this before adding them in, its not perfect they knew this and it was never going to be but in the imperfections could be hidden mystery's, one example is the wolf rayet just a few ly from Sol
