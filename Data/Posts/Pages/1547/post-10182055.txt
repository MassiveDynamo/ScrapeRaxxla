I wrote to them earlier about the polar coordinate system. But the translation must have gotten it all wrong.
I always thought that in Elite the basis is the polar coordinate system, in sectors it is already recalculated to the usual one.

Ya ive wondered about it for a while. - it was neat to see a polar map in the codex. But its weird- havent made much of it - like why break it up into 92 slices…especially as it looks like they numbered it wrong…. and why is it off center of Sag A* - spent a while hunting for the actual center - didnt find anything.
