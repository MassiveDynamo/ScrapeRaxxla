Also just to chime separate to my request above regarding the Dark Wheel station...juts a thought and may have been mentioned, the codex states that they are at the 8th moon of an unnamed Gas giant not an unknown one, how relevant that is who knows but means that any system is viable with 8 moons at a gas giant, also want to add on that some very low mass brown dwarf stars could also be classed as a gas giant and is highly debated if this adds some more locations to look at for the DW station as there are a ton of low mass brown dwarfs with 8 or more moons within the bubble
I would caution you against drawing a line at brown dwarfs. In Elite: Dangerous they are a "star" type.
