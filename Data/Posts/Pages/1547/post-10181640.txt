@Rochester I had a thought...the logo might represent the rear of an asteroid station, with the dotted line representing the unseen front. The nearest one to your Underworld bubble, and doing a quick couple of triangulations looks like it was in Jaques path out of that underworld area, is the one in Otegine....right in the PF district & noobâ€™s permit required! Anyone with a new account want to check it out?

Otegine asteroid base is still being built, and most landing pads are overloaded with scaffolding and such stuff.
It has no definite inner rear - it just sort of fades away into darkness. While there is some occasional light, there seems to be nothing there that matches the logo. There is no outer rear (logically enough.)
