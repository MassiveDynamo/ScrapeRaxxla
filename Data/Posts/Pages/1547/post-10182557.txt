Perhaps more obfuscation? Since being convinced by @Rochester ’s graphical analysis of the tight spacing of the “Underworld” region I’ve got interested in the mythology around the Eleusinian mysteries, Demeter and Persephone’s journey into the Underworld. One thing that has struck me is the sheer amount of obfuscation MB put in. There’s the Mars Alien Artefact, that caused me to focus overlong on Sol (which also has station names that fit the toast), there are Persephones all over the place, including a Persephone station in Avalon, etc.
