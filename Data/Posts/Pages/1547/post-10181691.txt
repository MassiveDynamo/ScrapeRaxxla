Otegine asteroid base is still being built, and most landing pads are overloaded with scaffolding and such stuff.
It has no definite inner rear - it just sort of fades away into darkness. While there is some occasional light, there seems to be nothing there that matches the logo. There is no outer rear (logically enough.)
Thanks, but I think its position in the prohibited Pilots Federation noobs area rules it out in any case!
