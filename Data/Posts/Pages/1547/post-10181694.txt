I can get some screenshots from Darwin Research Facility (A.O.E. Allied Order of Exemplars) HQ asteroid base. I think there may be some stuff in there that matches the Raxxla logo. I am sadly am about to have to stop as soon as my carrier jumps to the system.
On a similar thing was Octavia Quinton's asteroid base actually ever in game? I visited beacon 500 after reading Drew's amazing books but sadly no physical station.
The in game events were before my time here.
