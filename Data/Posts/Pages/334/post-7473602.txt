This leads me to inevitably to one thought. I jokingly thought, in my pants. that is why nobody has found it. This lead me to the phrase from the simpsons about eating my shorts... Then i realized something. Supposedly the simpsons has done everything... So, have they done raxxla? The show must logically/statistically have a hint. What from the simpsons could tell us where raxxla is. If not the simpsons is a lie. Else we might be able to whittle it down! It's just a theory. But if the weirdos who make games and tv are connected logically/coincidentally or personally in any tiny way it might just pull through.

Logically if very little from the show should be relatable to the game the few things that do must be rare and stick out. Else there is nothing to find or it gets weird fast if everything is relatable. But, then again, if it's all related, it might in itself be a clue!
