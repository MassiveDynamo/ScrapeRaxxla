Related, are we supposed to find Raxxla using clues in the game and lore? Researching Greek literature and the Illuminati and other "external" sources feels like a rabbit hole to me. Is there precedence for this?
Drew Wagar included a number of external references in his Formidine Rift puzzles. It's possible that Michael Brookes may have done the same, as he is well-read. I wouldn't have thought the current custodians of Elite would be so likely to include obscure cultural references, but you never know. The Codex entries appear to have some specific clues....
