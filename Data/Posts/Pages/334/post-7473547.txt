Related, are we supposed to find Raxxla using clues in the game and lore? Researching Greek literature and the Illuminati and other "external" sources feels like a rabbit hole to me. Is there precedence for this?

Why are you asking us? We have no idea & there are no clues! Your guess is as good as anbody else’s.

correction: we have many ideas, all are either untested or failed hypotheses. Some people seem to be obsessed by mythology in this quest; personally I think it’s a collection of red herrings...
but I could be wrong.
