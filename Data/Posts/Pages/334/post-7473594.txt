Over six THOUSAND posts in this thread and you have no ideas or clues? Well that's a sad commentary, LOL.

LOL, personally I enjoy this thread. It's like a little parallel universe all of its own, full of stories, speculation, winding paths and glorious hopes and dreams. I'll take it over six thousand pages of salt and bile (not hard to find in any other part of the forum!) any old day of the week.

Keep it up seekers! It's about the journey... not the destination.
