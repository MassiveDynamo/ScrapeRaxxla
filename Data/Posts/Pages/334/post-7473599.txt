LOL, personally I enjoy this thread. It's like a little parallel universe all of its own, full of stories, speculation, winding paths and glorious hopes and dreams. I'll take it over six thousand pages of salt (not hard to find in any other part of the forum!) any old day of the week.

It and the Dark Wheel thread have made for great bedtime reading
