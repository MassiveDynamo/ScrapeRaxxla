Mmmmh... Ok with the Astrophel and Stella/Spiralling Stars, though a quite far-fetched thing, imho...
Anything can turn out to be the point. It's ED, after all.

About "Raxxla being ingame since the start..etc..", I think there are like two periods in the developement of the myth ingame.
The first, which is so brilliantly related in the FP and following, wth the E/F missions and MB leading the thing, until they were brutally taken off.
Typical FD way of doing things.
And then, after a short interlude as MB left ED, the Codex period. No need to become Elite to deal with TDW faction, (anyway, getting Elite status is easy in a couple of days through Explo/Trade/Mining), and The Myth/TDW relation widely spread by appearing as a major theme in the Codex.
The tiny little bit obvious part, is underlined in red now.
