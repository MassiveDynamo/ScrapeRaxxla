Strange that You are mentioning Odin because reasons.

"Eyes to see" was referenced by FD long long time ago for Dark Systems among other things.
Indeed. But what I mean is that almost every culture has some kind of myth/legend/history which can be related to ED "clues".
Are we going to try every one we know or are we presuming that the FD story-tellers put some of their preferences in it?
Then the "MB being fan of Norse, Lovecraft, etc.." thing. But he left, so.. ? Do we know DB's preferences in that matter ?
