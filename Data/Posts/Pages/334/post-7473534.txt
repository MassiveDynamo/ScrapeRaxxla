Sorry if anyone has covered this previously...but to continue the literary analysis of Astrophel & Stella against Greek mythology.

'With eyes to see' - does this allude to a classical analysis of the text, to extract classical names used in astronomical navigation or a Homeric journey?

Might mean that Raxxla will not show on any instrumentation & must be spotted visually.
