See, that's what I was asking about when some random fellow told me you all have no ideas or clues...

Being late to the party, I wonder if I'll make it 6 million and ONE ideas, or if I'll just rehash old ideas as I embark on a little detective work of my own... I suppose I can eventually make my way through these 6000+ posts, especially if I skip past all the weird "One-eye Thor shall lead the way" ideas [haha]

Oh, you wonder ? Keep wondering and when you have some kind of proper idea we will be pleased to read and comment it. [haha]
Odin, not Thor.
