Any ideas on the symbolism here: My take Nature (tree) vs Technology (Guardian column?). This is from a tourist station. The same column appears between the male and female CMDR statue. This was in border zone between Federal and Independent systems. The building between the circles appears to be a church (on square pad). The green hexagon I am unsure of the nature of the building (may represent humanity). The building in the upper right appears to be a home. I don't know if this could be overlayed on GalMap to tell us where to search. The home structure I think would be in the direction of Coalsack if I am reading this corectly based on relative position of human bubble vs Guardian.
