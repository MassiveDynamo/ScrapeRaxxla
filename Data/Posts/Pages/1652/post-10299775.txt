Lets everyone forget the landscape signal for a moment and turn your attention to supercruise noise! now i cant record due to being in the room with my sleeping 1 year old however use camera mode and zoom as far away from your ship as possible, now crank up that volume and i mean crank up a good bit! and point towards Andromeda, yes there is a noticeable difference in noise! Im currently in Asuhail incase the location matters il report back when im further away from here if the location changes

Edit: There appears to be multiple different noises ranging from the direction of the Maelstroms, the galaxy center, landscape among a few more im not sure where they point, Now the kind of chirping noise is constant however there is audible differences that are in different locations and always are in those directions and not randomized.
