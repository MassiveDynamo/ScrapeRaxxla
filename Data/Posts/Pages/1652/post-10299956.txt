Hmm, that reminds me of the Aster flower Spencer described in his Astrophel poem, also used in Japanese and especially Chinese culture for centuries.
The -ach could easily be a suffix like in Irish meaning "connected or involved with / belonging to"
Halsey is said to possibly derive from Halsway, Somerset - which is Old English for Hals (neck) + Weg (way / road)
Edit: OH! and of course Jasmina relates to the Jasmine flower..... INTERESTING
There is another flower girl. Felicity Winters https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicia_amelloides

and of course the flower queen pin Florence, Lavigny Duval.

I mentioned this in august:https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-1573#post-10209908

This quartet will now have even more power, as Winters becomes the Federal president. Jasmina is currently ambassador to the Alliance and has been an adviser to Mahoon.
Florence is the mother of the Emperor and the architect behind the takeover of power from the Duval family.
