As to if itâ€™s a red herring cannot be definitively confirmed so one has to presume everything in the Codex is true. So Princess Astrophel must be a real character or place in game or lore, the spiralling stars I feel will be a directional clue and possibly point us somewhere.
If I were you, I would be looking very carefully at Aisling Duval and her parents (you may have to source details from the FFE journals). I think that is our Astrophel. She came from an unlikely background. Going to expand on that further, and The Architect from "..And Here the Wheel" is likely a Duval and his grandson may well be Admiral Aiden Tanner. We know there are CMDRs amongst the Duvals (believe the one behind Nova Imperium flew ships). Wasn't it a daughter that is read stories in one of the other novels? The Marlinists helped to found Tau Ceti (see Frontier gazetteer and FFE journals for confirmed portions of the Mayflower 97 route). Beta Hydri is founded by very wealthy Scottish families that traveled with Marlin Duval. The discontent with the powers that be goes back a long time. Phekda, Capella, Achenar, and Alioth were colonized specifically because they were resource rich and could be leveraged against the Federation and the corporations it let become so powerful. Even the Alliance is founded by one families affected by the Birthright Wars - the Argents. The plan to bring down the corporate overlords was set in motion before Raxxla. You are dealing with people who were uprooted by corporations that became too powerful. They were willing to see that there was karma for this even if took a long while.

Besides, Aisling Duval is a little too clean looking to not be wrapped up deeply into that plot. Her father certainly have had motivation given what happened.
