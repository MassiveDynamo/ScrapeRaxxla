So the Rift is not definite, only some versions of the Raxxla story mention it, and if you assume it is true what then is Raxxla and how does it relate to the OR? So the OR may either be total obfuscation or should be interpreted as part of the children's story "clue" which we don't understand...Astrophil & Stella AFAIK doesn't mention an Omphalos, nor does Elite Legacy (either as part of the main story or as part of the children's story that was Julia's sole possession growing up).
The way you get the rift back is via Earth. Without Earth in the same Universe, Raxxla cannot exist. The colonization of Achenar happened solely because Marlin Duval was not happy with the Federation. I am not wholly convinced that Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling stars rumors actually exclude the possibility of the Omphalos Rift being connected. The stories are informed by those who told them. Those who stayed at the Federation had different perspectives than Imperials, the Marlinists had different perspectives from main line Imperials, and the Independents still another. Perspective is everything.

The are three commonalities: an Earth origin in all cases, a rift between Universes, and the ubiquitous Astrogation Console. It doesn't matter how you approach it, those things are in everything. The Gold-skins are the key (as in Bedaho). This is why Saud Kruger and the Antares are so important.
