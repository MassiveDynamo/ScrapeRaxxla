In light of the above re: disappearance in Alioth, I am preliminarily going to say whomever founded The Pilot's Federation is the sole tyrant. That honor then may go to Jaques who may well be over a millennia or more old (and stands better odds than not of being the Guardian Civil AI). The catch here, he may also be the Founder and Peter Jameson. He may have other aliases such as Augustus Brenquith (which would go a long way to explaining how Astrogator got their Astrogation Console in every ship manufacturer known).
