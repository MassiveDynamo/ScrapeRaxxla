Hmm, that reminds me of the Aster flower Spencer described in his Astrophel poem, also used in Japanese and especially Chinese culture for centuries.
The -ach could easily be a suffix like in Irish meaning "connected or involved with / belonging to"
Halsey is said to possibly derive from Halsway, Somerset - which is Old English for Hals (neck) + Weg (way / road)
Edit: OH! and of course Jasmina relates to the Jasmine flower..... INTERESTING
So Jasmine stuck her neck out and struck out!
