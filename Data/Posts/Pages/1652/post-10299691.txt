I vaguely remember something in the lore about an entire fleet disappearing. That could be Raxxla and not much else - even a misjump would have only taken out one ship and its nearest neighbours.
Alioth. Though, that appears to connected to "Emperor's Own" from Laedla. Apparently, they were also deployed at Alioth given its' status of "stellar El Dorado". Interesting, so the clone program was actually active pre-2924. Whatcha want to bet that is why Pilot's licenses were only offered at Lave? Pilot's Federation is founded 2805. The rumors regarding unification of both superpowers happen approximately 3008 but could have happened earlier - mostly they are linked to President Tyrell Biggs. However, it may have happened as far back as Trasken Duval II which lines up Pilot's Federation founding.
