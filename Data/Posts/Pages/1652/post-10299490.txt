Just had a check in my notes but looks like I deleted the one on the SSO disaster.
I did find "Halsey has a sister Azalea" (hint to something about Azaleach?? In Japan/China Azaleas symbolise homesickness, is that the opposite of Fernweh??)
Hmm, that reminds me of the Aster flower Spencer described in his Astrophel poem, also used in Japanese and especially Chinese culture for centuries.
The -ach could easily be a suffix like in Irish meaning "connected or involved with / belonging to"
Halsey is said to possibly derive from Halsway, Somerset - which is Old English for Hals (neck) + Weg (way / road)
Edit: OH! and of course Jasmina relates to the Jasmine flower..... INTERESTING
