Ive been in the music industry for over 30 years, ive seen a few of these because they made me laugh!
I know the manufacturer but ive never met a representative, however, i know a guy in a well known band who i will be seeing shortly in a muddy field who DOEs know these folks so i will see if i can get some info (that's August though).
Having had conversations backstage with one chap (who does play Elite) we basically dismissed it as a sales gimmick, but ya never know.
Im sure like most other games you would be surprised at some of the well know people that actually play this game, i usually ware my ED T-Shirts backstage to see how many folks give me a salute

At least someone knows something about them. I assumed it was just a gimmick, the brand seems to be space themed. I've been feeling like Charlie from Always Sunny with the detective board. Kind of want to buy one for my pedal board just for the meme, even though I'm not really one for chorus.
