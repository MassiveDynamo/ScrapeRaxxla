Just for this system? Normally the fss does show planetary rings

Discovery of rings requires DSS scanner. In addition, if you are running a ship without DSS scanner previous DSS scans of that system are invisible. In essence, the DSS stores memory for any scanned bodies. As you approach a DSS scanned body, your ship will report on any updates. If you run EDDiscovery, I strongly suggest the voicepack add-on for extra details as you explore a system as it can convert your journals to spoken updates.
