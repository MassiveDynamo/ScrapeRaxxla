In Dahan, been 10kls above & below Hathor, then travelled from Coltan to Wanderer...nothing.

But FSS is showing 5 asteroid clusters yet there is no asteroid belt from EDSM or system map. Thought it must be planetary rings, but Hathor has 1 ring and Dahan 3 has 3 rings...
Odd!!

Edit
Could these be FC? Post lunch siesta...must wake up and check this.

apparently FSS doesnt show planetary rings but there are 5 asteroids showing in fss, but none in-system map (WHY?), 12FC and 2 stations, so I guess that's the 14 Concentrated Signal Sources (Never had a proper explanation of this- what do the asterisk and Exclamation mark symbols actually mean?), so what are the other 2 concentrated signal sources shown at left of frequency scan?
