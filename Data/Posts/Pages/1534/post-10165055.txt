I found this today... Little strange to me but probably nothing. It's a Russian guitar effects pedal released in 2015. It includes a pulsar map. Probably just meaningless graphic design, but it could also be the location of Raxxla if it somehow someway was related or meaningful. Raxxla is not a word in Russian or any other language so its a strange connection. Maybe the company is just a fan of the game.

Weird. When I searched for this word on the Internet a long time ago, I found it too. But it didn't seem to have any planets and it seemed to me to be an English company.
Although the device was also related to sound.
