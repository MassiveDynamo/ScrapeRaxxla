The Ark hips would be sub lightspeed. Realistically 0.6 C maximum. They would not have made it trough more than a couple systems, in 9 years.
Rogue planets would be much slower that that. They probably need a hundred years to clear a system.
If Raxxla really moves from system to system, it's a ship with at least supercruise capability.

Ya when i said ark ships i was kind of meaning all the various generation ships of the “missing” as fd calls them… so possibly a little further range . But ya not terribly feasible.

Raxxla as a moving thing feels right to me. While i agree a “moon” probably shouldn't have the velocity to zip around between systems with any speed… maybe its the death star

Just another thought…. All the rubble around the Maelstroms… what if that was the shell of a planet that the maelstrom grew in… before it “hatched”

Also ya with these kind of objects you think comets would be doable now…
