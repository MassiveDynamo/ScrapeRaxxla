Has anyone looked closely at Tourist Beacons?
The TB by Saturn has an unusual (I think) decal that says "P78+E", but the "+" sign has a dot in each quadrant. Did a bit of googling and this seems to be an unusual mathematical symbol meaning both dot product and summation. Dont see how it applies here, but pondering if it's a clue

nope, just checked the TB at Jupiter & it has the same decal & type number on its side.
just googled and 7 years old report of same number on Non-human relic TB. Might be interesting if anyone has info on TB outside Sol.
