I found this today... Little strange to me but probably nothing. It's a Russian guitar effects pedal released in 2015. It includes a pulsar map. Probably just meaningless graphic design, but it could also be the location of Raxxla if it somehow someway was related or meaningful. Raxxla is not a word in Russian or any other language so its a strange connection. Maybe the company is just a fan of the game.

Ive been in the music industry for over 30 years, ive seen a few of these because they made me laugh!
I know the manufacturer but ive never met a representative, however, i know a guy in a well known band who i will be seeing shortly in a muddy field who DOEs know these folks so i will see if i can get some info (that's August though).
Having had conversations backstage with one chap (who does play Elite) we basically dismissed it as a sales gimmick, but ya never know.
Im sure like most other games you would be surprised at some of the well know people that actually play this game, i usually ware my ED T-Shirts backstage to see how many folks give me a salute
