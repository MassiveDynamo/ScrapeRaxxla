Apology's we must be at cross purposes, i was just trying to put across that if you use the FSS to map a system when you first (shall we say) reveal a planet or gas giant it shows if it has rings in the zoomed in picture of the body.
Yes the DSS is required to scan rings i was just trying to respond to Jorki's question.

Yep, was going to say I thought the rings were seen in the pic of the planet when you zoom into the fss signal, but don't think they're indicated by the asteroid count in the tuning display. But then there seem to be 5 asteroids in Dahan but nothing showing anywhere in system or in system map.

Edit
If I had any faith left in the FD issue process Iâ€™d report it...
