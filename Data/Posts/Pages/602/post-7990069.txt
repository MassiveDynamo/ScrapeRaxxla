You’re not going mad, I’ve seen those green orbs. They do seem to be very randomly occurring. Saw some in the areas around COL SECTOR 70 when returning from the Orion Nebula about 1 month ago.

I was stupid and nearly got stuck trying to get back to the bubble in a 24ly partly engineered Python.... Had to back track my route in the end using visited stars.

I live in fear of flying through the RAXXLA system and not spotting it, or even TDW. It’s the stuff of ‘needle in a haystack’ nightmares...
Great thanks. So if you have seen then in COL 70, they are not unique to the neutron field.
That's useful thank you.
You weren't in a patch of high energy stars I suppose? Just out of interest.
