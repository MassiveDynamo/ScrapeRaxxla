Great thanks. So if you have seen then in COL 70, they are not unique to the neutron field.
That's useful thank you.
You weren't in a patch of high energy stars I suppose? Just out of interest.

There were some F-types, I was searching for large ‘blue light’ stars possibly with BH’s, but didn’t have any Neutrons or White Dwarfs that I remember on the trip.

What I did. Once I had arrived at the Orion Nebula I headed straight up until level with the bubble, then tried to plot a route back to DECIAT. My mistake, as COL SECTOR 70 is all over the place up here, so I had to plot a course back down and find a route back. Took me 8 hours to get back to the Witch Head Nebula....

I did not find Raxxla nor TDW on this trip I’m afraid....,
