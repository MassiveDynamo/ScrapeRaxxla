So from a meta-philosophical bent... If Raxxla is associated with the Spindle of Necessity... It has the idea of Inexorable Fate associated with it. What can be more descriptive of Inexorable Fate in the Elite Universe than the overarching plan/plot that FD has. And so we spiral towards death... the light at the end of the tunnel being Raxxla. This would explain how we will all make our own paths to it and also the reason no one has "found" it. The epitome of "endgame".. It is inevitable - it will be the singularity, the gate, and the key to a new beginning ?
SPOILER: WYRD BIÐ FUL ARÆD!

Edit: It is possible what Fdev is pointing to, judging from the many easter eggs ingame, is that Raxxla should be a space somewhere out of time. In a world where time does not exist, then free will is only an illusion. Everything has already happened & Destiny still arrives.

Disclaimer: Not familiar with Plato & the Spindle. I am also an agnostic & maybe absurdist but the idea of predestination still rankles somewhat.
