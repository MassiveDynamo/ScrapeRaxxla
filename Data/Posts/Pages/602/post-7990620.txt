So from a meta-philosophical bent... If Raxxla is associated with the Spindle of Necessity... It has the idea of Inexorable Fate associated with it. What can be more descriptive of Inexorable Fate in the Elite Universe than the overarching plan/plot that FD has. And so we spiral towards death... the light at the end of the tunnel being Raxxla. This would explain how we will all make our own paths to it and also the reason no one has "found" it. The epitome of "endgame".. It is inevitable - it will be the singularity, the gate, and the key to a new beginning ?
SPOILER: WYRD BIÐ FUL ARÆD!

What? You mean when we find it the PC explodes and we die??
Oh I don’t know
I’m half expecting that when I find TDW station it will be named
“Raxxla”

It’s Expanse Belter dialect for “relax here”
