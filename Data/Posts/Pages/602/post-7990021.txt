Come on guys....I'm seeing unusual things in the deepest void, whilst I'm on the brow of the mother of the galaxy, which COULD be the area with the radio signal?....have we run out of tin foil???
Anybody else seen these green orbs? The big neutron field is the only place I've seen them. They are common here, but not every jump.
Also still occasionally seeing the weird pronounced tunnel with extra lights, just before exit in some of these systems.
Are others familiar with these phenomena? Am I space crazy? Or are these things odd? I know it's a loading screen, but that doesnt mean it cant contain info/hints/pointers/clues....?

You’re not going mad, I’ve seen those green orbs. They do seem to be very randomly occurring. Saw some in the areas around COL SECTOR 70 when returning from the Orion Nebula about 1 month ago.

I was stupid and nearly got stuck trying to get back to the bubble in a 24ly partly engineered Python.... Had to back track my route in the end using visited stars.

I live in fear of flying through the RAXXLA system and not spotting it, or even TDW. It’s the stuff of ‘needle in a haystack’ nightmares...
