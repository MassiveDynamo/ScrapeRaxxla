Example or green orb strangeness. Space madness, or "unusual"?

Come on guys....I'm seeing unusual things in the deepest void, whilst I'm on the brow of the mother of the galaxy, which COULD be the area with the radio signal?....have we run out of tin foil???
Anybody else seen these green orbs? The big neutron field is the only place I've seen them. They are common here, but not every jump.
Also still occasionally seeing the weird pronounced tunnel with extra lights, just before exit in some of these systems.
Are others familiar with these phenomena? Am I space crazy? Or are these things odd? I know it's a loading screen, but that doesnt mean it cant contain info/hints/pointers/clues....?
