IMAGINAL NETWORK HEIST

The recent theft has been reported of two priceless works of art. The 'Imaginal Network' by [OoL1([FmL2,[FfL2), a multi-dimensional image made in the 'new conceptual' school of thought was removed from the Gallery of the Locational Arts Trust at [SyL3(A) while, in a second raid on the same night, the K'tion's 'Contemporate Method' was stolen from the Institute of Critical Art at Wicca's World.

Are those names some kind of leetspeak or calculator-speak?

Looks like Oolite, Emily, Frontier Elite 2, Sylea...
