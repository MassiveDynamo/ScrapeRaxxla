Jasmina Halsey’s assassination, by some high Fed officials, followed her surreptitious meeting with Mahon. Perhaps she was being kept out of the loop on Raxxla etc and Mahon provided some Alliance insight on Guardians/Thargoids which caused her unscheduled secret diversion? (I’m still not convinced the diversion was to Azaleach!). We have no way of knowing, but I find it telling that the galnet post about that meeting was redacted.

And the answer to your lore question may well be that the Pilots’ Federation is much more than a trade union. I think that’s what the indications are saying. I think they’re saying that PF originated from the Guardians or their descendants (hence the repeated triangle motif) who have been manipulating humanity from the outset. They certainly control the permit locks, and UC from which they appear to have become the richest organisation in the universe, and I think they also control Sirius (else otherwise an enterprising fsd engineer would develop a drive that didnt implement permits).

However, is it still canon that the Alliance reverse engineered Thargoid tech?
