Not convinced by your second gate. I’ve been allied with TDW in ShinDez for around 2 years, and with the PF (whichever spelling/subfaction it is) since killing goids out in the Pleiades during first lockdown (my hands are slowly beginning to get a bit better!), and now I’ve sold them MCr100+ worth of exploration data which included Goliath’s Rest (burning jewel on brow of Milky Way) and Sag A* and not seen any hint of a TDW recruitment test.

But I too suspect that TDW will provide another storyline and will provide access to permits for at least the half dozen locked systems in the bubble.
You only have the key, but you haven't found the gate. You need to find the station.
I don't think there are any in game mechanics that leads to the DW station. I suspect that it has to be found by interpretation of obtuse hints and visual searching.
