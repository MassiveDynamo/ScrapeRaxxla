Well, Tyko’s spent a few hours bumbling around Shin Dez, ran two data courier missions to nearby systems, visited asteroid cluster 3, planet A3, closely inspected the interior (and exterior) of Jameson Memorial, and has mapped AB3h. Why? I counted the red lights on the large wheel & got 33, same as the dots on the “Raxxla logo”? The interior of that logo looks like the astronomical symbol for a star with 3 belts around it. And AB3h seems to be the 33rd planet (going by distance).

Nothing found!

And nothing heard from TDW re a possible induction exam . A mission beacon did appear just before I logged out, but it wasn’t for TDW so I ignored it.
