I'm never sure either, but can help a bit.

Gallia in the letters at the edge - looks like raxxla with the right script - one of the very few things google will turn up that's not due to ED

"No one ever.." is a quote by the director of "The Dying Gaul"

The music? no idea - thumpy stuff. But it's lyrics are 'The Real Thing' which might be enough

Carlo Gergoi's engraving - not sure I got it on that one... A gladiator meditating..

"for the entire law is fulfilled.." is a quote from the bible saying that "love thy neighbor as yourself" encompasses the whole law..

Then a picture of UK warships patrolling ready for post Brexit cod wars? UK not loving it's neighbors..

That was my take, angular relevance, but fun none the less..

Gallia in Greek is Γαλλία. It looks a bit like raxxla and many OCR programs will interpret it as raXXLa.

Googling for Raxxla will give quite a few hits on old scanned texts, with partly Greek text.
