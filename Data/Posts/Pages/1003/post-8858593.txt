But don’t we need to pass the recruitment test to be able to visit the stealth station?
I suspect it wont instance until you do.

The “Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth” mission appeared to be related to Raxxla and TDW may be a parallel thread with little or no impingement.
It would really help if we knew of someone (anyone) who had achieved membership; I find it really strange after five years that nobody has mentioned they’ve had the invitation!
The next AMA perhaps someone should ask whether TDW membership test really exists in-game! It’s not Raxxla-related so should get an answer!
Gating the instance seem like a poor game design. It should at least involve some form of equipment, that allows detecting the station.
I would guess that gating the docking access, would be more logical and in line with existing mechanics.
Finding a station only by parallax, is really dificult. There is not much risk that anyone finds it, until the right hints are understood.
