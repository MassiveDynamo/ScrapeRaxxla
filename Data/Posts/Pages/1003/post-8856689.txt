Hey @GURU-951, I was reviewing some older videos as I do for tip-bits and recalled that your video a few months ago did a slow fly through of the recent Odyssey FDev footage around the systems and remembered something similar from David's PAX east video (links below).

Is it the same footage re-hashed again, it's looks like it with a quick scan?

If so I'm even more suspicious of it's content as David loves dropping hints in his videos. So to see it again 3 years later might mean we've missed something and FDev are making it a tiny bit obvious, or they're lazy and re-using stock video footage.










Fly Dangerously.
See you in the Black!

Your guess, Cmdr, is as good as mine.
