You only have the key, but you haven't found the gate. You need to find the station.
I don't think there are any in game mechanics that leads to the DW station. I suspect that it has to be found by interpretation of obtuse hints and visual searching.

But don’t we need to pass the recruitment test to be able to visit the stealth station?
I suspect it wont instance until you do.

The “Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth” mission appeared to be related to Raxxla and TDW may be a parallel thread with little or no impingement.
It would really help if we knew of someone (anyone) who had achieved membership; I find it really strange after five years that nobody has mentioned they’ve had the invitation!
The next AMA perhaps someone should ask whether TDW membership test really exists in-game! It’s not Raxxla-related so should get an answer!
