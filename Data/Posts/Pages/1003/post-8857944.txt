Mate, there are times when I think you’re an alien ‘cos I don’t understand a word!

I'm never sure either, but can help a bit.

Gallia in the letters at the edge - looks like raxxla with the right script - one of the very few things google will turn up that's not due to ED

"No one ever.." is a quote by the director of "The Dying Gaul"

The music? no idea - thumpy stuff. But it's lyrics are 'The Real Thing' which might be enough

Carlo Gergori's engraving - not sure I got it on that one... A gladiator meditating..

"for the entire law is fulfilled.." is a quote from the bible saying that "love thy neighbor as yourself" encompasses the whole law..

Then a picture of UK warships patrolling ready for post Brexit cod wars? UK not loving it's neighbors..

That was my take, angular relevance, but fun none the less..
