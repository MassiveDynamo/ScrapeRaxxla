Well ... did 9 jumps. Found 2 new star systems, each had "noticeable stellar" with trees ... Also EDSM shows 3-4 stars with trees in 500ly radius. Some infected piece of space
When I was on left side of galaxy, met 1 nebula only close to colonia with bio signals.

Maybe my luck, or maybe right - bottom side only has life.
