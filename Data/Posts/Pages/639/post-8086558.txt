Okey..there is a cluster there, pretty compact...
PRA BYOEA KU-A A82-0 and around


Also toast and his route on screen may have sence
"To the jewel" - behind Sag A there is region called Izanami - who is goddes of creation of everything
"To wisper" - when you turn to magelan clouds u can see "steam" region
and last part - is Mare Somnia which is "sea of dreams"...

but still can be fake info, claster is big enough yet there to find things randomly.
