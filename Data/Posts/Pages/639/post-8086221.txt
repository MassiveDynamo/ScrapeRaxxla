What does the barcode at the bottom come out to?

Also if any of that is true. Thent hose guardian gun platforms are also of the same shape in general. That is what that bottom picture is insinuating. And they are supposed to be portals to start with I think. Didn't someone try to turn them all on at the same time? Maybe in a group game?! Or in open..

Are those portal guns in anyway layed out in a pattern? Has anyone mapped them in both 2d and 3d. I imagine 2d could be hard with infinite perspective.

Ya i parked myself at one of them the other night. Probably worth studying more. I sat around and stared at the rolling rochard inkblots for a bit. Mapping them might be fun.... Barcodes? hmmm dont know about them.
