@CMDRKomatix Is the final marked route supposed to be raxxla?
As he stated, the location should be somewhere above the galactic disk (maybe ~2500ly) and between sector 22/23...

If this mathmoss did claim the galaxies as easter eggs then seems really odd because you can see those 2 images easily in galmap.

Plus some of the older pictures you posted are of Kepler's Crest & Trojan's Belt. Did he claim those were on the way to Mare Somnia because it would be really odd considering those 2 regions are half a galaxy apart. Or is that your interpretation?

And why are his "clues" such blurry pictures even though he has other good quality ones as a space photog? He claims to respect the game and other explorers and yet is still jebaiting with blurry pics.

He has also followed the common MO of other hoaxers of conveniently self destructing because of [insert reason here]... just doesn't pass the smell test.

well, idk... but I believe more into something like that as 90% of the "ideas" in this thread, like there are hidden messages in the barcodes of the stickers you can buy etc. ...
