There exists a Dev video of Brookes saying something similar, about being careful about transporting certain illegal cargo in Alliance space, it then cuts to an amusing ‘reaction’ he pulls with a Brookes smirk and appropriate ominous music!

Interesting - I know ive watched this a few times but a while back... MB mentions the Martian alien artifact (about 10:21) in the context of other sentient species in the galaxy and says he hopes to reveal a little bit more about it in the future. Seems to me that he is indicating it is Guardian since that is how things have played out. My only issue is - why wasnt the connection brought forward when Guardians were "Discovered"- an, oh by the way in Galnet saying ya we found this bit a while back on Mars... and ya turns out it is related to these Guardian chaps... But they didnt.... So i guess it still leaves the potential for something else...
