Technically the ‘Silver Comet’ of the article is in game.

The Galnet article identified two locations. One of these has a POI which leads you to another system. Likewise with another POI where you are ambushed by Elite NPCs.

You don’t actually find the Silver Comet, (at least I didn’t) just her acolytes. It’s more of a vignette, I suppose there are a lot of these types of POIs out there, but generally I found it a tiresome practice of tracking them down as it was reliant upon you the Cmdr to pursue.

Nice to have as environmental storytelling but it never felt divergent nor believable to me, more like a set dressing, and there was no explanation upon completion so you were left unsure about what had actually happened or if you had to do anything else… I always imagined what would someone think if they randomly found these POI, would they investigate or just ignore them.
