Wasnt the Silver Comet the ship of an enhanced ex military elite pilot in one of the books...”Wanted”?
The story was 'The Comet’s Trail'. The pilot is a genetically engineered woman. Sort of a biological AI. A bit like a pilot master chef.

I think the books name is 'Tales from the frontier', or similar?
