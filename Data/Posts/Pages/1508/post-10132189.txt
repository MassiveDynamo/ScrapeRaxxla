That bit about being ‘linked to TDW faction’ and having a ‘more valuable prize hidden within’ intrigues me. And why are they strictly prohibited everywhere? That doesn't make sense unless they contain some deadly toxin, OR FD is making their importance highly apparent.
Previous responses from Support and Devs was these were linked to that story and are now a ‘curiosity’.

I accept that story was removed or paused for whatever reason, but these were left in game as environmental storytelling. I don’t think they actively activate anything anymore, but potentially provide context.

As to if FD are keeping secrets through narratively gate keeping is another hornets nest all-together and not constructive. The past is the past. I presume FD moved on.

Arthur has hinted, there are things out there, for those able to read between the lines. As to if they are talking about Raxxla or something else is anyone’s guess.

At most the Codex is likely the primary information. What is ultimately means or leads remains a mystery.
