I’ve been mooting the Martian Relic as Guardian, and humanity as an engineered anti-Thargoid weapon or Guardian food source for years. The triangular motif, now obscured, in the ships’ nav panel and UC interface point to Guardian AI guiding us.

It’s possible that thise missions for SAP8 containers were obfuscation, and to resolve them we should instead have grabbed Trinkets —the containers both have the same visual appearance and serial number.

“FD probable have plans for us to learn more about these beings”, yep, well I’m 70, so I won’t be expecting to see that event!! Whatever happened to the 10-year game plan? I feel it’s stretched out to at least 30 year plan! There’s still the hostile human AI and Guardian AI to encounter/annoy/war, plus whatever is produced by the Thargoids from all those escape capsules they snatched.

I presume someone has tried shooting at Trinkets (?) to see what’s inside... has that been done in Alliance space? Has anyone tried to take Trinkets into Alliance space??
