Sorry I'm not attacking, but I'm just wondering what the basis for that statement is.
1. For example guards bases were immediately in the game and they were not added later?
2. In the game Raxxla is mentioned only in the Codex, he was not at the beginning of the game.
Im not being negative it was mentioned in one of DBOBE's ibterviews that Raxxla was in the game and players can find it. This was before Horizons and planetary landings etc
