Raxxla was in the base game before even planet landing so it has to be in space or a planet

Anything accessable by ship without landing on a planet surface
Sorry I'm not attacking, but I'm just wondering what the basis for that statement is.
1. For example guards bases were immediately in the game and they were not added later?
2. In the game Raxxla is mentioned only in the Codex, he was not at the beginning of the game.
