“Ostensibly Raxxla has been in game since the beginning so it isn't an Odyssey asset, which means it can realistically only be a planet. “

No, this is logically incorrect and pure assumption. We know very little about Raxxla. We were told (by DB with some amusement) that we don’t know what Raxxla is, and that Raxxla has been in-game since the pre-release Gamma version, so it could be any of the object/event types that existed at that time:
Star system
Star
Planet
Moon
Asteroid
Asteroid belt
Asteroid cluster
Nebula
NPC ship
Station
Shipyard
Market
Black Market
Tourist Beacon
Player ship
Player ship type
Player ship equipment module
Module store
Player rank level
Player reputation level
SRV
Material
Rare Goods
Landing Pad
Mission
Mission type
Combat Zone
Resource Zone
Hyperspace jump (the act)
Hyperspace tunnel (the loading screen animation)
Faction
Signal source
Datalink
Music track

However we do have a little bit of further information:
Someone said of Shinrarta Dezhra that they were a tiny little bit disappointed FD didn't call the Founder’s World “Raxxla” and MB responded that “Raxxla is something different”.
He also said:
“Raxxla is something in the game world (not text) and very hard to find”
“It’s not a random thing”
“Anyone can find it, and more than once”

And Drew Wagar reported that he talked with David Braben at bar after an award ceremony. I asked him "Is Raxxla in the game?" He answered with "Yes. And we know where it is." (I assumed the "we" meant Frontier Developments).

So this mysterious thing has a location (which might be fixed, or might be moving but in a predictable manner), it can be found, & it’s not Shinrarta. This removes some of the possibilities from the list above, but not all...

I’m currently hypothesising that it is a hyperspace jump that takes the player somewhere significantly different from the anticipated destination.
