Sorry. Finding does not mean understanding what you have found, much less interacting with that object.
Whilst i do agree with that sentiment that it can be found at all in the base game would in itself mean it can be found not by landing on planets but more moving around in space

It was this i was referring to, for all we know it might be locked behind a forcefield or something we cant access but without finding it properly and examining it we wont know for sure its all just conjecture and speculation.
