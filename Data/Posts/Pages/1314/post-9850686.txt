Mission update: Operation Bubble To Barnard's Loop

Mission is still a go; I've created a Google sheet with system names 'near' the two systems: Synuefe GY-O C7-0 & Flame Sector DB-X c1-0 where you can assign yourself to a system. Please note that some systems are permit locked; mark them as such and skip to your next system.

PM me your Google account email and I'll add you to the list of editors.
I've been catching up on this week's discussion and the other thread you shared.... This bit stuck in my head... "My guess is it's somewhere under the col 70 systems or very close to it. So, about 1000Ly from CUBEO system .. direction col 70.

System unknown, maybe OOCHERS .. contains a PLANET called RAXXLA"

Oochorrs would be a good point to start? I think it borders Col70 on the way to the crab nebula?

...and you're only looking for a planet in the Comms panel, so no need to look for anything else?
