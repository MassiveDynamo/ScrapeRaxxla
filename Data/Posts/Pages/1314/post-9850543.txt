I've sent you a message for access as I'll be near that area soon. When scanning a system should be check every object and map the surface as well or just look for earthlike worlds? I sort of assume it should be an earthlike world, but perhaps that is not a good assumption to make.
The first twenty or so systems I checked, I mapped all the planets that had not been mapped previously. Tons of RNG Odyssey POI's on each....I gave up in the mid 20's and am now just checked to see if there are any "undiscovered" bodies or abnormalities.

Ostensibly Raxxla has been in game since the beginning so it isn't an Odyssey asset, which means it can realistically only be a planet. In other words, it can't be an on foot asset, so atmospheric planets are out. Can't be a landable base, so Horizons planets are out. Which is why I think it's in a permit locked system being re-designed for end game reveal with Odyssey assets. But this is fun in the meantime.
