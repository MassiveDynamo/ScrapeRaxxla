Using the filter was my interpretation of “i did know about the KGBFOAM stars to not run out off feul. ( that's important info ).” But indeed he didn't explicitly say that he filtered the route. For me that makes 2 jumps of 45 Ly from my current position. Surely that depends on star density along the complete route. IMHO best strategy would be to measure without filter to stay on a sphere-segment around Cubeo. And then search closer layer by layer. If I had the time, my next step would be to find the 24-jumps arc going down from Synuefe GY-O C7-0 (given that he went below COL 70) until I cannot jump any deeper with the 45 Ly ship. Then estimate an east/west deviation from the perfect line to make that a search window. I bet this will be a lot of KGBFOAM to seach…
