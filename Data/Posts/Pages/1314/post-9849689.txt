Mission update: Operation Bubble To Barnard's Loop

Mission is still a go; I've created a Google sheet with system names 'near' the two systems: Synuefe GY-O C7-0 & Flame Sector DB-X c1-0 where you can assign yourself to a system. Please note that some systems are permit locked; mark them as such and skip to your next system.

PM me your Google account email and I'll add you to the list of editors.
