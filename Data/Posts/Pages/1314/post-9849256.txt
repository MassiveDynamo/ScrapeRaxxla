Using the edsm api gives 750 systems

If you're looking for a named planet, it might be better to filter out all systems already fully known to EDSM (otoh, I don't see an option to search for planet names in EDSM, so maybe not?)

If it's a signal source (because "it's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves"), that won't help, though.
