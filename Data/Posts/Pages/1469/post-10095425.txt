Anybody know when Asteroid bases were introduced into the game? My normal sources are mute on the subject
When they introduced to the overall lore? Elite Classic they were known as Rock Hermit stations. Insofar as Elite Dangerous, I would presume that they have been there since launch given they are at least as old as Faraway. In theory, as far as the lore goes I believe GalNet and prior games had the Dredgers built in the 2800s and those were needed to carve out the Asteroid bases/Rock Hermits. Further note, the GalNet covering Dredgers revealed they like our fleet carriers can jump 500 LY so we've had deep space access since possibly as early as the 2230s or before since "Logistical Nightmare" beacon in Beta Hydri is dated 2323 and had fuel scoops (also pretty sure Sirius Corporation has always dealt with Hydrogen and Helium for power and drives since Sol). It isn't a mistake those were called (Rock) Hermits:

her·mit·age
ˈhər-mə-tij
1 a : the habitation of a hermit
b : a secluded residence or private retreat : hideaway
c : monastery
2 : the life or condition of a hermit

synonyms: retreat, refuge, haven, sanctuary, sanctum, asylum, hideaway, hideout, hiding place, shelter, sanctum sanctorum, hidey-hole
