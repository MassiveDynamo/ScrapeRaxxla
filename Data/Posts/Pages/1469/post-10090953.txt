Triangulation completed, the system at the centre of these 3 points is: Scorpii Sector KC-V b2-2.

Note this triangle is not equilateral, also its exact X, Y, Z position is just a ‘nearest system’ match.

When comparing it with the hypothetical John Milton sphere of influence, it does not correlate, being ‘inside’ the sphere when the sphere is set to Achenar.

However, if we set it to Pandemonium, this point falls very close to it!



Totally tin foil, but enjoyable…might be worth a jump over and investigate those systems in that general area.

Somewhere to go at least.

Can I ask what tools you are using? EDDiscovery's map is nice enough but doesn't have tools like this to my knowledge (distance sphere). I am doing research and playing other games until I can play after my surgery (fell and screwed up my shoulder because of prior injury when I was young - IRL I'm in my lower 40s). I therefore have like a week or so of forced break from Elite Dangerous. VR is not easy with a screwed up shoulder.
