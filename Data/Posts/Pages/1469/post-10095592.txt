Interesting that those were not in at the beginning. Though, I'll be honest I have my suspicions that stuff like Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Horizons probes and possibly other stuff was there but FDev gave us ways to find them when we took too long. Like I said, from a pure lore perspective the asteroid bases are centuries old (from at least 2800s for the oldest of them). The first game, I believe did not happen until sometime following August 3174 but before December 31st, 3199.
Ya i remember - was nice to see those brought in. The one in lave changed from an outpost to an asteroid base. Would be cool to have actual rock hermits. I kindof expect the dredger clans to have secret rock hermit basesâ€¦
