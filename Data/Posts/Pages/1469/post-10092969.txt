I’m tooling around this sector (on/off I’m not playing as much as I used to so it’s infrequent) one thing I’ll be looking out for is any other systems with that same first discovered monicker close by...however I doubt this would be used to seed clues.

Early discovery flags weren’t retained initially in gal map so there may be a few Dev avatars out there, but I don’t trust this data as it’s been scrubbed before so likely not particularly accurate, but who knows?
