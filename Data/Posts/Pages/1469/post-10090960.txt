It’s very rough and ready, which suits my needs at present, being on-the-go most of the time, it’s very easy to use. I rattled all this together only this afternoon whilst cooking. All the calculations for mid points and triangulation etc are just undertaken in the Mki Sapien CPU.

I then just tart-it-up a little afterwards with an editor.
