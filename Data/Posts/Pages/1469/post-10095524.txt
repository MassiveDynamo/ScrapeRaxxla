No they weren't in E: D originally, but as mentioned above (with thanks) they were introduced in 2.3. Still no hermits that we are aware of, just space tourist and mining operations etc. The list of systems with them in makes for interesting reading, though. I was surprised to see how many are in the bubble in systems I might not have noticed. I first came across them in the Pleiades (Stargazer in Pleione) and then at various nebulae.
