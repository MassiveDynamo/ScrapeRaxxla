Spiralling Dance of Persephone

Found this sometime ago, whilst looking into Friggs Distaff; Hercules and Queen Omphale.

Touching to see a filament of ancient greek history and of those 'mysteries' survive into the modern area.

Oh course it has no direct relevance to Raxxla, just a nice find.

Currently looking into Kore as Cora circa the Codex. Demeter was described as a ‘wanderer’, was abducted by pirates and liked her tipple; I wonder if she had a vagabonds heart?

Persephone exists as a system in game (as well as a body in Sol) seemingly it might be within a directional alignment with the system Demeter, in relation to a hypothetical in game representation of an underworld. I do wonder what such an alignment may indicate if the reference in the Codex is a clue, towards the story of Persephone and Demeter?

It likely isn’t but I’m just trying not to inflate any mythological references, but look at theses systems relative relationships; does the Codex point to Persephone, does the alignment (if correct and not imaginary) point towards elsewhere?
