Thanks for the answer. I havent even thought about "reverse engineering using a hexeditor". I was more curious about the idea to translate the messages, or parts of the messages into HexCode. Maybe you find something interesting. I did it on my own but i am missing the knowledge to see anything in particular.

Cheers
Ah, ok, I see. If I'm following you correctly you're talking about an additional message concealed in the text of the logs. Not aware of anyone looking for that kind of stuff. @anyone else?

Oh, and just for the avoidance of doubt, I was suggesting that you were talking about using an actual hexeditor. (It just wasn't clear what you actually meant. )
