Ah the Cete. Good topic. The bits of its logs that were intercepted and put out on Galnet, helped inform the prediction that there had been Guardian - Thargoid territorial cross-over. Still some interesting stuff in there too, particularly the disregard for Ram Tah.

Whatâ€™s got you intrigued about them at the moment?

The Cete also fits into the mysterious whale theme that mysteries in ED tend to get little a dash of.

Prof. Palin's first name is Ishmael, same as the main character in Moby-.

Tau Ceti is part of the Raxxla codex. Tau is a symbol for life and resurrection.

We need to find the space whale and bring it back to life.
