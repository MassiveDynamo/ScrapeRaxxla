The Cete also fits into the mysterious whale theme that mysteries in ED tend to get little a dash of.
Yeah, got it all really hasn't it. The name of the ship, the name of the captain, a tale told by one of the crew, a captain who's obsession leads to doom, various other themes in the logs.

And of course the real in-game question of who has seen more clearly - Ram Tah or Melville.

Ram Tah's indulged in a little bit of misrepresentation and propaganda, but was it intentional? How much is Ram Tah's perspective distorted by his research method, which in some aspects at least constitutes 'reading the version of things left by the winners'?

Anyway, I digress...

Prof. Palin's first name is Ishmael, same as the main character in Moby-****.

Tau Ceti is part of the Raxxla codex. Tau is a symbol for life and resurrection.

We need to find the space whale and bring it back to life.
Hmm, I think we may need to find a starglider too.
