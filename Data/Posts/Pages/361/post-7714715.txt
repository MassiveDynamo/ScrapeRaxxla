As far as Gen ships go, The Cete's logs have me intrigued.
Ah the Cete. Good topic. The bits of its logs that were intercepted and put out on Galnet, helped inform the prediction that there had been Guardian - Thargoid territorial cross-over. Still some interesting stuff in there too, particularly the disregard for Ram Tah.

Whatâ€™s got you intrigued about them at the moment?
