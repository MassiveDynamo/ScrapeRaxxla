Hello all! I'm new here but have been following the quest for Raxxla with a lot of interest for some years. I'm personally convinced that the DW must first be located before Raxxla can be found. Besides the many clues introduced with the DW codex entry, I think there's a chance that the current game title screen might hold clues. Although the main menu screen background was obviously composed in an unrealistic manner, I believe it still might refer to an actual location in-game.

A post was made on the ED subreddit concerning the approximate location of the title screen system. One of the comments pointed towards this thread, and linked an image that was posted here (I can't find the actual reply containing the image due to the forum revamp):

Now due to the tone of that comment, and the lack of discussion I found after searching "menu" in this thread, I assume no one was able to guess an approximate location.

However, about 13 hours ago u/Eudu posted these comments on the Reddit thread:

The stars right on top of the image looks like Crux with the N pointing to the left, with a little angle compared to what we see here on Earth South Hemisphere.

I canâ€™t link an image with the stars marked right now. But look at the top of the image: there is five stars which resemble to Crux how we see here in Hueland, with the North star pointing to the left and the South one (Acrux) pointing to right, and the Epsilon Crucis out of position in the center.

Since u/Eudu didn't report his findings here yet I took it upon myself to post them here and credit him/her.

Do you guys think this information will bring us closer to finding an approximate location for the system shown in the game menu? And if yes, what do you think we might find there?
