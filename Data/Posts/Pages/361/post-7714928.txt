The Cete also fits into the mysterious whale theme that mysteries in ED tend to get little a dash of.

Prof. Palin's first name is Ishmael, same as the main character in Moby-****.

Tau Ceti is part of the Raxxla codex. Tau is a symbol for life and resurrection.

We need to find the space whale and bring it back to life.

Maybe we should investigate deeper into Saud Kruger then, given the ships they build.
