1000 pages, 5 years, 20,000 posts and countless theories. Yet, I still can't find a way to accurately describe how incredible this community is. Every day we inch closer to Raxxla. Every theory means something.

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies.

To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void.

The parent's grief, the lover's woe.

And the yearning of our vagabond hearts.

To Raxxla and to 20,000 more posts!
