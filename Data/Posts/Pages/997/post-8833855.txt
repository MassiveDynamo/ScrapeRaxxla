That certainly aligns with my thinking. It's a lot of effort to create those beacons just to point at a Guardian site. I know it's to introduce the guardian tech, as a way to fend of the Thargoids but I still feel like we're missing something about them.

I haven't (and don't know how to) mapped the beacons on a 3d map, but if anyone does know how to could they check to see if there is any Raxxla related shape to their locations perhaps?

Canon seem to produce 3D maps of things, have you checked them out?

Edit: Google is your friend!
