I've been wondering for a while about the badge Charlotte Reynolds wears;

Could the jewel that burns be the Tycho supernova? It was visible in the night sky in November 1572 - about the same time as Astrophel and Stella was written...

I just found out that Tycho has been found already; link is here -

Has anyone been out there recently or been down this particular rabbit hole before?

I've only recently caught the Raxlaa bug again and have started looking back through this thread but it is biiiiig and i've only made it about halfway through so far!!!
