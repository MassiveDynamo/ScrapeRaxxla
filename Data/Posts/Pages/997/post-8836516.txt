Perhaps off topic but this is my take on the current cg.

1) Alliance Grabs any and all meta alloys they possibly can
2) Alliance Ship builder lakon is seeming over extended for no overt reason. (massive R&D project?)
3) Alliance pokes the highly territorial goids right in the eye after direct attacks against humanity seems to have stopped.

With the Feds and Imps at each other's throats they will be unprepared for the goid's inevitable mass retaliation. The Alliance/lakon will very introduce guardian/meta alloy based hull just in time for the alliance to be humanity's savior. The alliance's MO is to be an opportunist picking up the pieces left in the wake of the two other super powers. Now it seems the alliance is willing to use the goids as a tool to crush the imps and feds.

Something like that. There are a lot of Alliance people that have Galcop background. They have not forgotten that the Imp/Fed INRA coalition actively used the Thargoids to break Galcop's back. They would gladly give them a taste of their own medicine.
