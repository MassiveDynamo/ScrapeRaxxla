I seem to remember that the Cassiopeia Project didn’t find what they were looking for, and the FD response was that it wasn’t in the star catalogues they used to feed into Stellar Forge.
That has always seemed a bit suspect to me (though I cant believe they would outright lie about this either), so don’t know what to think. Maybe Raxxla is a Dyson Sphere around a supernova remnant???
If they don't want you to find it they could just delete it and nobody would notice.
