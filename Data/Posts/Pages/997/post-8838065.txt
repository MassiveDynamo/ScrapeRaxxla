I've been wondering for a while about the badge Charlotte Reynolds wears;

I think it looks a lot like Cassiopeia;

Could the jewel that burns be the Tycho supernova? It was visible in the night sky in November 1572 - about the same time as Astrophel and Stella was written...

I just found out that Tycho has been found already; link is here -

Has anyone been out there recently or been down this particular rabbit hole before?

I've only recently caught the Raxlaa bug again and have started looking back through this thread but it is biiiiig and i've only made it about halfway through so far!!!

I seem to remember that the Cassiopeia Project didn’t find what they were looking for, and the FD response was that it wasn’t in the star catalogues they used to feed into Stellar Forge.
That has always seemed a bit suspect to me (though I cant believe they would outright lie about this either), so don’t know what to think. Maybe Raxxla is a Dyson Sphere around a supernova remnant???
