Raxxla has always sounded like an alien name to me, so unless it’s the ‘goid name for their homeworld or a mothership then it might be Guardian. Always felt there was something we were missing about those sites, and their space beacons are definitely overly-fancy for what they (currently) do.

That certainly aligns with my thinking. It's a lot of effort to create those beacons just to point at a Guardian site. I know it's to introduce the guardian tech, as a way to fend of the Thargoids but I still feel like we're missing something about them.

I haven't (and don't know how to) mapped the beacons on a 3d map, but if anyone does know how to could they check to see if there is any Raxxla related shape to their locations perhaps?
