I think the Odyssey update will be necessary for us to even utilise Raxxla. It talks in the description of the Odyssey update that it will "expand the frontiers of known space". Well, going on foot somewhere isn't going to do that. The American Frontier wasn't expanded into because people decided to walk around the places they already knew on foot. I think Odyssey, as the name suggests, is going to herald a journey somewhere new.

I imagine some device only accessible on foot available only to elites (guarded by TDW), only utilised on foot, which takes you to a new galaxy that has a station or two already set up by TDW, through which you can't bring your previous ships and your credits won't be useable. I reckon it'll be essentially a NewGame+ for the elite ranks.
