D'oh! That never actually occurred to me but ofc you're right. But does that mean if you can meet the requirements they remove the class needed from this info or is it still there but in yellow?

Never seen the game on a console. But on PC if the mission is below the line, i.e. missions you’re not qualified to do for some reason, the reason is given-allied/friendly/cordial status not met, or if you have sufficient status then whether you haven’t got the required cabin type. If you meet all the requirements then the mission is above the line and it just states the reward and destination, you have to open and read the description to check the detail.
