On the main passenger mission screen its on the right in Red on XB - Business/Economy etc but havent seen Luxury one to double check. This is on XB.

If it’s like the PC passenger missions screen it’s only red if you can’t meet that requirement. Of the missions I can do I have to open & read the VIP (with a crown) mission description to see if it requires a luxury cabin, some do & others business/first/economy; seems to be no rhyme or reason behind this selection

I’m pursuing this line because TDW are a “group of adventurers, explorers, investigators and treasure-hunters” (codex description). Tourist beacons 216 & 226-22 seem suggestive: Adventurous journeys are run by Astrogator Tours corporation, which were taken over by Saud Kruger (only ships that can carry luxury cabins; luxury passenger missions seem to be rare & under-rewarded so people will tend not to do them- seems a good way to obfuscate the TDW recruitment test). “Astrogator Extreme holidays” carry the image of the legendary explorer Augustus Brenquith. May be FD fluff, or maybe a hint how to befriend TDW? Has anyone seen a mission with a picture of a famous explorer?
A couple of the luxury missions I’ve done yesterday & this morning seem to then chain a secondary long distance trip out to Colonia region; seems like a possibility in a recruitment test for a band of adventurers. But I’ve done that trip a couple of times, it’s tedious & I don’t want to repeat unless I’m more convinced.
