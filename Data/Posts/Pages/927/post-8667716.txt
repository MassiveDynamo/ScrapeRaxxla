I'm beginning to wonder if there should be a hint for Raxxla, or a hunt for the real Dark Wheel, like... Dark Wheel the station.

I'm just assuming that Raxxla is a planet of some sort, and that this planet is hiding a secret. It cant be, by our "modern" standards, too far from home. But neither would the Dark Wheel station.

Supposedly, the station is supposed to be a disused station, orbiting the eighth moon of an unnamed gas giant. The station itself seems to be either a Ocellus or Orbis, running on it's lowest settings, to make it hard to discover.

This station REALLY can't be far, because when the Dark Wheel were being whispered about, we hadn't really travelled far, right?

And I think Raxxla and it's secret can't be too much further, because our knowledge of the stars wouldn't be too far from Sol, so "out in the black" then would be what, at most a couple thousand LY?
