Not an expert but isnt there a secondary light source? Looking at the shadow on the planet on the left and the ground the SRV is on? But I agree with the comment about it probably being just artwork anyway.



How? Theres a lot of people posting about it, Ill point them your way I suspected it was accruing in the background and just not showing but havent made any attempt to prove it.



Me too.



That blooming better well not be the solution Or that guitar pedal or whatever it is even if that is in game somewhere obscure.

Could be a secondary light source. No lighting expert though

FD have fixed the bug in yesterdays update. But I have EDO on my Jorki account, so what I did was check what that was reporting for Jorki’s fed/imp ranks, then close it and run up Horizons, he did a few rep++++ missions, then closed and ran up EDO again. The rank level had increased by a few % points as I’d expect for those missions. So Horizons was calculating rank increase but not displaying it.

The answer clearly is to get something that was made on Raxxla and is therefore quantum entangled with it. I believe Raxxla to be a Guardian Arkship. So try various Guardian artefacts, charge them up (ship’s fusion reactor would probably be best, don’t forget the tinfoil underwear, but lasers or PA might work) and see where they point to.
