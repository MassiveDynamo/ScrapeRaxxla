Here's the YT vid for the EDO training mission. arc cutter use is at 5:54.

The thing I have a real issue with, is that FD will create these nice training sessions, but they are ‘separate’ from the main game.

hahahha Its too early for me - i cant type : )

What I was going to say - is I thought they did a decent job of integrating it - they way the tutorial is introduced is when you first start Odyssey - it automatically loads... and as a flashback sequence. So while you arent going to a "trainer" It is atleast presented in context within the game initially. Its just later if you want to retake them you go to the special training module section.
