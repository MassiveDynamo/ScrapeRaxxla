Sigh. :-(

No new lore in Elite Dangerous Odyssey?
My expectations on this particular topic weren't high and, as far as I've been able to tell from the time I've managed to play in game, very little of the in-game background lore of the universe has been updated/enhanced. The Codex has no new text on the main personalities or the "big" topics...
