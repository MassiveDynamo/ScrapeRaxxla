There is an interview with current community manager Arthur Tolmie where he does directly state when asked ‘where is Raxxla” at the 0:25:00 mark:

AT “It’s there. Clearly it’s there. I’ve said this in another stream, I’ll say it today, it’s been going a longtime. The payoff would have to be great, and that’s all I will say on it”.

The interviewer tries to trick AT with a little psychological game which maybe shows Raxxla is a big deal, not some fluff, but maybe that’s just the interviewer showing his hand, either way it’s not much confirmation.

AT also used the same references around ‘the payoff is going to be great’ concerning the current storyline relating to the Adamastor, which is a slow burner, read that into what you will, but at least we certainly have another FD employee confirming its existence, again it can’t be concluded wherever it’s ‘actually’ in game or narrative driven.

Interestingly AT confirms FD does employ narratives drops in the game, eg someone may have been there 2 weeks prior, but not seen anything, because nothing was there, FD only loaded it up later on... just confirms FD modus operandi is to drip feed narrative.

Im interested to find this ‘other’ stream where AT apparently discusses Raxxla?
