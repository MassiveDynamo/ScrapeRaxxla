What do we know officialy about Raxxla?
1) The Codex
2) The statement from Drew.

The Codex is official but vague to say the least as its written as rumour and myth, the actual statements on video by Michael Brookes and David Braben are official, the statement or any information at all from Drew is NOT official. Its his recounting of a conversation but it hasn't been officially confirmed or repeated.

Mutabalis was written for Oolite iirc and Raxxla is apparently in Oolite coded by fans of Elite but not official. Drew has stated many times that as an author he was told Raxxla was 'off limits' to all authors. So dont go mixing the two up, one is a massive fan (or was) and the other is official. Only official statements can be verified.

The only other official source was a CM on stream saying 'youre looking in the right place' but I personally think he was joking and it was not an 'official' statement as to the whereabouts.

The official statements have been deliberately given as vague non clues with no actual real information. Make of that what you will. The Omphalous Rift is written as discredited in the Codex so it probably isnt that anyway.

Basically we know nothing and thats what Frontier wants, they want it as a myth and legend and the ultimate treasure hunt....at least for now. MB did say something like 'Thats all there is to be revealed at this stage' so there might be more coming at some point. The fun is supposed to be in not knowing and looking for it.
