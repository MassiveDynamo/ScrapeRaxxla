Thanks for your reply, would you mind giving me a link to where I can find that official statement thatRaxxla is in the game?

As above in the OP of this thread. Also in @Jorki Rasalas signature theres a link to Fdev & Frontier videos thats worth watching. One of the biggest problems is theres bits everywhere and some may be related to Raxxla or not and some may be designed to sound like it could be related or may just be on our minds. Theres still plenty to chew on though and try and make sense of.
