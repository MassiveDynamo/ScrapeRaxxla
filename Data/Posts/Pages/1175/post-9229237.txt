The thing I have a real issue with, is that FD will create these nice training sessions, but they are ‘separate’ from the main game.

FD would get so much more attention and praise if they incorporated such training situations into the game directly. For instance enable these as missions accessible through various NPCs, these would be optional, and maybe don’t provide any benefits (to stop farming) except knowledge.

ED has always been seen as a mile wide and an inch deep - right here is a simple trick to bring additional immersion.

Putting them separate is just short sighted in my opinion. An afterthought.

Eg. Cmdr goes to an npc looks at missions, the npc says something like, do you know what your doing? No - well go away, go ask that guy over there he’ll show you the ropes.

It’s optional and of course someone/ FD will eventually load it to YT; sure that negates the whole thing, but still there could be benefits and it can be a spring board for FD the build upon...

Rant over... back onto the main topic...
