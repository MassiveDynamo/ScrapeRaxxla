Unsure what to suggest, but if MB did say that the system has been visited but Raxxla was not detected then clearly Raxxla is not obvious.

It may be disguised as something ordinary with a different name but will exhibit anomalous behaviour when appropriately poked, it may be hidden and undetectable in an asteroid cluster, but worst of all possibilities it could be orbiting in deep space and undetectable unless youâ€™re within short range of it. I am beginning to lean more to that possibility. It makes for boring gameplay (which FD historically seem to mistake for amusement), it involves a long journey, very hard to find....
And at one stage MB did say something like it is worth searching off the ecliptic. I understood this to mean the high value materials that were located out there at the time, but it could also have been a hint to Raxxla!

Good hunting!!

Don't orbital installations not even appear unless you get with 1000 ls with possible exception for detection during FSS scanning the system. Honking and jumping would leave most stuff obscured.
