Careful of when trying to assimilate various historical references from previous titles and records which may no longer be relevant to the current title.

Allen Stroud has alluded that certain lore was incorporated into ED, some potentially I presume as part of the ED official narrative, but equally he alluded that some was simply referenced, to give context.

Also over time it’s apparent different FD members may / may not have dipped into this soup, creating their own links.

Open to interpretation, I don’t wish to advocate what is / isn’t canon (I don’t know either), but I would from my limited knowledge presume much of the ‘obfuscation’ going on in ED narrative, eg nefarious groups controlling news, the Club etc, is potentially a clever trick of FD to sidestep certain plot holes, eg the Thargoid war, and simply put it down to propaganda and counterintelligence, because I do presume much of it is separate.

But it read’s interesting either way, continue, it might lead somewhere.
