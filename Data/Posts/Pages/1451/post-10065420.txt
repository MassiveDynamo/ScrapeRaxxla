Unsure what to suggest, but if MB did say that the system has been visited but Raxxla was not detected then clearly Raxxla is not obvious.

It may be disguised as something ordinary with a different name but will exhibit anomalous behaviour when appropriately poked, it may be hidden and undetectable in an asteroid cluster, but worst of all possibilities it could be orbiting in deep space and undetectable unless you’re within short range of it. I am beginning to lean more to that possibility. It makes for boring gameplay (which FD historically seem to mistake for amusement), it involves a long journey, very hard to find....
And at one stage MB did say something like it is worth searching off the ecliptic. I understood this to mean the high value materials that were located out there at the time, but it could also have been a hint to Raxxla!

Good hunting!!

That quote if ever corroborated might just allude that if someone visited that system, they were not able to detect it simply because they employed the honk and jump behaviour; jumping in, blasts the scanner then leaves, doesn’t even look at the system map and moves on to their destination, or even less doesn’t even apply the scanner…

That to me is the most logical conclusion, something I suspect took FD by surprise and appeared on their awareness as ‘odd new behaviour’ hence why they ‘know why we haven’t found it’. Because we were not following the behaviour they expected of us!

FD had a huge level of depth planned for exploration, which they cast aside for a simpler mechanism; I actually liked the Mki eyeball variant of exploration, when the ultimate range scanner was introduced as standard it got real boring real fast.

I still suspect that is what was being referenced and that Raxxla appears on our scanners ‘now’, if not then it’s a dark object which either appears visually or only when your in close proximity to the POI?
