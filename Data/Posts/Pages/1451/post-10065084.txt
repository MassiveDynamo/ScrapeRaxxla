Well, going on the Toast and Generation ships, this afternoon I’ve flown:
Sol-Nefertem/Thetis-HR 2351/Epimetheus-Charick Drift/Atlas-and approached WD core at 90* to the beams until temperature up to 80% at which I chickened. Then did the WD boost and jumped to Pliny (just because I liked the sound of the system name). Nothing to report!

However I see that interpretation of the Toast leads to Atlas. There is of course a system of that name in the Pleiades, which I’m surprised to see my second account Tyko hasn't visited (Jorki is on extended vacation in Jaques’ bar after the Gravitational Wave Hypothesis trek!). Found a reference that says the Pleiades are spiralling: https://www.insightobservatory.com/2016/08/seven-sisters-stars-spin-in-space.html

Edit: it is interesting that this reference is dated 22 August 2016, whereas the Alleged Toast of the codex was released in Beyond - Chapter Four 11 DEC 3304 (2018); 2 years after the reference so may well have been known by DB who’s into astronomy.

Anybody had a good search of that system? Can’t say I’m interested in endless hyperdictions and potential death by cabbage.But if Raxxla is there it would explain why the Thargoids are so interested in that area. And weren’t the Pleiades significant in the earlier games?
