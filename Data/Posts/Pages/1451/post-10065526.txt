Had another idea. If we assume the Alleged Toast applies to the Generation Ships, and also that the codex’s “Spiralling Stars” is another clue. What do we understand by “Spiralling Stars”? I’ve always interpreted it as NS or WD, hence my focus yesterday on Charick Drift’s WD. Yesterday I found (rediscovered as it seems Rochester ninja’d me on that) the Pleiades cluster stars are spiralling. But in the systems which have gen ships and multiple stars, do those stars “spiral”??
