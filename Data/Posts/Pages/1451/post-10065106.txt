Well, going on the Toast and Generation ships, this afternoon I’ve flown:
Sol-Nefertem/Thetis-HR 2351/Epimetheus-Charick Drift/Atlas-and approached WD core at 90* to the beams until temperature up to 80% at which I chickened. Then did the WD boost and jumped to Pliny (just because I liked the sound of the system name). Nothing to report!

However I see that interpretation of the Toast leads to Atlas. There is of course a system of that name in the Pleiades, which I’m surprised to see my second account Tyko hasn't visited (Jorki is on extended vacation in Jaques’ bar after the Gravitational Wave Hypothesis trek!). Found a reference that says the Pleiades are spiralling: https://www.insightobservatory.com/2016/08/seven-sisters-stars-spin-in-space.html

Anybody had a good search of that system? Can’t say I’m interested in endless hyperdictions and potential death by cabbage.But if Raxxla is there it would explain why the Thargoids are so interested in that area. And wasn’t it significant in the earlier games?

Thought I was the only one to grab at that assumption about the spinning Pleiades!

‘Like cosmic ballet dancers, the stars of the Pleiades cluster are spinning’

The FD fascination with the Seven Sisters, in part I feel might be thanks to Michael Brookes interest in HP Lovecraft, who references them a few times…

But how is Tau Ceti linked to the Pleiades, unless the ‘omphalos’ reference was supposed to link us to Delphi…
