Random thoughts...

From the Dark Wheel:
...black and green flags with bright sunbursts on them, and non-terrestrial ideographs on the sides...

(being very terrestrial i didnt bother trying to come up with ideographs...)

When searching for sunburst flags - while there are many with what can be described as sunbursts - such as the Imperial Japanese flag - there is only one "Sunburst Flag" - an Irish Republican flag with a sunburst on a green background. The sunburst on the flag was meant to relate to the Fianna.

The Fianna were basically bands of young men - hunter/warriors. A right of passage before adulthood - another derivation of the Indo-european Koryos, like the Lupercalia of Rome...

I think its safe to say that the "Dark Wheel" novella is a right of passage story - a young man finding his way and becoming a man. And possibly the Dark Wheel society was to be the physical manifestation of the Koryos in the Elite world.

A slight tangent but i felt worth mentioning... two books which bookend the Dark Wheel novella in time:

SPOILER: TANGENT
