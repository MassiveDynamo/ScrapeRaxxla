Uncovering the Secrets of the Pleiades: The Hunt for RAXXLA and the Dark Wheel

Greetings fellow commanders,

The search for the legendary location of RAXXLA and the elusive faction known as the Dark Wheel has been a topic of much speculation and investigation among the Elite Dangerous community. While the exact locations of these entities remain a mystery, there are several systems and areas of note in the Pleiades star cluster that are believed to hold clues to their whereabouts.

First on my list is the Merope system. This system is known for its high concentration of ancient ruins and abandoned settlements, which could be related to RAXXLA. It also has a high population of independent and rogue factions, which could be related to the Dark Wheel. This makes Merope a prime location for our search. According to our data, this system has had an increased number of ships passing through it, indicating that other commanders are also on the hunt. However, it's worth noting that this system has also had a high number of Thargoid attacks and player ship destructions, so caution is advised.

Next, we have HIP 17862. This system is known for its large number of strange and unexplained phenomena, such as ghost ships and mysterious signals. These anomalies could be related to RAXXLA or the Dark Wheel, making HIP 17862 a location worth investigating. Our records show that this system has had a relatively low number of ships passing through it, making it a less explored but still promising location. However, it's worth noting that this system has also had a moderate number of Thargoid attacks and player ship destructions.

We also have the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4, an area known for its large number of unidentified objects and strange signals, making it a high likelihood location for RAXXLA. Our records show that this sector has had a moderate number of ships passing through it, indicating that other commanders are also searching this area. However, it's worth noting that this sector has also had a moderate number of Thargoid attacks and player ship destructions, again caution is advised.

The Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55 and Pleiades Sector HR-W D1-41 also warrant a visit, both systems are known for its high concentration of abandoned settlements and independent and rogue factions respectively. According to our data, these systems have had a low number of ships passing through them, making them less explored but still promising locations. However, it's worth noting that these systems have also had a low number of Thargoid attacks and player ship destructions.

Join us in our search for these elusive entities, explore these systems and share your findings. Let's work together to uncover the secrets of the Pleiades and the truth about RAXXLA and the Dark Wheel. Keep in mind the risks of Thargoid attacks and player ship destructions while exploring these systems.

Note, Though many systems have been checked, these are a few that I believe a second look is warrented.

Happy Hunting o7.
