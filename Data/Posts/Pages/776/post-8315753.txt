I'm slap bang in the middle between sol and Sirius 4.29ly still have the blue outline circle around my radar. I have dropped, but nothing so far. I'm going to spend the rest of my time in super cruise and search around. will let you know if anything happens. if anything it's one lead I can mark off. I just find it odd with the Blue circle, on planets it's a point of discovery.
