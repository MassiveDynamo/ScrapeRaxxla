Well, we know we have to be Elite to enter this system. It smells strongly as a dependency, like the requirement for joining TDW or finding Raxxla, depending on how we interpret it.
We have missions with Elite requirement ranking's of course. However I tend to lean towards SD is part of the requirement and so I'm a bit less convinced it is linked to a mission or just having the rank by itself.

It could mean we need to look at the hints in light of starting from SD or perhaps this is where we need to hand in any cargo. Look at all the previous treasure hunts for a pattern.
