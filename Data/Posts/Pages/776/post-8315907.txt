What a strange thing to write in the text for PF. Hm, I've been flying around with unclaimed bounties before but the only way you can never claim them is if your ship blows up.
Perhaps that's what they are referring to?
Can try to fly around with bounties for 30 days, but I doubt that has anything to do with it.

On another note, I flew out to the INRA base in HIP 12099 and Jamesons Cobra, grabbed the intel from both places, Returned to SD and slammed the datalogs on the frontdesk of Lori Jameson's reception. Perhaps someone will try to send some more (TDW) merceneries after me. (Highly doubt it)

Just a more interesting option to deliver the intel-data there.

If Lori Jameson is part of TDW then might be a very good tactic! I wish I could remember where the bit about them recruiting Dangerous and Deadly as well as Elite came from.
