this is what I have been going on…

To sol (the jewel) towards Sirius (the whisperer could well be the frame shift drive, Sirius manufacture it). Sirius is 8.59lys away from sol. The siren of the deepest void (a signal or wake if you drop?). The deepest void between sol and Sirius would be half way 4.295lys. fingers crossed one lead to follow.

I’m currently out about 4.45.

One thing I have noticed is that I have an outer blue circle on my radar if that means anything
