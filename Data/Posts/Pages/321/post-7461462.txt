Has anyone maxed out rep with these guys? They are a bit suspicious! I don't have a combat ship and I haven't gotten many donation missions from them yet.

So yeah this was months ago but I was just catching up.

FWIW, yes, I have. Me and a few friends holed up at Ray for a couple months and hunted the crap out of pirates down there. Nothing useful came of it with regard to Raxxla.
