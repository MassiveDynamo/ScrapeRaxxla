The idea that Raxxla is an alien construct wouldnt surprise me if it turns out to be true. What is interesting though is the fact that not a single one of us has found Raxxla. Its the 34th century and somehow with all the modern tech we havent found it yet... But somehow circa 23 century raxxla was found. You have to ask yourself why that is. Could that be because everyone is so quick to leave the bubble? Everything moves so fast now and noone slows down anymore. When is the last time you've spent some serious time scouring planet surfaces in Sol? I am willing to be almost every single one of us has spent more time searching for barnacles than we've spent in sol.

I mean... There was an alien device/object found on Mars. It didn't just pop out of nowhere. Someone was obviously in Sol before humanity had the technology to notice. We found 1 barnacle, then another... then another.. then another... Same with Guardian sites, and brain trees, and anomalies, and ELW, and everything else... Yet there has only been 1 alien device/object found in sol and because it was found in the 23rd century we just forget about it. Hell there is even a beacon saying "Hey guys... Look over here".
