My Paint says TDW symbol form the Codex has 3 triangles - north, center, bottom.

I hereby express my enormous rage because an artist misaligned right part of guardian key drop-point for 20 pixels to the left, to inadvertently delude us from figuring out Pilots Federation manipulations over mankind by using Raxxla future tech from the past!
