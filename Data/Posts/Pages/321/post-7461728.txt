Probably nothing but I was going through (on the galmap) the stars of Cassiopeia. Rho Cassiopeia is a G Class White Yellow Super Giant. It is logged in EDSM as a G class white yellow super giant. Seen posts from people who have made the jumps to it and say itâ€™s a G class white yellow super giant. BUT, now, according to the galmap, Rho Cassiopeia is now an F Class White Supergiant. ?????
