Raxxla

The idea that Raxxla is an alien construct wouldnt surprise me if it turns out to be true. What is interesting though is the fact that not a single one of us has found Raxxla. Its the 34th century and somehow with all the modern tech we havent found it yet... But somehow circa 23 century raxxla was found. You have to ask yourself why that is. Could that be because everyone is so quick to leave the bubble? Everything moves so fast now and noone slows down anymore. When is the last time you've spent some serious time scouring planet surfaces in Sol? I am willing to bet almost every single one of us has spent more time searching for barnacles than we've spent in sol.
