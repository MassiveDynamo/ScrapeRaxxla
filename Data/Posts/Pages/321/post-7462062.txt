G'day CMDRs,I've been catching up on this thread but I was hoping someone could bring me up to speed, as the thread is pretty big. Direct message if you don't want to clog up the thread, but essentially I'm doing more exploration than anything else these days and have always eye'd off this Raxxla thread from afar. What I'd simply like is a breakdown of were we're at with finding Raxxla, to help direct me on where to explore. Is there a certain, I don't know, navigational direction from the bubble, or sector that hints have lead to that I could follow to whatever is the current theory? I just figure as I learn a bit more about Raxxla, I would like to include it as part of my exploration

1) there are no clues
1a). (Codex entries for Dark Wheel & Raxxla appear to be more fd misdirection, but some have faith that they are clues)
2) there is much speculation
2a) (there is also much mythology)
3) there are as many hypotheses as players
4) actually there are probably more hypotheses than players
5) there is no concensus on any hypothesis or set thereof

Good luck in your Quest. Let us know if you find anything!

PS. We are always happy to discuss hypotheses!
PPS. We are even happier when someone presents some evidence!
