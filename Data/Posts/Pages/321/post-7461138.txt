This is what Raxxla or the Omphalos Rift may look like, based on the thumbnail displayed in the Codex.

Good work.

My final opinion is that the Raxxla symbol depicts very long hexagonal segmented prism that is either portal (artificial wormhole)
or a tunnel into Dyson sphere (some details hints the later one).
Dotted inner hexagon depicts one of the many stages (tunnel parts). Dot in the middle hints height.
In simple words - imagine standing in a lift, you are going down while looking at the glass floor.

There is some math behind but it is irrelevant for the story.
