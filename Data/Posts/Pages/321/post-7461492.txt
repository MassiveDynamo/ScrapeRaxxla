Just my opinion and, honestly based on little evidence. If you’re going to the void, which I’ve considered myself so who knows I might bump into you, I’d think looking specifically for triple star systems may be of help. The reason being if we look at TDW symbol, and use the center to line up with the Core region (they’re the same shape) the three orbs seem to be in the void region. I figure the three orbs might be three stars.
I will also look out for systems with six barycentric stars, especially if they have only one planet orbiting all of them, as I think it's possible the Raxxla symbol may be the description of a system in Guardian format. Sadly my post here ( https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...rch-Division?p=7328463&viewfull=1#post7328463 ) failed to get a confirmation, so I might have misinterpreted it.

I won't be setting out just yet and am likely to stop by Colonia on my way out there, maybe this weekend or next. Depending on which ship I use (Python, AspX or DBX) I may also need to do some minor engineering.
