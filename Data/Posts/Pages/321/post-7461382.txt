I mean... There was an alien device/object found on Mars. It didn't just pop out of nowhere. Someone was obviously in Sol before humanity had the technology to notice. We found 1 barnacle, then another... then another.. then another... Same with Guardian sites, and brain trees, and anomalies, and ELW, and everything else... Yet there has only been 1 alien device/object found in sol and because it was found in the 23rd century we just forget about it. Hell there is even a beacon saying "Hey guys... Look over here".
When you say 'we' here... who's the 'we'?

And how sure are you that there's actually only been the 1?
