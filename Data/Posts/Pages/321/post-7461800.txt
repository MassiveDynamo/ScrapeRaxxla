G'day CMDRs,I've been catching up on this thread but I was hoping someone could bring me up to speed, as the thread is pretty big. Direct message if you don't want to clog up the thread, but essentially I'm doing more exploration than anything else these days and have always eye'd off this Raxxla thread from afar. What I'd simply like is a breakdown of were we're at with finding Raxxla, to help direct me on where to explore. Is there a certain, I don't know, navigational direction from the bubble, or sector that hints have lead to that I could follow to whatever is the current theory? I just figure as I learn a bit more about Raxxla, I would like to include it as part of my exploration
