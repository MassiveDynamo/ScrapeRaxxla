dunno, i left the wing the guy mentions (i colored it out out of respect for him and the remaining members of the dying or dead wing) before they got added to the canonn chat. that being said, the other name i crossed out (despite being a really crabby person) is credible in my eyes. an admin on one of the main ED Facebook groups. If i can weasle any more info out of my source i will. He was my mentor when i first started flying, nearly 4500 in game hours ago, and knows more about xenobiology and lore than any other commander ive come across. I'd say that i have a pretty solid grasp on the lore myself, but Raxxla always has been a mystery. The tales i heard abiout Raxxla early into my ED career honestly kept me coming back. never been much of an explorer, but im slowly building an explorconda and when she's done i will actively join the search. until then i just keep an ear/eye out for any scrap i can find, and this tidbit he told him got me hot again.
