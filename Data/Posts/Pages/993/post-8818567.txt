List of comfirmed and suspected rogues

Perhaps this list would be a good place to start? Some, according to the list, are quite close to Sol. I'm not entirely sure how one might go about it, as I doubt any of these will show up in a Galmap search (haven't tried yet...will do within the hour).

Since I'm going to be doing some bouncing around in my DBX, I'll check out some of the systems @Jorki Rasalas posted above in relation to Halsey.
See also the catalog at http://exoplanet.eu/ which includes detection method used, confirmed (or not), etc
