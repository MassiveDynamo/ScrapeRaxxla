I’m still trying to find details of the unscheduled diversion “unnamed for security reasons”. The Wiki (https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_One) has a useful summary of the events timeline. There’s a post (https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/0c300d048550511dd1b7f24b1a1ab80edb567099) about 78 Ursae Majoris which says the visit there was strange, there had been unrest there until quite recently and Halsey wasn’t welcome. The post (https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/fbfb919f69da401c72e062a8165c8e6fcc348180) of 06 May 3301 gives 10 of the destinations and says another dozen were expected to be added.

Cant find anything so far about the secret diversion, other than (26 MAY 3301) the destruction occured shortly after start of the jump to Azaleach which was unscheduled.

Edit: just did another search. Someone on the forum pointed out that “The accident happened shortly after halsey met Mahon, after which she announced a deviation from the planned route.” Seems likely that meeting was relevant.

I don't think there was anything else on Galnet. The plan was to go to Saga. The report of the detour to Azaleach, came after SS1 went missing.
