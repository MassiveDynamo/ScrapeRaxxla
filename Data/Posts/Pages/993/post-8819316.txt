That XX system reference is very strange! I don’t think it’s in reference to Azaleach because that mission is being provided in Azaleach itself, and it said XX was located 75ly from that location. There’s a lot of secrecy still surrounding this whole thing. I never knew she met with Mahon. Maybe he imparted her with information to help save her presidency and all she had to do was jump to a certain system, one that Hudson and the Club wanted to stop her from getting to.
If i remember correctly, the system turned out to be Furuhjelm I-645. Now we only need to find system RA and system LA.
