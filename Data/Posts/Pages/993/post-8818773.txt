Report from Tyko:
At Goliath's Rest & refuelled at local NS. Carbon star is the jewel that burns...
Ships's camera working again, thankfully because the view is magnificent.
Looked into the Abyss, it looked back & stuck its tongue out at me! There are a few bright stars above me, but I think no return journey

SWOALS HG-Y F11 is a BH 263ly away but no NS for return journey, If Raxxla is a one-way trip forget it! I may be old but I ain't ready for euthansia just yet thank you, too much good Lavian brandy remains in the vat! MMmm-though could be a good hiding place for Raxxla-a one-way BH after a one-way jump!! Not going to try it though. Maybe someone with an FC might care to check this one out?
SWOALS BA-A is quite bright, has OO, B0, B0, but is 261 ly away, ditto!

Wondering where to go next...
