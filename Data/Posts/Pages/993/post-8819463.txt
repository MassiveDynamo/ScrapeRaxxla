That XX system reference is very strange! I don’t think it’s in reference to Azaleach because that mission is being provided in Azaleach itself, and it said XX was located 75ly from that location. There’s a lot of secrecy still surrounding this whole thing. I never knew she met with Mahon. Maybe he imparted her with information to help save her presidency and all she had to do was jump to a certain system, one that Hudson and the Club wanted to stop her from getting to.
I think the last-reported system XX 75 ly from Azaleach would have been an interim stop. 78 Ursae Majoris to Azaleach is 112.19ly, & I assume Starship One would have had a jump range of about 20ly? So several jumps would have been needed.

Edit: and the planned systems after 78 Ursae Majoris were Su, then Furuhjlem I-645 then Saga & we know she didnt reach there. The question outstanding - is Furuhjlem I-645 enroute from 78 Urs Maj to Azaleach?
