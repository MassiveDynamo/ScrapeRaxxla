I don’t disagree with you and you’re most likely right but I also don’t believe everything Galnet tells me. The current relics are sold by Garry’s Reclamations, the Phekda ones were supposedly sold by Gallagher’s Restorations. Weird similarity in the sellers naming convention in my opinion and my brain is searching for patterns that might not exist.

It’s just something I noticed while searching that area. I don’t think it’s anything significant but we probably won’t know for certain unless a big discovery is made.

There are hints in the galnet posts of the time that aliens are involved somehow in the disappearance of Starship One. These are worded as crackpot theories, however I suspect there is some aspect of aliens that is relevant just from the proximity of relevant posts in the timeline. We know Fed military convoys were retrieving UA for some purpose, Halsey was murdered by Admiral Vincent so maybe the Military arm was keeping the Executive arm in the dark about this (& possibly other alien-related activities-where did the Black Flight originate?). So the mention of Phekda and hence relationship with “alien artefacts” may be meaningful. The trouble is that we have no way of putting more meat onto these bones. Vague hints is all we get, with many possible interpretations.
