But its saying the phekda ones turned out to be fakes. Still, its naming a system for the sake of naming a system. It could easily have led to more
I don’t disagree with you and you’re most likely right but I also don’t believe everything Galnet tells me. The current relics are sold by Garry’s Reclamations, the Phekda ones were supposedly sold by Gallagher’s Restorations. Weird similarity in the sellers naming convention in my opinion and my brain is searching for patterns that might not exist.

It’s just something I noticed while searching that area. I don’t think it’s anything significant but we probably won’t know for certain unless a big discovery is made.
