Something I noticed that may have no bearing on the mystery but is still interesting...

Ngurii is noted for having Soontill Relics and being located somewhat close to Soontill. Phekda had a similar auction of alien relics that left people upset some time ago. Phekda is pretty close to the area of Starship One's disappearance. Probably mere coincidence.
