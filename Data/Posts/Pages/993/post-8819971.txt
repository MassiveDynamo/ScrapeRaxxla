maybe I take wishful thinking, but nevertheless, flying into the station, I noticed such a thing, right in front of me was a certain outline of the Raxxla emblem, maybe we are looking for a certain spaceport?
I have a request to all when flying into the spaceport, pay attention to what is ahead of you.
thx all
