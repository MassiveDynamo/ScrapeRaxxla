Great work with the sound analyses!

We should look for three systems that are as close as possible to being on the same vector. This way we can see if the sound changes, when we jump through a system.
If systems A, B and C are on a line we jump from system A to system C passing through system B on the way.

Per Codex, Raxxla is a definite place. It should have coordinates. Passing close enough, may trigger something.

Edit: Orerve <-> Diso with Leesti in the middle, aligns quite well. It's not that much flying to make it perfect.

Great idea, I've added that to the list.
