SPOILER: MANUAL FRONT COVER


Here's one for the "little bit obvious" crowd.
The letters V, H, G, R, A. Can be read on the manual's cover. Putting aside futuristic marital aids, a map?
This occurred to me as a joke, but I still feel I must post.
There is also an M (above the Sidewinder's top view, crossed by the outer circle) and what appears to be a partially obscured letter (by the last E in "ELITE").
