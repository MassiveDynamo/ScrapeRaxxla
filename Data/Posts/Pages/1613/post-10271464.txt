I'm just astounded that this work hasn't been done! Great effort!
I'm sure someone has at some point, but if they didn't post it, or only to a private group we'll never know, sadly.

A thought occurred to me: does legacy have the old witch space sequence in it still? If so work will need doing to capture that audio - maybe there are clues in how they changed it, if only mechanical ones.
I might be able to tell from the Youtube videos!
