Great work Louis Calvert! o7
Regarding visual differences in hyperspace jumps, I have noticed some slight differences in the 'clouds' within the tunnel, in particular the amount and colours present, between the Bubble and more distant regions (>5 KLY or so). It is subtle but I think there are more green clouds near the Bubble and more clouds in general. I have not recorded distant jumps to properly check, though - I do not think each jump is identical regarding the clouds. There are background features that are the same and a couple of them look a bit like the Andromeda and Triangulum galaxies, to my eye (they always appear at about the 11 o'clock position a little outside the centre of the tunnel).
Whether the audio is different in different (named) regions of the Galaxy is harder to say - I've done a dozen or so runs to Sagittarius A* this year and did not notice any difference in the audio (in fairness I was so busy focusing on the procedure for the next system that even visual differences could have slipped by unnoticed).
