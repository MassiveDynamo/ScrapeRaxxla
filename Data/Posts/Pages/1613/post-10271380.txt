I can sort of hear what you say... but I wouldn't say it's a breath sound as there's other frequencies being played too.... just noise that you might interpret as a breath.... I guess playing blind to someone or two and ask them what they can hear would be a test...

I've listened to the racket planets play in FSS and convinced myself there's voices in them.... looking for something that might not be there? ;-)

and have you tried slowing it down?
Yes and I'm fully cognisant that my brain is probably interpreting it as a familiar sound rather than just a cyclical surge of noise.
I made a pitched-down version of the file while I was experimenting with it.... it has a very aquatic sound to it

Regardless of whether it's a breath or not, the way the 'breath' sound appears in phases (with a few exceptions in the lower frequencies) makes me wonder about the nature of the signal's output. Assuming this signal is somehow linked to Raxxla, and assuming the signal does not vary elsewhere, then I do see a very tenuous parallel with the Raxxla symbol.


There appear to be 6 intervals within the signal. Perhaps this coincides with the 6 radiating 'arms' of the codex logo? as though emanating from within this object?

The only problem being the sound phases are not spaced regularly apart, so if Raxxla is a rotating object, then it would have to be irregular in some way to align with the signal.
Understandably given it's source location this also contradicts the other theories of it being closer to the Sol bubble, but hopefully the expedition team will find whatever is producing this signal at some point
