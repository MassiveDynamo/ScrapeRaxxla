I had a quick look just for you - from the few I've checked there's nothing that I would consider to be significant in the spectrograph, so far...

In the images below, the thin vertical pink bars you can see (look a bit like rain streaks to me) are the "fly-by whisps", the things that you can hear quite clearly going 'few.. few...few few, few...few' as you travel. The slightly thicker areas of "pink static" is the 'ghostly sighing' as it changes in volume. The yellow at the bottom is the "Wind-rush-groaning" sound.








to the raw audacity file for anyone that wants to have a play too I've been labelling every track so if there is an anomaly in there you can tell where it happened. The list in is the same order as the recordings in the audacity file.

It would be great if more people wanted to check out these recordings, more heads the better

Great work with the sound analyses!

We should look for three systems that are as close as possible to being on the same vector. This way we can see if the sound changes, when we jump through a system.
If systems A, B and C are on a line we jump from system A to system C passing through system B on the way.

Per Codex, Raxxla is a definite place. It should have coordinates. Passing close enough, may trigger something.

Edit: Orerve <-> Diso with Leesti in the middle, aligns quite well. It's not that much flying to make it perfect.
