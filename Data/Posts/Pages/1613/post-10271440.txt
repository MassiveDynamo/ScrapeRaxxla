Now who can do a similar analysis on the graphical elements of the jump...?
That would be awesome!... I think it would be much harder to spot anomalies visually though, it's easy with a waveform or spectrograph to see if something weird.

And the jump sequence has changed over the years.... I wonder if there's any elements they kept in there like some of the background stars that might be a clue....

And no doubt the audio would have changed, I wonder if there's any value in analysing old YouTube vids' audio?

Just a thought
It's a good idea! I'll give it a go, not sure if YouTubes compression might cause issues, but won't know until we try Good thinking!!
