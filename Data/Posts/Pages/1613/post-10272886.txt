I absolutely don't want to discount any possible avenue of research because they are all valid, but in that context, we have to acknowledge Fdev does update/change things, and without any confirmation either way directly from the dev team, we cannot assume (or discount) the same original game mechanic/requirement is still being used now to access Raxxla as it was (potentially) at game launch.

Just as an example, Horizons. when they finally pushed that to all users, maybe it was because the game mechanics to access Raxxla were changed and now required something in the Horizons update.
Or, when the missions about SAP8 cores ect were removed, and they were the best lead we had at that time...

There are a bunch of other examples, never mind Odyssey as well, but suffice it to say, we cannot assume that the activation/discovery process has not "evolved" since launch and that newer items/mechanics could be required...


Also, I still have a theory that Raxxla actually moves. I've had people jump down my throat previously for even suggesting that, saying it wasn't possible, but now, after the Thargoid mothership things moved thru the galaxy, I'm even more convinced that Raxxla is on some predetermined "path" or "circuit" between set stars, only being at each star for a limited duration of specific time before moving to the next star, likely always at a far far distance from any objects in those systems so as not to disturb orbits (or its the size of the thargoid motherships or smaller and just doesn't effects orbits as it passes), and that to be able to find it, and be a repeatable process, requires finding and understanding that path, or simply stumbling upon it (which would be unlikely, assuming Raxxla won't show up on FSS/system map as Raxxla (FSS wasn't in-game at launch anyways))...
I also think if Raxxla is Guardian in nature, that this would be one of the ways they would choose to hide it, so that even if stumbled upon once by someone (an enemy), it would not be there when/if they returned....
but again, just a theory and no good idea of where to even start...
