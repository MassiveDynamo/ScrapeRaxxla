Following up on Investigation #1
I'm just astounded that this work hasn't been done! Great effort!
A thought occurred to me: does legacy have the old witch space sequence in it still? If so work will need doing to capture that audio - maybe there are clues in how they changed it, if only mechanical ones.
I was a bit unimpressed by the change - some people said it was better so I shrugged and thought nothing of it.

What would be hugely helpful here is a distributable tool which can automatically track the audio of your jump and tell you if you've encountered something unusual. Imagine that! 9 years in!
