Thing is though there has been clues. The codex entries are clues, DB comments are clues "we dont know what it is" etc.

Personally I hope it isn't in the game as it stands now, I couldn't imagine anything as anti climactic as it being a earth like with some lights on the back of it.
I think it is in the game personally. I believe DB even said that it is in game and FDEV knows where it is. But like the Zurara which was originally just a mangled Anaconda they kept its location really hard to just stumble across or even actively find until they had it as they wanted it. I do think it’s possible to find it, but until they can put on a real show with it they’re gonna keep it really hard to find or get to.
with atmospherics and whatnot coming and all that I think with the years they’ve had to mull it over and get things right they’re probably near ready to make it a little easier to find. Still really hard I hope, don’t want it handed to us on a platter like they did with the Rift, but something to go on to pull the thread a bit. I think them adding a codex entry for it and all that indicates they’re getting pretty confident in what they have to offer for raxxla near future.

Since you brought up the guardians tho I really can’t help but notice how similar the design features of the ruins are to the raxxla symbol. Could be, perhaps, that Raxxla is the guardian home world that expedition was trying to find and the symbol is the shape of the ruin or civilization there? And why green? Doubt they picked the color just because it looked cool.
