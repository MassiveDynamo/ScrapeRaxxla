Unrelated but I just noticed the name. You and Guru are always like 3 steps ahead of me every time I get an idea to look at an area, I arrive and the planets are all “first mapped my Mattius” or “first mapped by Guru951”. You guys have got some light years under your seats

Well what can I say, get yourself a faulcon delacy...
