Honestly the phantom moves better is tougher and can go further

The placeholder thing could well be the case, but having totally new assets to flesh out a mythical world would be a million times better. It stops people from being upset I guess.

The guardian story is quite obviously unfinished, they would be foolish to leave it as it is and I do personally believe that we will be seeing the Guardian AI make an appearance in some way.

Got high Hope's for oddessy anyway. So far what I have seen has been great.

Ah, but I don’t think anywhere in the Codex it says that Raxxla is a world/planet! that’s a hangover from Holdstock’s original novella. Codex (only canon lore we can currently rely on other than tourist beacons) just says it’s “a mysterious place....with a mystical secret”, with a hint that the “Omphalos Rift alien artefact” could be a gateway (but since it’s been in-game since before Horizons it can’t be a planetary surface feature, so it must be either within Raxxla or orbiting it). And since FD have said several times there’s only one galaxy implemented in-game then it must be a gateway either to elsewhere in the Milky Way, or to a virtual world (not saying Guardian AI )). “But you don’t know what it is” (DBraben), so Raxxla could be any astronomical object implemented with special properties to provide an fsd jump point. I’m still inclined towards a BH! When I started playing BH didn’t have exclusion zones, you entered but got nowhere. Then FD introduced exclusion zones-must be a reason!

The Codex Raxxla logo could be a pictorial representation of the Omphalos, or it could be a map!
