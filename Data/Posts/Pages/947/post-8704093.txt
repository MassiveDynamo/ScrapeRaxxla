If the occupy different universes then by definition ours is alien to them so the gateway could be one way, to ours.

I've seen them at B class stars, t Tauri's and o classes. I've listened to people tell me they are planetary nebula while I was sat in one with only a neutron star. With the "little bit obvious" MB comment, I wonder what these funny little jewels actually are.

What they are supposed to be or represent may not be the same as what they appear to be. Many stars and star types and things are mis-identified in the black. Even when there is supposed to ELW for story reasons, there arent any, probably a bug but never rectified. I still say graphics first, bug second, oversight third. Ive looked at my skybox and looked at EDSM and just sighed at times. And thats supposed to be there.

Thing is though there has been clues. The codex entries are clues, DB comments are clues "we dont know what it is" etc.

Personally I hope it isn't in the game as it stands now, I couldn't imagine anything as anti climactic as it being a earth like with some lights on the back of it.

Tinfoil says 'there will be no clues' is future tense and doesnt exclude 'there are already clues'. It does imply not though, does imply its not part of any other story whatsoever, it is its own thing and finding it is the story.

Been to them they are amazing places for pics. Thing is though the halo glow around certain stars in the map is not exclusive to systems that have a planetary nebula. There is not one star or system type that these kind of objects only exist at.

I submitted a bug report of one compared to EDSM pics, got nowhere. Could try asking support what they are supposed to be if anything, if supposed to be one thing or not. Or just a stage of star that sometimes creates nebula?
