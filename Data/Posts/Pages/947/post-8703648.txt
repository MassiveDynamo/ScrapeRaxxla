A planetary nebula is not formed like other types of nebula such as the Pleiades, Bubble, etc:
“A planetary nebula is created when a star blows off its outer layers after it has run out of fuel to burn. These outer layers of gas expand into space, forming a nebula which is often the shape of a ring or bubble.”
Ask an Astronomer
What is a planetary nebula?

A star could produce a planetary nebula as part of its death throes before collapsing to form a BH or WD. Or it could continue to burn as a conventional star, but slimmed down a bit. Wish I could do the same to get rid of this Covid waistline!

I got my first Elite badge, Exploration, in a 26ly Cobra. But I now prefer my 60ly armed Phantom for everyday use.

Been to them they are amazing places for pics. Thing is though the halo glow around certain stars in the map is not exclusive to systems that have a planetary nebula. There is not one star or system type that these kind of objects only exist at.

The shorter range jumps let you scan an area in more detail as your not missing chunks out. However they are horrendous when your hiking to far flung places. I got my first elite badge in an aspx. Loved that ship...
