Since you brought up the guardians tho I really canâ€™t help but notice how similar the design features of the ruins are to the raxxla symbol. Could be, perhaps, that Raxxla is the guardian home world that expedition was trying to find and the symbol is the shape of the ruin or civilization there?

Future Alien Theorists says: Yes!

Raxxla symbol = Ophtalmos = Eye = Jewel in the crown
