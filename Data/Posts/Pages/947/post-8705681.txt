the Thargoids threat was due to “come across the Formidine Rift” ( early, now retconned so no longer canon, book reference)

I havent read the books, which one was that? Just curious as Zuara et al & HF & Conflux was placed early / beginning in a 180 degree arc away from the Thargs in the PS, which means it had changed by that time already doesnt it? Retconned between the books and the initial game? Was there time? IF yes it fills in quite a few gaps all over the place and puts a timestamp on the ongoing retcon from 'Elite - FFE' to 'The Novels' to 'ED' (to possibly wherever we are now or may be going back to the original ED but after the Novels if that was the final plan just waiting for the game to catch up to move it forwards)
