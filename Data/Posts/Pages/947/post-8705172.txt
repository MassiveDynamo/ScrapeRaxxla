What? Right now? Are you aware of the Turning The Wheel thread / forum community goal? We are trying to push DW to Sol & Lave and could do without the anti-DW effort right now if thats not too much to ask? If you havent seen it join us and try this later maybe? There are rumours that something may happen. (or at least that fdev may be aware of it, the rest is hope and the video got lost so we cant see exactly what was said - Obfuscation in the outer rim)

If not no worries, gotta blaze your own trail
Hey @Vetinari, no I wasn't aware, been out of it for a bit! Aside from an occasional post in here and review of TDW / Raxxla hunting I usually stay away from the forums and just enjoy the game.

Sounds like an interesting plan though, and I can certainly hold off for a bit. I don't get a huge amount of game-time at the moment so doubt I'd influence much anyway. But happy to do the Ram Tah missions and come back to becoming an enemy of TDW in SD.

Thanks for letting me know!

/ Ra
