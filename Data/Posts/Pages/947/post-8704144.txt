I suspect that RAXXLA isn't anywhere in the sense that it's an actual place. More in the line of it as being some kind of hollodeck, like in Star Trek. Maybe some kind of Guardian structure in which a player needs an alien artefact to active. Like a place that isn't a place, etc. etc.
This structure may have already been found by players but they haven't a clue of what they have stumbled across, except maybe it's just a Guardian structure. The Jameson miss jump could have possibly been to the planet where this Guardian structure is.
