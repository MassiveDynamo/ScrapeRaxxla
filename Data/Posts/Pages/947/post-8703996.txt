Ah, but I don’t think anywhere in the Codex it says that Raxxla is a world/planet! that’s a hangover from Holdstock’s original novella. Codex (only canon lore we can currently rely on other than tourist beacons) just says it’s “a mysterious place....with a mystical secret”, with a hint that the “Omphalos Rift alien artefact” could be a gateway (but since it’s been in-game since before Horizons it can’t be a planetary surface feature, so it must be either within Raxxla or orbiting it). And since FD have said several times there’s only one galaxy implemented in-game then it must be a gateway either to elsewhere in the Milky Way, or to a virtual world (not saying Guardian AI )). “But you don’t know what it is” (DBraben), so Raxxla could be any astronomical object implemented with special properties to provide an fsd jump point. I’m still inclined towards a BH! When I started playing BH didn’t have exclusion zones, you entered but got nowhere. Then FD introduced exclusion zones-must be a reason!

The Codex Raxxla logo could be a pictorial representation of the Omphalos, or it could be a map!

Rafe Zetter described: "an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes". In the Codex the wording is changed to 'alien artefac' and 'parallel universes'.

Not much difference, I think. The codex is perhaps even clearer than Rafe, in suggesting the gateway is not to another location in our universe?

Both hyperspace and the guardian monolith network comes to mind as possible other / parallel universes.
