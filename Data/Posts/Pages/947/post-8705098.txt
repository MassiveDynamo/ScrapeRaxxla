hyperspace is a universe in of itself.. A dimension that has size and volume much like our own normal universe. Thargoids have the ability to not just temporarily traverse hyperspace in narrow corridors, but to not move in hyperspace as well as really travel in it.

It stands to reason that other things can exist in hyperspace. Especially artificial things put there by civilizations perhaps even much older than the guardians.

The idea that only one galaxy exists can still be true. The idea that raxxla is in the game can still be true. It's just something that exists in hyperspace and could easily be hidden from access by making a player have to enter hyperspace from a particular point with a particular destination.

Though, i still think it's something hidden in a roid field or the remnants of raxxla is the roid field.
