Vague memories of an early vid of DB saying something like 'Its like nothing else in game and you will know it if you find it' or words to that effect. Im of the opinion that like Zuara it has been upgraded / updated as time went on but no evidence at all for that.

Jorki has a thread going with a video archive of mainly DB not on Frontier YT. Just a reminder if we find any in future to add them there, would have been easy then to say in this vid here...

Jameson I cant work out if his location now is in any way a pointer to Tharg space, or is it all them crashed Thargs in the PS and WHN, is that where he attacked?

The thread (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/fdev-ed-relevant-quotes-videos.553526/#post-8671776) I started is for any vid (or other official source or original rumour reference) related to E D mysteries. Please post Twitch or YT vid links or anything else there, but strip off the preceding “https:\\” so the link is embedded without all the graphical stuff that this forum software imposes and which makes page refresh problematic. The link can still be clicked and it will open up the reference.

@Macros- perhaps a link to that thread in the op of this?

I suspect Jameson’s wreck was placed early when (I suspect) the Thargoids threat was due to “come across the Formidine Rift” ( early, now retconned so no longer canon, book reference) & presumably from Bovomit. It’s location could make sense in that context.
