Been to them they are amazing places for pics. Thing is though the halo glow around certain stars in the map is not exclusive to systems that have a planetary nebula. There is not one star or system type that these kind of objects only exist at.

The shorter range jumps let you scan an area in more detail as your not missing chunks out. However they are horrendous when your hiking to far flung places. I got my first elite badge in an aspx. Loved that ship...

If not planetary nebula could be local dust clouds. Some stars are extremely dirty!
