How does one contact FD Support without going throughnthe useless process of raising a bug report?

Ive done a search on “Sima Kalhana” and FD have done it again- released Galnet ”a retrospective of 3308 (part two)” but without yet releasing part one!

Doh FD, xmas hangovers clearly still lingering!!
