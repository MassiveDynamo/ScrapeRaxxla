So. probably we are dealing with Scouts at first and have seen progressive escalation...

On the more directly related to Raxxla front, all indications are that Thargoids are if not natives to Witchspace itself are pretty damn capable of manipulation of it to maximize the effectiveness of their jumps (up to and including militarization of these same abilities). So, why would a species that can at will manipulate the fabric of space/time build much of anything especially if ammonia gas giants serve as temporary bases when this side of Witchspace? Even surface sites for Thargoids looks like crashed ships and similar. The only species that we have seen (remnants of) that would need infrastructure is the Guardians. They were social and built communities. They also had the monolith network for sharing information much like Pilots' Federation shared infrastructure. 2296 is damn early so what did we stumble on that some species built that would have been useful? Humans don't get stations until much later when hyperspace becomes commercially available. I suppose the other possibility is a natural phenomena that was harnessed in some fashion. For it to be important, it had to have some important utility.
