a taste for Thargoid bashing
Sadly, this pretty much excludes me as I am solidly in the Thargoid peace camp and convinced we are presently making matters far worse for ourselves. Look, I don't want the Bubble to burn but we at least partly brought this on ourselves. That and recent investigations into the type of systems that are Soontill and Polaris haven't exactly helped ease the feeling something is significantly "off" with what we are told vs what we see.

I'm happy to help in other areas but I don't bash Thargoids. One other note, the "octagonal starships" as they were described in "Galactic News: The Thargoids" makes it sound like those were either scouts or a separate species entirely (based on early observations) This just doesn't scream Thargoid mothership(s). Hard, sharp lines aren't really the design aesthetic we see with our flowery star brethren. Does anyone know for certain the exact number of sides to a Thargoid Scout?
