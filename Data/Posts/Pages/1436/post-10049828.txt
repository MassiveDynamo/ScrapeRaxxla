Yes, I know what you mean! Testing this hypothesis needs the SD permit and a taste for Thargoid bashing by someone who hasnt achieved Allied with PF through the latter as yet. Must be someone close to that point with all the Thargoid War effort.....

Edit
Perhaps it would be clearer to say that if anyone participating in the Thargoid War effort gets a message saying they are now Allied with PilotsFederation then PLEASE TELL US and show the screenshot so we can be sure of the spelling. In addition we also need to know whether you’re already allied with Pilot’s Federation Local Branch in Shinrarta Dezhra.
