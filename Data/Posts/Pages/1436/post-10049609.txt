Retrospective part one was released, I read it, it was a couple of days ago. It's just a case of (for whatever reason) it's not appearing on the archives. I'm sure they'll fix it soon

I know you can't see my replies Jorki but I'd be really interested to know what you mean by:

There is no in-game confirmation that TDW (& their hidden space station) exist, it is all rumour according to the Codex, our only known canon source. TDW is a nice concept, but is it a red herring?? Perhaps we should concentrate on what we do know!
It's a shame you couldn't see my entire post just before yours detailing all the in-game Dark Wheel stuff

I know you know this info though, so I'm wondering what you actually mean???

The issue with apostrophes I personally don't think is important. I've known English degree-holders, published authors, and extremely well-paid people in corporate marketing copywriting who write for multi-million pound projects that can't work an apostrophe. It's not at all uncommon. The fact that they've all been corrected now suggests it was a grammatical error rather than a significant hint.
