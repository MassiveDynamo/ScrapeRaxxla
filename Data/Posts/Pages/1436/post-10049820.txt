Well, progress update from Jorki:
currently at PSR J1915+1606, which should be the Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar (NS+pulsar), but it aint! FD have messed it up. In-game it's a NS + K type star. Which just about finishes my Gravitational Wave-based search. There might well be other potential GW sources in-game, but I think Jorki & Tyko between them have tested the major contenders. So I’m laying that theory to rest....
Hey Ho!

now just 9.6 kylies (121 jumps) to Colonia!

Happy New Year to all!
