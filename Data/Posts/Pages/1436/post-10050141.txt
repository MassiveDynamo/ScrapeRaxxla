Of the Wyrdest things?

Still resolving some loose threads from my ‘closed’ Milton Hypothesis and was surprised by the level of Apophenia when mapping LHS 316 - the calculated nearest system to the hypothetical celestial North Pole.

LHS 316 is not the celestial North Pole just the system closest to it, when plotted it actually falls below it ‘within’ the sphere of influence denoted by the hypothetical Crystalline Sphere diameter generated by calculating John Miltons Paradise Lost measurements of Pandemonium.

Amongst others, very close to LHS 326 and the hypothetical celestial North Pole; and above the sphere of influence is the system Wyrd - a system I’ve been aware of for some years, utilised for the engineer… but generally ignored.

The name Wyrd in Anglo-Saxon is a word roughly corresponding to fate or personal destiny!

A journey everyone takes?

Wyrd hosts the workshop of the The Dweller, who is of the Aganippe underworld; likely of the Aganippe system - Aganippe is the name attributed in Greek myth to a spring linked to the fates!

Wyrd in old Norse is Urðr a personification of a deity: Urðr or Urd; one of the Norns or fates in Norse mythology.

Note in my ‘Yggdrasil / John Milton conundrum’ hypotheses I intentionally restricted my search to ‘direct match spellings’ only, no anglo-Saxon interpretations (of which there are many) were included.

Apart from trying to find correlations, my whole approach is to find locations worthy of interaction, this looks like as good as any to begin ‘playing the game’ and ‘following the missions’!
