So, this is more to explain how I tend to operate because I get that my methods are non-traditional and use a mixture of methods to reach my conclusions. At the end of the day, I want information that fundamentally takes this from random guesses to actually being able to say we are looking for these particular types of systems with certain key things being present. I want information that changes it so the odds aren't so awful. Doing that means looking at the big picture and using tiny details to instantly eliminate certain prospects so we don't waste time and efforts. Information matters only in that it somehow makes the search easier.

There are, in fact, methods to how I do this. The goal was not to upend everything just because the opportunity presented itself. Though, for the Holdstock inspired version of Raxxla to be true I did need to prove to myself Earth was in all parts of the lore from the beginning. This has only ever been about finding those details that make finding the mysteries of Elite Dangerous ever so much easier (because often there are ideas that can be used elsewhere).
