fwiw as thargoids were not always available to be targets
there was once a time when bounty hunting gave a percentage to the pf, to empire, to federation, as well as to any local factions.
for someone like me that simply became triple elite long ago, before thargoids were available, becoming elite and gaining entrance to shinrarta came without ever going there, same as being allied everywhere I went because of the shares of bounties.
nowadays I believe you only get any pf percentages if you work for the pf aka kill thargoids.

mostly pointing out that shooting a thargoid was never a requirement and for the fun of it, becoming allied with the pf was a no effort gain.
watching the codex become, and watching new fake pf factions appear was easy to spot , still is as I am only allied with the real one.
meaning they did not always exist.

many things changed as time went by.
I mentioned before about the wiki's, and that the codex has done similar. meaning history gets written and re-written as things change.
the codex is named appropriately in my mind. because it only means library card to me, one that watched it become and grow, and also saw all my data change before and after the codex. many many errors. some change some don't.
I see it more as a reminder or a guide for the new. but by no means is it accurate in all things.

much lore is in a similar situation. some was re-written in front of many of us, more than once.
