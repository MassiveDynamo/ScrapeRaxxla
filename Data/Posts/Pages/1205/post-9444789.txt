Thanks!
And do we know anything about the “Something … Quest” caustic-damaged wreck in Bill Turner’s collection? Is it from one of the earlier stories?
Ah, just googled this Mic “Turner piloted a prototype named Turner's Quest for test flights in Pleione in the Pleiades Nebula, but was never seen again after jumping out of the system. Argent held a memorial service for Turner the following year, and continued to pursue their dream of contacting the Thargoids by launching a second Quest-class ship named Argent's Quest. It is rumoured that this expedition was successful, and was a primary factor in the dissolution of the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm”

So could be either of them, possibly Turner’s Quest?
Argent's Quest is the ship piloted by 'the player' during the Thargoid missions, in FFE.
There there are mission descriptions of all the missions here: http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/First_Encounters/Missions#Argent.27s_Quest_.231

This is the point where FFE history falls into a black hole. What happens next is up to the player. You can follow the main path and become friendly with the Thargoids or you can switch to INRA and Mycoid bomb Miackce. Unfortunately there were lots of bugs in the mission system, so only the main path was really playable.

I think that ED will turn out to reflect what would happen, if the player just skips all these missions. No contact with the goids and no Mycoid bombing. Mic Turner gets killed by INRA, some random NPC takes the Argent's Quest and messes up with the goids. Argent's quest then ends up in Bills basement.

Alternatively Mic messes up by him self and gets cocked by the goids, before INRA gets him.
