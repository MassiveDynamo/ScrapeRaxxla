How do,you figure that? From Holdstock:
“his father, Jason Ryder, had been élite, and none of his family had known!”

Ya Alex Ryder gets Dangerous at the end of the story and he is told by Rafe that “you’ll do” (or something like that) but i dont think it says he was actually accepted into the Dark Wheel at that point. But ya it is a little open-ended… i assume that he would still need to be Elite though.
