Nobody got any lore-based suggestions for where to sell the superpower Intel packages I got at the Dynasty Plot Hawking's Gap sites?
Just on my way to Neumann Camp to point out these sites out to TDW...

edit: abandoned settlement data packages sold to TDW, & also the Fed Intel package (which seems surprising), but the Alliance & Imp packages will have to go elsewhere...but where?
