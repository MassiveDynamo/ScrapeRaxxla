TBs, Codex, ED books, Galnet and release trailers are all canon. There are minor errors in two of the books, when it comes to the Thargoid events in the 3250s (the retcon). There are also a lot of 'fan fiction' in the old Galnet archives. Some stories were player written, some were author written and some were FD written.
Thanks Han_Zen!
Can you elucidate what the minor errors are in the books, and is there an FD reference for all this that I can add to the quotes thread? Sounds like something one of the CMs would have said in a livestream. Do wish theyâ€™d back up livestream utterances with formal written notification on the forum!!!!!
