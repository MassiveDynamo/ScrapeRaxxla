The main change seem to be that the authors were told that the Alliance had secret meetings with the Thargoids, after the Turner events in FFE.
The clearest example is probably this quote, from Out of the Darkness:

‘It’s not a blind guess. Carl consulted for Argent Incorporated as a
specialist in exo-biological research and exploration. He made me sign a nondisclosure agreement before he told me, well bragged: he was one of the
original members of the Alliance delegation that met with the Thargoids back
in 3253. According to him, he was pivotal in the negotiations, and in
minimising the diplomatic impact of the INRA’s attempt to sabotage the
meeting.’

As far as I have understood this meeting and the events leading up to it, was scratched from ED history. The caustic damage on the Quest ship in Bill's basement suggest that attempts of peaceful interaction went wrong, at a much earlier stage.
FD seem to have wanted to go further back in Thargoid / Human history and are gradually revealing the key encounters. Something will eventually pop up in the Pleiades and reveal Turnes adventures there, I guess.

Thanks!
And do we know anything about the “Something … Quest” caustic-damaged wreck in Bill Turner’s collection? Is it from one of the earlier stories?
Ah, just googled this Mic “Turner piloted a prototype named Turner's Quest for test flights in Pleione in the Pleiades Nebula, but was never seen again after jumping out of the system. Argent held a memorial service for Turner the following year, and continued to pursue their dream of contacting the Thargoids by launching a second Quest-class ship named Argent's Quest. It is rumoured that this expedition was successful, and was a primary factor in the dissolution of the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm”

So could be either of them, possibly Turner’s Quest?
