Well, I've just submitted an Issue ("Data missing from Commanders Archive in Codex") for the Stuart Retreat site at HIP 15329 since Log 1/4 is missing from my Commander's data archive (Thargoid) in the Codex, even though I have pix of reading all 4 logs at the time I visited. Since the Data Archive seems to be FD's way of tracing Commander's "Personal Journey" progress it may be important.
....
It's status is now "Confirming"!!
