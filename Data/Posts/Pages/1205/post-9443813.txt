P.S. just to remind you all, in case you missed the previous hints, or have forgotten them (looking @simulacrae!)

Friday is my birthday, I shall be 69. All gifts of Lavian Brandy, dark chocolate gingers and gift-wrapped dancing girls should be left at Hangar 31 at Jameson Memorial...
And two days later..on Sunday.....it will be Yorkshire Day!!!
hope you had a great one!
