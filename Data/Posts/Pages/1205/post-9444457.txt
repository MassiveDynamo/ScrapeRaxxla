Re lore
Didnâ€™t the message come from FD (I need a source reference for this please) that the only lore that is now canon for ED is that contained within the game, in Tourist Beacons and the Codex? I thought that was why they inserted the codex, to overcome player consternation about the great retcon of circa 2017.
TBs, Codex, ED books, Galnet and release trailers are all canon. There are minor errors in two of the books, when it comes to the Thargoid events in the 3250s (the retcon). There are also a lot of 'fan fiction' in the old Galnet archives. Some stories were player written, some were author written and some were FD written.
