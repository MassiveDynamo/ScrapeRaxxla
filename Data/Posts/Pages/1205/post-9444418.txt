Sold my abandoned Dynasty settlement data at Neumann Camp together with the Fed intel package, which surprised me, didnt think there were any fed factions there so logically why should they accept it?

Sold the Alliance intel at Golden Gate station in Alioth.

About to start the Imp rank grind at Mainani to see if max Fed &Imp ranks are part of the Personal Journey, so sold the Imp intel package there....


Still awaiting developments...
the next livestream I suggest someone asks if the “Personal Journey” mechanics are being regularly tested!!!
