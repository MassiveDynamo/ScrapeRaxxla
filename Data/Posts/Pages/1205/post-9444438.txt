Re lore
Didnâ€™t the message come from FD (I need a source reference for this please) that the only lore that is now canon for ED is that contained within the game, in Tourist Beacons and the Codex? I thought that was why they inserted the codex, to overcome player consternation about the great retcon of circa 2017.
