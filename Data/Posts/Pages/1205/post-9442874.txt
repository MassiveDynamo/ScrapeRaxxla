Yes. The original interesting point was the different placement of the Pilot’s’ apostrophe. I think this first gave rise to the hypothesis that there are several “variants” of the PF, which seemed to be supported by the multiple variant spellings when you look at minor factions in EDSM. And then you become allied with one of these if you save enough burning station passengers &/or bash enough thargoids.

Yesterday’s interesting point is that the spelling has changed in my personal journey data archive! Is this bug correction, or obfuscation??

Perhaps it’s paranoia, but I suspect FD are out to get me!
