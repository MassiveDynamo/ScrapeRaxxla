It just says "Elite"
Oke, did some research on those leaks. Yes, they almost all seem to be true. However, this roadmap was first posted on 14/04/2019 on a website named "4chan", a few days later on 19/04/2019 that roadmap was also posted on Reddit. In the 4chan post, nothing was mentioned of Raxxla. On the Reddit post it was mentioned that Raxxla is not in the game. It is possible the person on Reddit just copied the 4chan post and added that to add more drama. So that source is questionable.
