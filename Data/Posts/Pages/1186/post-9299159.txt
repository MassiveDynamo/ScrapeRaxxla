I finally visited the grave site in Tionisla. Received the encoded transmission and have been reflecting on the message.
"The vain queen rides a giraffe that remembers her daughter's hero."
The most common translations refer the vain queen to Cassiopeia, the giraffe to Camelopardalis, and the daughter's hero to Perseus. There are several links between these 3 constellations as they are in relatively close proximity with each other but I don't think it's a blatantly obvious map to anything.

Also, there is no reference of Camelopardalis in the myth of Cassiopeia offering her daughter (Andromeda) to appease a monster who is later saved by Perseus. Camelopardalis itself has no known mythology and is referred to as a "modern" constellation. I have chosen to omit Camelopardalis from my investigation as nothing more than a diversion used to create a clever riddle.

I feel the most common connection between these is Andromeda.
While mapping out the stars that make up the Andromeda constellation, I can not find the star Buna (HD 16175).

If you disagree with my reasoning I completely understand. All I am looking for is help in locating the star Buna (HD 16175). I have found no reference to it in any relation to Elite and this is really puzzling me.

Edit: Thanks to CMDR Jack Wilmslow for the alternate designation, HIP 12191. o7

Your star Buna didn't have its distance to Sol established until 2018. Therefore at the time of the creation if the in game galaxy in 2014 it would have had no distance data. This means it wont be in the game as FD don't have enough data to position it in 3D space. See:
