Halsey called them 'caretakers of our galaxy'. According to the codex her vissions are linked to the Guardians, but they have probably evolved a bit. Hints suggest that they are now body-less entities.

The name Guardians is according to Ram Tah, something they called them self. We just have to trust his translation skills on that one.
True, but the name Guardian sounds a lot like what she was describing. Some sort of guardians over the galaxy.

Yes, absolutly. Been doing research about that for some time now. Trying to see if the puzzle-pieces fit together. But this sounds more like the Construct, doesn't it? Either that or indeed, the guardians somehow locked themselfs in the monolith network. Maybe they are trying to contact us true those visions, hoping to be set free? I guess time will tell.
