Nope, Halsey in her vision.
Halsey called them 'caretakers of our galaxy'. According to the codex her vissions are linked to the Guardians, but they have probably evolved a bit. Hints suggest that they are now body-less entities.

The name Guardians is according to Ram Tah, something they called them self. We just have to trust his translation skills on that one.
