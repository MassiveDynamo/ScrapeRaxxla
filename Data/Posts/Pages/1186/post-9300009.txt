The Vain Queen stuff is from the seemingly finished Rebecca/Salome story line. Teorge has more beacons with stuff related to this story line. Probably not directly Raxxla related as the writer/author does not know any thing about Raxxla. All 88 modern constellations have at least their brightest stars in game. The game is not totally consistent on how the star's names are listed in game. Searching all the alternative names on wikipedia for a given star with a few spellings or combinations (a star with names "10 xyz" and "eta xyz" might get listed as "10 eta xyz" etc) usually gets a hit for real stars near sol.
Yeah I suddenly realized this is a completely different mystery. I'm starting to think Raxxla is just the codename for all of Fdev's planned and implemented mysteries. Currently, my plan is to complete as many steps in each mystery to see if that yields some deeper clues or revelations.
