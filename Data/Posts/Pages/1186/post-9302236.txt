Been away for a few....Come back to hear the Alexandria went to Delphi and has since then vanished mid-jump, and suddenly Guardians, Thargoids, and Humans are found by LEGENDARY EXPLORER (Truly) Cmdr NAMIX in the Trapezium sector. Inching the whole story even closer to Orion and Barnard's Loop. Orion is the goal, mark my words. The Story of the Orion connection to Egypt and the Great Pyramids, and to the Alien World and the Oisir-Raxxla is coming alive, in Elite's own beautiful way. I've been saying for over two years, Alex Ryder is Alexander the Great, you can actually find Many locations Alexander actually visited, within Elites galaxy.
This is beyond coincidence. Follow his history, in game. You just might be surprised.
"336 BC
Alexander the Great visited the Delphic Oracle wishing to hear a prophecy that he would soon conquer the entire ancient world. To his surprise the oracle refused a direct comment and asked him to come later. Furious, Alexander dragged Pythia by the hair out of the chamber until she screamed "You are invincible, my son!"
The moment he heard these words he dropped her, saying, "Now I have my answer"." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oracular_statements_from_Delphi
And He went on to "peacefully" conquer Egypt....
"Such was its reputation among the Classical Greeks that Alexander the Great journeyed there after the battle of Issus and during his occupation of Egypt, where he was declared "the son of Amun" by the oracle. Alexander thereafter considered himself divine. Even during this occupation, Amun, identified by these Greeks as a form of Zeus, continued to be the principal local deity of Thebes.".....Thebes.....Hmmm....
