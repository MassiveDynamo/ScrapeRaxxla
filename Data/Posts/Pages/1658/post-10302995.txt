There's only one Donaldson starport. It sits in Alioth.

Donaldson in Alioth - station | Elite:Dangerous | INARA
The companion site for Elite:Dangerous with the game database, market data, trade routes, outfitting, engineers, blueprints, crafting, Thargoid war, squadrons, logbooks, galleries, galaxy information and much more...
inara.cz

There were a lot of stations and planets that had the same names in FFE and FE2. The name generator was a bit limited.
Alioth has always been Alioth. Itâ€™s a real star, with a propper name.
