And the triangle/circles image can be seen in a CARRIER jump as well. This tells me it is indifferent to ship types and FSD types.

Awesome, that's a clean signal too, comparatively

I've been trying to composite an illustration of this shape together to see if it's anything useful. Let me ask you; look at the top point, I see something else there? Also the central circle seems to have divisions in it, those divisions also consistently appear, there's one at about 2 O'clock, a line that bisects the circle about 1/3 from the bottom?

What do you think?
