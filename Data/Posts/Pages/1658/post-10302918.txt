In FE2/FFE those are two different (and not nearby!) systems, with the latter being in a vaguely coreward direction from Sol - is there a reference in ED retconning the FFE Quphieth to be an Imperial alias for Alioth?
There's only one Donaldson starport. It sits in Alioth.

I think the issue is clarified in the entry for Quphieth that stated Augustus Brenquith messages sent to Sol became increasingly unreliable over time.

The Quphieth system was first visited by Augustus Brenquith, a rich eccentric from Old Earth who spent the latter half of his life exploring and opening up new stellar systems. He was one of the great early explorers, and left Earth in a highly modified Griffon class freighter. His ship was extensively altered, to enable it to make very long jumps (for the time) and most of the cargo space was converted to life support and message capsules. He left Earth just after the third algae war and vowed never to return. His aim was to explore the surrounding stellar systems and provide a legacy of inhabitable planets for the people of Earth.

For a period of 35 years, message capsules from Brenquith returned to the Sol system, bearing news of new worlds or hazardous planets which he had encountered. Each new arrival spurred a wave of colonists out from the home planet to the new world. His descriptions of the planets he visited were often poetically tinged, and after so long without human company became rather unreliable, but were always great media sensations.
