So, given the Quphieth entry, are we the CMDRs a dream of a Guardian Construct trying to simulate an end to hostilities? The simulation being between either the Progressive branch and Traditionalists and/or Thargoids and Guardians?

Would that make Raxxla everything? Or is Raxxla escaping the simulation? I think I broke reality there.
