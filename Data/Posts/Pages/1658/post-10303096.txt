Has anyone noticed that some Ice worlds have a tune? I've found 4 in one system. 1.58 to 4.03 Earth mass and .81 to 1.04 G. Unknown if it is the gravity or the mass that is the defining factor. All have various atmosphere types as well as non landable. A Rocky Ice World that fits the mass/gravity defined does not have this tune. I found it during DSS. I came out of DSS and supercruise and the tune is still there. I'm being cautious describing it as a signal due to 4 bodies sharing the same sound. When aligned to face the L. signal thru the Ice World in question, the Ice World tune is dominant with the L. signal is in the background. System Stuemeae KM-W C1-2965, bodies A5, A6, A7 and B4.
I was 50ly away from there so I went to check it out.

Unfortunately to me it sounds like the same thing all ice worlds make. AFAIK each category of world type has a specific sound in DSS. I'm not an expert though so keep investigating and I'm super happy to come record anything you find or lend a second pair of ears

I've recorded all these planets in DSS and also A5 in realspace with and without the Landscape signal. If you or anyone want the recordings to check for yourself let me know.
