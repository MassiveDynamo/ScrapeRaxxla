"Search"? Arch-sea?

Sea arch
The supporting roof of the arch is known as the keystone. The architecture of an arch is a reflection of its lithology and structure. Sea arches have been regarded as ephemeral forms tending to survive over periods of just few decades or centuries. The term sea tunnel can be used to describe a hole in the cliff line where the arch itself is considerably longer than the width of the entrance.

ergo - Raxxla is a tunnel

ergo sum
