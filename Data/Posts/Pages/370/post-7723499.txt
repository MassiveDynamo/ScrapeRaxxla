Anyone know of a list of player named systems? The reason I ask is because I'm in a strange area - a globular cluster - dozens of F type stars here - but there is one hand named system called 'Gilthaven' - 34 bodies but nothing human or out of the ordinary here though..

All the other stars have 2mass names and Gxxx catalog names and HD 50 etc. - its the blanco 1 cluster, btw - well under the disk of the galaxy 800ly from Sol.

Why go to the trouble of hand altering that one star?

AFAIK it's always worth checking distant/oddball named Systems in Deep Space with an Anagram solver.
(if I remember correctly, a long time ago that was amongst the 1st steps of Drew "teaching" interested Players in understanding a few things, together with little ROT-13 challenges etc.)

Gilthaven for example produces : Night Vale / Nightvale
...which in turn produces something like this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Night_Vale

"In an interview with NPR, Joseph Fink said that he "came up with this idea of a town in that desert where all conspiracy theories were real, and we would just go from there with that understood."

Now if that's purely accidental or reflects easter eggs (someone in early FDev ELITE design was aware and a fan) or points to something in-game... that's all-open to speculation.
