Anyone know of a list of player named systems? The reason I ask is because I'm in a strange area - a globular cluster - dozens of F type stars here - but there is one hand named system called 'Gilthaven' - 34 bodies but nothing human or out of the ordinary here though..

All the other stars have 2mass names and Gxxx catalog names and HD 50 etc. - its the blanco 1 cluster, btw - well under the disk of the galaxy 800ly from Sol.

Why go to the trouble of hand altering that one star?

That is the real-life open star cluster of Blanco 1 you have found. There are some real-life, non-procedural star names (2MASS and Tycho catalogues included) but also a handful of FD-chosen names, such as Gilthaven, McBurney's Point and Ziggy. I've searched the cluster a couple of times because I suspected involvement in the mystery surrounding the GCS Saravati and Project Thunderchild, sadly I found nothing relevant: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...-lookout-megaship.380074/page-15#post-7255635
