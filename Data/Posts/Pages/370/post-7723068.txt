That is the real-life open star cluster of Blanco 1 you have found. There are some real-life, non-procedural star names (2MASS and Tycho catalogues included) but also a handful of FD-chosen names, such as Gilthaven, McBurney's Point and Ziggy. I've searched the cluster a couple of times because I suspected involvement in the mystery surrounding the GCS Saravati and Project Thunderchild, sadly I found nothing relevant: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...-lookout-megaship.380074/page-15#post-7255635

Very interesting.. McBurney's Point, 1/3 from navel (rings Omphalos alarm!) - maybe there is a complete anatomy in space, a bit like the chakras...
