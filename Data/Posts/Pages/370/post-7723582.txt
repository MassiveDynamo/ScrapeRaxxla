Anyone know of a list of player named systems? The reason I ask is because I'm in a strange area - a globular cluster - dozens of F type stars here - but there is one hand named system called 'Gilthaven' - 34 bodies but nothing human or out of the ordinary here though..

All the other stars have 2mass names and Gxxx catalog names and HD 50 etc. - its the blanco 1 cluster, btw - well under the disk of the galaxy 800ly from Sol.

Why go to the trouble of hand altering that one star?

According to the kickstarter page, there were only 7 backers at that level, quote:

Pledge £3,000 or more
Have a frontier star system named* after you, and a 'special thanks' game credit, plus all rewards above.
Estimated delivery Mar 2014
Limited 7 backers

Might be worth reading the rest of this list for other naming reward overlaps, eg:

Pledge £750 or more
Have a planet named* after you, and an invitation to the UK launch party, plus all rewards above.
Estimated delivery Mar 2014
Reward no longer available 100 backers

Pledge £500 or more
Have a space station named* after you, plus all rewards above.
Estimated delivery Mar 2014
Limited 113 backers

Edit: Game credits can be viewed from the Main Menu, at the very end of course, it's slow, and you can't pause it. One or two of the system naming credits stand out immediately, others are less obvious.
