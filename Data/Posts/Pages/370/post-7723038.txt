I remember some pages back we were comparing the Raxxla logo to patterns on guardian ruins. Just asking: Did anyone ever try his luck with hatch breaker limpets on those ruins?
Don't know whether anyone's tried. All I can say is that it's not something that's been reported in terms of being done successfully.

Edit - well not on the pertinent forum threads anyway.
