Funny thing: to me, that looks like someone's left hand index finger touching a broken bottle. Except it's more like an hourglass shape than a broken bottle.

And the only vaguely hourglass-shaped constellation I can think of is Orion. Which means that the finger is touching Betelgeuse.

And another funny thing:

Map of Betelgeuse - 4 planets. This matches what you see flying in space, orbit lines and all.


However, in FSS exploration mode... 5 orbit lines!!!


I've been flying around trying to use the parallax effect to hopefully detect a hidden anything that would be in that orbit, but no luck so far. The orbit line doesn't appear in space, so it's kinda hard to follow it.
