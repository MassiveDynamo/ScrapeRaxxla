You have a way to go, but don’t worry. The triple Elite “requirement” was just the hypothesis of a livestreamer three years ago which people bought into. Many people of triple Elite rank have searched & found no advantage. It originally arose out of the 1984 novella which accompanied the original game and said you wouldn’t find Raxxla unless you were Elite; that novella has been retconned out by FD & is not canon for Elite Dangerous, so that requirement is bogus.
Join in the search NOW, the Quest for Raxxla needs you!
