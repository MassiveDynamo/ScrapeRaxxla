This thread has stopped making sense to me.

To add a little more sense for you: Today I saw a model of the human genome - you know that Helix. I thought, "hey might not spiralling stars be some kind of Helix, too?"

And there we go: Helix Sector is there and I would not really call it explored, at least eddb and Inara wise. Might be a place to have a look. Still fighting whether I'll be out bug hunting in Maia tonight or going over to Helix.
