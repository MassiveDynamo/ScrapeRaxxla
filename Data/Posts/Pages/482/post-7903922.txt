This thread has stopped making sense to me.
Don’t worry. It’s a peculiar mixture of space madness, frustration, and terminal fernweh often referred to as “Raxxlitis”
Soon we’ll get over it and get back to following weird ideas and unfounded theories, mixed with some mythology
A good dose of lavian brandy often helps (but doesn’t cure)
