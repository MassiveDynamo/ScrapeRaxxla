1) Raxxla Gateway ? I missed this one...
3) Isn't it described as a toroid, a donut, a low emissive and dark wheel-shaped station?

Stella, strictly speaking, means star, not planet.

Seems we'd better have a good understanding of the old English poetic language if we want to benefit from the "clues" FD provides...
I wonder how all this is managed in other localizations of ED..

Anyway, interesting interpretation, Pa. Every line might have some signification. Like "somewhere up in the MW/Bubble" for the first line (Polaris ?). A "big hot star" for the fourth, and more..
