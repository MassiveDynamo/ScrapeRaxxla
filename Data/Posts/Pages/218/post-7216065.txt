I just got in game. I'm exploring the starter system. There is a B star very far out. Maybe it's been hiding under our noses the entire time. This star is at the edge of what my stock starter ship can travel.

I just found an ancient artifact in the starter system. What do I do with it? Can I analyse it or something? It was at a degraded emission site. There were system authorities and npc's fighting nearby. The item in my inventory is labels illegal/stolen. Sadly I don't have enough fuel to get back to any stations to sell it. I could use a fuel scoop.

Didn't see anything else interesting around the star. There were some named NPC's though. Not sure if they might have any significance. Forgot what the names were. One was a french sounding name or something. Long and started with an A?!
