I found this: https://pos.sissa.it/170/032/pdf

https://www.google.com/search?q=ska+032&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-1

PoS(Antikythera & SKA)032. Pulsar Timing Arrays. K. Lazaridis1,2∗. 1 Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie Auf dem Hügel 69, 53121, Bonn, Germany.

And this: https://www.oceaniacruises.com/grand-voyage-cruises/papeete-to-vancouver-REG200414A/port-skagway-SKA/?voyageday=26#ports=SKA

White Pass Railway, Klondike Highway & Gold Camp Adventure (SKA-032) ... Klondike Summit, Suspension Bridge & Salmon Bake (SKA-023) ...

Not really related. Or is it....

And if you look up ska 0 in google it brings up a lot of suggestion with 0xx for actual ska music. But mysteriously no 032. I think you know what that means.

It also brings up some watches... That makes it creepier. http://www.watchsleuth.com/seikokineticfinder/search/?MOD=SKA035

It's trying to tell us something.
