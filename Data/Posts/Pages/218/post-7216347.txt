1) Raxxla Gateway ? I missed this one...
3) Isn't it described as a toroid, a donut, a low emissive and dark wheel-shaped station?

Stella, strictly speaking, means star, not planet.

Seems we'd better have a good understanding of the old English poetic language if we want to benefit from the "clues" FD provides...
I wonder how all this is managed in other localizations of ED..

Anyway, interesting interpretation, Pa. Every line might have some signification. Like "somewhere up in the MW/Bubble" for the first line (Polaris ?). A "big hot star" for the fourth, and more..

Yes, but using a poem to provide a clue just, to me, adds a layer of obfuscation (I’m not a poetry fan!) as you can’t rely on the literal meaning of the words used. The poem just adds a bit of evidence. It seems to me to indicate twin G type stars and twin G stars are definitely shown in the image on the start menu page (non-Horizons). Hopefully late afternoon I can get on the gaming PC and upload the other piece of evidence which led me to start my current search, but until then...Xmas shopping [mad] amongst the crowded shops and pouring rain (and we’re already 20 minutes late setting off ).

I haven’t got the answer, but I’m convinced this is the right track.

edit: I did read the poem through several times, and verse 22 is the only one that jumps out at me as a possible clue. Stella is the name of the subject desired by the poet, it’s not a great leap of imagination to say for us that is Raxxla. And I’ve mooted several times that Raxxla must be a hidden station since many stations are named XXX Gateway and according to Holdstock’s novella the original 1984 Raxxla was an alien world with a gateway to other universes (but we know there is only one universe/galaxy in E D).
