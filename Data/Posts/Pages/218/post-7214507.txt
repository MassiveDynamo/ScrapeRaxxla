What was the music video? maybe there is a connection to the music to something.

That looks older than 2012 though. Reminds me of old 16bit games form dos. I wonder if there are any odd music connection that might give hints from the games of the period.

women in bikinis with cheesy hairdos and a cowboy... What could it mean?!

Turning elite dangerous into a retro scene would be hilarious. I wonder if anyone will ever produce a Space Quest mmo? I'm feeling those nostalgia waves. I think the game Codename: iceman may have had subliminal messages in it. 8\

I have an uncontrollable desire to do this now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1IqyBZNJCU How did I get to that website!?

This is the music video that is from. It's a bit odd. It's from apple. And they just left apple as a supported OS(or they want us to believe this.). Art of Memores. Zenthial arches(zenith...) This is very computer oriented. Maybe there is a connection.

A12000000flex. Can that be turned into coordinates in game?

They have a lot of, "interesting," music: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/music-for-cat/284398017?i=284398266

BTW, you can play samples of those songs in the links. Was the, "dusk over raxxla," the song you heard? Is that music or anything related to that music in game? I wonder if that music has anything to do with any odd sounds you hear in space or from various frequencies in game?

I was going to post in this thread and say, "I know the games not out yet, but have you considered adding raxxla. And if so where have you considered putting it?" Or something like, "how have you considered implementing it?", as a joke. But no, reddit is boring and you can't post in old things... 8\
