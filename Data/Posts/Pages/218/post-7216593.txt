So wild conjecture time. It maybe the Lavian brandy I found floating out here or the fumes from a split reclamation duct but the imagination tends to wander when you're out in the black this long.

Tales of the prototype Codex have me wondering that we may begin uncovering more Dark Wheel/Raxxla missions very soon.

Its probably about time then this here sailor began taking their Elite ranking seriously and hand in his data, as I'm expectant a certain faction will be looking for explorers.

Taking that is for granted the unfounded rumour that a cmdr walzt right past it in some hurry.

All things supposedly being 'Obvious' as someone once said; the Dark Wheel will begin to turn again.
