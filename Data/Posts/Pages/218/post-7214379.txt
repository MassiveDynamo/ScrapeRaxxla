It's trying to tell us something.

Thanks. Not on my comp right now. In the heat of INRA bases hunt some time ago (IIRC), a user posted a pic in mega-thread (?) that IIRC he said was a frame from some ED trailer at that time and was not resolved. Ive stumbled upon a music video mentioning Raxxla from 2012. From my memory video background looks like that picture, and those letters and numbers were mentioned. Probably not relevant, but we live in a desperate times...
