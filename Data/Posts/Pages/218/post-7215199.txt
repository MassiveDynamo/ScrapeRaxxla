1. Riftborn - fine by me.

2. As I currently have abandoned my searchi in the Avalon system till the launch of the update I am currently pursuing an new theory. A few pages ago someone commented on the (fanmade) DW symbol and threw up a theory involving masonic symbolism. So I'll give it a try and visit the (very few) systems that have masonic allegations:

- Prims (Hiram's Anchorage)
- Shibboleth
- Senones (very far fetched idea, why this could be relevant)

Concerning a hidden Dark Wheel orbital I have the theory that one has to fly close enough to the planet to scan it. A bit like Sirius Atmospherics in Sothis that only shows if your ship is closer them 1k Ls.

I'll report any findings though I have doubts I will find anything.
