Nah, not the "Club". Thargoids kidnapped prisoners ... it was detention center with their ship somewhere ...
Then they studied/used em and made human beings which are controlled by them. And those guys used thargoids' virus on seeds. Similar response as "mikoid virus" but for seeds, as they figured we can just fast die bcs of hunger.

This is great- explains their interest in escape pods... maybe as part of their technology they are constantly incorporating other life forms... kind of a biological borge...

I still like the Club as the Twisted Men ( but if they were experimented on by thargoids... brings a new meaning to twisted)... i think they interpret the device as a mace and the dark wheel interpret it as a spindle... incidentally ancient mace heads look alot like spindle swhorlls.

Machina... looking forward to tales of the trail..
