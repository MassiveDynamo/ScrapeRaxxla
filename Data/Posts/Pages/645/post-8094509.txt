Simulacrae, isn't it strange there are two Earth like planets in Sothis, with sea beds that produce crystalline gold in "previously unseen form of crystalline structure"? There used to be anomalous signal sources in Sothis, and unknown artifacts. Now what are Soontill relics; "unidentified material", "pictographs of unknown origin" "elemental make-up and crystalline structure ..not made by human hands". Then of course there are those floaty things in space, transforming into spiky things.
