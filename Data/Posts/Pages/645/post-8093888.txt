SpaceDonut - good name for a ship

Actually Alexzk you got me thinking...what if there was a system on the map, nothing spectacular, but maybe the ship computer is programmed not to jump through it, like its permit locked, but it isn't? All ships would plot around it and nobody would really notice unless they paid close attention to galmap and available stars to jump to and relevant distances. It could be in the bubble even, any fairly dense star cluster would do, could be in the middle of hundreds of easily accessible stars and everybody just jumps around it. Can easily be jumped to if plotted but nobody does or has yet.

or

Its the last star system in a cul de sac of brown dwarfs or similar, one route in and one route out, wouldn't plot through as cant go through just in and back out. One scoopable at the entry point and one at Raxxla system but no nearby star apart from the one you came in on

or

How many people go straight up or straight down from Sol? How many pick a point away from the bubble and go there instead, wonder if it is the road less travelled?

or

a combination of all 3 or 2 of them

or

something else because....Raxxla
