Just to clear that up, Jumponium wasn't available at outset was it? What about Neutron boosts? If not we can reasonably assume it is within original LY jumpable range, maybe one full tank to get there so total jump range available should be calculable and that gives us some information that doesn't really lead anywhere but it might be useful to someone else.

P.S. I just left Drymans Point, plenty of BD fields in there...and WD and NS fields but let me sell the data before you go rushing in
