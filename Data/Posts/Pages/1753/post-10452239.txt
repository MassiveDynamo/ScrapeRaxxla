Ref - Chat GPT to search.

I've done the chat gpt thing from various angles. It's more inclined to make '..it' up as to parse data. Though the new iteration allows document use and can do a lot more but is still limited by a pay wall. ie sub for better access etc,..

I do not have a good head for many things as I used to, what would help is a more comdensed log of what is true as well as lore to use as a seperate data (document) for it (gpt) to use. Unfortunately I still don't believe the ai will actually be able to puzzle it as a whole. Maybe it could do some pieces and would need to be tested with information we already know the answer to.

It is what it is, o7
