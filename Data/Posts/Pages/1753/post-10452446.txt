Belt clusters are useless usually, so what clue points to them being relevant?
That would automatically make them a good place to hide things, then - and some of them have contained other POIs from time to time.

(They're pretty good for small mining ships - the rocks don't spin so you lose fewer limpets if you're new to it, the layouts are simpler to map if you're after something specific, and if you've only got a small ship it doesn't matter so much that there's only a few rocks per cluster to start with ... but I wouldn't expect "usefulness to the earning meta" and "relevance to Raxxla" to correlate much anyway)
