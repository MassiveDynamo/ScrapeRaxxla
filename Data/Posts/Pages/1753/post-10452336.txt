And for those, a so-far-last-generation-it's-no-longer-hyped-as-AI "computer program" would do a considerably better and more efficient job.

(Though the only thing that we have that quantity of data for is communal exploration data, and while I've run a few bulk searches on it as a more efficient way to reject/narrow certain hypotheses that it was more efficient suggests I may have been on the wrong lines)
Exactly, and like Rochester has pointed out there is an archaeological factor to the existing data where the older data has become inaccurate due to the periodic changes to the game. For example, I was able to verify locations of POIs such as Guardian ruins that have changed coordinates between their original 2016-2017 era recordings to now. That kind of shift on a planetary / system scale would have a big impact.

Why use it to search for a needle if there's a good chance it will point to the wrong haystack.
