Still playing around with this.

If we look at the Thetis signal and its spheres of influence, the proposed axis, in relation to the Norse Norns, Greek Fates and the ‘Fortune’ systems it seems to straddle the centre?

Here I’ve included the Greek compass (green) so it advocates a north/south alignment. Horizontally if we show Lethe and Styx together they seem to align West to East.

Given the proliferation of systems in and around Thetis which are named after ‘northern’ deities, I’m leaning towards the assessment this is the apex of the Empyrean or the most northerly aspect of the zone of Chaos!



Now if we consider how the ‘secondary’ event is likely narrative, I suspect it was inserted to get our attention.

If we replicate a third sphere of influence on the opposite side something interesting occurs, Tyche is upon its outer rim?

Something is in this area.

Addition: the system Penglai, is upon the circumstance of the Thetis signal. Interesting.
