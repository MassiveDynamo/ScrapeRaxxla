That's news to me - where was this revealed?
Robert Holdstock said so. In "The Dark Wheel", and also in his 1980 book "The Alien World: The Complete Illustrated Guide".

In "The Dark Wheel": "Raxxla was described as a mythical planet which held an alien construct that served as a gateway to other universes. A corps of Elite-ranked pilots was suspected to have found Raxxla and exploited the gateway for their own selfish purposes, and hired assassins to eliminate any independent pilots and members of the Dark Wheel who tried to uncover Raxxla".

I ask again, why the belt cluster stuff? Genuinely curious. Belt clusters are useless usually, so what clue points to them being relevant?
