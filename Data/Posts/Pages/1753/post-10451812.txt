Also Raxxla and The Dark Wheel were originally completely different things in The Alien World.
Raxxla a race of creatures and The Dark Wheel actually a place.

And who is to say it is any different in ED?
As DB himself said...we dont know what Raxxla is!
The codex says "that Raxxla is a definite place"...but what if the codex is lying and Raxxla is an alien race at a location? DB said in-game characters can lie (IMHO that includes Lyta Crane)
