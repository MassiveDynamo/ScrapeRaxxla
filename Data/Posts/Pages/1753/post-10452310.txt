Yep, as a tool to help process galactic volumes of data it might serve a purpose.
And for those, a so-far-last-generation-it's-no-longer-hyped-as-AI "computer program" would do a considerably better and more efficient job.

(Though the only thing that we have that quantity of data for is communal exploration data, and while I've run a few bulk searches on it as a more efficient way to reject/narrow certain hypotheses that it was more efficient suggests I may have been on the wrong lines)
