LAWD 27 Experiments
Using a SuperCruise Assist did not help to getting closer to belt cluster 3
Dropping just outside from a drop-in distance of a belt cluster and flying in to the rocks may work
Dropped-in just outside the 1Mm mark of belt cluster 2 took me to the rocks
Will be a challenge for belt cluster 3, as the closest I got was 0.30Ls
Well I tried cluster 3 for the fun of it, dropped in at 0.21ls and even in a modified viper mk3 with 850 boost it seems to be orbiting away faster than I can travel in normal space. So I don’t think it’s possible to reach unles you work out it’s orbit trajectory?
