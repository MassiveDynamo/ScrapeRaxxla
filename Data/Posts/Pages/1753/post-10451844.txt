Also Raxxla and The Dark Wheel were originally completely different things in The Alien World.
Raxxla a race of creatures and The Dark Wheel actually a place.

I wrote in this thread a long time ago and I will repeat myself just in case.
I've played all the Elites. And I've always wondered why they introduced Guardians in ED?
If I remember correctly, the Codex with the mention of Raxxla appeared after the discovery of the Guardians.
Before that, there were strange quests in the game that could lead to finding Ra... Guardians.
