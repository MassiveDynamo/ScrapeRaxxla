You're wanted. CMDR's required, simple challenge found.

I've found a simple challenge for you CMDR's:
Enter Belt Cluster 3 in LAWD 27
Examine the rocks
Mine if you can
Take video or pictures or it didn't happen
Note: It might not be simple...
Click to expand...

Interesting, not currently in game to test, but would like to understand the appeal.

Some record in threads of historical bugs (usually an indication of content). The system is relatively inside one of a number of hypothetical zones of interest, being essentially ‘east of Thetis’ and at the correct height in relation to the underworld, to be within the Empyrean zone…not just relatively close to the systems linked to the Greek fates.

I’m toying with the idea this area is a zone outlining the boundaries of the Empyrean walls, advocated elsewhere by various systems named after mythical heavens….or lands of paradise…

Be interesting to see what’s going on…
