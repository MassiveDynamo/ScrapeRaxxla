I wrote in this thread a long time ago and I will repeat myself just in case.
I've played all the Elites. And I've always wondered why they introduced Guardians in ED?
If I remember correctly, the Codex with the mention of Raxxla appeared after the discovery of the Guardians.
Before that, there were strange quests in the game that could lead to finding Ra... Guardians.

No one will ever know for certain so anything we discuss is purely speculative.

But I believe FD did alter the Raxxla narrative, and I suspect it had some thing of a knock on effect for the wider 10 year narrative, in that it’s original intent was to introduce various aspects which were designed to play out across certain locations at certain times.

There is various unofficial information, that could be interpreted to speculate that very early content has been entirely dropped, so I have the suspicion a fundamental business decision was made, and this ultimately shifted how that narrative was to be executed.

I suspect the narrative we now have, is still in spirit the same, but it’s core and is delivery was drastically altered.

I suspect Raxxla may have initially been integral, but was subsequently dropped, and now exists as an Easter egg.

I believe the codex is not an addition to the mystery, but it actually replaced it.
