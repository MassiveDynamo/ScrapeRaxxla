LAWD 27 Experiments
Using a SuperCruise Assist did not help to getting closer to belt cluster 3
Dropping just outside from a drop-in distance of a belt cluster and flying in to the rocks may work
Dropped-in just outside the 1Mm mark of belt cluster 2 took me to the rocks
Will be a challenge for belt cluster 3, as the closest I got was 0.30Ls
Bit out of the loop here, but what's the relevance of belt clusters? We know Raxxla is a planet.
