The other one people missed is when Jaques casually says he will single-jump a space station 44k light years and only made it about a little over 20k light years away. Up to this point these stations only jumped a couple hundred light years total.
What are you talking about?! The logs of this event are still around! Some of those in Turist Beacons... others in the Codex... never the less you can still learn that the jump failed due to UA bombing from in-game lore...
