I think some of those Pilots Federation things are simply what they say they are on the tin, not cliques.

Like you wouldn’t generally consider your local branch of the Post Office to be some kind of mysterious clique within the Post Office. To extend the analogy you might have a good personal relationship with the folks in your local Post Office, but that wouldn’t mean anything about what your relationship was like with the Post Office as an organisation as a whole.
Possibly, and I originally thought the spelling differences were just mistakes by FD. But when I became Allied with “PilotsFederation” after (by a couple of years) I was already Allied with “Pilots’ Federation Local Branch” it became clear there was more to this than just spelling mistakes. I checked on “pilot” on EDSM minor factions and it came back with several different factions for PF. Davanix claimed to have become Allied with another after participating in the anti-Rochester CG. So, there may be three or more PF factions. The question is why! The slightly different faction spellings seem to be obfuscation; from the tourist beacon TDW are a clique of PF & I remember the old mission “Obfuscated on the Outer Rim” and Elite Premonition had a character saying that the PF faction in Shinrarta were a distraction “on the outer rim” of an organisation that has “wheels within wheels”.
