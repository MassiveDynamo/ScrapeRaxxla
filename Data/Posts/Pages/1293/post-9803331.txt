Well like I say, I think the Pilots Federation Local Branch is just what it says on the tin, i.e. a local branch of the Pilots Federation. One of the others I think is the Superpower rating equivalent for the PF. Theyâ€™re supposed to be a fourth superpower after all.

I think it was The Dark Wheel in SD that the character was talking about in Premonition.
Yes indeed it was. And since we are told that TDW are a clique of PF perhaps they are better known by one of the PF spelling variants?
