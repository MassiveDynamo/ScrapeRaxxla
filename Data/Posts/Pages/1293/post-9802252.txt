But did you wonder about why they are next to ship debris and the name of the other ship and it curious paint job that you canâ€™t buy?
At the time it was a big treasure hunt... the prize: that medusa paintjob was gifted to the CMDR who solved it first. It was an in-game event. Not sure those clues are relevant for Raxxla or any current open mystery. But as usual, it is a path every CMDR has to go through himself... you may find something new... if so, please, be so kind to report back as we all do.
