At the time it was a big treasure hunt... the prize: that medusa paintjob was gifted to the CMDR who solved it first. It was an in-game event. Not sure those clues are relevant for Raxxla or any current open mystery. But as usual, it is a path every CMDR has to go through himself... you may find something new... if so, please, be so kind to report back as we all do.
If it was just for the treasure hunts, why is it still in the game five years later? Perhaps there still is a way to get that paintjob.
I don't check the forums that often, but when I do I try to share as much as I know about the topic I am responding to (hence why I shared that Hadrian Duval is a clone from the same group as Hans Walden).
