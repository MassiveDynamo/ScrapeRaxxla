Do we have anyone here who has a high rank in CQC Arena? Rating in the Arena opens systems with a discount on ships and weapons. I don't think we've searched the systems thoroughly yet, due to the low popularity of this mode. There might be some catch there. The arena appeared along with the release, and was present in the topic related to "the Club". need to check
