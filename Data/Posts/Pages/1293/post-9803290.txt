Possibly, and I originally thought the spelling differences were just mistakes by FD. But when I became Allied with “PilotsFederation” after (by a couple of years) I was already Allied with “Pilots’ Federation Local Branch” it became clear there was more to this than just spelling mistakes. I checked on “pilot” on EDSM minor factions and it came back with several different factions for PF. Davanix claimed to have become Allied with another after participating in the anti-Rochester CG. So, there may be three or more PF factions. The question is why! The slightly different factions seem to be obfuscation; from the tourist beacon TDW are a clique of PF & I remember the old mission “Obfuscated on the Outer Rim” and Elite Premonition had a character saying that the PF faction in Shinrarta were a distraction “on the outer rim” of an organisation that has “wheels within wheels”.
Well like I say, I think the Pilots Federation Local Branch is just what it says on the tin, i.e. a local branch of the Pilots Federation. One of the others I think is the Superpower rating equivalent for the PF. They’re supposed to be a fourth superpower after all.

I think it was The Dark Wheel in SD that the character was talking about in Premonition.
