I would only use in-game lore to find Raxxla.

Wouldn't hurt to take a look at the signal source that has no time limit near Algol A3, which is the end of the Alfred Jeffress treasure hunts from 3302 and is still in the game. It is almost as if you need to walk in the footsteps of a hero that is on a journey, a Hero's Journey. I'll stop being coy (because I hate when people act like they are hiding other info), remember one of the missions hinting at Raxxla has the title "The Call to Adventure" which is the first step of the Hero's Journey.

Plenty of odd and non-explained things in the game that are not bugs.
Sure! I agree to that! Even did the very same already... found some cannisters of "Earth Relics"
