Many (if not all) of past game events are still present in the game in some form... maybe for the reason I just mentioned before... perhaps is the way Frontier found to endorse their approach to allow CMDRs to walk the line themselves even if that path is already known...
This is the only part of the treasure hunts still in the game, it is the last of all of them. All other parts of the treasure hunts were removed at the conclusion of each hunt (including the last hunt). This one has persisted for five years.
