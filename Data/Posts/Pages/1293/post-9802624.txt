It also does not help when the galaxy is bugged. I noticed this when I was doing a super cruise in sol towards Scorpio area on my 2nd account. It’s only when I logged in with my main account and entered Sol to cross reference something, I noticed something was amiss on my 2nd account.

I was chasing another tin foil hat idea that Ian Bell could be the whisperer, he was born 31 October 1962 a Scorpio, one of the 3 sirens of the zodiac (witch space), Scorpio is the deepest siren towards the centre of the milky way. Oh and always thought that life… Sol where it all started is the jewel.
