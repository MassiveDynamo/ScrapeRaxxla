Maybe space madness overhelms me, but it looks like mocking. "We know that you can't obtain permit right now, but we didn't tell you about it. Feel free to discuss this as long as you want". So frustrating if you ask me

Yes I thought the same. Was hoping for a clear yes or no. The cynic in me feels like they know the permit is unobtainable right now and also know it doesn't go down well. So they make it a bit ambiguous.
