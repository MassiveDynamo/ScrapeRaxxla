Got a reply from frontier support re permit for LFT 509.

In the release notes for the 1.2 Wings release it mentions LFT 509 and two other systems:

"Adding valuable salvage convoys to three permitted systems: LFT 509, Isinor, Witch's Reach"
Patch Notes - Update - Elite: Dangerous Wings 1.2 (Wings content update) incoming
Hi everyone, The Wings content update (Elite: Dangerous 1.2) will be available for download shortly. The Galaxy servers will be down from 3PM GMT for approximately 3 hours to let us apply the update. Thanks again to everyone who took part in the beta test. EDIT: The servers are taking longer...

Isinor - "This pastoral system supports an agricultural economy but doesn't welcome strangers. So much so that the governing council won't permit a starport in orbit for trading. The permit for this system can be obtained via the Chapter of Isinor faction."
