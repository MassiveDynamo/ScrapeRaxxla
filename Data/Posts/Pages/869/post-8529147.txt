Trying to think....Where does A Friend appear, other than the letter from our beneficiary?

I think there are a few tip off missions that are from A Friend (most are mysterious strangers)

Is there anywhere else?

As a side note - it would be a nice little twist if it was a bit of a double bluff and it turns out there is a character in TDW called Alex Friend
