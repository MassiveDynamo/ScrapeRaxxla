Ah
MIB2 investigates strange happenings on Mount Olympus!
Yes, some men in black have been studying these mysteries for hundreds of years. Actually the site is Tel Abib, "the hill of spring" by Chebar river, in Babylon, not Mount Olympus (nor contemporary city of Tel Aviv). Interestingly the fiery wheels of Ezekiel are also called Ophanim, Thrones or angels. Remember, Omphalos is also a throne, and in some sense thematically close to mountains, and that of a deity. Also, the idea of four hayyoth, living beings, had long lasting impact on later religious images.
SPOILER: TETRAMORPH (OR A RAXXLAMORPH?)
