Maybe space madness overhelms me, but it looks like mocking. "We know that you can't obtain permit right now, but we didn't tell you about it. Feel free to discuss this as long as you want". So frustrating if you ask me
I reckon we need to expand the dark wheel faction to within a certain distance of LFT509 or to a specific system before a permit mission is released.
FD's response about it not being obtainable now, would be true.
