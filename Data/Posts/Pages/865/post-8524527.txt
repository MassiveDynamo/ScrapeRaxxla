If raxxla is a location i imagine they might have "improved" upon it since its creation ( much lile the zurara was changed from an anaconda to a mega ship) but ya i have been toying with the idea that the omphalos rift artefact might be a key that turns certain blackholes into wormholes.... thus the door could be hidden in plain sight.. unless u have the key.

i like that idea, only question is now, how to find the omphalos rift... it could have been missed in the Delphi system, but unlikely in my opinion, so where else could it be?
