But that’s only true if Raxxla is a POI, which I highly doubt. There is no evidence to support it, the suggestion arose from Holdstock’s TDW novella (“planet with alien artefact”) and Wagar’s Oolite books (hyperspace-capable wandering planet with alien artefact) , the former has been retconned by FD and the latter is fan fiction (though a good read!) and not relevant to ED. And Raxxla has been in-game since gamma release, so well before Horizons, hence it cannot be landable. Raxxla ought, logically, to be an astronomical phenomenon, and sufficiently novel to be a worthwhile find at the completion of a long tedious frustrating search, so I’m mooting an Exotic Star (though it might also be a rogue star wandering between systems), or perhaps a Diamond Star (good luck getting it back to a market for sale! Though it would probably pay for a fleet of Fleet Carriers!! )

If raxxla is a location i imagine they might have "improved" upon it since its creation ( much lile the zurara was changed from an anaconda to a mega ship) but ya i have been toying with the idea that the omphalos rift artefact might be a key that turns certain blackholes into wormholes.... thus the door could be hidden in plain sight.. unless u have the key.
