But that’s only true if Raxxla is a POI, which I highly doubt. There is no evidence to support it, the suggestion arose from Holdstock’s TDW novella (“planet with alien artefact”) and Wagar’s Oolite books (hyperspace-capable wandering planet with alien artefact) , the former has been retconned by FD and the latter is fan fiction (though a good read!) and not relevant to ED. And Raxxla has been in-game since gamma release, so well before Horizons, hence it cannot be landable. Raxxla ought, logically, to be an astronomical phenomenon, and sufficiently novel to be a worthwhile find at the completion of a long tedious frustrating search, so I’m mooting an Exotic Star (though it might also be a rogue star wandering between systems, and I reserve the right to be incorrect!! ), or perhaps a Diamond Star (good luck getting it back to a market for sale! Though it would probably pay for a fleet of Fleet Carriers!! )
I am, of course, not saying you are wrong....who knows??? But why are you so sure that Raxxla has been "identifiable and discoverable" since Gamma? Do we have any evidence of this?

There are lots of things that have been "in game" since Gamma, but some we couldn't explore until Horizons and others we wont be able to explore until Oddessy.
