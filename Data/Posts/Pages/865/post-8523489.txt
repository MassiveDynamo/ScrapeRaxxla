But the Ryder Family does appear to have a faction in Maia.....
That faction as named in honour of the player Commander Ben Ryder. He did a lot of work, to get the first station established in the Pleiades. Obsidian Ant and Hagglebeard (he posts here from time to time) also got factions. Obsidian Ant did of course also get the station name.

Before Obsidian Orbital, there were no stations or bases in the Pleiades.
