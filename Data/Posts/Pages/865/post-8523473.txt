... anyone noticed that the minor faction "The Hive" is the controlling faction in 4 systems named after the 7 Pleiades...

Their home system is Taygeta, one of the Pleiades names was Taygete.

Then they control 10 systems total, but heres the list of Pleiades names ones:

Taygeta - Mother of Sparta
Merope - Married a Mortal
Electra - Mother of the Trojans
Celaeno - Mother of the exalted rulers of the Fortunate Islands, the kingdom of the Blessed in the Greek afterlife, 2 of Poseidon's chilren

Im wondering if this has been explored and what was the outcome....

Just seems curious considering Maia's link to everything, and being a Pleiad herself, and the defacto leader of them.
Sterope, wife of Ares, isnt in game thus far, Sterope II is though.
and Alcyone, also mother to some of Poseidon's children, is a system with just a star...

Im not sure exactly how this relates, but it seems important, doesnt it?

Most Pleaiadian mythology was dissected and examined from early days. The Pleiades were a Thargoid hot spot in FEE and therefore drew plenty attention. When the first free floating UAs were found out there, the attention exploded.
Everything out there seem Thargoid related. No signs of any Raxxla connection so far, but it's an interesting cluster that everyone should explore.
Remember to check out the Tourist beacon about the Thargoid Probe at Merope 5C.

By the way, Sterope is in the game under the name Asterope.
