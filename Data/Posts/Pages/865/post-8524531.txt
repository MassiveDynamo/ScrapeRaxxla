If raxxla is a location i imagine they might have "improved" upon it since its creation ( much lile the zurara was changed from an anaconda to a mega ship) but ya i have been toying with the idea that the omphalos rift artefact might be a key that turns certain blackholes into wormholes.... thus the door could be hidden in plain sight.. unless u have the key.

Yes, I've mooted black hole rifts before, and ended up banging my cockpit on the exclusion zone of about 80 on this quest...
not found anything so far, but there's always one more to try!

Edit: another 3 this afternoon!
