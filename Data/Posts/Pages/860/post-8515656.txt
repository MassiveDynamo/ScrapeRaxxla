Been doing mail and info grabbing missions all afternoon. An FDL forced me to go into solo to reach a planet, even though I asked him nicely to let me by. He wound up taking a bite out of my armor to, but silent running in a DBS is a wonderful thing. Came back out after i got there to the planet.

On the ground, not only was there a data tower i needed to scan, there was an occupied escape pod. And then i realized i had no cargo bay.

Had to leave him behind. Woops.
