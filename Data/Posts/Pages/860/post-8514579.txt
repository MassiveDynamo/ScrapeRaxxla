This is rift related.
Chasing a theory that there should be 14 bases not 12, I went to check how they appear after the latest update. Flew out to,,
System: EAFOTS GL-Y E2
Beacon around: A1
Rally Point (settlement) on: 6 delta 21.2838 19.0682 delta

No beacon and no base.
The settlement then and now.
