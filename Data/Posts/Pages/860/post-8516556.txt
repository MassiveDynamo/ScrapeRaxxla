Polaris.

Correct me if wrong but I'm currently out of the game, so cant visually check. The Polaris permit says 'Polaris permit' doesn't it...not 'unknown'. Meaning it can be obtained.

My longstanding suspicion has been that the DW or Raxxla is somehow linked to this permit. Never bothered before...but maybe its that 'obvious'?

Of course location of the permit givers seems to have baffled many. Has any work been done on locating factions which could have 'Polaris' within their title? Polaris does go by several names.

Alruccabah
Cynosura
Phoenice
Lodestar
Tramontana
Angel Stern
Navigatoria
Star of Arcady
Yilduz
Mismar
Alpha Ursae Minoris
Stella maris
