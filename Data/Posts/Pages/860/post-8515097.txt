Hmmm... But this sounds in fact like an interesting testing approach. Seriously=)
I've also tried to visit some other not Tip Off related persistent crashed ship sites in the Bubble. Those that are "not specially designed" with special/audio log etc and - imo - those that are just proc.generated. (Visited those in Ithaca and Aulis). They are still there.
Probably current issue with POI's can be a (rare) occasion to separate some hand placed or proc.generated in-game features, I don't know (while I also think that this starts to sound a bit like a bug-exploiting)
