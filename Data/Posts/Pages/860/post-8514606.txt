This is rift related.
Chasing a theory that there should be 14 bases not 12, I went to check how they appear after the latest update. Flew out to,,
System: EAFOTS GL-Y E2
Beacon around: A1
Rally Point (settlement) on: 6 delta 21.2838 19.0682 delta

No beacon and no base.
The settlement then and now.



Next stop Zurara.
Purge tour continues,,,

I've read in other threads that since the update guardian sites are missing too. I think its a bug
