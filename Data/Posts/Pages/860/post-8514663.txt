I've read in other threads that since the update guardian sites are missing too. I think its a bug

if it wasnt for Turning The Wheel, i wouldnt be playing for a few days, but im too invested in helping, done too many DW missions to stop now....
But i've been dropped like atleast a dozen times in the last 5 hours, even just accepting new missions, hyperjumping, or turning in completed ones is dropping me, so I can only imagine how many bugs there are to be fixed too..
I've been reading some ppl arent even getting missions at some locations....

Its funny to see the FCs in the system maps, lmao, LFT 926 has like 20 in it now, lmao

If they were'nt 5B each, id buy one too lmao... but jeeze thats insane
