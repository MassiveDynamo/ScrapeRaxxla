I see the things your talking about now... and they could i guess ressemble what your saying, but at the same time, if you look at the entire shaded area around it, I also see an Alien shape like @PeteACarter said lmao...

I think whats happening in this particular frame is the Pareidolia effect, like @Jorki Rasalas said.... its most common to see faces, but seeing known/familiar like things in clouds ect is all the same effect....

The only way we could get a better guess, would be if it was a video clip in HD 60fps, because then we could see the progression of the "object" and the clouds/space around it and the lights....
That's the weird thing. It's not just one frame, it's definitely something visible as you pass it. At the time I confirmed it to only show up in a certain few systems in the same area. I tried finding it again at the same system a couple weeks ago and it wasn't showing up. At the very least, this means that the witch space animation DOES change and I think that could be a clue.
