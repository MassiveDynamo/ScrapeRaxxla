Can you filter for a specific moon on a gas giant on EDDB or you done it manually?

in the bodies search page you can filter by planet type


but that will only show the selected planet type and not it's orbiting bodies/moons...



However filtering on body group of "Planet" also gives moons....
"Planet: In this context a planet can be a moon as well as a conventional planet.
Subtypes are Ammonia world, Class I gas giant, Class II gas giant, Class III gas giant, Class IV gas giant, Class V gas giant, Earth-like world, Gas giant with ammonia-based life, Gas giant with water-based life, Helium-rich gas giant, High metal content world, Icy body, Metal-rich body, Rocky body, Rocky ice world, Water giant, Water world"

This is what I did and then extracted the 2300 or so records and filtered on " h" names. I also visually checked for anything interesting (e.g. planets with sister moons, which would obviously reduce the H requirement to a previous lettering)



Not perfect and EDDB obviously isn't 100% accurate.... but thought it might be interesting.
