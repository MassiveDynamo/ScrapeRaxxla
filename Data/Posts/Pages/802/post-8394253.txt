in the bodies search page you can filter by planet type
View attachment 169291

but that will only show the selected planet type and not it's orbiting bodies/moons...

However filtering on body group of "Planet" also gives moons....
": In this context a planet can be a moon as well as a conventional planet.
Subtypes are Ammonia world, Class I gas giant, Class II gas giant, Class III gas giant, Class IV gas giant, Class V gas giant, Earth-like world, Gas giant with ammonia-based life, Gas giant with water-based life, Helium-rich gas giant, High metal content world, Icy body, Metal-rich body, Rocky body, Rocky ice world, Water giant, Water world"

This is what I did and then extracted the 2300 or so records and filtered on " h" names. I also visually checked for anything interesting (e.g. planets with sister moons, which would obviously reduce the H requirement to a previous lettering)



Not perfect and EDDB obviously isn't 100% accurate.... but thought it might be interesting.

Cool, thanks for that.
