Once i have the distance, how do i find my heading though?

Also, you know how when you have your destination targeted in system and it shows the time to get there at present speed? Is there some way i could get the distance out of the 21h 45m 53s?
I like your thinking with this. I had exactly the same thoughts last year, but couldn't ever work out how to get the RA+Dec accurate. Tips I got were all PC based but I'm PS4 and I think you are too right?
