..don't recall if we got that idea already..
..so there are many stations named in the name of well-known humans, like Tereshkova port etc. Maybe that toast refers such a names, not a greek myths?
So at the times of Einstein galaxies were unknown yet. Maybe it was some woman who helped to discovery they're, and in her name station is named...so she will be "mother of galaxies".
