Once i have the distance, how do i find my heading though?

Also, you know how when you have your destination targeted in system and it shows the time to get there at present speed? Is there some way i could get the distance out of the 21h 45m 53s?

No, if I remember my astronomy correctly, RA is measured in hour-angle, with 24 hours equating to 360 degrees. So the angle equivalent to your RA figure is (21h 45m 53s/ 24h 0m0s)*360 degrees measured from the reference point which is, I vaguely recall, the Point of Ares which is something to do with the Equinox. You’ll have to google it I’m afraid. There is no way to get a galactic 3D coordinate directly from RA+DEC, but you could work out the direction then just travel along it.
