....problem with astronomy ... all those measures are 2D measures of projections of 3D universe to Earth's sky..
...and when we go into space, all that measures get obsolete, no 1 sane will describe something in terms of Earth sky if he/she never visited Earth.
...so I would dig any true 3D coordinates which can be obtained +/- exact sitting in ship.
