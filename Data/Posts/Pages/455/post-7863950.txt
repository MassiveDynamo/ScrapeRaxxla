I'm re-reading "and here the wheel" & been having a bash at mis-jumping as described towards the start of the book (initiating the jump then pressing jump again just before the tunnel).
It's not worked but it might be because I visited the local brewery this weekend and my reflexes are a bit 'tired'- has anyone else tried this or am I barking up the wrong tree?
I've checked here but its not really answered if it is included in the game or just some artistic licence from a book written before the game was finalised.
