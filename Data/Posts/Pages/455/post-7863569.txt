Isn't it just the direction that Macros happened to be travelling in, whilst looking for TDW missions? If he'd gone in a different direction that data would 'point' that way instead.
Travelling three months, thousands of Ly, across.. a plane in space ?
Anyway only him could say. I just plotted the data. Now, everybody is free to interpret it as he wants.
And, again, TDW never gave these missions. Because most were aimed at spying TDW ! (aside the "diplomatic" missions, ofc, sorry..)
