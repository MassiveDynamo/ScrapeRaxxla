You guys still haven't found Raxxla yet? Oh well, see you in another six months or so.
Mmmh... Six months ? Imho, just wait for the FDevs to put back in the game some "part of it a tiny little bit obvious, so people know what they are doing."
Until then..
Edit: yeah.. well.. thx for the rep, Boss, but it is still your fault !
Btw, I can't remember you commenting the fact that the E/F missions giving factions kept moving from the core to the rim of the Bubble (all at ~180 Ly from the start). No intent pattern there in your opinion ?
