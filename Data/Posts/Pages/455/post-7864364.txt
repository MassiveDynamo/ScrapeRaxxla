Who argues about a conclusion ? I said I just plotted the data. That's what appeared.
Period.
Forget about the "extrapolation' part and you'll be safe.
And if you want more points, just keep adding their coordinates on the plotter I posted and calculate the resulting vectors.

Come on Scytale...
We argue about everything! Thatâ€™s part of the fun in this thread!
