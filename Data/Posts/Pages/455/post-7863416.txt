Just looking at your excellent front page data makes appear that pattern.(example) https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-2571931

Now, if any math nerd sees some pattern or something odd here (everybody should, imho) and wants to do some vector geometry and extrapolate the next (co-planar !!!) vectors and points for fun, he could reveal some nice hexagonal figure and maybe make him think.

I am going back to build "sandcastles" in my Dual Universe space game..
