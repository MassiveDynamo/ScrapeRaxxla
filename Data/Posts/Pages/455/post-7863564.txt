Not considering SD here. TDW never was a mission giver.
Just looking at your excellent front page data makes appear that pattern.(example) https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-2571931
From Ticushpakhi to Varati to 49 Arietis to HIP 86063
Your own data.

Now, if any math nerd sees some pattern or something odd here (everybody should, imho) and wants to do some vector geometry and extrapolate the next (co-planar !!!) vectors and points for fun, he could reveal some nice hexagonal figure and maybe make him think.

Isn't it just the direction that Macros happened to be travelling in, whilst looking for TDW missions? If he'd gone in a different direction that data would 'point' that way instead.
