We also checked Thargoid Wakes but it is not possible to follow their trajectory, which looks suspiciously like they jump to Col 70 Sector, maybe even Col 70 Sector FY-N c21-3, although I would need to do further checks to verify that.

This is an interesting idea. Are you simply aligning your ship with the Thargoid exit vector and then targeting various systems until you find one that's directly in front of you? How many times have you done this? We need to try this from several thargoid-inhabited systems, ideally ones that are far apart.
