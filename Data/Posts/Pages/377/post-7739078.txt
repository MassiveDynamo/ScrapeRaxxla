Well, Through the emblem, we can understand what it is. Faction, planet, some kind of module in the game macro, region (for example, Lave, Lestee, Teoge ... where Lave is in the center, humans colony from the past) No alchemy. If it is in sight, and proceeding from the fact that there were no people in the habitable bubble, it was not only in the Witchs Reach system - I'm looking for something that we missed.

Raxxla is not my main occupation, I am more on aliens or Drew Wagar's clue; here I just see how the guys, along with the search, discover many things that are not related to the riddle ...very often they make progress. I'm interested.
That's not what I was responding to, you asked specifically about IRL connections to the circle and dot symbol of the "sun" which is a central pillar of alchemy as the symbol for gold (Au = Latin "aurum") and obviously, cosmology (which combined astronomy and astrology) from within the seven liberal arts.

You're welcome to go digging in a rabbit hole thousands of years deep if you like but those who practice such disciplines are well renowned for closely guarding their knowledge. Considering the FDev graphic design team may conduct occasional conspiratorial meetings the logic is probably not that complex.

Did you try decoding the thargoid probe spectrogram at all (scroll to the bottom)?
