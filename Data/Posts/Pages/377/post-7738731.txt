Someone just posted on Reddit that there's a hidden scientific installation in orbit around Delphi 2 with a beacon transmitting some sort of coded / cipher message. Not sure if it's Raxxla related, or Thargoid related or what. Can't check it out right now.

I tried a Caesarian Shift on the bit of code he posted, and a shift of 23 reveals "HQ" something.

You should edit your post. This was confirmed to be Eagle Eye 6. Nothing noteworthy.
