That's not what I was responding to, you asked specifically about IRL connections to the circle and dot symbol of the "sun" which is a central pillar of alchemy as the symbol for gold (Au = Latin "aurum") and obviously, cosmology (which combined astronomy and astrology) from within the seven liberal arts.

You're welcome to go digging in a rabbit hole thousands of years deep if you like but those who practice such disciplines are well renowned for closely guarding their knowledge. Considering the FDev graphic design team may conduct occasional conspiratorial meetings the logic is probably not that complex.

Did you try decoding the thargoid probe spectrogram at all (scroll to the bottom)?

Yes, but there is nothing new yet. Perhaps after tomorrow's update, something new will appear.
One guy claims that there are two ways to stop Thargoids, one by force, the other is not known. In the near future I am going to experiment with the motherships, while I collect information. Plus a lot of bugs, and it is not clear whether the script worked or not. Maybe the guys would have discovered something, but for now ... nothing new

As for the Raxxla Logo, I don’t understand the meaning of these symbols. If the answer with the Dark Wheel is in the encyclopedia, but I don’t find any familiar features with Raxxla. It looks like the hexagon of Saturn, the old type of scout Thargoids (from the old Elite, refers to the tetrahedral form), it is green - the color of peace, a circle with a dot may denote the solar system and Sol (or the planet as the center of something). That's why I asked the guys, maybe something will remind them. Maybe advertising in space docks, maybe a movie, maybe have seen such forms somewhere else.
