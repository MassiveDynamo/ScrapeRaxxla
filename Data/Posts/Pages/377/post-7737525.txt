I don't know if this helps, but I found out how to find nebula just by looking at the sky. They are always very small dots with very distinct bright halos around them. I saw one from cacoon nebula and followed it and it just stayed in the sky. Always the same brightness. Followed it and figured out what it is. If anything it will help identify certain objects via looking only at the stars in a system and instantly spot one. I've seen some other sustained object I have to follow still to figure out what they are.(Like possibly that bright yellow one possibly to the left of GCVR 950.) But there seem to be visual indicators to understand what you are looking at in the normal sky map. Should help eliminate possible objects and read the stars/sky.


As far as I can tell if you see this in the sky this is a guaranteed nebula star. Don't even have to look on the galmap. This is a much easier way to identify them from where you are. From what I can tell they always look exactly like this and can be seen from 1000's of light years away!

Basically, they have those tiny dots because they are so far away, but have those massive halos indicating massive brightness. Instant potential identification.

Those stars basically look exactly like that all the way back to cacoon nebula.(or at least GCVR 950) I'm not sure on the max distanct they display. That could actually be helpful in understanding the game more. Assuming that is not common knowledge.

Well, from your photo I can’t see what you mean as its indistinct, however I think I understand what you are saying.
Some distant nebulae do indeed appear as you describe (I remember chasing the Little Dumbell for several days and a couple thousand kylies until I isolated it in Galmap), but I don’t think they all do-just a couple.
