Not entirely sure you want to go digging in that rabbit hole.

DB did electrical, not alchemical engineering in college...
SPOILER
Well, Through the emblem, we can understand what it is. Faction, planet, some kind of module in the game macro, region (for example, Lave, Lestee, Teoge ... where Lave is in the center, humans colony from the past) No alchemy. If it is in sight, and proceeding from the fact that there were no people in the habitable bubble, it was not only in the Witchs Reach system - I'm looking for something that we missed.

Raxxla is not my main occupation, I am more on aliens or Drew Wagar's clue; here I just see how the guys, along with the search, discover many things that are not related to the riddle ...very often they make progress. I'm interested.
