Someone just posted on Reddit that there's a hidden scientific installation in orbit around Delphi 2 with a beacon transmitting some sort of coded / cipher message. Not sure if it's Raxxla related, or Thargoid related or what. Can't check it out right now.

I tried a Caesarian Shift on the bit of code he posted, and a shift of 23 reveals "HQ" something.

EDIT: Embarrassingly, this is just Eagle Eye 6 broadcasting a warning in the keyed Caesarian (key = invaders, shift = 0), for OU Geminorum. Canonn needs to edit its Eagle Eye page to replace Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 2 with its new name Delphi 2.

Thanks Yoda711 and everyone else. Sorry.
