in 1105 those voice would be 'holy visions' or 'witchcraft'
in 2015 we know they are 'auditory hallucinations' and can be a symptom of schizophrenia amongst other mental health issues
in 3305 they are again 'holy visions' but this time its 'aliens'

Come on, we can do better than this.

Holy visions from schizophrenic aliens!
Or is it schizophrenic visions from holy aliens??

Edit: ifirc there were some similar happenings mentioned in a couple of the early generation ships logs
