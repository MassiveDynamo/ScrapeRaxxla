Thatchimo - Spoiler? as you give lot of info about RT missions...which I haven't done yet.

IF its neural-connections 'radio waves' I can just about live with that, cheesy as hell but completely different to 'visions' from within.

tbh Ive read all those GalNet articles and all the logs so far about 'visions', 'lights', whispers' etc as clear signs of mental ill health or even a total breakdown as thats exactly what they look and read like. You have to apply a 'vision' filter through rose-tinted galsses to get anything alien or unusual at all. If you met them on the street youd think 'Crsis' not 'OMG this person is in touch with aliens'
I've completed all the Ram Tah missions a couple of times and the data you get while doing them is confusing at best because you tend to collect it out of order, completely overwhelming at worst. If you hunt around a bit there are guides, maps and complete sets of all the information in the correct order.

The Canonn site might be a good place to start, I forget where I found and collated the run data.

[Edit: Some of the sites appear to have underground bunker entrances. Maybe we'll get inside?]
