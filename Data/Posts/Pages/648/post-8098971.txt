The behaviour of this particular thread is a little, odd. Maybe due to the tinfoil?

Despite trying several times to kill them I still get emails for every, single, post...

At top of page select your Cmdr icon/preferences/watched threads
For each specific thread(s) there is a small check box, select it.
At bottom of list of the watched threads there’s a pulldown box named “With selected”, select the “disable email notifications” option, then press the GO button.
