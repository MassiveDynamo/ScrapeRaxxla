An extra bit of speculation to throw in in the context of visions in the history of humanity’s expansion into space. Perhaps these were active things, or perhaps they were responsive to certain events. Certainly the discovery of the Mars Relic is something that stands out as a potential trigger point.

There’s other things that aren’t as obvious though. That lock on the Regor Sector didn’t just get there by itself...

The visions (Halsey and Romero) in them self, aren't particularly surprising.
We know that Guardians had neural connection with AI and their monolith network. It is very likely that these AI continued to evolve after the elimination of the Guardians. Giving their own(AI) burgeoning society the best possible chance of survival, is the reason Ram Tah gives for the elimination.

For an untrained human mind a neural uplink to these entities and their network, would probably present itself as an unfamiliar and confusing experience.
