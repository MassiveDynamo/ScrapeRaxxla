I'm not suggesting that at all, but we are individually searching and not searching as any type of coordinated team or group, with no tools to assist in the search.

Compared to what Canonn and their website is doing for the search for Thagroids, we might as well be playing solo.
It's a very different proposition though.

How do you co-ordinate a search or create a tool to help you search if you don't know what it is you're actually searching for?

Take the EDMC plugins - basically they're 'read specific events from player's journal and transmit them via the ED Data Network'. So the question in terms of building a plugin is what journal events that aren't already being picked up are we looking for in terms of searching for Raxxla? Unless there's a clear, well defined answer to that question, then there cant be a plugin.
