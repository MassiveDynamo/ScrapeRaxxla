I always had the feeling that the Raxxla Quest (I mean the quest ) had ended when the E/F missions disappeared and/or when MB left/was put aside.
Raxxla may very well be in game, but no longer/for now, findable nor is The Quest running, imho. That's why nobody knows what he is doing.
Keywords, like SAP 8, Trinkets of HF, etc.. were replaced by far fetched poetry and mythology. GalNet events have no continuity (Romero..), The Dark Wheel SD faction has become open to anybody as soon as you manage to undock from Eravate and even the Thargs are tired of so much inconsistency. Meh...
Only thing, perhaps, the Icon. But even this is not sure.
And it still is Macro's fault !
