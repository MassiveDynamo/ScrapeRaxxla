I guess I'm a "Rifter" and an "old grumpy individualist old school explorer" but not afflicted with space madness. I'm 64 and only play Elite to search for Raxxla.

I'm awestruck and dumbfounded by the stories some have done in search of Raxxla. I guess I don't know the crowd I'm dealing with.



Granted, but how does a plugin for EDMC which searches for the unknown location of Thagroids differ from looking for the unknown location of Raxxla. Both are unknown locations and no one has any information what-so-ever on the location of Thagroids, their home world or undiscovered bases. The Canonn plugin just sends you on searches for the suspected locations, based on nothing more than someone elses speculations. We know nothing more about the possible locations of Thagroid bases as we know about the possible location of Raxxla. In both cases, we are searching in the dark for both, but one we have a plugin for.

Could you post a link to the plugin or relevant part of the website?

What you’re describing sounds partly like something I’m aware of but could be something different, so I wouldn’t want to make an incorrect assumption and give an answer on the wrong basis.
