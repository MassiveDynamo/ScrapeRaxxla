He does not confirm or deny it. He says it's a silly question and Ed says probably. He said Fdev knows where it is, but not that it's in the game. Could just be a screensaver, at the hq. Yeah... we see it every 20 min of inactivity. Or perhaps it's what they call the break room. Lunch time, let's goto Raxxla.

At 13:43 “ does Raxxla exist ... what a silly question, of course!”

If that's not confirmation I don’t know what is.

Perhaps the summer heat is getting to people (I’m certainly suffering lack of sleep!) but a bit of salt seems to have crept into the last few pages. Please keep it friendly guys! We may not know what we’re searching for, where to look, or possibly even why why we’re still doing it. But we do it with a smile!
