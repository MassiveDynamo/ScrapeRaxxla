I'm not suggesting that at all, but we are individually searching and not searching as any type of coordinated team or group, with no tools to assist in the search.

Compared to what Canonn and their website is doing for the search for Thagroids, we might as well be playing solo.
We don't even know what we are looking for, never mind coordinating a search for it
