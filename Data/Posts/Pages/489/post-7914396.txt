Could be, yes.

The old Dark Wheel missions were the 'little bit obvious'.
Not that they were supposed to be a trail of breadcrumbs leading to Raxxla (that would be a LOT obvious), simply that they were the 'proof' that Raxxla was in the game.

There aren't any 'poetic clues'. There's a reference to a story with a similar name to a real poem, but that doesn't make it a clue - and the Codex specifically says that that theory is garbage anyway.

So we're still at 'There will be no clues', and here we'll stay.
