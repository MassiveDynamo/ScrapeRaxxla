I would be very amused if it turns out that you can find Raxxla just by stumbling on it.
"Centralized search plans ?" Not compatible with the personal journey statement. Imho.
But even this may need to be retconned, after all.

The thing with this thread is... well.. you know, Rifters (who populated it) are kind of old grumpy individualists old school Explorers with the brain fried by space madness.
Not the best people to get organized... There is even one who spent weeks looking for Cas A ! Yes, I swear !
Another one spent one year circumnavigating the MW because he read somewhere that Raxxla was obfuscated in the outer rim, but forgot the meaning of obfuscated !
Now, there is young and dynamic people doing just as you say:

But just like anyone, they also don't know what they are doing. Which is fine because that's what is..
