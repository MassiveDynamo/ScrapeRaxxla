So what exactly would it take to convince you that it is in the game, since you seem determined to believe that it isn't?

I am not determined to believe it isn't, search my posts, I posted graphics that are likely on Raxxla. And if it's there, there is likely some unknown mechanic. I searched for the Darkwheel a lot as well. All the permit unlocks, all the power play unlocks, triple elite, all generation ships visited, engineers unlocked, king and admiral ranks. CIEP , the Club, and Darkwheel all ignored the promotions.

I feel we have been forsaken. Even Cmdr Braben quit visiting the world. Perhaps Raxxla is the room he counts DLC income in. Or maybe he is just waiting for Fleet Carriers?
