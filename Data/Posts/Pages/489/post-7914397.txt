Anyone have tryed to erase the Minor Faction "Dark Wheel" from Shinrarta Dezhra and LFT 926??? I m currently trying it, they are in war

Shin, IIRC, isn't tied to the BGS that way. It'll always be controlled by the Pilots' Federation.
And you can't kick a faction out of their original system anyway.
But good luck.
