Regarding 'far fetched poetry and mythology', they're either deliberate clues, or obfuscation. I for one believe that at least some of them are the former. I think it may be a case of FDev not trusting people to just randomly stumble across it, and wanting to throw us a bone to chew on. I am curious about whether the SAP 8's and Trinkets still have any significance, or whether they were retconned out.

Regarding GalNet events not having continuity, there have always been "slow burn" GalNet stories. Halsey's ship disappearing, all of the seemingly obscure Salome movements, etc. I'm sure we'll see more of the Winking Cat burglar as well as Gan Romero. Personally, I prefer slow-burn stories. I don't want an entire story to belch up on GalNet and be done with while I'm working an 80 hour week, or on vacation.
