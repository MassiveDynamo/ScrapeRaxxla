But does he? I thought the only mention/allusion to this was when he mentioned "numbered stations" but it has generally become accepted that he meant to say "listening posts." Is there more out there than this? I can't imagine that Federal Station numbers have anything to do with Raxxla.

CMDR Naysayer, out.

Michael Brookes confirmed that DB the “number stations” meant ED listening posts & UCB. Somewhere early in this thread I provided the reference.
