Incidentally, (just been browsing while waiting 20 minutes for todays update!) reading the summary of AMA III thread and one question stood out:

"In the Codex, it says that the Guardian sites were found as a result of Halsey's visions. However in reality, they were found via images in a trailer. At the time, it was said that there had been something planned for how they were going to be found but that got cut off due to them being found via the trailer. Does the Codex version represent what should have happened rather than what did?

This is BEFORE my time but I would suggest that CODEX is the correct narrative"

So, if Halsey's visions were supposed to be the way Guardians were found.. then they are the "infinitiely small but infinitely large" caretakers of the galaxy (or similar phrasing, see her speechh on Galnet), so it seems she encountered somehow their AI Constructs (or disembodied Guardians are still around) via the guardian comms network. How did she do this??
