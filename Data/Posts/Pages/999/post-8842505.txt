Yeah Ram Tah's mission is the only choice however it won't guide you, nor it will record your findings. They will come as private messages on your comms panel.
In-game codex basically has everything you need to know.
Dear CMDRs, thank you for the information. o7

My return into the Raxxla quest will be with Ram Tah then.

The reason i'm asking you about guardian is that it makes more sense to believe that Raxxla is an artificial thing than a natural one. If it was natural we probably would have more than one so said 'Raxxla' phenomenon around the galaxy as we have other rare/uncommon oddities that have been figured out already. If it is artificial, it cannot be human made, because its information would've been leaked along the history so it must be alien, in this line of thought. Please note that i dont intend to bring the truth here, this is just the hypothesis i'll be working on.

If it's Alien, either it is thargoid origin or guardian, since those are the only known intelligent species so far. I don't know much about them to distinguish which one could be more relatable but i'm up to start working on that. Thargoids came from other galaxy if i recall correctly and guardians were killed by their own lost AI (since we see no signs of it around), yet they had incredible/mystic technology.

Does that make sense to you guys? Have you worked in this trend before? I've been reading the later posts, with a lot of discussion about guardians so that idea came to me.
