@Thatchinho: Ah, I thought the question style sounded familiar! No problem re Discord mate, RL always gets priority.

“The Guardians involved were exiled and are fate unknown. It’s not known if any AI went with them.” - did they go in one of the Ark ships? (I can’t remember the detail) just wondering if that is Raxxla. It would fit the general storyline-yes,the triangle theme has been evident for a while, particularly in PF messages, e.g. in UC data sales. It made me hypothesise that PF are actually run by Guardians/AI/descendants and (with the Mars Artefact clearly indicating alien presence in Sol in the distant past, & Ram Tah’s message decode re the Guardian influencing prey species etc) whether Humanity might actually be the result of Guardian manipulation to create a successor capable of beating the Thargoids (their implacabe enemies). Guardians tried peace negotiations with goids, which failed, so perhaps they started developing us as a response? Just might be another reason for Raxxla being near/within the bubble (but if it’s Triton/Luna I’m going to get angry because they’re permit locked!!).

(Edit: and it might explain why PF have locked the areas in question-perhaps we’re being protected until we stand a chance)

Someone reported a vague recollection that DB said Raxxla is like nothing else and we’d recognise it when we find it. MB reputedly said Raxxla’s system had been visited but it wasn’t detected/recognised. These are rumours, apparently contradictory, that I’d like to see solid references for, but they give me some hope that we can still attain the object of our quest!
