What wonders me, humanity put presence in whole Galaxy during 6 - 7 years game exists.
Now we have 2 alien cultures which were far more advanced and still we find it locked to small regions.

The permit locks are defined by the Pilot's Federation, and designed to stop humanity trespassing where they shouldn't yet! There's nothing to stop the goids moving anywhere they please as far as we know. Perhaps the PF is actually a collection of Lizards in Human suits? Ricardo Bentonio made a lot of good sense!
