If I wanted to know/read the guardian lore, to understand more about them, where could I find it in the game?
Yeah Ram Tah's mission is the only choice however it won't guide you, nor it will record your findings. They will come as private messages on your comms panel.
In-game codex basically has everything you need to know.
