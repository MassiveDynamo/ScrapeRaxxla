Thats consistent with the RPG which says the atmosphere on Exoice was left corrosive by the failed attempt.

The implication here is that the Thargoids attempted to terraform Mars in the ancient past, is it not?
Mmm, Thargoids or Guardians?
Being pedantic, Terraforming means making it like Terra (Earth), so unlikely to be Thargoids who like Ammonia atmospheres.
