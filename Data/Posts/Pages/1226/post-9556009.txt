I am just going to throw this out there that I am increasingly convinced the Cereberus plague was not a new plague at all. It seems to be a triple parasite much like the Soholia Fever from First Encounters. Both were cured via a special tea. In Elite Dangerous the cure was Ceremonial Heike Tea. I did some digging in Galnet (via Independent Raxxla Hunters Custodian tool) and there appears to have been efforts to make that good harder to get at times. If you look up Heike on Wikipedia it is a Japanese epic about a power struggle. I think there is lot more there than meets the eye.

I seem to remember the Soholian plague was implied to be related to the mycoid in FFE and then later in Lave Revolution it indicates that Walden was involved in the Soholian plague as wellâ€¦
