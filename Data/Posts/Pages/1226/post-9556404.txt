I thought the Duval artifact might have originated at Exioce (if Marlin Duval didn't leave Sol with the Martian artifact). It just wasn't 100% clear if we are dealing with a singular artifact that has made quite a journey or several of them. If that is the case, that we do have a separate one the story of Wanted appears to be about the Duval artifact. Regardless, the last known location was Jackson's Lighthouse (though Ji Khanguire was sent off with the artifact and a new identity towards the end of Wanted).
The Duval artefact is a statue, that is stolen in FFE. There is a mission to transport it: http://www.jades.org/missions.htm

According to the news in FFE, The relic, discovered on Achenar 6d in the early days of the Empire was treasured as an Inter Stellar Treasure and a perfect example of an ancient and novel uni-dimensional art form. this unique piece of uni-dimensional art work is the last surviving relic of an ancient and sentient race, wiped out by the Colonising Forces of Duval
