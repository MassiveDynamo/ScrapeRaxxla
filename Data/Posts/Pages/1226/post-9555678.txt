Yep, pretty sure I made that up first in my Elite fan-fic story "Mutabilis" back in.... wowzers... 2008. It's definitely not canon for ED (unless Fdev adopted the idea independently). Those novellas were written for Oolite and based on the original Elite lore.

Thanks Drew!
Must get around to rereading your Oolite series. I need a good read after the current (boring) murder mystery Iâ€™ve got. Gave up on two others after reading Thursday Murder Club 2 which I really enjoyed.
