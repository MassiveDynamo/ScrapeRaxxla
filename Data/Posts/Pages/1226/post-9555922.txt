The Duval Artefact is not the same as the Mars relic. It was made in Achenar, by Mudlarks.
I thought the Duval artifact might have originated at Exioce (if Marlin Duval didn't leave Sol with the Martian artifact). It just wasn't 100% clear if we are dealing with a singular artifact that has made quite a journey or several of them. If that is the case, that we do have a separate one the story of Wanted appears to be about the Duval artifact. Regardless, the last known location was Jackson's Lighthouse (though Ji Khanguire was sent off with the artifact and a new identity towards the end of Wanted).
