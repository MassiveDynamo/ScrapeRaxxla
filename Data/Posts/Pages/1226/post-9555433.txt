Just some thoughts about the missing Joker… The origin of the Joker card is the Fool. It is a card without a number… a Null card … also associated with Orion….. and today we are told of an Orion University … could they be behind the jokers deck? All connected to “the club” … of orion.

In Tarot The Fool generally means a beginning of a new journey
