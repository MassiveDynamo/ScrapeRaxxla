Mmm. Not sure about the wandering moon, the original source for that seems to be Drew Wagarâ€™s fan fiction novels which are not canon for ED.

Yep, pretty sure I made that up first in my Elite fan-fic story "Mutabilis" back in.... wowzers... 2008. It's definitely not canon for ED (unless Fdev adopted the idea independently). Those novellas were written for Oolite and based on the original Elite lore.

You can read it here if you want to > https://www.ascorbius.com/drewwagaroolite

Cheers,
