See iv seen no actual proof of Jacksons cave bar the galaxy search, everyone keeps trying the neutron but what about the Class 5 gas giants or maybe on the outskirts like the voyager probes
Haven't done extensive searches on the fringes. Per Wanted there is a disused station from when it was inhabited (before the gravitational collapse) by the Federation that is in a stable orbit of 2 light-minutes out from Jackson's Lighthouse (but operates with very low power - sound familiar?). The Cave is supposed to be exceptionally close to Jackson's Lighthouse.
