I wouldn't put to much on that detail. The RPG writers were probably just spinning on the old Gazetteer article. The Gazetteer is sort of half lore. FD has reused a lot of it, but not followed it accurately. At the time of FE2/FFE, FD already had plans for the return of the Thargoids and at least one more alien race. Only the Thargoid encounters materialized in the games, so we can't know how they had it planned.

The makers of the RPG would have had the same info as the book authors. All they knew of Raxxla was that it was of limits and that TDW hadn't found it.
I am just going to throw this out there that I am increasingly convinced the Cereberus plague was not a new plague at all. It seems to be a triple parasite much like the Soholia Fever from First Encounters. Both were cured via a special tea. In Elite Dangerous the cure was Ceremonial Heike Tea. I did some digging in Galnet (via Independent Raxxla Hunters Custodian tool) and there appears to have been efforts to make that good harder to get at times. If you look up Heike on Wikipedia it is a Japanese epic about a power struggle. I think there is lot more there than meets the eye.
