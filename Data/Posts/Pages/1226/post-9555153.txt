Mmm, if it’s just history may give it a miss, never was taken with history. And those remarks are a bit offputting.

Yes, Corr Fellian makes much of a second alien artefact in his theorising. Interesting that it relates to terraforming.

The possible application of a “small child’s hand-sized artefact” for terraforming Mars is presumably FD making a humorous reference to the Total Recall film (I liked the Arnie version) where a huge alien subsurface terraforming machine was triggered by a hand placed in the console indentations. If so it doesn’t reduce my faith in the Raxxla in Sol hypothesis since it still proves that aliens visited Sol (& presumably attempted to terraform Mars, so they were settlers).

But if another similar to the mars artefact was found on Exioce then that would pose another possible location. We know there were 3 Guardian arkships, so maybe another one somewhere?
