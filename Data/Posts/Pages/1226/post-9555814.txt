Maybe, but if Exioce was 'terraformed' by the Thargoids, and the same type of artefact was found there as on Mars, it would seem likely that the artefact was thargoid in origin wouldn't it?
I wouldn't put to much on that detail. The RPG writers were probably just spinning on the old Gazetteer article. The Gazetteer is sort of half lore. FD has reused a lot of it, but not followed it accurately. At the time of FE2/FFE, FD already had plans for the return of the Thargoids and at least one more alien race. Only the Thargoid encounters materialized in the games, so we can't know how they had it planned.

The makers of the RPG would have had the same info as the book authors. All they knew of Raxxla was that it was of limits and that TDW hadn't found it.
