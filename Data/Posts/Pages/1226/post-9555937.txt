Any other mentions of the Ryder family, TDW or Raxxla?
I will have to research that ... there was section in the Elite Encounters RPG discussing the origins of CMDRs being approximately during GalCop. I working to get a better idea of when the ships arrived at Teorge and that cloning program happened vs Dr. Walden (whom I believe came to power towards the end of the GalCop era). I have a sneaking suspicion that Teorge happened first then Dr. Walden took that for his own followed by the Imperials stealing the tech from Dr. Walden after GalCop's collapse.
