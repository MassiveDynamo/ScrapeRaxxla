Thats consistent with the RPG which says the atmosphere on Exoice was left corrosive by the failed attempt.

The implication here is that the Thargoids attempted to terraform Mars in the ancient past, is it not?
More likely the Guardians. An ammonia prepped planet would not have been much use for humans (except for all the barnacles).
Attempts at terraforming Mars failed, until shortly after the relic was discovered. The relic may have given blue prints or started a hidden terrafoming machine.
The relic could also be unrelated to the terraforming, but that wouldn't be much fun.
