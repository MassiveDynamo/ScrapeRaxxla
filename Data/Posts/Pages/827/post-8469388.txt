well if anyone wants to help me, lol...

I was looking at these three systems; Maia - Polaris - Zeta Cassiopea
They make a near perfect triangle on the galmap...

Not quite a perfect triangle but here it is with centroid marked.
SPOILER: TRIANGLE

The way I like to do these is get the XYZ coordinates from EDDB then import them into Sketchup (a free 3d design program) - then some touch ups in photoshop. Its relatively painless - just keep an eye on the XYZs as they can be interpreted differently by various software.
