Not quite a perfect triangle but here it is with centroid marked.
SPOILER: TRIANGLE

The way I like to do these is get the XYZ coordinates from EDDB then import them into Sketchup (a free 3d design program) - then some touch ups in photoshop. Its relatively painless - just keep an eye on the XYZs as they can be interpreted differently by various software.

Awsome, thanks!! gonna find that spot tomorrow and head out! Gonna search atleast 20 systems in that area, see what happens!
