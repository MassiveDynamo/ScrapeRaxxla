The way I like to do these is get the XYZ coordinates from EDDB then import them into Sketchup (a free 3d design program) - then some touch ups in photoshop. Its relatively painless - just keep an eye on the XYZs as they can be interpreted differently by various software.


And LOL, i love how you put "import them into sketchup"" and "relatively painless" lmao i cant even figure out how you would create what you did, lmao, I just tried to recreate what you did, but I dont see any place to input direct coordinates for the corners lmao

EDIT: I can find the text tool to SEE the coordinates, but cant find a place to enter them to move the triangle
