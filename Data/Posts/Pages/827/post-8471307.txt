Update there A/B/C coordinates, take from EDSM
In "main" (very bottom) update what u want to find, currently it gives center of circle inside triangle ABC. I.e. it is a point on equal range from AB-BC-CA routes.
It will print a link to query edsm, just paste in browser.

But..for example, i did'nt finish "equal remote from a-b-c" - as it will be line intersecting surface abc. Need 4th point.
