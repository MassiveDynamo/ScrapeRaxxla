Well, if it’s close to RA 20 then could this actually be Raxxla or the way to it? It could be a “rift in spacetime” that is the Omphalos Rift mentioned in the Codex. Maybe you have to find it, travel through it to Raxxla (or maybe the rift is Raxxla?) which would be in its own instance, then the second “rift” is the return journey? Just speculating on game mechanics, this phenomenon that you’ve observed, one hypothesis (Right Ascension) we have discussed many times over the last few years, and the Codex details-this hypothesis would fit them all. DB did say we dont know what it is! The journey to it would be a “personal journey”. It certainly looks cool, and is sufficiently different from anything else in-game to be a worthy find.

I think you said before that it can also be observed from Alpha Centauri too-that should give three directions for triangulation? Assuming we can triangulate from the system maps!? We ought to be able to, at least in the orrery view.

Edit: alternative interpretation- it is a rift within/between those three systems allowing instantaneous travel between them?

This one is from Alpha Centauri.


It's a single, as far as I can tell. It's far more difficult to find, than the two out in Cygnus. Longer wait and lasts shorter. There is also more bodies in aCen, for i to hide behind.
It's is the same type of object though.

As you can see from the pics, they take their colour from the main star. Yellow in aCen, blue in SOI and white in aCyg.
