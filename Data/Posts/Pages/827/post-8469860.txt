That pic reminds me of an asteroid. Maybe all of those things are coloured as they are because they are reflecting the parent star's light?

Hmm...

But why, if an asteroid, does it show up in only three systems? Why doesnâ€™t it show in all other systems that we know have asteroid belts? Why only show in system map after a minute or so? I find it hard to believe that a graphics bug of asteroids would only show in 3 systems.
