Eyes to see or not to see

Within the Codex it states the clues to Raxxlas location were hidden, for those with eyes to see.

What if this is actually a hint towards the opposite, to blindness?

John Milton author of Paradise Lost (MB favourite story) like Philip Sidney (a contemporary) wrote about Arcadia as well, Arcades.

If you dont recall my rambbling about Arcadia, look no further: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8293878

Now I never gave Milton much thought but Milton was also thought to have been blind. In his writings Milton also relates to blindness and prophecy especially the character within Greek mythology, Phineus.

He was a king of Salmydessus in Thrace and seer who appears in accounts of the Argonauts' voyage. Some accounts make him a king in Paphlagonia or in Arcadia.
