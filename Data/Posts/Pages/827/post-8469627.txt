This one is from Alpha Centauri.

It's a single, as far as I can tell. It's far more difficult to find, than the two out in Cygnus. Longer wait and lasts shorter. There is also more bodies in aCen, for i to hide behind.
It's is the same type of object though.

As you can see from the pics, they take their colour from the main star. Yellow in aCen, blue in SOI and white in aCyg.
That pic reminds me of an asteroid. Maybe all of those things are coloured as they are because they are reflecting the parent star's light?

Hmm...
