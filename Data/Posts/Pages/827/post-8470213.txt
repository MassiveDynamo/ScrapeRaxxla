But why, if an asteroid, does it show up in only three systems? Why doesnâ€™t it show in all other systems that we know have asteroid belts? Why only show in system map after a minute or so? I find it hard to believe that a graphics bug of asteroids would only show in 3 systems.
Corrupted memory some sort? Good conditions to happen are only in those 3 systems. Btw, was it 3? I think 2 ... Post a list of names plz, maybe will check too.
