And also, you don't get anything to select. Your composition scanner gauge just goes from the red "nothing found" status to a blank blue status, then you can use it.

fairly sure it was blue the second or third time I used it, but still didn’t show the find in my codex. There really ought to be some feedback on screen that it’s registered something.

edit: ah, got it to work this time, and of course there’s visual feedback! Just needed to get to something like stable near-horizontal attitude so the reticle stayed over a single mound long enough to register. Doh!

if anyone wants to investigate there are 13 biologicals (3 are bark mounds, assume the rest are also) plus several geologicals on IC 4694 Sector ye-a d21 3a
