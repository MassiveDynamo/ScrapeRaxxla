Possible lead here. Codex says that there may be hints in the story for those with eyes to see it (or something like that). Sonnet 42 is all about eyes
42

Oh eyes, which do the spheres of beauty move,
Whose beams be joys, whose joys all virtues be,
Who while they make Love conquer, conquer Love,
The schools where Venus hath learn’d chastity;
Oh eyes, whose humble looks most glorious prove
Only lov’d tyrants, just in cruelty,
Do not, oh do not from poor me remove,
Keep still my zenith, ever shine on me.
For though I never see them, but straightways
My life forgets to nourish languish’d sprites;
Yet still on me, oh eyes, dart down your rays:
And if from majesty of sacred lights,
Oppressing mortal sense, my death proceed,
Wracks triumphs be, which Love (high set) doth breed.
O, eyes that move the spheres of beauty,
Whose rays are joys, whose joys are all the virtues:
Who while they force love to conquer, in turn conquer love,
The schools where Venus has learned to be chaste:
O eyes where humble looks prove to be most glorious,
To be beloved tyrants, just in their cruelty:
Do not, O do not, take yourselves away from me:
Keep above me in the zenith, and always shine on me.
Since though I never see them without my life
Immediately forgetting to nourish its own weary spirits,
Yet still dart your rays down on me, O eyes:
And if my death is caused by the majestic power
Of your sacred lights, oppressing mortal sense,
Disasters that noble love creates are triumphs.

My first interpretation is that we want to be looking for an O class star. Maybe tinfoil is too tight

Rays and beams, like the rays and beams from a neutron star?

I wonder if Raxxla is in a system that requires a Neutron Star boost, and a leap of faith with no way back?
