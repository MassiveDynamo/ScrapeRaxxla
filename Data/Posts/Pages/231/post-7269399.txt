Hmm, you weren't scanning the one in the Little Dumbell nebula were you? Those are technically just in Elysian Shore rather than inner Orion arm and seem to bugged.

no, I’m still around col 285/385/etc looking for Raxxla......
gave up on that blob hunt when you identified it as Little Dumbell. Knew I’d seen it somewhere before! I looked in galmap at all the known RL nebulae from Dr Kaii’s list while checking out the startup image for clues.
