I've been flicking through the last few pages to try and somewhat catch up on where people are at with the investigation. Good to see people investigating a possible link with Astrophel and Stella. I wonder if anyone has given any thought to the version of the book on Google Docs, and the various scribbles that can be seen on pages of the book. Sometimes numbers, sometimes words. Upon Googling one of the number sequences, I came across a book which seems to record full moons, and their date and time. May have some connection perhaps?

Also, the line in Sonnet 9 - ' The doore by which sometimes comes forth her Grace' - Could possibly mean something. Perhaps an entrance, which sometimes opens. If referring to the full moon logs above, perhaps when a full moon is in the sky? Where? No idea. But I'm tinfoil hatting super hard right now.

Also in the codex the "Those with eyes to see" line (referring to possible hidden clues within the book) - That line specifically seems too cluey to not be pointing at something.


Just some thoughts. Again, may have already been mentioned previously.
