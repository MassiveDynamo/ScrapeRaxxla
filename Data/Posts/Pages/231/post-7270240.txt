Ok, scanned a system, probed a planet where there were biological signals, went to surface & found two sites of bark mounds, tried to use composition scanner but fired heat sinks instead (think I need to sort my firegroups!) , carried on with my journey, checked codex & I hadnâ€™t found the biologicals.
How do I confirm a sighting? Do I have to get out in the srv to scan them??

It is a bug and was already reported. The same happened to me with pumpkins somewhere else.
