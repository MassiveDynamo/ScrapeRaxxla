Given the Guardians extensive use of crystals, the data crystals could in the end be shown to be related to them.
From what I gather, IF Raxxla is a planet or object, the Guardians appear likeliest to be the ones who protect it. By all means, it would be nice to find out.
Also the SuperMan Crystal has been made and can store 360TB of data, Forever.
