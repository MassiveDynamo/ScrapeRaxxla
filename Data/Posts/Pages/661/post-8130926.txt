Hey, welcome back stranger!
Sounds like you might need to reload Horizons?
Thanks commander, glad to see some familiar faces still kicking around

I think you are right, going for a full reinstall today and will see how I go later tonight. So many new and interesting things to catch up on. Spent a good hour last night remapping my custom control bindings haha luckily I had my screenshots still saved of my previous setup.

Edit: Thought I should also mention there is a Delphi related security installation orbiting Pluto. Pretty sure it would have been checked out by now, but can anyone please confirm if there has been a full scan done of all the data points? I got one of them, but didnâ€™t get a chance to scan them all last night, as I was quite tired and there was at least one that was within the trespass zone.

I did scan the mega ship nearby, which gave me a flight log with a list of systems, but again I did not follow that up before retiring for the night.
