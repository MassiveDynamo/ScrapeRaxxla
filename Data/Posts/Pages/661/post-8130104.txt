Haha yeah thanks mate, but I have been trying to land on Charon to catch the ferry over to the underworld, no luck at all.

Has been a long time since I played, and although I had a nice time playing around with the exploration changes that have been added since I was last on, having a large portion of the game decide it wouldn’t work was certainly frustrating.

What’s most annoying is I can change my goofy Holo me through station services, but when I try and land planetside I get a big error message saying “Horizons Required” or something.

Just about my whole fleet is docked at a Planet base. Guess I will just float here in the Asp for a while ¯\(ツ)/¯

Hey, welcome back stranger!
Sounds like you might need to reload Horizons?
