I was wanting to head over to Sol to check out the plutoids and touch down on Persephone (Planet 9) for the night.

Just due to some late night thinking about Pluto, a Planet that isn’t a Planet, and the door that is also the key (♇), as well as a few other tinfoil induced thoughts about Greek mythology.

However, a bug is preventing Horizons from working for me.

Coincidence or Conspiracy?
