Nice! So all you need is VR?
Noting your new avatar Six6VI.....
Reading up on that book now. It appears to be pretty amazing. It also appears to have ties to Ecclesiastes 1.17 according to wiki.
"And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit."
"The simulacrum is never that which conceals the truthâ€”it is the truth which conceals that there is none. The simulacrum is true." -wiki

It all appears very buddhist. Life is a lie. Physical reality is false. Though it seems to also say that wisdom is junk, which is the hard part.
I can understand when someone says that physical reality is a lie, and even much of the mind, but to say that wisdom is useless to search for, that's tough.
Wisdom leads to understanding, and without understanding how could you figure out it's all crap and a waste of time?

When I posted my last video on Twitter as a farewell Drew Wagar responded to it with two words. Ecclesiastes 3. (If you're reading this Drew, I promise I'm trying.)
