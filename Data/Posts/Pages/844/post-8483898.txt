Has anyboody been able to give this a try?? yesterday it was driving me crazy that I could not drop out at that location without some crazy non-sense happening, and Im curious if its a bug, or just im eperienceing it, or what... if anyone has a chance, would be much appriciated if you could give the location a quick visit and let me know what happens
I dropped in on it a day or two back and it was orbiting faster than my Cobra III could go, I jumped back to it a couple of times but no joy. Maybe with an engineered (faster) ship you could keep up with it.

I vaguely remember seeing and reading about something similar a few months back, can't remember if it is the same location or if there are others.
