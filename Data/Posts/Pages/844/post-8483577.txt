Its considerably different combat than pvp in your own personal engineered murderships thats for sure. Pip management is vital same with throttle control. So much different than blasting it out with npcs. Im serioulsy surprised its not more popular. Git gud at cqc and not a ganker in the galaxy can ruin your plans
