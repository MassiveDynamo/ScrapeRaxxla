OK, heres a new one.....

Has anyone ever tried to visit "Zeta Universe Co." in Tionisla system?

I cant seem to visit it, lmfao.... I drop from SC and some non-sense happens... lmfaao..... I cant fidn a reason for it...

PLEASE someone else go there and see what is going on, lmao

Has anyboody been able to give this a try?? yesterday it was driving me crazy that I could not drop out at that location without some crazy non-sense happening, and Im curious if its a bug, or just im eperienceing it, or what... if anyone has a chance, would be much appriciated if you could give the location a quick visit and let me know what happens
