By the way, if you are in Tionisla what do you make of Tionisla 9 rings - I can scan the inner one but not the and harder to see outer one. Was wondering if this is common as I can't remember seeing any ring of that size before or such a large gap between them.
On large rings you have to launch probe around planet to use it's gravity assist
