You have to come at it from the direction it is going i would assume. There are a few fast orbiting stations/outposts/installations i dont know them by name sorry.

Find its orbit path, get in front of it and it will come to you


I did try that, dropped in front of it, but it slammed into me, I didnt go with it, I just got smashed and spunn off like a top.....

But interesting to know that it may not be the only one unreachable...
