I dropped in on it a day or two back and it was orbiting faster than my Cobra III could go, I jumped back to it a couple of times but no joy. Maybe with an engineered (faster) ship you could keep up with it.

I vaguely remember seeing and reading about something similar a few months back, can't remember if it is the same location or if there are others.

Ok so its not just me, lmfao....

Im using an almost fully engineered Anaconda and cant keep up with it, it aslso appears the NPCs cant keep up, when they drop out near me, they get the same thing, station just takes off like a whip....

I thought when we dropped from SC, we were supposed to enter the stations "instance" and automatically keep up with its orbit due to the station having its own gravity....?

I dropped once infront of it, nd it slammed into me and just kept going while i got thrown like a rag doll
