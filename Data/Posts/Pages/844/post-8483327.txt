Ah yes, you fly through the deepest regions of space in your explora ship,
You face the dangers alone, overcoming the deepest despair of fernweh,
you finally find Raxxla,
you enter the Omphalos Rift!
you fly through a squirming hyperspace tube to....instance in...
Shin Dez in open and are immediately ganked by a wing of battle vettes!
