Im just curious if anyone else find this odd? that a station would be orbiting like that...

Online, I can find only one place where someone has posted screenshots from that location, so at some point it was accessible, but their investigations were not very indepth, and its posted in another language on another forum, lol, so google translate had to work hard for me lol

Seems like its an interesting place to try to visit by his pics, but I just cant get dropped out safely near it, lol
You have to come at it from the direction it is going i would assume. There are a few fast orbiting stations/outposts/installations i dont know them by name sorry.

Find its orbit path, get in front of it and it will come to you
