There a few 4xE's but none have reported anything exciting happening. Given how moribund CQC is and how FD have lost all interest in it, it would seem unlikely, or at least if it were, then they made quite a few enemies..

It'd actually make quite good pvp training if it weren't for the limited number of players, as above, you always end up with a ranked player with a much more deadly ship dominating the proceedings. Feel sorry for those guys who think that winning every round because you have proper shields and hull is fun.
It is absolutely not the ship that is deciding point in CQC. It's map knowledge and power ups! Invisibility or 100% damage boost is no joke. The best pilots in CQC can beat anyone in stock condor solely by using power ups and you won't be able to do anything.
