Its only a minor distinction but I believe that Braben said that Raxxla has been in-game since Gamma not Beta. Its pretty much the same thing but if there is a quote out there from DB stating that Raxxla has been in game since Beta I'd love to see it.
Ok ok so what on earth is the diff between gamma betta and alpha releases?
