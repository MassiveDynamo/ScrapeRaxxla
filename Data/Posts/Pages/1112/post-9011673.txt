Yes, I’m allied with them. Not run any missions for them for while but I remember an Elite tourist mission (about 7 businessmen) last Autumn from SD to a nearby tourist system about 13ly away, can’t remember the system name. Got several million Cr for 10 minutes run and an elite assassination mission as a follow-on. Didnt take it for roleplay (& rheumatism) reasons but did wonder if it was a recruitment test.
I check in on them, i have maxed rep with them and my carrier is assigned to them as a faction , every now and then i check for passenger trips and missions, but also 45mil to go to 25000 ly..no thanks! Il spend more in tritium!
