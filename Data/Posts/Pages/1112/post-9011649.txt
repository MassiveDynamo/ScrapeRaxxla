I'm sorry, but again I have a question off-topic. Someone said that the developers said that there is only one galaxy. What stars sky do the Targoids show us on their rig?
I dont know why it was sated there are no other galaxys....we have real world dwarf galaxy's within the milky way that are also in elite, skull and crossbones nebula has many interstellar other galaxy stars within it for example that do not belong nor orbit the milky way
