Is there somewhere a summary of all already known facts and theories on this search, that would be handy for newcomers to get up to speed quickly?
Honestly read the darkwheel novella book online and look at the codex entries, then statements from fdev, this is the most unwavering solid evidence,do not believe the statement someone has honked/visited the system, that's absolutely untrue! Just like those who lied and said they found raxxla or were very close, lies.. you can't say your close if you haven't seen it, you can't say its found with no photos..
