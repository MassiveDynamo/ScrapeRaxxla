CMDR Brown Beard might be on to something in Canonn. His thoughts copy and pasted from Discord: "To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies [Mu Andromeda]! To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void [Achelous, one of the few Sirens]! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts [Demeter]. To Raxxla!"


As seen from shinrarta. "The centroid is around -77, -3, -13".

Thoughts?
Do you know what this yellow star is?
