If i remember correctly the FFE plot spun around Polaris,
including the "Turner Class" ship.
Polaris is one of the brightest stars visible from earth.
Have the other objects in the "brightest star list" been checked out?
I think you need a very bright star, best with a big solar mass used as
a stellar beacon for long range travels.

Any ideas on how i can check what their designation is in E: D?
