Except that FDev told us the Romero story was fluff when they cut it all out of Galnet.
^ This.

FD embarassed themselves when their 'fluff' story send dozens of people on a wild goose chase looking for content that didn't exist. They communicated their embarassmenet, apologised , and the thread died.
Only consolation here is that they haven't said the same for the hunt for Raxxla.

You need to learn to search the forum before making a fool of yourself.

Notice - GalNet changes
Meh. "Show, don't tell." Put another way, if Frontier are interested in world-building (as they should be imho) there are better ways of doing it than what we've been getting via GalNet.

Was the Gan Romero story reflected in-game?
The Gan Romero storyline was always envisaged as an off-camera narrative. The fact that some people assumed it had an in-game component, and went searching for Romero, was for me further evidence that off-camera GalNet stories could be detrimental to the player experience, and cemented our desire to ensure that all GalNet content related to things that were actually in the game.
