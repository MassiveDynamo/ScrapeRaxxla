I'm good, CMDR. I've seen some of your recent posts. I'm not at all bothered about the dictatorial status of Lave or anything of the nature. FDev said Gan Romero was fluff. Same as the traveling holo-novelist. Carry on as you see fit, though, by all means. o7
For the record, the answer to Lakon Spaceways origin per Elite Dangerous is Earth (Sol) and that is stated plainly in the Codex entry for Lakon Spaceways. My purpose here is to assist in ending the danger of false knowledge. Perception is a double-edged sword. Bad data inputs means bad conclusions out. We are all better off when we are wiser. If you seek to understand the biggest mystery of Elite Dangerous, it may be advisable to make sure you understand the story, the major characters, major organizations, major events, how they interacted, and any alterior motives. Without understanding all that, you'll wander blindly.
