Bravo! That’s really insightful I like it.

We sometimes cannot see the wood for the trees, I like that logic, it fits neatly with how FD handled the retconned Dark Wheel missions in the Codex, I suspected this to be the same case with the Raxxla codex too; ‘don’t be looking at that old fluff, it’s nonsense - go here’.

It’s a bitter taste because still it’s difficult to comprehend even if you’re a new player ‘what’ it means.

But I think the Yggdrasil systems and John Milton content is potentially retconned, it fits with my hypothesis that Raxxla is unfortunately narratively locked to the Thargoids….

I hope to be incorrect.

I’m feeling rather jubilant so I may attempt to throw this hypothesis via a Comm Dev PM and see what happens, if the logic is sound then FD really ought to identify if we have uncovered a dead end?

Thanks I too wasn't expecting Raxxla to be linked to the Thargoids, and I'm a little sad that it might be, but equally I could (am probably) entirely wrong, so there's that!

I can't think of any way to take this further given just what's in the codex. I'm going to see if I have any further ideas specifically on the Dark Wheel, which may be a pathway to unlocking permit locks, maybe?!?!

Good luck in your PM's, I hope you get a result! keep us posted o7
