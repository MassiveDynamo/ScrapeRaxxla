I believe we are going to need the statement on that one with necessary context as they are very clearly present and not purged from Galnet. May I remind you, it was "The Hands of The Architects" that were "apprehended" but then allowed to stay aboard Jaques Station as it supposedly made a jump to Beagle Point. Sadly, that too seems to be misdirection and the area now called Colonia was the intended destination all along. The Hands of The Architects appear to have had a destination in mind all along.
