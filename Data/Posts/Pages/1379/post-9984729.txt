I figure I share this on here.

Author Begins Interstellar Book Tour
basically it's about a interactive holo novel.
I think Cunder was highlighting this little gem in which FDev basically admits it is written in such a way to be a "choose your own adventure" depending wholly on how much you invest in the effort. You can accept the story as given to you or rework it if you deeply invesgate the stories:

“After many months of waiting, the next book in Olav Redcourt’s pulse-pounding series is at last on sale. To mark the occasion, we have organised an epic tour so that loyal readers can meet the creator of the Corsair King, Lady Lastday, Roughkiss and all their other favourite characters. The tour will begin in the Blatrimpe system and conclude two months later in Procyon.”

On a personal note, "Galactic News: The Thargoids" appears to have numerous details from the first game. Lakon Spaceways codex also concurs on a more Earthly origins of the corporation. Also, kind of curious to see what systems that path would take you through when warping via economic travel mode and investigating POIs along the route.
