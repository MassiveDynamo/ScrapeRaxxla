Siren's were protecting Persephone in the fields before Hades kidnapped her, tore a rift in the ground, and brought her down below. The main thing with the argument that there are a myriad of myth's that fit the picture is that Persephone is the consistent figure from the Dark Wheel to the Codex. "Consistency in the fragmentary rumors."

We literally named the 9th planet in Sol after her and that moon fits one of the exact descriptions of what Raxxla could be.
There's that running idea that they may have placed it smack dab in our face the whole time, this would fit the bill.
edit* At this point I feel I'm being redundant about this, and as such, to save you all from the same feeling, I'll leave it at that.
