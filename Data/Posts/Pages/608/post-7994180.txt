Just FYI, Persephone in Sol system was not present until late in Horizons (2.3 or 2.4).
It also figured in the Formidine Rift 'mystery' - especially in the first phase.
Jupp. I think the Persephone link has been investigated inside out. Salomé went to Avalon and Persephone after her Sol trip, If I remember correctly.
I think it was meant to symbolise her going under ground. It was the transformation from Kahina to Salomé or something.
