I'm in agreement with not being the deepest void. Imo, that's death.
I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, that the regions were introduced along with the codex and the riddles within it.

It also goes against the idea that Raxxla should be within 200ish Ly from Sol due to the technological capabilities of the time,
but hey, being that no one knows what it is, anything is possible. Especially since there could be hidden aspects of the storyline we're unaware of.
