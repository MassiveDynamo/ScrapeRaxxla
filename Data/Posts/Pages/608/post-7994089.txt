Sirens gets complicated...

In the Persephone myth where they are created they can be referred to as Sirens of the Underworld as they serve the Queen of the Underworld, not sure whether they were bird-women at this point or later, at some point they became bird-women and later the Sirens of the Sea / mermaid type that we mostly know about...eg Jason and the Argonauts, Jason had himself tied to the mast so he could hear the song but not be lured, for.... reasons *edit, It was Odysseus who had himself tied to the mast, Jason had a musician play loudly to drown out their song so his crew couldn't hear them.

Problem is theres so many myths across so many cultures that fit certain bits

Edit: and theres a lot of sci-fi references in game and across multi-media

Edit Edit: Just read 2 stories, in one version Demeter gives the Sirens wings to aid in their search, in the other Demeter turns them into ugly old bird-women as punishment for not preventing the kidnapping. Contradictions, Yay!
