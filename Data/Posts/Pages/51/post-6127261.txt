It doesn't fit the myths though.

The myths say it's in another galaxy for starters. (That's got to be taken in conjunction with the likely retcon of the other galaxies from previous games to actually be distant parts of the milky way of course.)

TDW never found Raxxla.

Elite pilots being assassinated just for finding evidence that Raxxla existed - that's a complete mismatch with it being somewhere that all Elite pilots get access to.

64 ly from Sol isn't very far. Achenar is more than twice further away.

The name Shinrarta Dezhra came from one of the kickstarter supporters, not from FD.

There's also no need whatsoever for treasure from other universes in order to explain the PF's power.

Also, the state of commercial FTL tech =/= the state of human FTL tech.

I'm not aware of many of these things tbh. (myths about it being in another Galaxy?!?! The only reference to it not being found is not Lore, TDW short isn't Lore, so you an't use that as fact to prove/disprove, sadly.) There's no need for the PF's power to be explained by treasure, but that doesn't mean it's not

The name did come from a kicksterter backer, but it's unlikely Fdev let them pick whatever they wanted without oversight or it might have ended up Planet McPlanetface.

64ly from Sol is really far if you've got crappy slow hyperdrive. That people went further doesn't invalidate anything or you're saying Raxxla must be at Beagle Point

I got the permit as a Kickstarter backer.

Me too.
