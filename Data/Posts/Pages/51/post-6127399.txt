What exactly are you expecting Raxxla to look like right now then?

I'm expecting it to be a handcrafted system given a procgen name.
Raxxla itself is probably an atmospheric planet - so currently inaccessible, but I'd expect some in-system assets that can be interacted with.

In short, something for us to actually DISCOVER


Now it must be said that I thought roughly the same about the Rift mystery - that there was something mysterious to uncover - so my track record isn't great. However, if the other 'great mystery' of ED gets handed to us on a plate or turns out to be somewhere that has been visited countless times under a different name then I'm pretty sure I'm going to be hitting the uninstall option.
