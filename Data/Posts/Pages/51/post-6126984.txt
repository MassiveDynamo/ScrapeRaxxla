"It's in the Milkyway" - So are we
"It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves" - The journey to become Elite, blaze your own trail etc...
"You have to make some of it a tiny bit obvious so people know what they're doing" - When you've made that journey you are issued a permit... subtle covert nudge maybe?

The three major things Michael Brookes said when doing that interview a couple of year ago.

I've also heard there was confirmation that it has been in-game more or less since the beginning and that anyone can find it? Which implies, because of what was available at launch, Base Game only owners can find it (even if they cant interact with it now because of additional features made or whatever).

I think this all supports yours (and others) theory Moribus.

However, and I really don't know much about the lore surrounding this other than reading the OP... If the Dark Wheel 'lost' Raxxla, it is entirely possible that the base/station/moon/planet/gateway/ship/what ever it is, may periodically jump to a new location to keep itself protected. Not necessarily in a similar way to how we do, more likely a series of stationary jumps to a limited number of locations within a finite area so whoever made it could always locate it. As like you've said, if FTL technology wasn't as advanced back then, just moving to the other side of the system would present a huge challenge to find again.
