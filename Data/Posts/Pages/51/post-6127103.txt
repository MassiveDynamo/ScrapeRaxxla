I don't think it's Founders world. It's not 'Obfuscated In The Outer Rim'.

It could be another planet in Shinrarta Dezhra, though. That would still fit the general concept.

Perhaps a planet far out on the rim of the system, that does not show on honk?

Don't know really but if it's something like that, I would be quite happy with the implementation.

Sorry yes, that's more what I meant. I think it is likely somewhere in Shinrarta Dezhra, but not on the honkable/scannable planets.

Out of interest, would or was Shinrarta Dezhra ever considered an 'Outer Rim' system back in the days of early space travel when the bubble was a lot smaller? Because that could help towards that part of the puzzle. (Also that would be confusing and misleading, but then... obfuscated... maybe it was the outer rim but isn't anymore but is still called that to add a level of misdirection)


As a poorly worded side note:
From what I understand those missions are no longer in the game? (a quick google).
Because at the time I started playing I was completely unaware that it even existed, I never got a chance to get one of the missions, so without this thread I would never have known they existed, so personally, I feel they should count more as a way to get people interested in the mystery than evidence to its location.
If Raxxla is still findable for everyone, then there has to be a way to do it with no previous knowledge of those missions for those players starting after the missions disappeared.

I think the system permit being issues once you reach Elite is the nudge. hmmmm
