DrewC is right. Read the "Disclaimer" part.
However, I think we haven't found any X star class...yet, because we haven't found Raxxla....yet. X=exotic and Raxxla is 'exotic' I HOPE !
If we suppose Raxxla is a rogue Planet, it can't be of the common star classes (OBAFKML.....). A small doubt about Y dwarfs, as astronomers don't agree whereas known Rogue Planets being "dwarf" or "sub-dwarf".
Just Google it if interested. (My Anglich is to teribble for more...) It has to do with being >15 or <15 Jupiter masses. So I don't think Raxxla being so high G. If landable. So, no Y dwarf.
