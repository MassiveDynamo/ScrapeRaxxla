But we started from Sol, not Lave. And Shinrarta Dezhra is much closer to Sol than Lave is, and not that far from the same direction. Saying somewhere closer to Sol is too far from Lave really is not a valid argument.

Sure, I was just using Lave because that's where the original Elite started and that's when the Raxxla myths started for us. Who knows how it's been modified for ED, but I assume they'd keep it somewhere around there for old-times-sake.

Since it wasn't in Elite at all, then I kinda like that it's on the edge of GalCop space, then you could maybe feel like it was "just off the map" in the original game
