(a rogue planet, out of any system, star class X = exotic).

Is star class X actually a thing in the game???

Also is there a Raxxla discord.

and also also, I need to get this seperated in my head right, as you mentioned the formidine rift... are the rift and raxxla a separate things?

If so then how does COR link with Salome as their leader, and do they actually care about finding Raxxla? or is it just their group name, because there seems to be some crossover but it seems to be roleplay related??
