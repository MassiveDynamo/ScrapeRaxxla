As a simple man and Cmdr, I'll keep my hype and hopes simple too. The quest (personal journey) has to do with the Dark Wheel (tiny little bit obvious) and gaining rep, ranks and permits (only personal things in the game) for somewhere in the outer rim where it is 'obfuscated' (a rogue planet, out of any system, star class X = exotic).
