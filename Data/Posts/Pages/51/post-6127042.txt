The three major things Michael Brookes said when doing that interview a couple of year ago.

I've also heard there was confirmation that it has been in-game more or less since the beginning and that anyone can find it? Which implies, because of what was available at launch, Base Game only owners can find it (even if they cant interact with it now because of additional features made or whatever).

I think this all supports yours (and others) theory Moribus.

I don't think it's Founders world. It's not 'Obfuscated In The Outer Rim'.

It could be another planet in Shinrarta Dezhra, though. That would still fit the general concept.

Perhaps a planet far out on the rim of the system, that does not show on honk?

Don't know really but if it's something like that, I would be quite happy with the implementation.
