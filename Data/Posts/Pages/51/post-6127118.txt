Hmm, good point, however is it possible that you could see Shinrarta as the Outer Rim of the Old Worlds?

If the myths just kept the terminology of "The Outer Rim", that rim would shift outwards, the meaning would change.

Given the jump ranges involved and how crazy hyperdrive in the past was, travelling there from Lave probably wasn't that easy, there's 1,174 star systems in the 57ly range from Lave, so even if you know the exact range you need to travel, there's over 1000 star systems to search - Back then that would have been a huge haystack to hide a needle - interestingly it's not a million miles away from the total number of star systems in the original Elite game (including the other "galaxies").
