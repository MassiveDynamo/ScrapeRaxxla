I got the permit as a Kickstarter backer.

I too have the permit somehow even though I missed out on the Kickstarter (reason = procrastination). I suspect it was given to me when I purchased the life-time season pass (which I am concerned may turn out to be a waste of money now).

Not visited the Founders' World yet though...
