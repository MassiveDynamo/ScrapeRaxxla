Speaking of HIP 13044 the fact that stars exist outside the navigational part of galmap and the whole "Blaze your own trail" comment, Blazing your own trail would mean not following a pre determined path but one you route yourself (through nav panel etc) now could there be a potential path of stars to the M Clouds or Andromeda that we just cannot see or have found yet? also the Milky way has 2+ galaxy's that spin around our Sag A centre black whole and are not part of our galaxy but orbit it these could also be navigable this way, Its no Raxxla but interesting to search and be one heck of an accomplishment
