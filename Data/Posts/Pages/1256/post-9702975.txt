what you whant is simply not posible. Although the caltulation would be easy. (just everyday phytagoras), there is no Data to do those calculations whit.
there are not eve 0.01% of the stars in any database.
The Stars are proceduraly generated. And as long as we do not know how StellarForge works, we need to collect the data needed by hand. wich would only need a couple million years. and what would such a tool help anyways. It would generate an unbarable amount of secondary data. Draw a line from Sol to Sag A* 10k -100k - or maybe even a Million Stars near this line.
Your 100% right, if you do somthing like sol to sag A, it would be stupid.... but I plan on looking at much shorter distances in much less dense star space, so my data set would be limited for a few hundred stars at most.....

And the point being, if Raxxla is moving between systems, it's on some form of predetermined or predictable path, as stated in the now likely uncannon, but who knows stories, where Raxxla was found, and they met future versions of themselves who tell them Raxxla indeed moves and they will find it again, when the time is right....

So if we in theory have atleast 2, possibly more, locations where we believe Raxxla to have been in the past, they can be used to calculate the trajectory and rough speed/intervals of Raxxla, and allow us to project a possible next set of locations and dates ect....
But basically yes, without the actual galmap in the game allowing me to plot potential courses between stars manually, based on math or specific trajectories, im probably S.O.L on testing my theories anytime soon....

Which sucks cuz I really think this is the way to go, and we have the information we need to do it, just not the tools do it
