Read two posts above your question, it was already answered.


Ok, next theory I have for Raxxla is my biggest on-going theory.... but I need some help to see if it's even possible at all....

Does anyone know, is there a tool or 3rd party site, ect, that I can use to see a potentially ploted course, outside of the game? As well as get information about systems and there distances, but like specifically, like the straight line distance between two systems, vs the route plotting distance, ect....?

My theory revolves around Raxxla being mobile, and changing systems periodically, either in a circular way or in a continuous way, and that the clues we have point to systems the may be required to calculate/track Raxxlas' current position....

But doing this on the galmap in game is nearly impossible.... I need to check straight line distance and direction between two systems, and be able to potentially extend that "path" into a projected/unknown area/distance; Or if it's a curved course, be able to extend the curve/manipulate it.....

Any ideas?

The (short) distance between 2 objects in space is:

distance = squareroot((xa-xb)²+(ya-yb)²+(za-zb)²)
where System 1 has coordinates (xa, ya, za) and System 2 has coordinates (xb, yb, zb).

Now the system coordinates are the coordinates of the main star (but not always). You can find them on 3rd party tools.

If Raxxla is moving, maybe the weekly tick makes it move to another system (because i don't think fdev have the tools/abilities to move objects without loading an instance).
