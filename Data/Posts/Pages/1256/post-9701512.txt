Awesome discovery!

In Odyssey, you have to write Z3non_RAXXLA_Bj5 WE-A H17-to at least show a fragment of result.
Starting from Z3non_RAXXLA_Bj5 WE-A H17-1 it seems that the last one is not Z3non_RAXXLA_Bj5 WE-A H17-11 but Z3non_RAXXLA_Bj5 WE-A H17-42
42, the answer of questions on universe? .

I'd like to know HOW this "Z3non_RAXXLA_Bj5 WE-A H17-1" was found in the codex.

EDIT:

I have this list (different than ) :


Some "Z3non_RAXXLA_Bj5 WE-A H17-??" are following a same GalMap system but some are coming more often such as HIP 9221.
I Don't have data but in eddb.io 2 bodies are missing for :
Planet 9 and 10. BUG?

I was bored, now i have 48 systems to explore
Click to expand...
Me to... where in the codex is this found...
