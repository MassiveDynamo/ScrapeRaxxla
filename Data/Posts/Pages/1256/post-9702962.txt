what you whant is simply not posible. Although the caltulation would be easy. (just everyday phytagoras), there is no Data to do those calculations whit.
there are not eve 0.01% of the stars in any database.
The Stars are proceduraly generated. And as long as we do not know how StellarForge works, we need to collect the data needed by hand. wich would only need a couple million years. and what would such a tool help anyways. It would generate an unbarable amount of secondary data. Draw a line from Sol to Sag A* 10k -100k - or maybe even a Million Stars near this line.
