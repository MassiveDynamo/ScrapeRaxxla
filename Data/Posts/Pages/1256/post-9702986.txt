Your 100% right, if you do somthing like sol to sag A, it would be stupid.... but I plan on looking at much shorter distances in much less dense star space, so my data set would be limited for a few hundred stars at most.....

And the point being, if Raxxla is moving between systems, it's on some form of predetermined or predictable path, as stated in the now likely uncannon, but who knows stories, where Raxxla was found, and they met future versions of themselves who tell them Raxxla indeed moves and they will find it again, when the time is right....

So if we I theory have atleast 2, possibly more, locations where we believe Raxxla to have been in the past, they can be used to calculate the trajectory and rough speed/intervals of Raxxla, and allow us to project a possible next set of locations and dates ect....
But basically yes, without the actual galmap in the game allowing me to plot potential courses between stars manually, based on math or specific trajectories, im probably S.O.L on testing my theories anytime soon....

Which sucks cuz I really think this is the way to go, and we have the information we need to do it, just not the tools do it

If you don't need the Systems there is a way to get the Boxels on a path and then only test if systems exist in those. but my programming skills are far from 3d development, i would not be able to get something whit visuals. i do all my cal either whit SpreadShet or by hand i have a littel lib for for getting the boxels from the ID but thats it.
