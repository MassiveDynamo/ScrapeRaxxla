I posted pics of similar. The larger circle around the mailbox also has similar shapes made of 6/5/4 smaller dashes. Also that shape is the reticule for the system map. The back of the interior of the station is also seemingly the outside of the raxxla image. The only thing I haven't seen nearly exact references too are the 18 dashes in the hexagon shape. Although there are 18 dashes in some stations on the rear in a red circle. It could be raxxla is pointing to a station interior or something weird.

The other oddity is i've seen are messages on stations like the one about not surrendering and to take over. Do those stay the same as some long standing history of the system or do they change with things like civil wars and whatnot over time?

Maybe we have to look for a station interior type. Maybe that goes with a certain owner or circumstance. Do the interiors change with owner?

As far as I can tell, station audio changes based on State, but some of it is static.

Edit/Add: I do believe most is static. Obsidian talked about a permit while I was there, and that is YEARS out of date information.
