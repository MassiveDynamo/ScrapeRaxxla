It was a couple of months ago (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...-Find-Raxxla?p=7137768&viewfull=1#post7137768) but since I'm out of leads (and tired of mission-running) I'm going to head out to the Jewel Box cluster to look for, well, anything. The hint from Cynthia Sideris's name could also apply to other places but I just want to get away from the Bubble for a few days.
