Some addition for my Coronae Borealis "theory". There are so named "Blaze star" in this constellation. I don't know English enough, but I think "burns" and "blazes" are the very same words. Unfortunately this star is not in our game Probably because it is too new. Or too secret. Oh, sorry, I again going hunting ghosts.
