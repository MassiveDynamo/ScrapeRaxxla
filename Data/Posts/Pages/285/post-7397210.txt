The system on the right is Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3. Cmdr Wace decoded that from the probe sound.

The three numbers are distance to: Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3, Merope and you current system. That gives the possition of the target system(and one dud possition).

This works 100%. There might be some ‘fine print’ in the map that we haven’t figurer out, but the main function is known.

I swear if the Thargs are hunting Raxx, and it's been permit locked the last couple years I've looked, I'm gon be upsetti spaghetti. I'll gladly turn on the Feds and Imps for the glory of Raxxla.

Like: "Bug off Huddy and Zemmy, the Thargs are my new best pals!"
