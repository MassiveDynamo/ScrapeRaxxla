Hello CMDRs, I’ve been reading this thread for a long time now and I would like to add one thing. I can’t remember what system it’s in but it is in the bubble but there’s a Coriolis station named (a different kind). Has anyone else been there?

What do you mean by "a different kind"? Can you provide more details?
