I guess at this point the question is given all the rumors of what Raxxla might be, what might it look like. I'll start: if I had to guess RAXXLA is big as in probably bigger than a single star system. I suspect what we are looking for is as follows:

-What does RAXXLA do?
-Is it focused on anything in particular?
-What was the purpose of it being built in the first place?

I suspect there are bits and pieces of gameplay that give hints. It still bothers me that we have to upload telemetry for carrier jumps especially. Though I suspect the data on jumps we collect for engineers may hint the smaller ships do the same.

One last thing: if "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" and Holdstock's other science fiction works play any part in this: RAXXLA may look human-designed because part of it may have initially been built poorly at Sol. We may have been the first species to use it.
