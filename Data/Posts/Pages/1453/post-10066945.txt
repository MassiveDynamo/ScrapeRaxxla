Very nice work.

I had a similar idea with the ruins being directional instruments but looking at it from another way (which is probably not going to lead anywhere).
As a Druid with a previous job which allowed me to travel Europe i continued some work a friend started on the alignment of key stone structures (Carnac, Stonehenge, Brownshill etc) and many lined up to a central point when viewed on a map that allowed for the curvature of the Earth.
Maybe this was a directional indicator maybe just coincidence, who knows.
My research (on the guardians) is nowhere near your expertise ,good luck in your endeavors, discovery is a wonderful thing.
