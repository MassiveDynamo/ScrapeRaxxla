if the number 8 is intriguing to you, I think the 8 princesses might fit that bill
I presume we are talking the 8 Maelstroms which may or may not have the 8 Princesses or Queens (forgetting how exactly the Codex references them) at their center? I still wonder if there are 8 somethings they are looking for? Might be time to see if there are common threads between the systems the Maelstroms are located. There has to be something that hints at what they want.
