Drew used to comment and answer questions on here about what he knew (or wasn't covered by NDA)

You might find this post interesting on your thoughts

Post in thread 'The Quest To Find Raxxla' https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-9529268

edit: you can try him on Twitter, he's a friendly chap and may well reply. He signed off here when he signed off from playing Elite....
Allen Stroud who also wrote a lot of the initial lore as I understand it (hope I'm not doing him a disservice!) has also contributed on here and answered questions so it might be worth searching for his messages too.

Drew also had his own ED Lore thread:
Lore questions. :)
Folks, I wrote a couple of official books in the ED universe a while back, which meant a reasonable knowledge of the background lore. If anyone has questions about in-game lore stuff from the dawn of time until now post below and I'll do my best to answer. :) Cheers, Drew.
