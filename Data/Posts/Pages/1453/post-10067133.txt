if the number 8 is intriguing to you, I think the 8 princesses might fit that bill
in hopes of them being here for reasons very different than most cmdrs suspect.
they could wipe us out with ease imo. overnight.
so why haven't they?
making a barrier seems silly, anyone that can't get past, isn't trying.

The avenue I am on is trying to find out how to get closer. but not by fighting.
our one possibilty of communicating has gone on a walkabout..so no help there yet, I hope 'They' make a useful decision.

timing and coincidence are very different things. fdev is pretty good at mixing them up so it is harder to tell which is which, sometimes.
I think this is one of those times..

no such thing as coincidence.

I asked a few times, if a cmdr discovered something that could end the war or otherwise save humanity, that would interfere with the story.
if that something was the actual focus, we would not know until that story becomes more revealed.
Having never believed the Guardians died out. and no sign of the robot, yet.
then watching 8 vessels slowly fly towards the bubble from who knows where
but then us not getting wiped out
leads me to think it is very close.
but something is stopping/preventing the Thargoids from erasing us
and it does feel a bit like they are waiting for something.

too much speculation
easier to go do some more exploring, see what I find today.
