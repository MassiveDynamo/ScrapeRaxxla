Drew also had his own ED Lore thread:
Lore questions. :)
Folks, I wrote a couple of official books in the ED universe a while back, which meant a reasonable knowledge of the background lore. If anyone has questions about in-game lore stuff from the dawn of time until now post below and I'll do my best to answer. :) Cheers, Drew.

I am still hoping we can eventually get Drew Wager back to being an active participant in the community. If we can dig up something on the Oisir/Klaxxian divide he might hop back in. Also, thanks for posting this information. Apparently, will have a good deal of weekend reading to do
