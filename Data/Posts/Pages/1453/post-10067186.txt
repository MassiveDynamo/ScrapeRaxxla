I think this sums up your entire outpouring whether your ideas have merit or not?
I would say at this point everyone is still coming up with ideas and seeing what seems to have substance. To date: no one has proof of the actual The Dark Wheel. Raxxla seems to just as much rumor as myth. We think they are likely real but there is that nagging problem of are the folks in Shinrarta Dezra legitimate? Also, are the Engineers working for someone else or kind of independent specialists? Even my ideas would at best be classified as highly speculative. No one has a map. We barely have an idea of how Tornvquist fits into all of it. At least some people are trying.

Yes, I am fully aware my bombastic approach has contributed to this state of affairs. On paper plenty of ideas sound good. The true test is does it move us forward in a meaningful fashion? However, until we get something actually substantial in some form we need to keep helping each other come up with ideas and how to test them. There's a lot of galaxy and we don't even know WHAT we are searching for exactly.
