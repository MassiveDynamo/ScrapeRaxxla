I am a bit confused. Do you want to be unhappy? We have all kinds of rumors as to what might be Raxxla and yet hardly but a few bother spinning up tales of what it might be and then go investigate it. There are about as many origin stories and y'all aren't spinning up ideas? What happened?

I admit that I kind of hope for the 8 galaxies bit being real. But in the meantime, I am perfectly content with looking into other avenues. No one is right until there is proof. Get to work with ideas.
