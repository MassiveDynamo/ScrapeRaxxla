With regards to Waters of Shintara and the lesson from the generation ships, I don't know if it means we are supposed to reinterpret the lore to find Raxxla. That has kind of been the operating theory based on themes in Elite Dangerous. I still believe Raxxla exists. I suspect that in reality it is less cryptic than we think but perspective is everything. Honestly, I really want to go to Temple region based on research from Independent Raxxla Hunters discord and see if we cannot activate a portion of the network. I really do believe that like "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" that Raxxla is galaxy-spanning but we are looking for the gateway itself.
