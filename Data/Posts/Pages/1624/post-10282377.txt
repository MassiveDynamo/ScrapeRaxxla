May I ask is NGC 1999 permit locked?
Not in game so can't check but very curious.



Not a bad place to get out and stretch the legs and admire the view... and perhaps write a poem...

In NGC 1999's embrace, a world so new,
Where cosmic wonders paint the sky anew.
A tapestry of stars, a celestial show,
Where nebulae ignite, and colours flow.

The Cosmic Keyhole, a gateway grand,
A portal to a starry, vibrant strand.
Through its dark embrace, the light does shine,
A beacon in the depths, a cosmic sign.

Oh, the beauty that unfolds above,
A symphony of hues, a starry love.
Nebulose embrace, like velvet skies,
Where galaxies ignite in starry sighs.

NGC 1999, a cosmic gem,
A symphony of stars, a dazzling dream.
On this alien world, my soul takes flight,
In the celestial dance, bathed in starry light.

Now it's bloody freezing and where the hell is Raxxla and how would I recognise it?
