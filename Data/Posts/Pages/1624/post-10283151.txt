Strange that the Venusian log mentions supercruise directly. They should have no knowledge of it.
Some of the last of the generation ships to arrive were those headed to Phekda. From the in-game description:

A rare anarchy system that maintains a powerful industrial economy. Also known as Gamma Ursae Majoris and Phad.

The home system for The Ancients of Mumu who are adherents to the entity \"Mumu\". Their aim is to maintain the substance and nature of their society and protect their home system from incursion by any non-believers. Founded in the 12th century, while still planet bound on Mother Earth, the (then) Adherents of Mumu sought to better their environment for the benefit of others.

When first generation ships were due to leave Earth their society sought to colonise a system far from Earth as they believed that Earth itself was not worth saving. The colonists, by and large, survived the journey, arriving several hundred years ago. A significant proportion of the first settlers had developed a sincere hatred of space travel by the time they made first landing.

Since their arrival they have grown particularly attached to their home and have transformed into a community that is fiercely protective of its chosen system and resistant to any attempts at visitation by those who have not been granted access.

In other words, the generation ship era ended during the late 3100s - mid 3200s. If they had faster than light communication already, they absolutely would have been aware of the nightmare happening as they traversed space to their destination (or at the very least it would have been common knowledge of the command crews).

This is why there are a lot of famous anarchy systems, the settlers found out about the nightmares perpetrated by the superpowers (sometimes enroute).
