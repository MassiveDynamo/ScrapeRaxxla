Update on this post.

I have been through our list of named stars in the Orion complex and added details and names to them by summarising wiki entries. Mine's not as neatly presented as Emperor's list though, sorry!

SPOILER: LIST OF NAMED STARS IN THE ORION COMPLEX (UPDATED)














































































































































Note: A few in there have more than one possible, you'll see where that happens.

Interestingly, there's are some I can't figure out at all:

Archer's Wish
Labyrinth
Legacy
Rickman
The Veil
Tycho
Yngvi-Freyr

Archer's Wish... I assume maybe someone named Archer, but couldn't find a match, kept getting references to Sagittarius. Orion (the Greek myth figure) is a huntsman, and does have a mythology that includes archery, so it might be that??

Labyrinth ... I mean I immediately thought of the Goblin King himself, but other than that I don't know?
SPOILER: IT'S ONLY FOREVER, NOT LONG AT ALL

As @Jorki Rasalas suggested, Legacy does potentially tie into Brookes' novel (and actual legacy in-game).

Rickman seems like a name but I can't find a match.

The Veil... ???

Tycho would be Tycho Brahe, but Brahe was already a star name and I've found no other instance of using both first and last name to name this set of stars... so, another Tycho?

Yngvi-Freyr is apparently a norse myth?? Seems like something @Rochester might be interested in?
