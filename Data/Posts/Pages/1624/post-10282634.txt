That's an interesting find! All the nearby systems that have names seem to be named for astronomers or that ilk.

I also went there after I saw your post (it's a short hop from the bubble as things go). As you said, not really anything to find, but it is curious. I do think you're also quite right in pointing out that the line of stars there that runs through the Orion nebula is very much could be described as a "golden chain".

I like that interpretation, quite literally hanging in a chain of 'golden' stars.
In addition to that you reminded me that the Orion Nebula has a very torc-like appearance at certain angles. It reminded me of the fire/amber coloured Br√≠singamen and other torc jewellery.


The nebula aspect of it also connects to the codex as all galaxies had originated from molecular clouds collecting together - ie. the Mother
Similarly - "in bigness as a star" could also be interpreted as being the expelled mass (bigness) of a star after a supernova.
Perhaps the nebula can be a frame of reference / scale for the pendent world which would narrow the scope down immensely.

I wonder then if the last line is MB pointing to a specific moon within this region or, like I was theorizing earlier, a star of smallest magnitude (ie. the brightest star [jewel] within the nebula)
What is Theta Orionis C like in game? https://www.edsm.net/en/system/id/3185980/name/Theta+Orionis+C
