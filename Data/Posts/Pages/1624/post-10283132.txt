In the logs for the Venusian, the generation ship is overtaken by supercruise capable vessels. The FFE journals shed more light on this and supercruise was jointly developed to expressly take out generation ships.
Strange that the Venusian log mentions supercruise directly. They should have no knowledge of it.
