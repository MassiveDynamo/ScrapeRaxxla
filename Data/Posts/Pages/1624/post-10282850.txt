There are a lot of Leavitt stations in proximity to Sol
Leavitt worked as a computer (the occupation) and developed the technique of measuring distance by studying Cepheids brightness fluctuations (named after Cepheus - husband to Cassiopeia and father to Andromeda)
One could say a periodic oscillation is like a spiral

Edit: extending that further - Alpha Cephei is known officially as Alderamin and is the brightest star in the constellation (also a trinary system in ED)

Andrea Ghez got a nobel prize for discovering evidence of Sagittarius A*
There are quite a few stations with her name as well.

Same goes for Herschel - comets - spiralling 'star' ?

Cepheus also hosts the galactic north by 3300; Alrai¹ is the pole star in Elite's time, passing the title to Iota Cephei in the following millennium.

¹ The official IAU name is Errai, but it only got standardized in 2016; Arabic-to-Latin transcriptions can vary quite a lot.
