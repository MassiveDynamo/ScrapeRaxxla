There is a Vera Rubin Complex, in the Garuda system - but that's in the Colonia region. My memory of names is not so good these days so I'm not sure off the top of my head which/if any of the names above are female astronomers/scientists/astro- or cosmonauts.

I remember that it was about the time the permit locks were added (shortly before 2.1, The Engineers) that the names of systems around Barnard Loop were being changed - I was out there at the time and I saw names being added on a daily basis! It was quite surreal and I kinda hoped that it might be something like a Generation Ship having arrived there and established a mini-bubble of systems... .
