I have added to @Emperor's excellent list of named stars within 120ly of the system Galileo, this radius covers (from what I can tell) most of the Orion complex. I used EDSM for this, so there may be some missing etc. The list below includes Emperor's and the new ones. I've also messed up the neat divided list Emperor made, so... swings and roundabouts really.

SPOILER: LIST OF NAMED STARS IN THE ORION COMPLEX









































































Working on the Codex interpretation, I'm assuming that "Princess Astrophel" might be code for "woman astronomer", but that's just a guess.

If Rubin was in there I'd be excited since she worked on galaxy rotation (amongst other very important things) and that to me seems like it might be a match for "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars". Unfortunately I can't see Rubin in the list, but I assume there are other candidates. Hiding one astronomer in a massive collection of astronomers is a good way to hide something in plain sight. Props to Emperor again for this.

I believe there's a planet called Rubin's Discovery in the bubble though? EDIT: There is indeed, it's in the 61 Virginis system.

Just checking possibilities here
