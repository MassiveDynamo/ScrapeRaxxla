Hi folks. Just checking in after a long break. Seems like we did not found it yet. I just stumbled upon an interview of DB, which had this peculiar screenshot from Elite 2.
Entrevue avec David Braben

I wonder which 2 more systems those lines connect? Maybe totally irrelevant, may be someone else pointed out earlier i dont know. But very peculiar to be honest.
I'd need to dig out a copy of FE2 to be sure, since that's an unusual angle for the screenshot, but if you mean what the systems the various lines point to just off-screen to the right are, probably Wolf 359 and Sirius.

Not sure what the unnamed one at the other end of the 61 Cygni line in the top left is. Could be Altair?

The lines are the "suggested trade routes" on the map and only appeared around the systems fairly close to Sol. https://t.gamesnostalgia.com/screenshots/f/r/frontier-elite-ii/49559.jpg is the best screenshot I can find of them elsewhere, from a more conventional angle - the line heading south of Wolf 359 goes to Ross 128, and the line heading west from Ross 154 I think went to Arcturus (or maybe Wolf 630)
