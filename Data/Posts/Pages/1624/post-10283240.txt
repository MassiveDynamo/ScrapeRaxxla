Spiralling stars... Any female astronomers discover the first binary stars or similar concepts? I also have "twins" floating around in my head so if any were a twin where they both are famous is another thought...

Richards Gap - Mercedes Tharam Richards, astronomy and astrophysics professor. Her investigation focused on computational astrophysics, stellar astrophysics and exoplanets and brown dwarfs, and the physical dynamics of interacting binary stars systems. However, her pioneering research in the tomography of interacting binary star systems and cataclysmic variable stars to predict magnetic activity and simulate gas flow is her most known work. OR Richard Noel "" Richards, naval officer and aviator, test pilot, chemical engineer, and a former NASA astronaut. He flew aboard four Space Shuttle missions in the 1980s and 1990s. OR Paul William Richards, engineer and a former NASA Astronaut. He flew aboard one Space Shuttle mission in 2001.

Closest I could find in our list, and it's not a definite hit.
