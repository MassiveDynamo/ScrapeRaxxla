The John Milton quote of a pendant world is multilayered but ultimately is a ‘painterly’ method of writing, something Philip Sidney liked to do as well, literally ‘painting a picture in one’s minds eye’.

Unless the author in ED is intentionally misinterpreting, or repurposing that text, then the original context ought to apply in my opinion. That the pendant globe hangs from the walls of heaven.

In Paradise Lost that text relates to the view that Satan is presented with when he finally finds his way back to heaven, it’s as though he breaks through the top layer of broiling matter of fire and night of the zone of Chaos and sees before him the entirety of the Empyrean or heaven far off, a wide possibly circular expanse, with high mountainous walls, and from which hanging far off in the distance is our pendant globe - our universe, encased in a solid shell, but given the vast enormity of the Empyrean it looks tiny, like a distant star comparable to ‘our night sky’.

The Empyrean is made of pure light, it’s the only source of ‘light’, it’s a brilliant spectacle Milton is attempting to convey, our universe sits below it, shining from Satans perspective as though he was seeing a star from earth in comparison to the Moon, tiny in comparison and almost eclipsed by the brightness.

It is pendant because it is new and in flux, but it’s also a valuable jewel. It hangs relatively very close to heaven, not far off, because it falls within gods grace and love, Milton here is conveying multiple concepts, but one which a Christian may find comforting, that creation is literally still connected to heaven… it’s not distant nor separate.
