Anyone notice that Galnet the new article for 12, Sept 3306, trying to change the narrative of StarShip One of a possible sabotage in an attempt to assassinate former president Jasmina Halsey, by causing a malfunction of the Frame Shift Drive. This was our first look into Raxxla first reports of ever being sighted by any character as well as communication of intelligent life form. This was also the incident that had president Jasmina Halsey launch an expedition to looking for the "aliens" and the so called "planet of paradise".

I got a feeling they are about to pin it on some poor Low ranking sap to try to cover this up since the Feds are behind this investigation.

has nothing to do with Raxxla (Well not so far), Thats the Guardian narative that pulled us to their ruins whihc is very much alive
