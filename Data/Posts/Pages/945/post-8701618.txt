Well we aren't 100% sure of any stance some say it was the Thargoids and not the guardians and it was the intelligent lifeforms that could aim to both. Fact of the matter is we never found the so called planet of paradise which former president claim to have seen. The direction hasn't shifted away from it not being Raxxla, we still have a missing engineer in space some where.
