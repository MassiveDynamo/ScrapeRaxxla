Well we aren't 100% sure of any stance some say it was the Thargoids and not the guardians and it was the intelligent lifeforms that could aim to both. Fact of the matter is we never found the so called planet of paradise which former president claim to have seen. The direction hasn't shifted away from it not being Raxxla, we still have a missing engineer in space some where.

Wasnt the planet of paradise already confirmed to be images of the Gaurdians home planet millions of years ago and that hasleys visions where due to time and space warping from the failing jump? then we where pointed to the now ruins of said paradise's all over the galaxy
