Good write up.

It could use a little tightening up. Some of the leads are based on dynamical situations. Things that are relevant at this moment, because of player behavior.

A few tidbits that you could consider if you find useful.

- Tau Ceti: Tau was used as a symbol for life or resurrection. It's based on the Phoenician letter Taw, which was drawn as a capitol X. Cetus is of course the moster that was supposed to eat Andromeda.
- Hecate: As a triple deity, the three aspects of Hecate are Selene(Moon in heaven), Artemis (the Huntress on earth) and Persephone (the Destroyer in the underworld). I see both Art and Cora in there.
- Roger Waters was the main vocalist on The Wall, not David Gilmour.
