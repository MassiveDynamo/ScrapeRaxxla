How do you get access to those 3 overlays in blue, purple, red they used to make these pictures. I think this one is closer but the purple is upside down.(NVM, I think I found out how.)

It is a technical drawing of mechanism that unlocks blueprints at guardians structures. <- statement, not speculation

It is partially visible at guardians alpha sites as cluster A.
