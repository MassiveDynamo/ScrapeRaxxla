It's possible that the "mother of galaxies" is a term similar to "mother of all bombs", i.e. simply a big one, i.e. possibly Milky Way. And in that case "the jewel that burns on the brow" would be Earth, which has been referenced to as a jewel by various astronauts who have viewed it from space.

What if it is a nebula system where the sun has blown up in some way. There are several of them. Some in notable places like inside other nebula. Or a planet in such a system.
