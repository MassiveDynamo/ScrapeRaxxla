I'm sorry, that's not what I meant.
When they made the Codex in the game, they wrote that there are three sections in the galaxy map.
Rumors - I can not understand how they appear there and did not see there any.
Objects - if someone from the kmdr something will find that at once all see it.
Confirmed - if you found it yourself.
This is divided by region.
I know you did not meant it bro. But your comment made me think about pheme and all the rumors, wild theories, conclusions, this tin foil madness sea.
And i love your translator misunderstandings, it creates tiny Chaos pockets in order.
