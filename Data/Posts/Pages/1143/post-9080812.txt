I'll try later today, on my phone and offline for the next few hours. Like Jorki, I was surprised a few weeks ago to discover that I was still a member and had access, esp. after the Great Zoltan-Clavain Supernova of 3303 or thereabouts.


I suspect he is getting that message via the other thread and the various complaints.
I miss Zoltan!
