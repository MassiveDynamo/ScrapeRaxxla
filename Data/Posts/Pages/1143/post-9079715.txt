Who has even 1 rumor in the codex ?

Just an out of box approach. The whisperer in witch space. In Greek mythology, Pheme is known to be personification of rumours and whispers.
Pheme - Wikipedia

And also there is a project, which is also called Pheme, and oh boy this is very interesting to read. Just one paragraph from their website:
We are concentrating on identifying four types of phemes and modelling their spread across social networks and online media: speculation, controversy, misinformation, and disinformation. However, it is particularly difficult to assess whether a piece of information falls into one of these categories in the context of social media. The quality of the information here is highly dependent on its social context and, up to now, it has proven very challenging to identify and interpret this context automatically.

Here is their site: https://www.pheme.eu/

This site is created in 2014 and funded 4.3 m â‚¬

Conclusion: They have created this lab rat cage and expecting us to put a solid theory out of it
