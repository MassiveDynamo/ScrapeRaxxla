@Vetinari So you need to drop out at each belt cluster? No signal to indicate there’s anything to be visited otherwise? Does make a bit of a nonsense of the FSS (though it was the advanced scanner that MB said was infinite range! Didn’t believe that either!! )

I still think Raxxla is likely to be hidden in Sol’s asteroid belt, but we can’t find the asteroid “clusters”, other than by an indication in the hud but nothing there when we drop. Sounds like my suspicion is correct-Raxxla May be god/dess of the RNG function!
As far as I remember astronomy, a large number of asteroids are not only in the asteroid belt, but also in the orbit of Jupiter and Mars. The so-called Trojans.
