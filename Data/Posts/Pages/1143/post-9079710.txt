I'm sorry I disagree about the Odyssey. Yes it has no hints, but the textures (I do not believe that all the textures are replaced in the Odyssey relative to the main game)
And most importantly, the algorithm works. It is just being tested in the Odyssey. And just how I think that the announcement of any mystery does not mean that it is in the game until we find it. If anyone is interested, I can explain it on the example of the mission repair energy in the settlement.
