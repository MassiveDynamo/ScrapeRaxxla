I always map everything, thats why I take so long to get anywhere so orbital cruise altitude I will find anyway if thats how it works* and know to drop out of SC to get it in Nav Panel when it finds the signal, but the asteroid belt one I dunno. Have asked on that thread now anyway as would be good for us all to know how the tools work and like I said itll be a while for me to get there to confirm or deny it.

*I should have asked for an example for that Orbital Cruise one as not really sure what they meant and could have gone and looked for myself to find out. Might explain a few 'bugs' I've seen occasionally.....just wish Id recorded where now instead of 'oh bug' and moved on lol
