There may be other stuff out there as well in the Belts, but to reiterate, you need to physically go to the Belt and drop out of SC at each one to have a chance of finding them if they are there, there is no other way for the scanners to pick it up.

And there may very well be other things in the belts that have been lurking undiscovered for some time. Zac made a comment yesterday about how long he had been waiting for someone to find the Hesperus/Scriveners (on Canonn Discord of course) implying that it had been there for quite some time (perhaps since the Adamastor or perhaps even older).

Right, off to get caffeinated and catch up on the Adamastor thread.
