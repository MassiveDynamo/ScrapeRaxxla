There was another megaship found recently? Hesperus? That's so nice.

Still on a holiday cruise, I think we are reaching Xibalba soon. I love Xibalba. Had grilled tiger prawns yesterday. I think the cruise may be affiliated with Canonn in some way, being called the Comfy Canonn Cruise, but I don't know how many really are members. People speak about duelling with stock Sidewinders and such things, and I'm merely using the Canonn decal from building the Gnosis times to apply for special offers at the tax free shop. It's lovely weather out here, and you can really see the Milky Way, like, all of it at once.

Best Wishes
