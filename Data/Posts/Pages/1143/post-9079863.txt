My takeaway from the latest Adamastor / Hesperus event is that I can't rely on the FSS scanner showing what is in a system and every detail such as asteroid fields or similar have to be visually inspected. Fair enough, just thinking how much I have crossed off that I now have to go back and reconsider.
Yes, that was a major reveal. They hid one of the LPs so well that nobody spotted it. Someone apparently had been in that system and mapped a planet but had not spotted it. I wonder if it was “stealthed” like TDW station (& Raxxla perhaps??) so only detectable if very close?
