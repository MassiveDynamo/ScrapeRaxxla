My bad I thought someone had linked it, just checked and youre right, nobody did.


Well reading between the lines....Frontier told Canonn on Discord it was in an asteroid belt....in fact there was a lot of Comms between Frontier CM and Canonn on their Discord group that we never heard about here on the forums.....even though we did ask the questions. At least 2 Cmdrs on the Hesperus search thread had visited that system, think one of them mapped as well or said they FSSd everything, something more than honk n scoop anyway.




Yeah gl with that, you need to go on Canonn Discord to get a Frontier CM attention. I half-joked about it on Friday in a post here. Not laughing any more.

I tried to submit a private Support Ticket to complain, but couldnt work out their darn Ticket system and it kept throwing me around to the FAQ, so I started a public Bug Report. Link here if you want to add anything. At least hopefully someone will will read it.

I’ve added my two pennyworth!
Yes, FD seem to view Canonn as the largest puzzle-focussed group. That may be true but they shouldn’t exclude other players who are trying to solve puzzles. I think I’m probably still officially a member of Canonn, but I stopped participating when they moved their activities off the forum and put it into their own Discord. I thought that was exclusionary and went against the whole purpose of the group.

Edit: mmm, I thought the Adamastor-Hesperus puzzle thread would cease activity after Hesperus was found, but looks like another 12 pages since last night (when I’d caught up!).
Something’s afoot /aclaw/ atentacle!
