Can you do me a favour and screenshot everything Zac said thats relevant?
I'll try later today, on my phone and offline for the next few hours. Like Jorki, I was surprised a few weeks ago to discover that I was still a member and had access, esp. after the Great Zoltan-Clavain Supernova of 3303 or thereabouts.

I suspect he is getting that message via the other thread and the various complaints.
