And there may very well be other things in the belts that have been lurking undiscovered for some time. Zac made a comment yesterday about how long he had been waiting for someone to find the Hesperus/Scriveners (on Canonn Discord of course) implying that it had been there for quite some time (perhaps since the Adamastor or perhaps even older).

Oh for Gods sake!

I assumed Hesperus had been put in there and Adamastor LP woke up when Hesperus salvaged or something just for the mystery started on Thursday.

Can you do me a favour and screenshot everything Zac said thats relevant? May as well get all the salt out of the way now about what we havent been told that a private player group have. Maybe start a new thread and just repost there, I know its a massive PITA and too much to ask but my laptop freezes when I try and use Discord so I got no chance and hopefully others will join in and repost as well.

Or tell him the forum community is not impressed and not happy and could he please copy / paste his comments and vital game information and updates here as well...or in game...or on Twitter or Reddit or one of the official Frontier sites that dont need a separate program to run. This is gonna turn into a massive sh-storm before they even realise how much damage they have done...again....repeatedly.
