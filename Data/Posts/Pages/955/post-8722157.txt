Actually,I believe none of these bodies described are planetary bodies, but all stars/black holes. Basis for hypothesis being stars: "The Princess & The Spiralling Stars". Basis for the toast being a system map: "For those with eyes to see".

I think that a unique system is described in the toast, and using the star descriptions in the toast we can find and verify the correct system.

The Spiraling Stars sound more like pulsars or white dwarfs. Black holes dont really spiral, sure the stars bend, but no real spinning. I'm a big fan of the stella angle, I've been hunting down one path for a a year now — always the same results — You find coincidences but never anything solid. Started to blend into events of 3303. Story is currently being researched but took a break to help my squadron.

I thought they were black holes , its actually mentioned in the 'alien worlds' book. Says its behind a wall of them. Who knows how much of that is truth...
