I'm coming up with:
white dwarf, orbiting black hole
neutron star, pulsar
brown dwarf, red giant

It feels rather fitting and FDev like to have a riddle based on star types/life cycle.
Some sections seem to want to fit:
Jewel that burns - white dwarfs with hearts of diamond.
Whisperer in witchspace - neutron star
Siren of the deepest void - pulsar
Parent's grief - brown dwarf
Lover's woe - red giant or star in the end of cycle

Parent’s Grief (Death of a ‘sun’) could be black hole, or supernova remnant
Lover’s Woe could be co-orbiting planets, or a planet with asteroid field from destroyed planet, or planets co-orbiting at opposite sides of a star so they can never meet.

Does a NS really whisper in witchspace?
A pulsar is a highly magnetized rotating compact star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles, so in-game another NS.

Not looking to me like a system description, but could be 6 5 directions to which glasses are raised, with TDW station being at the centroid (i.e. where the toast is occurring).
