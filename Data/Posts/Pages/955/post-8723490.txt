Why do you think Raxxla can be found? Like someone will decipher it's location and find it?
DW: "We know why people haven't been able to find it"

For me it means that Raxxla is somehow hidden, behind permit etc. and so it can't be found but it is in the game.
I'm open minded to this possibility but keep searching just in case
