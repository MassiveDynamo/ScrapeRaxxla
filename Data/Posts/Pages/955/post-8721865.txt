speaking of Cambridge.

For some reason, i’ve often wondered if Raxxla was as a fancy (meta) Easter egg; the Elite dangerous version of Paul Woakes’s Damocles,
Where on the planet Dion, you could find the authors computer and his chair.

the author’s chair, was the fastest ship on the game,

and the author’s computer allowed you to destroy stellar bodies. Stop time. Unlock any lock, an in-game back door for the author.




Now I don’t expect a full slew of cheats in elite dangerous, but I can’t help but think of Targ, Eros and Damocles and that sneaky, hitchhikers guide styled Easter egg, whenever I think of Elite dangerous “walkies” edition. -I wonder What would the pylar commanders brother in law say to all of this

There's a moon in Pollux named Cambridge. i find this interesting because there's nothing there. You would think if they were to name a moon for their home town it would at least have something there, right? Why name an empty moon?
