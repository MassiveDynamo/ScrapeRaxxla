Having a new insight on the toast, it isn't a map to find Raxxla, but a map to find their station. This may invalidate the idea of being near the 8th moon of a gas giant.
The toast itself is one of a elegant prose describing the system in which to find the station.

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
Star orbiting black hole?

To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!
I'm not up on my exploring, don't black holes whisper/sing? Or is that a NS?


Two planets in orbit of eachother, never to embrace?

Actually,I believe none of these bodies described are planetary bodies, but all stars/black holes. Basis for hypothesis being stars: "The Princess & The Spiralling Stars". Basis for the toast being a system map: "For those with eyes to see".

I think that a unique system is described in the toast, and using the star descriptions in the toast we can find and verify the correct system.
