I'm coming up with:
white dwarf, orbiting black hole
neutron star, pulsar
brown dwarf, red giant

It feels rather fitting and FDev like to have a riddle based on star types/life cycle.
Some sections seem to want to fit:
Jewel that burns - white dwarfs with hearts of diamond.
Whisperer in witchspace - neutron star
Siren of the deepest void - pulsar
Parent's grief - brown dwarf
Lover's woe - red giant or star in the end of cycle
