A question though,
What the flarkin is “The Princess & The Spiralling Stars"
I’ve tried googling for the book and landed on something bizarrely from the 1800 or something.

is it an in-game reference to that in-game sci-if author that was in galnet? The one that disappeared and came back, bad sales / publicity stunt gone bad?

it seams like a “look here”
Which then turns out to be a big massive instant dead end with a just lot of emphasis put on it, or have I missed something revolutionary by having a typo when searching on the internet?

You need to read the in-game Codex entries on Raxxla & The Dark Wheel
The reference is “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars”

Edit: it doesn’t seem to exist! Nearest we’ve found is “Astrophel and Stella”, plenty of mentions in this thread!
