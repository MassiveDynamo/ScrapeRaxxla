Just gonna update my theory. I had said that Raxxla, if it is intended for all players to be able to find, that means that raxxla may be a planet but whatever secret it holds must not be on the planet since that would exclude non horizons players.
just announced is that starting October 27th, Horizons will be free to all base game players.
meaning that if theyâ€™ve made updates to raxxla, which I assume they have, it may well now all be planet bound.
further the last CG gave all players the Akenar permit, which until now required Empire rank to get.
seems sus.
