The Spiraling Stars sound more like pulsars or white dwarfs. Black holes dont really spiral, sure the stars bend, but no real spinning. I'm a big fan of the stella angle, I've been hunting down one path for a a year now — always the same results — You find coincidences but never anything solid. Started to blend into events of 3303. Story is currently being researched but took a break to help my squadron.

I thought they were black holes , its actually mentioned in the 'alien worlds' book. Says its behind a wall of them. Who knows how much of that is truth...
Given enough time, effort and tinfoil one can find connections and coincidence everywhere, especially if you really want it to be there. This is the danger in our little obsession
