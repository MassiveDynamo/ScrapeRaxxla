If you saw the latest LS with DR Kay or saw the StuartGT summary you'll know that they have the ability and have actually put 'faces' onto geography or geology for fun while playing with the building. Probably took them out for final game, probably.

But it does mean that a planetary feature could be Raxxla or a 'clue' (there will be no clues), as we have thought before, even before Horizons we would see whatever feature was there and we could 'find' Raxxla. Thinking of Slartibartfast and others it could even in the extreme be text, readable from space (Hello Sweety). Just adds a bit of evidence to the 'they could have done this, they did have that ability' not anything else. And fits 'for those with eyes to see'.

Just tinfoiling.

I agree however if it is something to do with planatary landing or landing on a planet we'll alot of people won't be happy as before that was a thing we should have been able to find it
