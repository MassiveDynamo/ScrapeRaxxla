When you're there, try the following different writings:

"veil north "
"veil north s"
"veil north se"
"veil north sec"
...
"veil north sector"

I'm currently not ingame for a while, but there is something that I noticed: when you search for "veil e" it doesn't take you to "veil east". Likewise "veil w" does not take you to "veil west".
