My fear currently is that "veil north" is a one off, meaning it only works once for your character... There is precedent for this game mechanic: CQC prestige.
Before this gets out of hand, its much more likely to be a one off bug that fixed when you reopened the galaxy. Always have the attitude of disproving a bug, ie its repeatable and consistent, otherwise sometimes it just is. Well, often actually not sometimes.
