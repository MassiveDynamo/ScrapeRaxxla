When you're there, try the following different writings:

"veil north "
"veil north s"
"veil north se"
"veil north sec"
...
"veil north sector"

I'm currently not ingame for a while, but there is something that I noticed: when you search for "veil e" it doesn't take you to "veil east". Likewise "veil w" does not take you to "veil west".
Click to expand...
They don't take you to them because the are not valid systems, it would be "veil sector west/East.

As for the sifi thin, nothing in the system, nothing at all
