Before this gets out of hand, its much more likely to be a one off bug that fixed when you reopened the galaxy. Always have the attitude of disproving a bug, ie its repeatable and consistent, otherwise sometimes it just is. Well, often actually not sometimes.
No. It's very unlikely that "veil north" is a one-off bug. Why would a one-off bug point me to a system that is close to the Veil Nebulas and is high above those nebulas?

In this case you have to prove it that it is a bug. Sabiyhan was probably a bug. Veil North is not a bug.
