Regarding getting there without getting bored:

Do stuff on the way (it appears that you are, which is great) because jumping alone for long distances is soul destroying even for those who love exploration. Scan stuff, take pictures, land on (low g) planets (with your shields up) and drive around shooting rocks. Just break up the monotony every 20 jumps or so, and you'll be fine.

It's the trip home that's always the killer, anyway

Good luck and have fun o7

Thanks for the advice. I've been doing those things and yeah, when I just relax, its pretty great. Its nice to sit back and appreciate the scale of this game
