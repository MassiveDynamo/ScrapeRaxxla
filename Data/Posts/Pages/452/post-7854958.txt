Exploring all the galactic regions would at least indicate that you're a 'real' explorer - simply by the amount of ground you've covered - even if it's not the actual regions being tracked, so it may be worth doing.

I'm not sure the DW are considered to be exploration focused. My recollection is that they were elite combat pilots, although that was from before other ranks were a thing. Still, there's nothing in the Codex (IIRC) that suggests they care about exploration particularly.

Finally, given that you can't hand exploration data in at more than one station (and it all goes to Universal Cartographics anyway) I don't think that where you hand it in is relevant. Imagine missing out on Raxxla because you handed your data in at the wrong place - that would be a ridiculous way for FDev to obfuscate it.

LOL. Yes. Although where my mind was going, is that (if I remember rightly) if you hand in exploration data, your reputation increases with the controlling fraction. So another question might be.....has anybody become allied with the DW, solely by handing in exploration data? If not, I can try this when (if) I ever get back to the bubble.

Doesn't the fact their primary objective is finding Raxxla make them explorers by definition?
