You could see whether the FSS radio noise lines up with Sag A* <--> Source 2.
Sag A produced 2 distinct sounds. The sound of a ship slowing down in super cruise and the thunder-like sounds you hear while speeding up. My best guess/overall impression was that it sounded like all of witch space or something was inside it. Idk if it’s unique to Sag a but I haven’t noticed it with other BLs. I also tried lining up Sag a with source 2 directly behind it and then doing a bunch of random things. Also tried flying into Sag A which proved impossible, unless you have 20,000 hear sinks and about a year of time to fly into it with thrusters.
