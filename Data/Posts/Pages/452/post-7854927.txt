Bear in mind that 'galactic regions' were only introduced in v3.3 - so they're unlikely to be part of any process to 'unlock' Raxxla.
I'd also be cautious of trying to use the Dark Wheel faction in Shin to do anything significant, since they're not confirmed to be the actual Dark Wheel.
Good point about 3.3 I had forgotten that. Although, who is to say DW were unlockable, prior to 3.3??

I have always held off on doing anything with DW previously, as "any attempt to contact them to request membership has always failed" seems quite a blatant statement of "Don't waste your time!" but - I'm running out of straws to clutch at, and it was actually you talking about your thought that we need to do something to unlock the next step, that got my brain spinning. Given the exploration nature of the DW (Shin or not) I cant think of many things that could trigger an invite?
