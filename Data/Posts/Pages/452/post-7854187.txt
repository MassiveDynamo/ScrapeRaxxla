Good to know. I'll continue on though as well. When you say a full survey, did you do just they full system, or full nebula? As there don't seem to be too many stars there Im going to try and check them all. Thanks for the link, ive seen this name a lot but havent investigated it yet.

Full nebula. Really, read at least the first page of the thread - a lot of good info in there esp. for a first timer to deep space.
