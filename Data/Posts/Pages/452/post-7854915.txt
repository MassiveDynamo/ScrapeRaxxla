Right....I've been thinking....if I was in charge of recruitment for an elitist group of explorers, and my brief was to "pick only a handful in each generation", what would make me stop and say..."oooh, what about this guy?"

It cant be gaining Elite explorer, because far more than a handful in each generation are elite explorers.

What about if somebody turned up in my station and sold me exploration data from every single galactic region? That might make me stop and think.

Does anybody know of anybody trying this?

Please somebody tell me I'm nuts, otherwise I'm going to be really tempted to try it, and that is something I will seriously regret about a month in!

Just cos you’re nuts doesn’t mean you’re definitely wrong!

But for this I think it’s worth bearing in mind that the Galactic regions were only introduced into the game in 3.3. (Always possible they were there in the background and never fronted to players prior to 3.3, but haven’t seen anything to on any way indicate that was the case.)
