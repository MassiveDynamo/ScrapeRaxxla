Since The Dark Wheel is a clandestine group hailing back to the beginnings of stellar exploration I would think this group has their fingers in all the pies ( thus the term 'wheel' and themselves being the hub. ) Also, with the introduction of the 'Codex' we now have extra information at hand. Interestingly a section on major corporations.

If I was the leader of this group I certainly would plant sleeper agents and spies in any mega-corporation that could undermine me. And I would have definitely started with The Sirius Corporation. Some of the other corporations listed could just be fluff, or related to other corporations that the DW has interests in. Mining, exploration, cartography, science, aliens and all the stuff.

So, how to find the Wheel? They find you of course and to notice you I assume you need high profiles in a list of corporations ( the spokes ). Then maybe you get an invite or a permit. I also assume it would be a permit since if or when TDW HQ is located I take it they would not want a sudden influx of visitors. We do know FD keep tabs on more than ranks due to the introduction of Engineers. Even to the point of locating exactly where you are in the Galaxy. Interesting stuff.
