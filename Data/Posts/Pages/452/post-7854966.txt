LOL. Yes. Although where my mind was going, is that (if I remember rightly) if you hand in exploration data, your reputation increases with the controlling fraction. So another question might be.....has anybody become allied with the DW, solely by handing in exploration data? If not, I can try this when (if) I ever get back to the bubble.

Oh yeah, I totally did that, years ago
