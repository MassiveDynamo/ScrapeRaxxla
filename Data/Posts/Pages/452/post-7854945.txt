Good point about 3.3 I had forgotten that. Although, who is to say DW were unlockable, prior to 3.3??

I have always held off on doing anything with DW previously, as "any attempt to contact them to request membership has always failed" seems quite a blatant statement of "Don't waste your time!" but - I'm running out of straws to clutch at, and it was actually you talking about your thought that we need to do something to unlock the next step, that got my brain spinning. Given the exploration nature of the DW (Shin or not) I cant think of many things that could trigger an invite?

Exploring all the galactic regions would at least indicate that you're a 'real' explorer - simply by the amount of ground you've covered - even if it's not the actual regions being tracked, so it may be worth doing.

I'm not sure the DW are considered to be exploration focused. My recollection is that they were elite combat pilots, although that was from before other ranks were a thing. Still, there's nothing in the Codex (IIRC) that suggests they care about exploration particularly.

Finally, given that you can't hand exploration data in at more than one station (and it all goes to Universal Cartographics anyway) I don't think that where you hand it in is relevant. Imagine missing out on Raxxla because you handed your data in at the wrong place - that would be a ridiculous way for FDev to obfuscate it.
