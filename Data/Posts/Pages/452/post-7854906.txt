Right....I've been thinking....if I was in charge of recruitment for an elitist group of explorers, and my brief was to "pick only a handful in each generation", what would make me stop and say..."oooh, what about this guy?"

It cant be gaining Elite explorer, because far more than a handful in each generation are elite explorers.

What about if somebody turned up in my station and sold me exploration data from every single galactic region? That might make me stop and think.

Does anybody know of anybody trying this?

Please somebody tell me I'm nuts, otherwise I'm going to be really tempted to try it, and that is something I will seriously regret about a month in!

Bear in mind that 'galactic regions' were only introduced in v3.3 - so they're unlikely to be part of any process to 'unlock' Raxxla.
I'd also be cautious of trying to use the Dark Wheel faction in Shin to do anything significant, since they're not confirmed to be the actual Dark Wheel.
