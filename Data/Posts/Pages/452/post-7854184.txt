Hathor looks like a good shout.

Her Greek equivalent is Aphrodite, which hooks nicely into 'Lover's woe' since she was something of a trollop (while married to Hephaestus). Aphrodite was also (according to Theogeny) born from Uranus' severed genitals and if THAT doesn't fit the definition of 'Parent's grief' I don't know what does!

For the old Rifters: Aphrodite is also the greek equivalent of Inanna/Ishtar and we've all been here before


Well hopefully its helpful. Thanks for the tie in to the greeks because I missed that. I don't really think the poem has any clues other than that first line. But you never know.
