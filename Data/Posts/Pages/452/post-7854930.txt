But for this I think it’s worth bearing in mind that the Galactic regions were only introduced into the game in 3.3. (Always possible they were there in the background and never fronted to players prior to 3.3, but haven’t seen anything to on any way indicate that was the case.)
Do we know that it was possible to gain a DW invite prior to 3.3? We dont really know its possible at this point do we....??
