I get Ozric's point above but then why that passage and why mention Raxxla at all? It is as close as FD can get to saying Paradise Lost is relevant to the search for Raxxla.
Milton tells us the same story that we have heard twice before. The story of the Portal / Gateway. This is mentioned by Rafe Zetter in TDW and in the Codex, as the Omphalos rift.

Rafe does not give any hints on the location of Raxxla, except for "Raxxla—if it exists—is in another Galaxy". This probably just means that it's not in Galaxy 1 of the GalCop trade maps. For us that probably just means that it's not close to the Lave region.

Both Milton and the codex sort of says that the portal is directly above earth (whatever that means).

If the Omphalos rift / portal / gateway is alien like Rafe and the Codex tells, it's likely that these aliens are the gods from our religions and that all the religions tells the same story. As story that has been corrupted by millennia of oral retelling.
These aliens would have had the portal for a practical reason. Something like relocating from a home that was no longer sustainable or for exiling undesirable members. This portal would have to be close enough to earth, for it to be practical for the aliens to drop by, mess with the humans and tell them a few stories.

If the aliens didn't have the same type of hyperspace tech as we have and relied on jump gates, Raxxla has to be really close to Sol. Most likely within.
If they had normal hyperspace, Raxxla could be further away. That would imply that the distance between the heaven and the underworld is very long. To long to for it to be practical with normal hyperspace travel.

In essence the closer we put heaven and hell to each other, the closer to Sol we put Raxxla.
