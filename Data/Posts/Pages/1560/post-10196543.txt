Or, since Paradise Lost was his favourite book itâ€™s just an apt tribute to Michael Brookes.
I think this is a very important point to remember. Michael gave away his personal copy of Paradise Lost which is almost 200 years old on the first 24 hour stream Frontier did, which I was lucky enough to win for knowing it was his favourite book. His back tattoo was inspired by Milton and Lovecraft. I personally think the inclusion of Milton is far more for Michael than anything else.
