Anything on a Hutton mug would be nice as well.

Too bad I'm short on creativity for truckery ideas to earn an IRL one, and neglected 2Hot2Messy for months.
Honestly, the Brookes Tour's nudging to Raxxla is what made me return at last, even as completely aimless as I am.
Honestly, I need to make the trek back out to Alpha Centauri to finish synthesizing the lore from Shibboleth system and "Church of the Path" and the (possibly former) adherent that ended up there to make sense of some stuff. There is also a weird disappearance that went down nearby there. I think "Church of the Path" is part of Far God given Brother Aiden and him possibly being linked to Etain. Alpha Centauri is weird and HUGE.
