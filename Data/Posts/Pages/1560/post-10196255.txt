I think everyone here deserves a nice Lavian Brandy.



Remember, we are all here to find Raxxla. We should be as transparent as possible and be open-minded to other view points. This is all the more true if they can substantiate their ideas via known lore (no matter where it falls on the "official lore" spectrum).

The hunt for Raxxla was designed to be worth the effort.
