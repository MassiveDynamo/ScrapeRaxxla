So, who do you need saving from? The people that lied like snakes because, imagine that, they might be Reptiloid as discussed previously. The Club cannot fight people who are honest and authentic.

I have gotten to the point where I am threatening enough to be pulled over by the varying superpower's navies. You are told under no uncertain terms you must submit to interdiction.

Let that sink in. I am not nearly as high ranked as most CMDRs. True, I am Elite, but only in exploration.

Lawful good doesn't mean lawful nice.
