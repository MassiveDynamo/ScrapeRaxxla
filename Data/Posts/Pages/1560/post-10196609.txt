Remember: ‘As far removed from god and light of heaven as far from the centre three times to the utmost pole’ John Milton - Paradise Lost.

My assumption is still that Raxxla is somewhere in the Lost Reals area, but it may also be closer to Hecate / Artemis?

I struggle with old phraseology like this - does this mean that Eden is one third of the way from heaven to hell?
It makes me think of a system called McBurney's Point, which is located towards the Blanco 1 cluster (about 1/3 of the distance from the centre of the cluster in the direction of the Bubble. -ish). I have been there several times, before and after the FSS came out but I did not map many ring systems.

Today, I will take a look at uninhabited systems that are nearer to Hecate and Artemis, especially hand-named systems.

I think my idea to look for a point of light in a ring system is workable. Yesterday I visited the Laguz system, which has zero population and a ringed brown dwarf with 8 moons. There are a pair of megaships, immediately adjacent to each other, inside the brown dwarf ring: 'Tour Des Fiers' and the flight operations carrier 'Champion of Commerce' (both owned by Torval Mining, which is listed as a faction present in the system and the whole system is under their jurisdiction). They are visible in the ring from distance as a point of light.
Additionally, I was able to map the ring using the DSS. (2 tritium hotspots and a pair of overlapping grandiderite hotspots, not a bad place for mining). EDIT: the ring here has 4 hotspots only - the tritium/grandiderite is the contents of the rings of the gas giant with 8 moons in the Undines system.

I get Ozric's point above but then why that passage and why mention Raxxla at all? It is as close as FD can get to saying Paradise Lost is relevant to the search for Raxxla.
