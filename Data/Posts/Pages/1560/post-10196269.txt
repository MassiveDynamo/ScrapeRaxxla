I think everyone here deserves a nice Lavian Brandy.



Remember, we are all here to find Raxxla. We should be as transparent as possible and be open-minded to other view points. This is all the more true if they can substantiate their ideas via known lore (no matter where it falls on the "official lore" spectrum).

The hunt for Raxxla was designed to be worth the effort.

Anything on a Hutton mug would be nice as well.

Too bad I'm short on creativity for truckery ideas to earn an IRL one, and neglected 2Hot2Messy for months.
Honestly, the Brookes Tour's nudging to Raxxla is what made me return at last, even as completely aimless as I am.
