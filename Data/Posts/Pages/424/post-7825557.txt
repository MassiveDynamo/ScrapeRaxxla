A few of us on here have been working to increase TDWs influence in lft 926 but to no avail. It's be huge if we could work together on this to give TDW control in this system. Perhaps they would show their appreciation.
Several months ago, i got allied with TDW by participating in a war in LFT 926, which they were fighting against the Green Party. I dont know much about BGS, but TDW controlled a few stations and outposts in system at that time (sadly, i think they lost their grip on these). IIRC, they even had the highest influence at the time but were not the controlling faction (was War, not Civil War, the latter of which i think determines controlling faction). Not sure if any of this is useful, but i am surprised to see that they seem to have lost progress in that system since.
