Nope didnt.

I will check to see if i find another of this situations, im out atm exploring so if i come across one of this again ill check to see if i got it again and try to document it.

I could understand this happening if there was a server-side problem at FD, possibly exacerbated by an internet problem. Of course the bugged fss was very unreliable so it might have related to that. I suggest keeping an eye open for it & if it happens again then definitely raise a bug report; FDâ€™s response to these is sometimes of interest! It may be that there is a 500kls detection limit inherent in the fss design; whether that is intentional or not would be the interesting bit!
