Thanks!

Were you getting the 'System scan completed' message when you'd FSS'd all the bodies from the first honk?

Also, are you on PC? It'd be very interesting to see what your journal file shows for those occasions!

I play on pc, that is my platform.

That is one good question...
From what i recall in one case it didnt gave me that, cause when i tried to scan the last planet that was missing the FSS bugged out (that turn the image stuff), and i went all the way, wich was a good thing since was what made me realize that this was possible.

The other times it did say "system scan complete", doe it turned out it wasnt...
