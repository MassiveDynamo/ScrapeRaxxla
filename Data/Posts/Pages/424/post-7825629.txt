Well light can travel through the worm hole can’t it? Therefore if you go through it at sub light speed and light is also going through it then technically you’ve not gotten there quicker than light as light also went though it and just so happened to do it first

If you want to get really technical, I don't think there is a distance to travel in a worm hole. Speed is needed to get to the worm hole but once you are there, you are on the other side.
