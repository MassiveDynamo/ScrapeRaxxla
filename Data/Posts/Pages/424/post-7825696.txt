I have posted a question in Drew Wagar's q&a thread pertaining to our only known confirmation of raxxla, and the fact that the original version of David Braben's quote actually read:

"It exists, we know where it is and we know why people haven't been able to find it..."

I find this to be significantly different from "it's out there and we (FD) know where it is"

Take a look here, hopefully we get a response:
Lore questions. :)
Hereâ€™s a quicky, do Thargoids have anything to do with the dark wheel, Raxxla or the club? Specifically the star maps found at there active sites.
