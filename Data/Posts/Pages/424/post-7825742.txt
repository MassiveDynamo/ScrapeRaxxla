Also, i would like to note for the newer guys that in previous versions of the player log journal, there was a celestial body classification of "Rogue Planet". This has been taken out since 2.4 (i think), and to my knowledge, no body was ever found that fit this category.

Edit: went back to double check. Interestingly, "RoguePlanet" was a listed category of star type, which might suggest it is something outside of the bounds of any system that one might be able to jump to, given the right circumstance.

This is to be expected (we discussed this topic earlier in the thread). A rogue planet is one not bound gravitationally to any other body, therefore it will be on its lonesome. ED fsd requires a star to jump to, therefore if rogue planets exist in-game then they must be classed as a star type otherwise you would never be able to reach them, effectively putting them outside the game....

If they are to be found in-game they should appear as very low-mass systems, so will probably have a system designation something like Sectorname XX-X A?, since A type systems have the lowest mass.
