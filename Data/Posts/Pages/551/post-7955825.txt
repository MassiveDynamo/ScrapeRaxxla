Always cloak your shadowy evil world dominating organization in ordinary mundane language and terminology. People on the train hear you talking about how things are going at The Club and they think your discussing your golf game. That's why they referred to the CIA as "The Company".

Ya i suppose im a bit of an escapist when it comes to fiction... I prefer my evil organizations to have names like Spectre, or the Dark Wheel
