That would imply that TDW came up with the toast first, then chose the location of the base to fit it. The chances of them randomly picking a location, the looking out of the window and thinking "You know what, we could make a really cool toast about this view" are astronomical. They'd be much more likely to wind up with the toast:

To those 3 stars in a triangle
That line over there
Those look a bit like a frog, if you squint
I think the implication here goes back to our discussion last night Drew. If the toast is some kind of intergalactic treasure map, left by Mr Ryder, for example, then the toast could be a clue of this nature.

You also have to ask yourself (yes I know its "alleged" toast, but lets assume it IS the toast) why TDW would have some random toast to Raxxla, that had no relation to it's whereabouts. Assuming the working assumption that they havn't found it is correct, then the assumption it containers pointers to the breadcrumbs they know of, is a reasonable supposition in my opinion.

EDIT:
To me, it sounds like TDW congratulating themselves for having "some kind of vague idea where it might be" possibly.

EDIT, EDIT:

(pirate laughter) To the palm tree at the bottom of the beach! To the sun that shines brightest on the 3rd rock! To the seagull that calls from the bush on the right! To the treasure chest! (more pirate laughter)

"So, have we found it yet boss?"

"No! But we think we know what country the beach is in. As soon as we work out which coast line it's on, we will track it down in no time!"
