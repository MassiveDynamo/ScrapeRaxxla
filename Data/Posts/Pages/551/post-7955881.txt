It would seem the Galactic Map can actually hide stars ( unless it's my GUI ). Try searching for Beta P. It will direct you to Beta Pavonis in the local area. Then click the next arrow and you will be directed towards the Magellanic Cloud. Try it and see what happens.

That'll be Beta Phoenicis.
It got lost.
