Wow, just had some fun. I was fiddling about with the Galactic Map on my usual search for the Dark Wheel Station, Raxxla ( I still think it's a beer ) and the perfect cup of tea when I noticed a certain Brown Dwarf that is named but with no population. Why??

So off I pootled to check it out and sure enough, one planet had a human signature. Ok, it turned out to be an INRA base with some lovely logs but it got me thinking. If the Dark Wheel are in hiding then I still think we can detect human constructs.

Anyhooo, I did love the fact I discovered something by accident even though it's probably been seen. The source of the Mycoid virus discovery. I love all of this. The mystery, suspense, and beauty of it all. I'm getting all poetic, I need another pint of Ra'xxla
