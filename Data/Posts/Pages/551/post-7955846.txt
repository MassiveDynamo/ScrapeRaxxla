Ya i suppose im a bit of an escapist when it comes to fiction... I prefer my evil organizations to have names like Spectre, or the Dark Wheel

Council Refuse Collection (outsourced). You never know what’s in those black bin bags!
(Well I do, ‘cos I’ve got a cat...)

But I don’t think the Dark Wheel are evil. They are explorers & adventurers, shadowy only because the Club would wipe them out ( presumably to protect the Club stranglehold over Raxxla, and to protect things like the Club’s Dynasty bases out in the black that explorers may find and disclose to the general populace).
