I hadn't considered, find all 6 locations of the Toast, and plot what's in the middle of them, instead of waypointing them...

It makes sense, if you imagined looking out from Raxxla the way we do Earth, the Toast could be to their 6 most prominent astral bodies, the way we have constellations and the North Star (Polaris)...

That would imply that TDW came up with the toast first, then chose the location of the base to fit it. The chances of them randomly picking a location, the looking out of the window and thinking "You know what, we could make a really cool toast about this view" are astronomical. They'd be much more likely to wind up with the toast:

To those 3 stars in a triangle
That line over there
Those look a bit like a frog, if you squint
