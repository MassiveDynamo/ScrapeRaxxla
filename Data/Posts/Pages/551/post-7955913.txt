I am sooooo far behind the times.

The Formidine Rift was chock-full of mythological 'clues', especially Ancient Greek, so a lot of the old constellations got investigated pretty heavily while that was active.

I was chasing down a cloning/rebirth/terraforming theory with Cmdr Matzov and we hit upon the Phoenix as potentially being relevant - hence Phoenicis. Interestingly there's a lot of waterworlds being terraformed in Phoenicis systems.
