I disagree. I would much rather find that the "powerful, twisted men" currently occupying Raxxla are a cartel of self-serving, greedy corporate types. The kind of people who would call themselves something just as mundane as "The Club". If they turn out to be some monastic order of "enlightened" cultists ... that, IMO, would be truly horrible.
I couldn't agree more. Plus "The Club" is inconspicuous, almost innocent, as a name. They would be unlikely to call themselves The Cult of Twisted Men, or similar, as it may well draw some extra attention ;-)
