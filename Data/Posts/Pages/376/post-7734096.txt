I don't think the idea is bad, i am quite sure tbh that a 'misjump' is needed (and that this is how Raxxla was originally discovered also) but i don't think Thargoid Probes are the way. Remember this is supposed to be reachable by 'Day 0' means... at launch ED didn't have thargoid probes innit.

My own tinfoil hypothesis is that there is still an old jump-gate around and that's the only way to 'misjump'. Problem is that jumpgate is most likely dark and quite probably right next to the DW dark station. So not something you can find randomly but rather part of some quest. I'm guessing that even finding the jumpgate will not let you use it unless you have some 'activation code' from TDW.

Other ways to achieve a misjump might also be interesting to explore (damaged FSD maybe ?) although i don't have high hopes that it will work.

Was going to suggest this-do neutron boosts until fsd down around 80% level then start to jump near/towards likely candidates.
