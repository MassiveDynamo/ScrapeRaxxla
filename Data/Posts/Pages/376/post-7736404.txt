Not the codex. The movie intro in the file in your game folders. It's over a planet with those massive features but seen from a nearby moon looking at a similar station and planet.

It has two rings close together. Is that Jacques station or something. Maybe it just made a jump. I don't think that is a normal station.

Is this not the planet that station is over. Or at least the surface map type. What type of planet is this:

How many other planets have that surface design? From what I can tell it is a rocky ice world. A somewhat rarer type. Would that count as a dieing world? I forget which thing had dieing world attached. DTW, or Raxxla?

That is Synuefe VM-D C15-10 2 A I think. I thought most rocky ice worlds were relatively featureless like ice worlds. Is this only in certain areas or close or far from sole?! This is probably what to focus on for that one movie station. Plus I have a feeling it's one of these rocky ice worlds with a small 1 sized moon and very close. I also have a weird feeling that one station will be something we already know about but are just missing the obvious about. I swear I saw something at some point that it was a known location. But I have no idea where I would have seen it.

Ok, one of them is ariel at uranus in sol. The other is the other location or something. I'm not sure.

Edit: Yea, those probably aren't the same planet. I wonder where that it. I don't know what is going on in elite enough.
