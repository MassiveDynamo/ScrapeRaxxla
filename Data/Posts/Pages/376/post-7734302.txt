I found this on Isinor Search zone Shelter you can scan a datapoint and then you get logs, it leads me to a new search zone Habitation but it is only visible in my srv, it is 16ls away so bookmarked but when in ship het search zone is away, did found the habitation scanning the datapoint did give me a job offer collect 4 black box, can we relate this as a invite for The Dark Wheel,
