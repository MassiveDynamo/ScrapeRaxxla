Remember this is supposed to be reachable by 'Day 0' means... at launch ED didn't have thargoid probes innit.
Do you mean Raxxla was supposed to be reachable from start? Whoever said that? Only official piece of information/confirmation we ever got was that Raxxla is in the game and that's it. 'Can we discover/find it and fly there once found' question was never answered and people should stop spreading false internet claims.
