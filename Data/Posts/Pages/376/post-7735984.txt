Do you mean Raxxla was supposed to be reachable from start? Whoever said that? Only official piece of information/confirmation we ever got was that Raxxla is in the game and that's it. 'Can we discover/find it and fly there once found' question was never answered and people should stop spreading false internet claims.

In September 2015, Drew Wagar - one of the official writers for Elite Dangerous - stated "I spoke to David Braben directly in 2014 and he confirmed to me that 'It’s out there and we (FD) know where it is.' – So it does exist."[6] Michael Brookes said “There will be no clues.”[7]

Day 0 ~ 2014, no thargoids, no planetary landings, no engineering, no generation ships and no guardians.
