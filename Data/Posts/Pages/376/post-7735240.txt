John Harper (forum name: Thargoid) confirmed this on the forum.

The Dark Wheel never found Raxxla.
Unless they have found it in the last four years, they are still searching.
The secret of how to get there, died with Jason Ryder.

See, that's what bugs me. It's their main objective. Yet instead of recruiting 50,000 CMDRs, with missions, promises of wealth, requests for scans or any info, etc., they act all "mysterious" and ****block themselves by insisting on Elite ranking and a "secret test of ability" first.

I mean, Ram Tah wanted info on Guardians, and he got SPAMMED with it, within 24 hours of announcing his interest. I'd say that's the way to go about finding something.
