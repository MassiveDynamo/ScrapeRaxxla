See, that's what bugs me. It's their main objective. Yet instead of recruiting 50,000 CMDRs, with missions, promises of wealth, requests for scans or any info, etc., they act all "mysterious" and ****block themselves by insisting on Elite ranking and a "secret test of ability" first.

I mean, Ram Tah wanted info on Guardians, and he got SPAMMED with it, within 24 hours of announcing his interest. I'd say that's the way to go about finding something.

It's just their style. Secrecy is their legacy.

There are player groups that operate that way as well. They listen, but don't talk.
