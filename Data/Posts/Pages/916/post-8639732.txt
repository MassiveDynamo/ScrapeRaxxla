Drew wrote the FR beacons and text for the Comms. He knows nothing of Raxxla.

The expedition was either followed by Thargs or Black Flight, its not clear to me yet. Add in space madness and further obfuscates it.

Lights/whispers in hyperspace/witchspace have long been associated, rightly or wrongly, with Thargs.

In the Codex there is no link between the Thargs or the Guardians and Raxxla, there is a link between Dark Wheel and Raxxla.

Make of that what you will.

We were told that we should have found the raxxla long ago, if I am not mistaken even before the thargoids

Where you hearing that, any source or link?
