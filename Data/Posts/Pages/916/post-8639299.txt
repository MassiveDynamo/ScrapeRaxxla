Yeah, I've mentioned that being a Raxxla clue several times but each time was closed down by the psycho penguin saying FDev wouldn't put everything in 1 place, and the area has been searched thoroughly.

The codex came after the rift and I always wondered are FDev telling us we missed something?

Well, methinks it could therfore be a very good hiding place! The thing that initially attracted me to Han_Zenâ€™s system map anomalies hypothesis was they are towards RA=20. Getting out beyond Star of India, NGC7822 was quite obvious...in front but off to the side a little.
