Yeah, I've mentioned that being a Raxxla clue several times but each time was closed down by the psycho penguin saying FDev wouldn't put everything in 1 place, and the area has been searched thoroughly.

The codex came after the rift and I always wondered are FDev telling us we missed something?
ya im not sure about everything in one place, but lately leaning towads FD being themeaticlly lazy. I think we were all hoping for seperate mysteries... but im now leaning towards everything being tied together.
