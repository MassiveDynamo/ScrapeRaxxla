what is this mission?

Do you mean the Founder/Elite missions which were available at Shinrarta Dezhra (if you had the permit) but which mysteriously disappeared? See first page of this thread:
“Obfuscated In The Outer Rim (Answering The Call Of Adventure)”: Elite Explorer: Data crystals are found by the Dark Wheel and supposedly contain a map with coordinates with an unknown context “...information on a certain celestial body, you know the one I mean. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth."

But I think Pete is talking about the Dynasty Plot missions whose logs are recorded in the Dynasty surface sites out towards the Formidine Rift. Some of them hinted at an alien presence, an unseen menace, mysterious heat signatures (some of that could be the Zurara, the missions were kept separate and did not know of each others existence)-all part of the Formidine Rift (FRift) mystery that was started by Drew Wagar with his book “Elite Reclamation”, continued in Elite Premonition, and ended with Salomé’s death at the hands of a murderous assassin during a somewhat controversial community event. You can read all about it if you google, probably on the Canonn site.

Coincidentally I came across Rebecca Weston yesterday, so she didnt die in Tionisla. She’s now flying an Orca in the neighbourhood of Crom (I’m currently pursuing the last few permits, got Crom and now working for Isinor). She flew off before I could ask her for Salomé’s phone number should she also have survived.
