Get your tin foil out....Carter's got a theory....

I have always though of the toast as a pirate treasure map to Raxxla, but what if it is a shopping list for how to impress TDW and get an invite?

Jewel that burns brightest - Ngadandari fire opal
Parents greif/lovers woe - black box? Personal effects?
Whispers/sirens - thargoid heart
Vagabond heart - anyone got any ideas on this one?
To Raxxla - we have to find Raxxla? Or bring them all that and they will help us find Raxxla?

Vagabond heart - hopefully something you steal, to complete the theory.

Ideas/elaboration welcome

maybe rescue capsule.
but in general, you led me to an interesting idea.
We were told that we should have found the raxxla long ago, if I am not mistaken even before the thargoids, then almost everything related to the thargoids can be discarded. The only thing that confuses is the base. It seems to me that if certain objects are inserted there, then something can happen.

And I also noticed a very interesting thing here that can possibly serve as a hint to all of us, in the section passengers I noticed that some people want to travel to points with interesting names) now the translation will not be entirely accurate) as a true polar star, the beginning of a journey, etc. can it really be that obvious?
