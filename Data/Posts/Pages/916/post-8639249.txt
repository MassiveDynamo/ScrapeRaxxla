Form Rift, alpha mission, text 5/6 - "lights calling me, siren song"
Anybody knows, was that event prior raxxla codex, after or same time? DIdn't play that time.
Yeah, I've mentioned that being a Raxxla clue several times but each time was closed down by the psycho penguin saying FDev wouldn't put everything in 1 place, and the area has been searched thoroughly.

The codex came after the rift and I always wondered are FDev telling us we missed something?
