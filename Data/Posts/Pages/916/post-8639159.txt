Yeah I actually dwell on that one too. It lead me to a lot of experimenting, like following Thargoids into their own wormhole with a Thargoid heart and sensor, probe, and link. Thereby making Thargoids both the door and key, by making their systems think I'm part of their ship...no dice on that experiment. I also did some experimenting with literal Ancient Keys lol.

I feel, right now, that key is our own FSD. We need Metadrive modifications and there are undiscovered engineers yet in the game. The key to them, I feel, is getting the Dark Wheel into specific permit systems and having exclusive access to these off-grid engineers.
please write literally how the hint about the door and key sounds.
thx
