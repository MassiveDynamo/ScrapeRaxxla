Yeah, I've mentioned that being a Raxxla clue several times but each time was closed down by the psycho penguin saying FDev wouldn't put everything in 1 place, and the area has been searched thoroughly.

The codex came after the rift and I always wondered are FDev telling us we missed something?

I think 4 or 5 are close and lay down in direction to FR sites
And that megaship lost here, if you google, 1st will be some ancient politician/librarian/knight ...who wrote many things, which could be grief/woe/etc.
However, right now I see 4-5 carriers near that ship. They see nothing. So not sure what to think.
