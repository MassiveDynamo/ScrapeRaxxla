Form Rift, alpha mission, text 5/6 - "lights calling me, siren song"
Anybody knows, was that event prior raxxla codex, after or same time? DIdn't play that time.

The FRift was set up well before the Codex appeared. I still believe that the Thargoids were originally intended to be based in Bovomit, several of the FRift messages suggest some form of threat in that direction and it has always been locked, although the messages could have been intended to indicate space madness. But it seems to me at some stage FD decided to move the goids to Col70 region which was originally unlocked but then FD locked it.
