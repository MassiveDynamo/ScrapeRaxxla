Yeah, I've mentioned that being a Raxxla clue several times but each time was closed down by the psycho penguin saying FDev wouldn't put everything in 1 place, and the area has been searched thoroughly.

The codex came after the rift and I always wondered are FDev telling us we missed something?
what is this mission?
