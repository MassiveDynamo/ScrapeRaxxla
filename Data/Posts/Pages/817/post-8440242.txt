If it's a personal journey, what if we each have a unique criteria we have to meet, randomized based on their technique they use for building systems and planets. That way only a few would ever get invited because it can never be leaked, what you need to do.

That’s a very fair point! It would be feasible, presumably by using their commander name as a seed for the criteria determination. Unfortunately there’s no way to check it until people announce they have been invited to join TDW & we can compare their experiences.
