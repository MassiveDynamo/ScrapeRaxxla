The name of this character is something that Drew Wagar has mentioned before as deriving from that of a taxi driver who once got him from a conference back to the airport in good time (in Milan, iirc). It is not therefore a clue but I'm not sure where to find a video that he mentions this. It was some time ago, early 2016 at the latest, and he would have been talking about the characters from Reclamation.

The Kingdom of Prester John reference is interesting but I wonder if it is a red herring, as everything I have read about it says that there was no such place and that it was all just hearsay and stories being presented as fact by prominent persons. It's certainly fair to ask how much of the Raxxla myth is really myth and which bits might have useful information buried away. Five years ago, if I hadn't heard anything otherwise, and if I stumbled across a Guardian Beacon, I might have thought of that as Raxxla...

Realising the name similarity/reference has made me want to re-read John Buchan’s story. I enjoyed it at age 14, a millennium or so ago! Must see if I can find an ebook version. Currently re-reading Tales of the Frontier.

Might well be a red herring, or just colour fluff, especially if it was Drew’s invention since he has said he knows nothing about Raxxla. It was just the fact that FD referenced Prester John in the Raxxla codex entry that made my eyebrows hit the ceiling.

I still suspect Raxxla is Guardian-related, quite possibly an ark ship.
