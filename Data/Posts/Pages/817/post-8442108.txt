Just downloaded an epub of John Buchanâ€™s Prester John from Project Gutenburg for later reading. But apparently
Prester John was also a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prester_John_(comics)). I suspect the latter was more likely to have influenced FD thinking.
