Nobody has picked up on my comment, although admittedly it was in the middle of a load of text:

The Raxxla codex entry mentions Prester John, an old fable (apparently Marco Polo referred to a ruler named Prester John) and adventure story by John Buchan (I remember it was a good read, did it at school) .

I realised yesterday that Giovanni is a male Italian given name (from Latin Ioannes). It is the Italian equivalent of John. And prester means a church official, but is also used to mean “elder”, which suggests rank or reputation . The Cambridge dictionary says “prestigio. noun. prestige, reputation or influence due to success, rank etc.”

So Luko Prestigio Giovanni (member of TDW and mentor of Salomé, see Reclamation and Premonition books) is equivalent to Luke Prester John.

Is this coincidental? Is it an FD hint? Is the codex actually a riddle with hidden meaning?

The name of this character is something that Drew Wagar has mentioned before as deriving from that of a taxi driver who once got him from a conference back to the airport in good time (in Milan, iirc). It is not therefore a clue but I'm not sure where to find a video that he mentions this. It was some time ago, early 2016 at the latest, and he would have been talking about the characters from Reclamation.

The Kingdom of Prester John reference is interesting but I wonder if it is a red herring, as everything I have read about it says that there was no such place and that it was all just hearsay and stories being presented as fact by prominent persons. It's certainly fair to ask how much of the Raxxla myth is really myth and which bits might have useful information buried away. Five years ago, if I hadn't heard anything otherwise, and if I stumbled across a Guardian Beacon, I might have thought of that as Raxxla...
