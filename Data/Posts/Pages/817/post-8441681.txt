Ive been enjoying the personal journey discussion. And Jorki ya good catch with the Prester John reference! - Im just realizing that as part of my personal journey I will be needing to get a craft with a higher jump range... Filthy Aquilas Halo is proving difficult to even get into with my 46ly Asp.

I have a 63 ly Phantom exploration ship & love it, it’s got range, space, manoeuvrability and speed. It’s the one I did Distant Worlds 2 with last year. Highly recommend the Phantom-IMHO best ship in-game! A year or so ago I had a Conda exploration ship but the low manoeuvrability niggled.
