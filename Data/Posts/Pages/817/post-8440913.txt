Nobody has picked up on my comment, although admittedly it was in the middle of a load of text:

The Raxxla codex entry mentions Prester John, an old fable (apparently Marco Polo referred to a ruler named Prester John) and adventure story by John Buchan (I remember it was a good read, did it at school) .

I realised yesterday that Giovanni is a male Italian given name (from Latin Ioannes). It is the Italian equivalent of John. And prester means a church official, but is also used to mean “elder”, which suggests rank or reputation . The Cambridge dictionary says “prestigio. noun. prestige, reputation or influence due to success, rank etc.”

So Luko Prestigio Giovanni (member of TDW and mentor of Salomé, see Reclamation and Premonition books) is equivalent to Luke Prester John.

Is this coincidental? Is it an FD hint? Is the codex actually a riddle with hidden meaning?
