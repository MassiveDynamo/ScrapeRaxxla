Ive been enjoying the personal journey discussion. And Jorki ya good catch with the Prester John reference! - Im just realizing that as part of my personal journey I will be needing to get a craft with a higher jump range... Filthy Aquilas Halo is proving difficult to even get into with my 46ly Asp.
