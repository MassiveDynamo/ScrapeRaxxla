I just super cruised from shinrarta towards it for 1 LY nothing. it also looks the same in the sol system so going to super cruise it from there. one thing I will say for sol, when I did a sol super cruise towards Sirius 1ly, when I dropped a search and rescue ship named "Hope" was flying around, and when I did 1ly from sol to Alioth and droped I got the same but the search and rescue was named "Fighter". this may mean nothing but it's doing my head in.
