I checked a bit on this a while ago. The clumping from lists is quite clear. This page seem to be the basis for the religion / mythology section of names: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deities_by_classification
If you check against the game, you see clumping of both classification and the specific religion. I have not bothered to check the if the system IDs follow the lists in order.
What is clear, is that there has been filtering of the lists. Any names with non English letters, apostrophes or other difficult stuff, have been dropped.
I also suspect that names have been left out, because their assigned system already had been assigned a catalogue name.
Do you happen to have the list of which names are used still?

I didn't see any obvious clumping for the Greek ones besides the general "deities only seem to appear 45-85 LY from Sol" restriction, but it'd be good to do some more thorough checks.
