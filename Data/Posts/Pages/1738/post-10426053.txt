rather than anything more ordered.
I meant that I didn't expect the figures to be perfect circles like in the picture I posted.
Intersecting points (yes, it is vague, but we don't have much of a firm foundation to build upon...) could be significant, and the big arrows could point to something, nodes or connections. Spawning points, passages, hints...
The design is of course somewhat reminiscent of an Ocellus station but it could be a disguised plan of how to find Raxxla (or something leading to Raxxla).
We have 6 "arrows" pointing outward that seem to draw a perimeter (dotted). 6 elements (systems? Notable places?) that delimit the area of search.
3 arcs (3 superpowers?) encompassing a circle (a system?), and in it... the prize.
