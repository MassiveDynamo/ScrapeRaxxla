Rumination upon the Raxxla logo

Key themes I’m entertaining here, revolve around the concept of the Celtic Otherworld and of burial mounds as passages to it. Combined with other concepts of the ‘omphalos’ as a description of a mound or mountain.

In the logo I suspect the inner hexagon denotes something hidden. So what if it’s hidden inside something.

The image below is not intended to represent anything directly in game nor anything physically, but rather a metaphorical concept. An otherworldly location hidden inside a mountain, with numerous passages to it.

I’m wondering if MB combined concepts of old English myth and Milton and Dante (the later two associated Eden being on top a mountain).

What if Elite Legacy is pointing us to the base of this ‘beautiful mountain’. Dante’s begun in the underworld, in game this is a zone populated by various ‘other Edens’ as Holdstock describes in his ‘Lost Realms’.

So could the logo represent an over-head topography of a tumulus?

In game would such a metaphorical mountain exist in the underworld, or have its peak in the heavens? Is this a metaphor too far… probably yes.

Excuse the terrible design, I threw this together on a mobile, very basic.

Contemporary astronomers have already drawn a mountain in our sky:
Mensa (constellation) - Wikipedia

Lacaille was on his Cape Town observatory when he charted a bunch of Southern Hemisphere constellations, and decided to homage the nearby Table Mountain; so named because of its flat top. It's near the Magellanic Clouds (right beside the LMC, in fact) because of the Cape of Good Hope's association with them - more Age of Discovery stuff!

Also, two other mountains flank its Earthly counterpart: the Devil's Peak and Lion's Head.

...and Alpha Mensae was renamed ingame - it's none other than the perma-locked Witch's Reach. Huh.
