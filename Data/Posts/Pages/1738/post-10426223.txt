It's a random name for NPC's
ah ok, bummer

btw, today i was doing a few 'Megaship' data scan 'ship log' missions and i noticed there's like some ingame mail that gets sent after you complete the scan & mission , which tells you all the locations the Megaship is apparently going.

Just got me thinking: Could *RAXXLA * intel be hidden somehow in these types of subtle and "random" gameplay content? At this point i guess we're all just grasping at speculative space straws.
