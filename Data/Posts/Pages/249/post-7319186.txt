So, here's a very interesting tidbit I found on Reddit from about two years ago:

"Joint-Tester: My dad got allied with the children of raxxla and they gave him a passenger mission to a system just between the heart and soul in eafots. The passenger said it was the raxxla staging point he was taking him too."

Exact midpoint in the galmap for H&S is -5208 | 117 | -5394, +/- a unit on the x & z axes. Closest system is EAFOTS XQ-K B36-0. Anyone heading out to H&S might want to take a look there first.
