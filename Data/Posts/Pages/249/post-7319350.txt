Aww and here I thought I struck gold. Ah well, I appreciate the sanity check. Need more tinfoil.

You're not the first, and won't be the last, either

I saw that mission too, thought "Could be a trail here...", and set off to the location (without taking the passenger - I didn't want someone else on board!). When I finally got there, it turned out to be possibly the most un-interesting tourist beacon I have been to, with a line of text that doesn't say much more than "The Children of Raxxla set up a staging post here for expeditions into the Rift". Great. Still, it got me out to see the Heart and Soul, which was worth it for the views alone!
