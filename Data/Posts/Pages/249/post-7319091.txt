Now that is intresting.
Never been to formidine rift, i'll try that approach now and 'll record the witchspace sound to see the spectrum of it, already was on path that way, to check NGC 7822 nebula, and heart and soul nebula.
Being in one direction with H&S is another reason to check that clue.


As a side note: been using audacity to records ingame sound and look into spectrum, may there be another tool which is better?

Audacity is a very good tool. If you want something simpler I think SPEK was used by some during UA/UP audio analysis days.
