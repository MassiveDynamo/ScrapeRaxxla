The Opmhalos Rift is a central subject in the codex for Raxxla.

An omphalos point is a nave point. The point that does not move, when something rotates. It's a fixed connection between Earth and the sky. A point on the Axis mundi.

Bringing this back round, I'm out at Alpha Cygni at the moment. The system map object is still there, and I captured a quick video showing how it moves relative to the star map and the star itself when you reposition the reticule:

This is intriguing, but for the life of me I've no idea where to go with it.

Edit: Forum plugin broken? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wxqo-b7_- for the link.

Edit2: I'm not sure what's going on with that link either - "Wxqo-b7_-" is the string for the video.

Edit3: Oh really, please don't tell me B and s together are being swear word filtered?

Edit4: https://tinyurl.com/y8jsv9hh - let's hope the forum allows that.
