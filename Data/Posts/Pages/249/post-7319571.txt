I wonder if we could compile the GalNet miss-jumps?
Maybe there's a region of (witch)space which is a sort of Bermuda triangle, well pyramid, and then try jumping in/out of it to see if we can miss-jump too.

Some are probably just relating to Thargoid teases, remember when the hyperspace interdictions were just rumour, but could be something.

Antares was going from Sirius to an unknown system(possibly Antares). The wreckage was found in Luyten 205-128.
Starship 1 was going from Furuhjelm I-645 to Azaleach, when it blew up.
Jacques was going from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point.

I don't think those locations can tell us much, but I could be wrong. Both Antares and Jacques were heading towards the core of the galaxy. Starship 1 were not.
