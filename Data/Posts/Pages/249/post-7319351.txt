It's the Children if Raxxla staging point. I've taken the mission myself ages ago. It's just to one of the systems that the player faction set themselves as a gathering point during one of the Formadine Rift surveys. This was back when we thought there was going to be a threat coming from the the rift.

I think they might have been acting on information from Drew Wagar at the time, but I think plans for any further story points were scrapped by FD in favour of concentrating on Thargoid content.

This, and the lack of further elaboration on the hyperdiction/EMP/lurking evil & heat sources theme of the Dynasty logs was what made me think that the Goids were originally supposed to come from Bovomit but for reasons unknown FD moved them to Col 70 area.

But he doesn't understand the needs of spaceship piloting, nor does the ship's cat...
