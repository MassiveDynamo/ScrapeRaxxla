There is something goin on in witch-space. These reports, Jacques miss jump, Halseyâ€™s accident and the Antares story, all have common components.

Strange sounds or vissions in hyper-space and drive fail.

I wonder if we could compile the GalNet miss-jumps?
Maybe there's a region of (witch)space which is a sort of Bermuda triangle, well pyramid, and then try jumping in/out of it to see if we can miss-jump too.

Some are probably just relating to Thargoid teases, remember when the hyperspace interdictions were just rumour, but could be something.
