So, here's a very interesting tidbit I found on Reddit from about two years ago:

"Joint-Tester: My dad got allied with the children of raxxla and they gave him a passenger mission to a system just between the heart and soul in eafots. The passenger said it was the raxxla staging point he was taking him too."

Exact midpoint in the galmap for H&S is -5208 | 117 | -5394, +/- a unit on the x & z axes. Closest system is EAFOTS XQ-K B36-0. Anyone heading out to H&S might want to take a look there first.

It's the Children if Raxxla staging point. I've taken the mission myself ages ago. It's just to one of the systems that the player faction set themselves as a gathering point during one of the Formadine Rift surveys. This was back when we thought there was going to be a threat coming from the the rift.

I think they might have been acting on information from Drew Wagar at the time, but I think plans for any further story points were scrapped by FD in favour of concentrating on Thargoid content.
