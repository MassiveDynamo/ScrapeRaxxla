If no new entries are made by me for a period of 2 weeks, you must assume that I have been eliminated by the Dark Wheel, swallowed by the abyss, or found Raxxla and have gone there. I hope for the latter (but will probably send pretty postcards)

So... From your previous statement, can we now assume Mighty Dangerous has indeed found Raxxla, showed you the way and you are living the life?
