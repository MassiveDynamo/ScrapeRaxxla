Glad I came across this thread, I have setup a player faction dedicated to seeking out Raxxla. Maybe raising the Dark Wheels influence to become the controlling faction in Founders World may revitalize the missions?


Is your group still active and how many?
You are doing what I'm already doing but I'm alone.

Many thanks.
