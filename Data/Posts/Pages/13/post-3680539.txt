Glad I came across this thread, I have setup a player faction dedicated to seeking out Raxxla. Maybe raising the Dark Wheels influence to become the controlling faction in Founders World may revitalize the missions?

Certainly a possibility; note that the missions were spread out all over the bubble, so they were not isolated to Shinrarta Dezhra.
