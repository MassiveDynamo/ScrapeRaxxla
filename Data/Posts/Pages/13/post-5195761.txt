Leave no stone unturned

I've received a PM offering help in the search for Raxxla. It is much appreciated. The PM lists two possibilities for the location; the bubble and the Formidine Rift. So I've been thinking about those two areas, and decided why not start with the bubble. Next question is how to best organize the search as not to waste effort. I have no answer for that yet, except that it must be easy to use, delegation of areas must be simple and it must easy to get an overview of progress.

Determining the systems to visit could made using the cube systems method available in edsm.net. Maybe exclude any inhabited systems, and then look at bodies to see if anyone of them have no orbital periods, suggesting a roque body such as Raxxla.
