Glad I came across this thread, I have setup a player faction dedicated to seeking out Raxxla. Maybe raising the Dark Wheels influence to become the controlling faction in Founders World may revitalize the missions?


People have tried to make the Dark Wheel the controlling faction before (Fact: They were highly successful) but alas, because The Pilots Federation is in said system Frontier has it set up so the Dark Wheel can't take over (Likely because if the Pilots Fed. lost control of their system...well, that's a GalNet war with the DW) unfortunately.

Sorry to break it too ya, but the Dark Wheel will never control Dezhra until the Devs allow it, and that also means no expansion.
