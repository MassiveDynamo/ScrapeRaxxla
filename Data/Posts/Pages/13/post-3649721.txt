I've been lurking on this goal for a while, thinking it over. Raxxla is intriguing, but the quest to find it is a mystery of the real sense. I mean that to say that there aren't really any breadcrumbs leading us there. It's more like a crime, where the object genuinely doesn't want to be found but has nonetheless left evidence of its existence.We may not get to find it, or if we do we may not be able to do anything about it. It may be locked behind an unobtainable permit.All of that said, I have a plan that just might maybe work. Maybe. It'll be a very long term affair and I don't stand any better chances than the rest of you. If I do find it though you'll be the first to know.
