How to eat an elephant

You divide it into smaller chunks and then begin to eat the first chunk. Using the cube method in edsm.net to provide the system names in a 50*50*50Ly cube is a good start. So (over) estimating the bubble to be a cube of 1000Ly*1000Ly*1000Ly gives 8000 cubes of 50Ly*50Ly*50Ly. 8000 cubes, that sounds easy...

So starting in the corner of [-500,-500, -500] and giving edsm.net this query:https://www.edsm.net/api-v1/cube-sy...ze=50&showPermit=1&showInformation=1&coords=1, I got 2 systems returned: Synuefai XB-K b26-0 & Synuefai UJ-P d6-9. Inspecting the systems in GalMap shows more systems in the area, so I got curious as to why I only got 2 systems returned. Now a number of good reasons could explain why they weren't included, such as the missing systems simply isn't submitted to edsm.net, and that appears to be the reason for the systems I checked nearby. Assumptions are always worth validating.

As a little curiosity, I got first discoveries on bodies a mere 334Ly from Sol
