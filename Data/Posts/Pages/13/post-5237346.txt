Found a possible clue while reading Reclamation after Drew mentioned it was cannon: "You've been to the Frontier?" "To it, threw it, past it. Don't tell no-one, but I've got as far as the Formadine Rift. Not many folk can say that. And no one has gone past it and lived to tell the tale. Edge of the galactic arm. Take a line from Reorte to Riedquat, to the edge of the arm, and keep going. [...] Quiet for the most part until..." "Until What?" "Well let's just say there's some serious [can't post explicits] out there. Stuff you wouldn't believe... [...] It'll all come back to bite them one day. It's all there in the Imperial Databanks somewhere... [...] Have you ever heard of the Tionisla System?

So, does that mean it may be possible to buy the system information for whatever she was talking about in an Empire station? I'm a few thousand light years away from the core worlds right now, but would someone be able to check the map for far out systems in that direction with system data available? All you need to do is line up Reorte and Riedquat on the map, zoom out, and hold down the "Galaxy Cam Translate Forward" button until you either see something that stands out on the galaxy map, or a lone far out system (>20k ly) that has system data available. If that fails you could try the same process in Tionisla. I'll do it myself when I get back from deep space in a week or two as well if no one can find anything.

I think what you're looking for is here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/324796-THE-FORMIDINE-RIFT-MYSTERY-(Part-4)

There is something in the Formidine Rift but it isn't Raxxla. Okay... Drew said that it's always possible that Raxxla could be anywhere, even in the Rift, but that if it is he isn't aware of it because Frontier hasn't shared anything about Raxxla with him.
