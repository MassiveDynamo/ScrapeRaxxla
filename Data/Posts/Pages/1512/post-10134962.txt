I've just discovered there are activable doors on some (all?) orbital installations. Maintenance tunnels that open upon contact with the ship.
The actionnable doors are marked with a glowing red triangle.
It looks like a CQC thing, but since we mentioned passing through doors as a gateway to Raxxla or something else I felt like mentioning it.
Maybe it is well known but I never heard about it myself .
