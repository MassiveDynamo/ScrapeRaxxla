Well is a sense our FSD enabled spaceships are keys that are also doors apparently, we can literally open doors with this key, by pressing on this door and then we go in witchspace with it.
Are we supposed to activate the FSD in one of this corridors, targeting a star in front? Normally we would be mass-locked.
What if we are not and the structure act as an amplificator instead?
Edit : Just to be clear with the previous post with doors and corridors. It is sometimes network of doors and tunnels behind a first outside door with more doors and tunnels in all three dimensions.
