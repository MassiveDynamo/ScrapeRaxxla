Maybe each piece is a star from different constellations that creates it's own "Great Diamond of Virgo". Or not...

Schedar being the brightest start in Cassiopeiae
Whisper in Witch-Space? No idea
Siren of the Deepest Void? Feel like there's a connection here with Demeter and Persephone/Cora. I believe Demeter sent sirens to watch over Persephone. They failed and were turned into bird-like creatures. I know they're typically depicted as bird-like creatures in art.
The parent's grief, lover's woe - Persephone/Cora

As someone has said the Elysian mysterious seems so apparent here. And it was also said in here that some answers might be discoverable underground - connection between Cora being in the underworld and the codex's Cora claiming she wants to 'dig it up'.

Very apparent to me that there's an obvious Greek connection. No idea how to tie all of it. Maybe we need to travel from one system to next to unlock something? Or the form a "map" or a "Great Diamond of Virgo".
