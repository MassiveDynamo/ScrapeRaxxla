I've just discovered there are activable doors on some (all?) orbital installations. Maintenance tunnels that open upon contact with the ship.
The actionnable doors are marked with a glowing red triangle.
It looks like a CQC thing, but since we mentioned passing through doors as a gateway to Raxxla or something else I felt like mentioning it.
Maybe it is well known but I never heard about it myselfView attachment 354371View attachment 354372View attachment 354373View attachment 354374.
Nope, spent many an hour diving into corridors in space installations, looking for the one that is the Omphalos, the key and the door...
But you set my heart racing- I thought at first you'd found a door in a Guardian space beacon!!!
