Yup but not wanting to be pedantic, other than something obviously being there, how does the codex lead us up there, in the first place, in relation to the other elements described in the codex?

I don't know.

I've just discovered there are activable doors on some (all?) orbital installations. Maintenance tunnels that open upon contact with the ship.
The actionnable doors are marked with a glowing red triangle.
It looks like a CQC thing, but since we mentioned passing through doors as a gateway to Raxxla or something else I felt like mentioning it.
Maybe it is well known but I never heard about it myselfView attachment 354371View attachment 354372View attachment 354373View attachment 354374.
The installation Steelhook Hold at Ra had a funny tunnel, too, with some strange shiny thingy in it. At least it was so in 3.8. Have no spare commanders anywhere nearby to make a screenshot - 3 of 4 are more than 20k Ly out and the only one relatively close is on strike because he suffered from severe lags in FSS last weekend. I guess we need more parallel "legacy" timelines to get more spare commanders...
