Yup but not wanting to be pedantic, other than something obviously being there, how does the codex lead us up there, in the first place, in relation to the other elements described in the codex?

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!

ALLEGED TOAST OF THE DARK WHEEL

Jewel that burns - The Great Diamond asterism itself. The components are amongst the brightest stars visible from Earth.

Whisper in Witchspace - Reachable within a few jumps / call to adventure.

Siren of the deepest void - Need to explore but also the Bo√∂tes Void or Great void is in that generalized direction viewed from Earth. Remember, TDW likely started in Sol itself. In addition, the area also features the Virgo cluster of galaxies and is notable for the sharp differences within close proximity as viewed from Earth.

Parent's grief, lover's woe - The Eleusinian Mystery cult (cult of Demeter and Persephone) was based on the sadness of Demeter when her daughter is taken down to the Underworld by Hades. Hecate guides Persephone back to Earth triggering Spring. Lover's woe comes from Persephone and Hades repeated 6 month separation every year. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries

The other thing is the Frameshift Suite itself.
