Nysa - home of the Hyades Nymphs

Nysa is in game and situated close to Achenar. Many of the systems in this area have a similar link to concepts of an underworld or lost / sunken kingdoms.

Within the marriage between Persephone (daughter of the goddess Demeter) and the god of the Underworld, Pluto. Nysa proudly boasted a sanctuary of Pluto and Core (Persephone), as well as a cave thought to provide an entrance directly into the Underworld.
