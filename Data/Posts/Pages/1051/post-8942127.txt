They had hyperspace in 2296.

Only on generation ships to which only the ones that made it to the systems I mentioned reported back until later in the timeline, normal ships only had basically supercruise, also according to lore up until 2296 only the systems mentioned where visited and explored and the rest of the surroundings where unexplored.

The original hyperspace module that was non generation ship was made in 2800 called the faraway drive and was the type 0 hyperspace drive and first of its kind..

Remember apart from the generation ships mentioned most we didnt know what happened to them, heard nothing from them and got no reports back until after 2296 or recent 3000 AD upwards
