My own personal opinion is that the Duval family where the original finders of the Mars relic, The federation took it from them hence their hatred however they had enough time with it to lure them towards where it may have came from, why else would they travel so m

except you are assuming that somebody went to Raxxla at that time - this is not a given.

But it was mentioned in 2296 (and possibly known about beforehand and during this time they didnt even know about the mudlarks, didnt have jump capabilitys, didnt even know what they would find in the systems they travelled to until they landed on Achenar and later so doubt they would have the technology to find Raxxla without having been to or seeing it.
