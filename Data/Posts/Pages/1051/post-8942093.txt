Iv been reading lore sourounding timelines and that Raxxla was first mentioned in 2296 according to lore, also according to the lore only Tau Ceti, Delta Pavonis, Altair, Beta Hydri and 40 odd years later Eotienses and Achenar 6 where travelled to and colonised and by lore the rest of space was unexplored as stated until after achenar was colonised, now many other generation ships where sent out also however we know that these never reported back until a good while later so if Raxxla where to exist (It has to be before 2296) these systems and the systems in close proximity are the only ones that should hold Raxxla. Either that or frontier has not given vital history about a non existing ship which could travel or did travel during these time lines which leaves us dead in the water still lol

Anyone know what the maximum lightyears a ship could travel upto the time of Achenars visit and the destruction of the Mudlarks (The civilization on 6) I plan on jumping in sequence in order of colonisation from sol to each one and see if anything happens.

Even if there were stories about Raxxla in 2296, it does not mean it had been vissited yet.
If something was found that pointed the way, the myth may have started without Raxxla it self.

Achenar was settled only a few years later. By that time, 140 ly was within reach.

The ods for the Sol near systems are definitly higher than for systems further out, but I would not exclude the rest of the bubble.
