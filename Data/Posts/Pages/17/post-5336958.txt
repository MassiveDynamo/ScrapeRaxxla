This is fair enough. Yet I'm sure you can understand why people think a "Children of Raxxla" video would be about Raxxla. Aren't there other player groups that are disciples of Salomé that have less misleading names? I understand the CoR have invested a lot in Drew's stories and the associated in-game narrative and I hope you continue to do so, you deserve lots of credit for pursuing and keeping the storyline alive in the minds of other players.

Oh yes indeed !

Loren's Legion is one of those other groups, yes.

Why our group is named as such actually lies in its origin : CoR was formerly known as The Dark Wheel playergroup, but due to a conflict with the faction already existent in Shinrarta, we were asked to find something else by FDev before they implemented the faction. The founders chose to keep a link, first due to Salomé's relationship with the actual Dark Wheel, and second, due to our nature that is somewhat close to what The Dark Wheel is. CoR just has a broadened goal as to uncover the galaxies mysteries at large, and not just about Raxxla

Also, many thanks for the kind words, much appreciated ! We do try our best to generate content related to Elite mysteries, but ultimately it's driven by the game's content and rate of additions, so we sometime have periods of rest indeed, hahah.
