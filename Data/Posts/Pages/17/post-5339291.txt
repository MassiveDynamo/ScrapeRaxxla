I had an email conversation with Ian Bell, almost a year ago, where he confirmed that Robert Holdstock had something very specific in mind when he wrote about Raxxla in The Dark Wheel. Bell's specific words were: "You may be interested to know that I alone, now Rob has left us, know exactly where and what the Raxxla of TDW is."

Something to do with a certain Steven Eisler book ..?
