I really wish there was an officially sanctionned Elite Lore guide, for this very matter. Slicing between canon/not canon facts is a hard task when we are playing with breadcrumbs, and sometimes nothing, hahah.
Good thinking on the following as well, entirely agreed.

As for re-checking some places after 2.3 release, as of now there is nothing in the beta, but this doesn't means sneaky last additions can't happen on release day. Definitely worth keeping that in the "Things to check for the 100th time" list

Also, re the CIEP, I always have in mind what Dav said during a recent stream about undiscovered human settlements out of the bubble, heheh.
