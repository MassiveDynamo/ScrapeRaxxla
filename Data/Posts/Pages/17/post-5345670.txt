Placing Raxxla in Shinrarta Dezhra would fit with the Elite requirement. However, I haven't seen it there

Could it be so far out in the system that it's invisible to the scanner?, perhaps just like Voyager you have to get close to see it. Considering Hutton Orbital, long (and close to an infinite number) trek's in Shinrarta Dezhra could be ahead. Obvious directions would be to target systems like Lave, Tionisla, etc. to begin with and then just keep going...
