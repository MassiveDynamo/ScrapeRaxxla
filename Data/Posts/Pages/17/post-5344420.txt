Possible Location of Raxxla: Founders World
My reasoning relies on what lore we have and practical application of it.
Raxxla was described more than once as a rouge planetary body capable of autonomous (?) travel. So, I took the speeds of the fastest rouge bodies known (and a theroy that Raxxla isn't FTL capable) with the last 'known' location Lave 2 centuries ago (less than 1000 years) and did the math.
All in all? 44.7ly minimum, 999ly maximum. So, Raxxla (and/or its gateway) is nearby.
Within 1000ly one world with a startlingly close match (secrecy, Elitists, INRA, The Dark Wheel) would be Founders World.
It has been accessible since 2015 (no engineers or boosts). It is 'hidden' by the Pilot's Federation through misinformation that contradicts itself.
Oh, and its wording used to describe it is very much like the way Raxxla is described.

Elsewise it is the philosophical embodiment of the Exploration itself. 'A place that isn't a place. A door but also the key.' A mindset that draws us all into the unknown looking for answers. However, proverbs aren't usually worth killing over...

If they were however, we have a whole new rabbit hole to dive in...
