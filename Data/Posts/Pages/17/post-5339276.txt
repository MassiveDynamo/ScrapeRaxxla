As for Raxxla, we can go quite wild with it, since there's not much more known than it's ingame, somewhere, hahah ! Worth keeping all the tinfoil on the side prepared for the day Frontier decides to, maybe, start to give breadcrumbs or reintroduce the Dark Wheel missions and more.

Speaking of crazy ... if you read the letters in Raxxla as "medieval Roman numerals" you get the following values:

R = 80
A = 5
X = 10
X = 10
L = 50
A = 5

If you treat the word as a chronogram then, nearest I can tell, the value is 30: RAXXLA. It doesn't quite conform to what you'd expect a Roman Numeral to look like.

I had an email conversation with Ian Bell, almost a year ago, where he confirmed that Robert Holdstock had something very specific in mind when he wrote about Raxxla in The Dark Wheel. Bell's specific words were: "You may be interested to know that I alone, now Rob has left us, know exactly where and what the Raxxla of TDW is."
