Oh yes indeed !

Loren's Legion is one of those other groups, yes.

Why our group is named as such actually lies in its origin : CoR was formerly known as The Dark Wheel playergroup, but due to a conflict with the faction already existent in Shinrarta, we were asked to find something else by FDev before they implemented the faction. The founders chose to keep a link, first due to Salom√©'s relationship with the actual Dark Wheel, and second, due to our nature that is somewhat close to what The Dark Wheel is. CoR just has a broadened goal as to uncover the galaxies mysteries at large, and not just about Raxxla

Also, many thanks for the kind words, much appreciated ! We do try our best to generate content related to Elite mysteries, but ultimately it's driven by the game's content and rate of additions, so we sometime have periods of rest indeed, hahah.

To be fair ... The Dark Wheel was about more than just Raxxla as well.

From Holdstock's novella:
The Dark Wheel was a semi-legendary space unit, star-riders who made it their business to seek the truth behind the plethora of myths and romantic stories that filtered back from all corners of the Universe: fabulous cities, parallel worlds, time travellers, even planets that appeared to be the old 'heaven' of Earth legend. The Dark Wheel was as mysterious and as mythical to the traders of the Galaxy as King Arthur might have been to the first spacemen.
