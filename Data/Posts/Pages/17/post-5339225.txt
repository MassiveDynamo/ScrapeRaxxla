Well, about Neptune and Oberon, it may, or may not be, that's something that is worth asking to John Harper. There's several other things from the book that I noticed would be nice hidden things in the game like the other CIEP planetary base (not Soontill) for example.

As for Raxxla, we can go quite wild with it, since there's not much more known than it's ingame, somewhere, hahah ! Worth keeping all the tinfoil on the side prepared for the day Frontier decides to, maybe, start to give breadcrumbs or reintroduce the Dark Wheel missions and more.
