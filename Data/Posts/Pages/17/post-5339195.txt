Yep, this is my favourite of the ED books I've read so far, but I don't really know how much I can depend on the information in it considering the imperial succession storyline that subsequently appeared in game and didn't really seem to mesh. But perhaps that can be explained.

Re Raxxla, do you think Neptune and Oberon are clues? Otherwise I'm not sure what else there is to go on.

My own theory, which is not helpful at all is that Raxxla is hidden by the ED universe equivalent of an SEP* field, meaning it's only possible to see when you're not looking for it, and it'll just pop up in the corner of your eye and when you try and look more closely it'll be gone.
