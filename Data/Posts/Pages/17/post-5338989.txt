While I would normally entirely agree, Holdstock's novella is not considered Cannon anymore, it seems FDev wanted to start full-fresh back again with it :/
I thought that, like all pre-ED-full-release official Elite/FE2/FFE/ED fiction, there are parts which are no longer canon, but we don't always know which parts!
