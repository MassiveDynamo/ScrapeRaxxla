Thargoids all over the place.

Not a big surprice, as Come sector is in the midle of Thargoid space.

Did I miss something obvious and pew-pew happening, again, in another doomed effort by a player group trying to create actual narrative and non-pew-pew things to do? <lookingForMorePopcornToGetThroughAllTheWhingingInAllThoseGnosisThreads/>

Just think what the game would be like if all this failed effort put into player groups was instead put into, oh, I don't know, actual missions with narrative or things to find while exploring.
