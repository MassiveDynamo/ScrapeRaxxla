(Redirected) Who is Gallun?

Original Post From -> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/446114-Who-is-Gallun?highlight=Gallun

Was told to ask in here about the character Gallun from the Elite Book's,
From what I know he is mentioned a few times in the books however I don't see any information on Gallun here on the frontier forums and excessive google searches on who he was in the lore.

I have suspicion that he is someone worth to note in the quest for Raxxla or Soontil. Does anyone here have more information on which books to look at or maybe info on who he/she was?
