Sorry that sounds exactly like an abused woman's excuses for going back to her husband for the nth time.
We keep coming back and back to fdev only to be abused again.
See you at Christmas for Q4 and the kids.

I get your point but I've not actually involved myself in an awful lot of what's happened over the years (with a few exceptions). I am definitely going to be watching Q4 updates very closely though to see if it ends up being worth my while.

I said it in another thread but strangely enough (and not wanting to incite a debate here) I'm getting more enjoyment out of No Man's Sky at the moment, as far as exploration goes.
