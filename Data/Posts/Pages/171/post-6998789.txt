Gallun's inheritance is a station name in Shinrata D- Which you can only get to if you have a permit from ranking as ELITE from the Pilots Federation. I thought at first, Gallun was the Gallun Z Sci Fi writer -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Z._Gallun ?He was a sci-fi writer. His big book was people minus X.

If you goto Ian Bells (former Elite partner with DB) Amazon - The one book he hason his wish list has the ISBN-10: 140200351X. Which would coordinates : 140 200 351 (minus X) or X marks the spot?

I also thought Grothendieck's Folly - was his childlike innocence which could hint at Ganymede (who was taken by zeus in the form of a large bird (like the Frontier symbol) So the question would be - What did Gallun inherit in the books?

Sorry for the diff sized fonts. Copying from notes.

Maybe if you goto the Waypoint in Sirius and point your ship at those coordinates.


Some good tinfoil there. However, Ian Bell's wish list changes over time - so it's unlikely that FD will tie coordinate to a single item on another person's site (even though he co-authored the game). I might be wrong though.
