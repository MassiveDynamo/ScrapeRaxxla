Echoing the general sentiment of 'Explorers got short-changed (again)'.

Almost nobody expected unique content in Cone Sector- it was simply an opportunity to explore somewhere you couldn't otherwise get to. It was poor form of FDev to turn it into a combat experience instead.

At least they gave a one week notice in Galnet.
Thargoids all over the place.

Not a big surprice, as Come sector is in the midle of Thargoid space.
