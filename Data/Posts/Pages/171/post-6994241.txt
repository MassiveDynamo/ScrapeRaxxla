Well, I myself left my CondaX in SD and my AspX in Exphiay, no too far from the Gnosis, and armed a badass Guardian engineered Krait 34+ Ly of jump range for the expedition (what a grind!). Of course I expected problems when arriving in the Cone. In the Cone. The thing is, we actually (12 Ly) didn't even jump ! What I mean is I played an "armed Explorer"... And it was boring. Hydras just vaporized me and Marauders are really weak. Anyway, you can't be at the same time an efficient explorer and a well geared pewpewer. So MB could well have said this of going armed for exploring, but what for ? My tinfoil CondaX, even armed to the teeth, would last one minute at most in front of any alien combat ship. Now, someone could say " Keep using your badass Krait ! 34 Ly jump range is not so bad. It's what my AspX used to jump pre-Engineers". Well, yes, but times are a changin' !
Now coming back to the Bubble and my trusty AspX !
I was hoping for...something in the Cone. Something new at which I could have taken a short glance (an AW with city lights ?), just before being destroyed along the Gnosis and all the Cmdrs by an entire fleet of Thargs. The very one Salom√© and Luko detected time ago. The Collective Suicide Cone Expedition as I used to call it.

Going to put for sale on ebay four near mint Guardian Gauss, a chics-grabber Javelin and a fly-killer Flak Cannon...
