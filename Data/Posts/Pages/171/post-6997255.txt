Did I miss something obvious and pew-pew happening, again, in another doomed effort by a player group trying to create actual narrative and non-pew-pew things to do? <lookingForMorePopcornToGetThroughAllTheWhingingInAllThoseGnosisThreads/>

Canonn 1 - CoR 1

Just think what the game would be like if all this failed effort put into player groups was instead put into, oh, I don't know, actual missions with narrative or things to find while exploring.

Ah, but that would mean FD had to do some creative thinking and put effort into narrative; unfortunately I think they either never got there, or lost it a while ago. It really is a shame as ED is just so beautiful, but it is empty.

edit: perhaps they ruminated on what happened when DW did put narrative in, and the salt farming that arose, and just decided to keep their heads below the (Guardian) parapets.
