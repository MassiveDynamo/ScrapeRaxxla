The Cone Sector has never been about anything. Before the permit locking of COL 70 and the other sectors, several explorers visited. I wouldn't expect many first discoveries in the Cone nebulae at least.
There is nothing in there and it has never been anything there. The sector was simply forgotten, when FD closed the region for future content.

It's will probably be a part of a much larger Thargoid dominated area, once we are allowed in.

Only the Canonn's curiosity put it on the map. I doubt FD have ever had any special plans for it.
