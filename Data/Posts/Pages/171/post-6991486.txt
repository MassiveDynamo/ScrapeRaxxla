Mmm, not sure that’s entirely fair. Seem to remember a sense of danger when out FRifting (MB- “explorers should go armed”), and exploration is historically a hazardous occupation (used to be mosquitoes, crocodiles, lions, frostbite; now it’s aliens, close binaries, neutron stars...). But the Gnosis’ intended jump into an area surrounded by goid space was always a bit near the edge, and I got the feeling was being set up to fail in some FD goid storyline-related way.

I agree with your assessment that about having a feeling the Gnosis jump way going to fall prey to some Thargoid-related shenanigans which is why I called it "predictable". I also stand by my assertion that it reflects Frontier's regards for the exploration community. Generally us explorers have never quite been playing the game according to Frontier's 'rules" which is why Michael Brookes made that statement about upcoming content that would make it unwise for explorers to go out into the black unarmed. I don't think that Frontier understands that some people just want to go out and explore ... they want everyone to join in the pew-pew fest even if it means dragging players into it who have zero appetite for such things.
