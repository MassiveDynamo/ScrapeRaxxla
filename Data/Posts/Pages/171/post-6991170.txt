Pathetic? I'd say "predictable". Shows exactly what Frontier's regard toward the "exploration community" is though. Somebody wants to peacefully explore the galaxy in Elite? Quick! Toss some pew-pew at them!

Mmm, not sure that’s entirely fair. Seem to remember a sense of danger when out FRifting (MB- “explorers should go armed”), and exploration is historically a hazardous occupation (used to be mosquitoes, crocodiles, lions, frostbite; now it’s aliens, close binaries, neutron stars...). But the Gnosis’ intended jump into an area surrounded by goid space was always a bit near the edge, and I got the feeling was being set up to fail in some FD goid storyline-related way.
