A thought ... though it might have been brought up before.

I've been trying to find any links to the old "Place that isn't a place" and "Door that is also the key" statements from the old missions. I found an interesting correlation between place that isn't a place and the philosophy of Heraclitus of Ephesus. His most famous saying was probably, "no man ever steps into the same river twice" as he concluded that the constant flow of a river meant that the river could never quite remain the same place that it was since it was in a constant state of change. At least that is how I'm understanding him.

Eridanus is the river constellation. A place that isn't a place? Now if I could find a link between Eridanus and a door or a key (I've found a few "new-agey" references to Eridanus as a door/gateway to heaven or even as a "Stargate" but I haven't found any actual references from ancient myth that would indicate that the ancients viewed it as such.
