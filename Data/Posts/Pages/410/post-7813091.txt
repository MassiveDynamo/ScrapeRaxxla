Samhain rituals? so we've jumped from Ancient Greeks to Celts

We've already been to the Celts last year. My idea was to have a closer look at Avalon System (great Greek/Celt mix btw. there is a station called Persephone) where either I proved to be incompetent in finding things or did not find a thing because there's nothing to be found.
