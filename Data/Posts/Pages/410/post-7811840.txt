The other question is if the Shin Dez bunch are impostors or not. I read the Flis Farserr's comment in the DW codex to mean ' hey we scrapped those missions and explain it as "they were a fake" ' and that the faction in Shin Dez is just a shell now. Others read it the other way around that since they still exist as a faction that they must be real. I guess my view is based on FDEV needing to explain why the juicy missions just ran dry...

It seems reasonable to assume that they (the real DW) might be providers of extra clues in their 'evidence they are the real deal', and this means the 'find Raxxla' game arc has a longer life as you need to solve both puzzles in series.

The Codex also hints rather heavily that they will approach you, so I expect Jorki is right that the 'I just dropped by to see your archive' response will be:

Yes, it can be interpreted either way. Since they are still in business in SD then I think that means they are part of the real DW, but as some spiky-haired female said in Elite Premonition they are on “the outer rim” & therefore part of the obfuscation/misdirection. Since that was an fd-sponsored book I think they were telling us a little about TDW; we should perhaps check that assumption with Drew.

It may be that FD removed the missions for some other reason, perhaps they thought it was too much obfuscation. Though I still have a feeling that one of the devs said at some stage they were still in game, possibly implying they were moved, perhaps to the DW dark station.

No doubt we‘ll see in due course!
