Yes, it can be interpreted either way. Since they are still in business in SD then I think that means they are part of the real DW, but as some spiky-haired female said in Elite Premonition they are on “the outer rim” & therefore part of the obfuscation/misdirection. Since that was an fd-sponsored book I think they were telling us a little about TDW; we should perhaps check that assumption with Drew.

It may be that FD removed the missions for some other reason, perhaps they thought it was too much obfuscation. Though I still have a feeling that one of the devs said at some stage they were still in game, possibly implying they were moved, perhaps to the DW dark station.

No doubt we‘ll see in due course!

Is that "outer rim" business a direct quote? I haven't read any of the books aside from "And Here the Wheel", to be honest. If it is, that whole talk of "obfuscation" and "outer rims" brings to mind the second post in this very thread... "Obfuscated in the Outer Rim", indeed.
