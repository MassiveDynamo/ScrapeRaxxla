Is that "outer rim" business a direct quote? I haven't read any of the books aside from "And Here the Wheel", to be honest. If it is, that whole talk of "obfuscation" and "outer rims" brings to mind the second post in this very thread... "Obfuscated in the Outer Rim", indeed.

The other books are worth reading. Yes, the repetition of the “outermost rim” phrase is, to me, suggestive that this was an FD-approved hint. They would have proof read it so must have implicitly agreed with this statement; whether they actually suggested using it would be worth knowing, but only Drew could tell us that.
