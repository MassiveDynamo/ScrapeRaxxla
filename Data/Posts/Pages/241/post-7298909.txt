I'm moderately surprised no "dark wheel" has been found too. I don't think it's in the Coal Sack nebula, it seems Felicity Farseer connection was noticed and lots of probing has been going on in the close nebulae. Maybe some other place far away, like Heart nebula, then. Codex entry seems to suggest such thing could be found, eventually.

I think bubble/frontier exploring is worth it, as well as tip off missions. For those with eyes to see here means finding some value in crashed ships, Thargoid sensors, things that are of some obscurity, rarely mentioned and often without canonn website entries. I even discovered a secret plot to mix onionhead into energy drinks, scanning some settlement data beacons. Stuff like this could have been out there for over a year now, and often has been discovered by somebody already.

Polaris, polar star, Stella Polaris mean very similar things as omphalos, or the navel. Stella Maris. Neuer more valiant.
