Commanders,

The Nomads of Oisir have been working diligently on deciphering The riddle. It has not been easy and the path has not always been clear or sure. We will not reveal all we have uncovered yet, but we will reveal an important discovery we have made in regards to The Club.

As it has unfolded thus far, triggers and the implications suggested seem to be pointing to what may very well be one of their jewels, the namesake of The Club itself. It has also re-confirmed, in our minds, its ties to The Federation and to the Sirius Corporation.

In one of the many steps in the riddle, you will be guided to the Orion Constellation, the mythological master of the dog, Sirius - specifically to Orion's Club. This is revealed in the opening line of sonnet #19:

"On Cupid's bow how are my heartstrings bent," - when pulling the string of a bow, the bend is in your hand.

To find The Club and the Federation controlling the system, along with their Earth Defense Fleet, go to Chi Orionis, the tip of Orion's Club.

In time, we may publish future developments, as we deem just.
