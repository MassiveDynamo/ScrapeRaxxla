I looked around the Orion Nebula and Orian Dark Region. A lot of unmapped planets that had biological things on them. Not connected but that does tell me very few people actually really look for things. Going to check something out. Then off to Heart and Soul Nebula I suppose. Anything I should be on the lookout for over there?
