I'm assuming it would have been reachable with much earlier and shorter-ranged hyperdrive systems than a modern engineered FSD) to try and find The Dark Wheel station.

I see this idea a lot, but I honestly speculate that with how long they've been undiscovered, The Dark Wheel may have utilized Raxxla's fabled power to move their station indefinitely. Perhaps they learned how the technology worked, or moved the tech on-board. The most likely explanation is that they've remained hidden for so many years because we're chasing shadows.
