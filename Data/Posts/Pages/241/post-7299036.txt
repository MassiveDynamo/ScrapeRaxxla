Polaris, polar star, Stella Polaris mean very similar things as omphalos, or the navel. Stella Maris. Neuer more valiant.

Polaris is the nave of the sky wheel. At least the northern one.

It also actually had an alien(Thargoid) portal, in FFE.
It would surprise me If it’s not somehow part of the quest.

I don’t think it’s the starting point though.
