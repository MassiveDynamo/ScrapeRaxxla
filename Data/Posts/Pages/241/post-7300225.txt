uhm.. i believe im onto the vicinity NOT precise location but narrowed down close enough for a thorough search - non of which is guess work but the results of overlaying certain known materials and ending up with an 'X marks the spot' - fine on a 2D map but a fairly large area on a 3D map. I head out tonight - will be a long voyage, maybe even 'a 5 year mission.....'

Anyhow - i firmly believe i have it nailed. updates to follow.
