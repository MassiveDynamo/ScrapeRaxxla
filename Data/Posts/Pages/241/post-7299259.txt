And on a lighter note..
I don't know why i keep coming back to this. After fiddling with the Canonn decryptor tool i got some chinese characters. I tried to translate them and i got this:

Ƒ coconut揷 淧 䡙 Jian 䛍揷 諽謆 䓕 and 쵷 accused accused 䣇 and Ƒ mortgage Jian Ƒ 揷coconut 䣇mortgage Jian 揷 mortgage 䣇 蜟 coconut 뉇 ѧ 揷 뉇 蜟 淧 䓕

I think it's a Pina Colada recipe.

I'll show myself out.

It was my understanding that this riddle was made up by Stoyben on the Canonn Discord, but I'm not 100% sure on that. Not really sure about any of this, to be completely honest...

I don't know for certain it was made up, but the image it was on was definitely not from in game, so if could have been from anywhere, and I suspect a piña colada recipe is more likely to be it's answer then anything Raxxla related.
