What was the system like in FFE? Any gas giants with 8+ moons?

I'm not sure what would surprise me about the quest to find The Dark Wheel or Raxxla, except finding that permits are _not_ required. Even if they are not themselves found in locked-off locations, clues to give you a chance of finding them might be. I think I have all the known obtainable permits (CQC system excepted and that was changed in 1.4, as it used to just be an empty system with only one star) but there may be unusual ways of getting some others that have not been found. I've read (on the permit-lock list thread on these forums iirc) that a very small number of people got the Mingfu permit but were not sure how they did it. Maybe I should do a quick tour of those I have and see if the FSS picks up anything noteworthy.

It had two ammonia worlds. That's all I remember, without checking in game.
