When someone goes to their ingame nav panel, there is a list of “nearby” stars to select as an FSD jump destination. Someone could write a plugin to scrape that list and show only the stars not in EDSM or previously visited. But that’s probably against the ToS.
Systems are printed in log IF you make a route through it. Some programs work in such way, for example you select system on map, then program pops u message if it is known for EDSM.
