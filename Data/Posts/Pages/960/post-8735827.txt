There was a useful planetary navigation tool (cant remember its name, it’ll be on the abandoned tools area) that had to be abandoned because (I believe) it broke the EULA as it grabbed the coordinates off the SRV screen.

Was thinking if the neighbouring system names were generated by SF at Cambridge and downloaded (& could be intercepted by a player’s assistant tool) during the transition/loading screen that might not breach the EULA?

@Feria: Ah yes, found the reference (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threa...ries-thread-10-the-canonn.355713/post-5644701). Cmdr Khelder was prototyping an idea for a surface navigation tool (before journal files gave the coordinates) that got the SRV/ship position by memory scraping, but that was banned by FD. Guess OCR could be used to read the nearby systems off the nav panel if you opened it & scrolled down. Those could then be compared against a local copy of the EDSM database to give an idea of what systems in the vicinity hadn't been explored by anybody. Sounds a bit messy though. Guessing those local systems aren’t reported in the journal file. EDScout (& guessing also Alexzk’s mention of a plugin to EDMC?) seems to check a planned route against EDSM-explored systems, but not found any mention of a tool that picks up the nav panel nearby systems.

Edit: someone else had the same idea! https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/edscout-and-undiscovered-systems.555386/
