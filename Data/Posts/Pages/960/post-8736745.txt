Repost. I think its star map with systems location is somebody is good at triangulation ???

It's probably wishful thinking on my part, but if the largest circle is a 'Sun' then that system has 8 bodies... Damn, I wonder if the Dark Wheel used this target system as their base hide-out so they wouldn't lose it? A permanent map for potential candidates!

Unlike Raaxla that they've conveniently lost?!
