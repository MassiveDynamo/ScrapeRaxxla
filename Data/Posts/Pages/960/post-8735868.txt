EDSM tells you that theres systems that need scanning or correlating....can it not tell you the nearest undiscovered system too, or does it know about it yet?
This is "red" plugin you speak about. When you jump into system log files generates "entered system" (absent if u jump onboard on carrier), then it's picked by plugin and it queries EDSM for nearest known systems with errors.
In case of "plot route on map" plugin, there is another event in log "destination set", so plugin picks it and queries EDSM if it is known or not.
