Don’t understand how your ED M+plugin can tell you where systems are that have not been visited by anyone. Surely to do that it would have to do a comparison of the EDSM database against an FD in-game “ground truth” database (which doesn’t exist)? OR access Stellar Forge directly to ascertain if anyone had visited? The in-game Galmap “visited systems” filter only tells me what I haven’t visited, so I assume that database is held locally.
I think main idea behind Stellar Forge is, there is no data base. Systems are generated by your computer on demand. Algorithm is same everywhere, so each computer generates exact same system. It is possible FDevs can have "patched db" which just overrides SOME systems, for example renamed.

"0.014268% of the galaxy has been discovered on EDSM," - this is already 100Gb. 1% will be 10Tb. That is not what FDevs can pay for. This is also a reason why Galaxy is so empty, they patch just small amount by adding stations etc.
