What about being able to pull in the total number of stars such as wolf rayet stars in the stellar forge? So you're not asking for the contents of a system rather the star type.
1. You need algo of SF. I.e. computer program which works exact as SF.
2. I don't think it will be possible in short times. To count anything SF will have to create each star and count it. Guess this loop of creation will take couple weeks.
