Pure guess taken from the time it takes some systems to load, especially in the black, especially if undiscovered but not essential, the time taken can compare to the resolution of bio & geo signals - and we know thats SF generation - Id guess not. Pure anecdotal. Logic suggests no as a lot of useless data a lot of the time. But no real idea.

Can we check if it is against TOS coz we all want one now Surely theres a way to pull it of EDSM or does that only 'know about' stars that have been logged there?

There was a useful planetary navigation tool (cant remember its name, it’ll be on the abandoned tools area) that had to be abandoned because (I believe) it broke the EULA as it grabbed the coordinates off the SRV screen.

Was thinking if the neighbouring system names were generated by SF at Cambridge and downloaded (& could be intercepted by a player’s assistant tool) during the transition/loading screen that might not breach the EULA?
