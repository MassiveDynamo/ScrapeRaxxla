I donâ€™t think the modes matter for squadrons do they? At least in terms of joining and comms, anyway.

Yes. It would. A squadron could be working toward a common goal while individual members of that said squadron might prefer different modes. They'd still want to be able to coordinate.

Currently there are inter-modal comms in game via your friends list and the chat window in the main game. I can't see why squadrons would be any different. Instancing filters shouldn't affect comms, I wouldn't think.
