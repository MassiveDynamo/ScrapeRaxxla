I think we should be heading towards the core.

I ED we know of three events involving hyperspace failure. Antares, Spaceship 1 and Jacques station.

Antares was going from Sirius to an unknown system. The wreckage was found in Luyten 205-128. Almost straight towards the core of the galaxy.
Starship 1 was going from Furuhjelm I-645 to Azaleach, when it blew up. Towards the core.
Jacques was going from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point. Also directly towards the galaxy core.

Hints from the codex:
SPOILER
