Hi I`m new to the Forum, but want to participate in the Quest for Raxxla.

I must admit to not having read all of the 279 pages of this threat, so if the little theory I'm now going to post has already come up an been proven wrong, feel free to tell.

I have been considering whether the quest text might contain a clue and have been pondering what "the place that is no place" might be.

My theory is as follows: In ancient faith (especially in places dominated by celitc cultures) there was a strong belief in a world of men and a world of the supernatural with a place in between those world i.e. the "place that is no place". So considering where such a place might be in our beloved Elite Universe I had the idea that Avalon might be exactly such a place because there you are neither in the world of the living nor in the world of the dead.

There actually is a system called Avalon 146 ly out from Sol (I guess one might be able to reach it with a Cobra MKIII). The System hats several stations but I find the Orbitals Noctilux and Persephone most interesting as Noctilux roughly translates as Light in the Night and Persephone is named after the sorry wench that the ancient Greeks believed had to live in Hades for Wintertime and on Olympus Mons for Summertime - which is like living in between.

I think maybe there could a hint or two be hidden in this system. Any ideas? Comments? - If I find the time I will be heading out there with my clipper Atlantis tonight.
