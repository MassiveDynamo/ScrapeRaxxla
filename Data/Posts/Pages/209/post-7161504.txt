Hey folks, who else is doing Beta testing?

Macros, are you doing anything with Squadrons wrt the Quest to find Raxxla.

And for the Rifters, an FR squadron for the Beta for testing?

There will probably be 20 to 30 Raxxla/Dark Wheel themed Squadrons to choose from once Beyond CH4 goes live. Hopefully they'll eventually consolidate until only a handful remain and are active. I plan on spinning one up myself under my "Persephone Ryder" account.
