I don’t think the modes matter for squadrons do they? At least in terms of joining and comms, anyway.

Well, I was being flippant (a warped sense of humour comes with age, like rheumatism, or perhaps because of it!) but you could be right. You need to get some beta testers together to check it out, afraid I don’t beta. However would it make sense to allow comms between squadron members in different modes?

It is certainly worth checking out!
