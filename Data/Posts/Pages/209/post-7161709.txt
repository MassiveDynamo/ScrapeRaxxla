There will probably be 20 to 30 Raxxla/Dark Wheel themed Squadrons to choose from once Beyond CH4 goes live. Hopefully they'll eventually consolidate until only a handful remain and are active. I plan on spinning one up myself under my "Persephone Ryder" account.

I thought about setting up The FRifters, Rasalas’ Rascals, or perhaps Jorki’s Tykes; but then, since I play most of the time in Solo I thought perhaps there wasn’t much point
