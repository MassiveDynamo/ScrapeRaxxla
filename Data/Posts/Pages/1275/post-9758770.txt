I'm glad someone brought up the subject of the Dark Wheel invite.

What I take away from the Codex entry on DW is that they've had an undetectable spaceport somewhere for ages (the shape of which gave the faction name), and the only way to enter it , it's by invitation only, after a test.

Raxxla is as old as Dark Wheel. And it is (in my opinion) not a place; this is the recruitment test, the outcome of which leads to the invitation aboard DW's spaceport.

If Raxxla is a test, then DW's toast could point to things to bring to them, as a token of understanding of the test.

It seems to me quite possible that these things refer to all possible activities in the game. For example, "the jewel (opal) on the forehead of the mother of all galaxies (void)" = Void Opal, obtainable only by mining. (text are translated from French)

"The Siren of Nothingness" = a Thargoid heart, obtainable only in combat.

"The grief (memorial) of a parent (family), the sadness (tears, water) of a lover" = Water of Shintara at Jameson Memorial, Obtainable in trade, for Elites only.

"The desire of our wandering hearts" = trinkets of hidden fortune? Ancient key? Something historically related to DW? SAP 8 thing?

All these items have to be delivered somewhere. It could be Shinrarta Dezhra (it would confirm that DW there would be authentic), Delphi's thargoid site (Omphalos Rift), Soontil (another possibly "hidden" Omphalos Rift)..

I hope it is not necessary to be Elite in combat, because it is really very long to go up. And I'm not yet.

Given that the quest is aimed at experienced players, it seems to me possible that you have to be triple Elite and involved in all the activities of the game.
