I seem to remember that Ram Tah mission was bugged
So many memories…



And yeah, the thing with messages not appearing was one of them. It was a very random bug, sometimes a message would appear and sometimes it wouldn’t. Made it hard to tell whether you’d got the correct combo of objects and a relevant obelisk or not. Lots of people (possibly everyone) experienced it.

It got fixed at some point, plus eventually guides came out telling people what obelisks to go to and what objects to use, so the problem became much less obvious anyway.

Most people doing the missions via guides wouldn’t have been to Colonia or Sag A. I hadn’t been to either at the point we were figuring out how to do the Ram Tah mission and just experienced them being bugged like everyone else was reporting at the time.

Never seen any other reports of anyone experiencing the messages in a ‘don’t work whatsoever’->’do something in game’ -> ‘all messages work’ way.

@Koben , I hope that doesn’t sound like I’m saying you didn’t experience what you say you experienced. It’s just a very unique thing which is different to what was reported generally.

Either way, we know for sure that having visited Sag A or Colonia isn’t something that’s needed to do the Ram Tah missions across the playerbase as a whole.
