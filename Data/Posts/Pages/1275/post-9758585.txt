Here’s what I’ve found so far based upon the title description “on the horizon”.

Note I’ve not done an extensive search, this is just via Google, I’ve not expanded the search to other engines, nor the way back machine.

For future reference; and I’m aware many here are probably aware too, various search engines use different indexes, aggregators and hit-charts. One may turn up results where others won’t, searches will also be based upon how ‘popular’ said elements are…also using “x” as well as “x” and “x”; might bring up more. As well as other tricks.

There are several hours of talking heads here…
