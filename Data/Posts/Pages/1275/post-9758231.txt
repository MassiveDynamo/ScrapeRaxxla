The mirroring reinforces the suspicion that they were placed on purpose. The only thing I can think of are Bearing Rate Graphs. However, they are not mirror symmetrical. Also, you don't see any scale. And always only one contact. Maybe its only in Stations were Bugstuff (Targoid sensors etc.) has been sold?
Bear in mind thats some sound effects processors like ring modulator and resample can produce spectral mirror of this type. Horizontal lines are sustained tones and vertical lines are clicks, both of which are audible in the normal traffic noises.
