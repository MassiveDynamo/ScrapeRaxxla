While recently on Kepler's Crest and Formidine Rift, I received some strange signals there similar to the sound of a child's toy. I received the same signal at Jameson Memorial Station when I returned from my short trip. Unfortunately, I don't have a tool to record these signals. If you give me such a tool, I will fly there again in the hope of recording them.
