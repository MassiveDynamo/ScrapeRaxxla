OK, had a chat with Cmdr Koben about the mysterious interview where DB apparently discussed Raxxla revealing itself & he’s agreed to make the conversation available to see if it jars any memories:

Me:
I’m still involved with the Quest for Raxxla, though it’s gone on a bit of a back burner for me after so many failed hypotheses...I’m trying to track down the DB interview that you reported in
https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-8194682

“Someone asked him about Raxxla and the answer was:
DB: "- It would be more likelly to reveal itself to a group of players."
Interviewer: "- How so?"
DB: "- If you are at the right place and you scan it enough..."
Interviewer: "- Advanced scanner or the basic one?"
DB: "- Basic scanning is enough."
Interviewer: "- But you have to be Elite..."
DB: "- You have to be Elite." “

Did you have any success in finding the video?
Do you remember who the interviewer was?
Any better recollection of the date? Any real world events at the time?
Was it YouTube or Twitter?
Did you find it by chance, or were you subscribed to the interviewer’s channel?
Was it definitely DB & not MB (who was usually the one to give out clues)?

:
About that interview... this I can tell you for sure... that Frontier took it off.
1. I found it on the official Elite Dangerous youtube channel;
2. I was watching developers diaries videos and found this interview about Horizons launch;
3. There were several videos with Braben being interviewed and this one was about features in Horizons and at the very end of the video was this short interview.

My guess is that they have changed the whole mechanics to find Raxxla and the invitation process to the DarkWheel... and most likely you have to complete a number of certain "hidden tasks" in order to trigger a DarkWheel invitation.

For example, (as I have 2 accounts and I could compare this...) I went to the Guardian sites to complete the Ram Tah CR100Mi quest and I only got the messages during obelisk scanning after have visited Colonia and/or Sargitarius A blackhole. Did the same with the second account and I could confirm that... the first time I did the mission I was scanning obelisks and never received a confirmation message after each scan... then after a while and have visited Colonia and SargA then I did it again and it "work as intended" same with my alt account a few months back.

Another thing is whenever I got tripple Elite I received a friendship invitation from a "player"... "Maddogdiver" on my main account, but as I was flying with several friends and taking part on many Discord events, I didn't pay too much attention to that. But then I decided to get tripple Elite on my 2nd account. Guess what, I have NO friends on that account and I got the very same "player" sending me a friend request. Another similar thing happended when I started killing every single thargoids that would hyperdict me... even bug combos... after several of these scenarios completed, I got hyperdicted and killed a basilisk with 2 cyclops... got a invite from "Matewad" (have to double check the player name).

So yeah, there's something more to it... the game seems to expect us to visit the whole galaxy (all regions), master killing thargoids, find and scan alien civilizations... and maybe the DarkWheel would ask us to join them. As they say that they'd reveal their real selves once we prove capable.

Yeah, pay attention to your friend requests...

:
I dont remember any strange friend requests when I got my triple elite, but it was a while ago.

So it sounds like the interview was related to the Horizons release, which shifts the timeframe a bit, Ive been searching from the very beginning. But even if FD removed the video there should still be some player comments about it somewhere in the forums, or on Reddit. And if it’s Horizons-related then that might answer why I seem to remember it, as I started to get involved just before then and did watch all the livestreams etc at the time.

I seem to remember that Ram Tah mission was bugged and not appearing for a while. But you never know with FD!

Would you be happy for me to post your response above across into the Quest for Raxxla thread? It might jar some memories.

P.S.
On the Elite Dangerous YT site there’s a video “On the Horizon episode 4” dated 4Nov2015. Can’t find any instance of episodes 1, 2 or 3!!!

:
That is indeed interesting!! (Regarding the missing "on the horizon" episodes)

About the friend request, keep an eye out... the last one I received was even stranger once I received it and de-received maybe because I ran off a couple thargoids, then re-received it again after killing a medusa and went to do some challenges for AXI and as I ran off again several times, I no longer have this guy is in my friends list. Really weird... all happened withing a week time.

Concerning posting it on the forums, yeah, why not... don't think it will cause any harm.

SO-any memories stirred???

Oh great, Ive never been Elite because of the ridiculous requirements. I've also never studied signal technology nor cryptography. I'm rather simple gamer. It'd be nice if the games we play actually offer gameplay to everyone - and not just little subsets of players. Doesn't segregate ED already enough? You already have to ascend beyond peasant by grinding out the engineers to take part in the bulk of game loops - especially combat.
