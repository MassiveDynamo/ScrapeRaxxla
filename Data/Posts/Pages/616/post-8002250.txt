The course remembers me of Dante's Commedia. Except the 3rd part "Himmelssph√§ren" - Sorry what's that in English? - Just saying, no further ideas.
"The space inbetween" is described as: John Milton meets H P Lovecraft in an epic tale of cosmological horror. So ya i assume its "Paradise Lost" ( also has a description of hell) with the battle between the Angles and the Deamons (in this case the Old Ones) and shows the layers of Hell with Satan/ Nameless Horror trying to escape.
Parts of Lovecrafts book "Through the gates of the silver key" remind me of this too. Mans own inquisitiveness and science being the key to opening the gates and release the old ones. Is mans science also good enough to close the gate again? Would be a fun read.
