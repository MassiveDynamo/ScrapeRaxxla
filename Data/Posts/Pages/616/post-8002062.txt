Presbyterians ? You were fooled, Pa ! But I think there is no place here to restart the Wars of Religion. Let's just wait for the Bre.. to be completed, before that.
On the actual photo of MB's back there is no sword.. yet. In the model drawn pic, there is. Flamigera sword has flames for blade. "When we pray the St. Michael prayer, we are like the angel in Book of Genesis with, “a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way (3:24)."

Hey, I’m a Yorkshireman- we’re still fighting the War of the Roses! (No, not the tin of chocolates brought at at Xmas, that’s a separate recurrent conflict that breaks out every 25th December!)

I went back to your original post (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-7990649) but still can’t see any flemigra. Which tattoo image are you talking about?

Edit: googled “a cherub (or the archangel Uriel in some traditions) with a flaming sword was placed by God at the gates of Paradise after Adam and Eve were banished from it (Genesis 3:24).” Uriel, not Michael!
