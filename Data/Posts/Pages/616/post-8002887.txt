Shining Trapezohedron? I can't remember exactly what it did, but lovecraft did have a lot of novel ideas about space and aliens and hedgehogs (except not the last one).
Could Lovecraft be a part of the clue? or am I taking the above post too seriously?
Too seriously .. Just for fun. And you wouldnt want to know what i had to do to get a copy of the neconomicon.... Shining trapezohedron was from "Haunter of the Dark"
