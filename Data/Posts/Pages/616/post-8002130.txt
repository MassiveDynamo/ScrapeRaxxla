Yeah, pretty unclear. Anyway, following different traditions, writings, paintings and statues, both Michael and Uriel are depicted wielding some flaming sword of sorts, and guarding the gates of Paradise, Eden or whatever. Only MB could tell which one he wanted to represent on his tattoo. Or..any theologian here ?
No Uriel in EDSM... In ED ?
