I mixed up though. Michael is Aldebaran, Raphael is Regulus, Ureiel is Antares and Gabriel is Fomalhaut.

That's all of them.
The four fixed astrological stars in Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius, respectively.
The bull, lion, eagle and a man that show up in mythologies from all over the world.
Including in the bible, the tetramorphs guarding Sumerian city gates and the sphinx.
