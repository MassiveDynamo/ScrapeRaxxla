In the actual tattoo pic, look closer, it has no sword because it isn't drawn yet, I think. Like the unfinished wing. In the original paper pic, the flamigera sword appears clearly. Seems that MB couldn't resist any longer to show off his new tattoo, even when not fully completed. Time to have those old goggles checked, Pa ?
