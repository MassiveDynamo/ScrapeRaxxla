Presbyterians ? You were fooled, Pa ! But I think there is no place here to restart the Wars of Religion. Let's just wait for the Bre.. to be completed, before that.
On the actual photo of MB's back there is no sword.. yet. In the model drawn pic, there is. Flamigera sword has flames for blade. "When we pray the St. Michael prayer, we are like the angel in Book of Genesis with, â€œa flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way (3:24)."
