I haven't had much time for ED lately but I've finished looking in the immediate vicinity of the Cat's Paw nebula for systems with two M stars (only) and an Earth-like World, without finding one (my guess of what the Winking Cat might be guiding people to). The number of systems with only two M stars is not either too many to make searching the immediate vicinity of the nebula too time-consuming (though if you start looking too far away that happens) and they are not so rare either that there is a trivial number to search. I think I must have searched 20+ MM systems, keeping within about 60LY of the nebula. I might have missed one or two. A couple had biological sources planetside that turned out to be bark mounds. I didn't find any notable stellar phenomena nearby (though I did run into a system with two near the Bug Nebula, appropriately, on the way out).
I've returned to the vicinity of the Bubble. Apparently, untagged systems can be found just a couple of hundred LY out from Sol. I'll look for the same thing here, picking an odd angle to head in (the Coma Berenices constellation seems a good starting point).
