In the actual tattoo pic, look closer, it has no sword because it isn't drawn yet. Like the unfinished wing. In the original paper pic, the flamigera sword appears clearly. Seems that MB couldn't resist any longer to show off his new tattoo, even not fully completed. Time to have those old goggles checked, Pa ?
Those "female angels" you say you dated, don't look very "Catholic" to me...

Mmhh.. Herr Professor-Doktor makes bad mistakes, sometimes. He brought me here when The Rift thread closed !

Catholic? No, I suspected the harpies were presbyterians

Getting confused which pic we’re talking about. Where were those links?
Edit: this is where/what he announced as the tattoo he was going to get (angel betewwen tree & gates has no sword) https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/ua-mystery-thread-4-the-canonn.195658/post-3111550

The Cultofme blogspot (http://thecultofme.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-space-inbetween-preview.html) - “The Space Inbetween” preview- is where he said the image was drawn by an artist and “previews the story of a book I have planned called 'The Space Inbetween'...The detail in the image is incredible and captures the flow of the story”. That image also shows no sword. Did he change it for the tattoo? What’s the reference? Got to have consistency for meaningful discussion!!
