I'm like 95% sure raxxla is located in an asteroid field. There's too many technical and common sense reasons for it to be hidden there than as a naked stellar object in a system.

So people who are only interested in interesting planets or stars will miss raxxla. Only masochists will take the time to explore roid belts enough to find it. It's almost surely not very far from the bubble. It wouldn't have to be and it would make the most sense lore-wise if it is very close relatively.

edit: I wish fdev hid fun things to find out in the black but there's only been two instances of fdev attempting that and both were bungled and part of a main narrative that either spoon fed the path or bungled the secret entirely). The black is empty...devoid of anything interesting and trying to find meaning to the inclusion of hundreds of thousands of systems with nothing in them will drive you insane. It's all there.. it's pointless to visit them, there's no chance of you stumbling onto something nobody else has found way out in the boonies.

I agree that it is very likely you have it correct, but that won't stop me from poking my nose around while I am traveling. Worst case I find nothing except a few extra credits in exploration data. Best case I do find something interesting given to me by RNG.

Edit: I should point out that when I say something interesting by RNG, I'm not referring to Raxxla or anything close. I am under no delusions that RNG will give me anything other than the occasional anomalous signal. Still, any reasons to poke around are fun to explore.

I also like your point about asteroid fields. When I get back to the bubble I am just the right kind of masochist to spends days floating around asteroid belts looking for something that stands out.
