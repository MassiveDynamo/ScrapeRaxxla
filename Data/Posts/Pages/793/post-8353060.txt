While I don't really do my part enough in the hunt for Raxxla, I do visit most 8th moons around gas giants in search of The Dark Wheel.

I suspect the Dark Wheel station won’t be instanced until you’ve been invited to visit. And there is a level of unreliability in Lyta Crane’s arcane sayings, as indicated in the Codex!

But it’s always worth checking!
