If I understand you correctly, you're talking about the Thargoid installation showing the star map?

If so, I think a multitude of objects have been attempted to be placed in the installation without positive results. Guardian artefacts trigger a (very?) negative effect by the installation. Having said that, I can try to have look at the toast and see if I can map any rares to the toast. There's ~140 rares so this may take some time

Btw, good idea.
This just gave me the idea to give the tharg machine various onionheads to see how that reacts
