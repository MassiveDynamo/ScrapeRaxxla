I'm like 95% sure raxxla is located in an asteroid field. There's too many technical and common sense reasons for it to be hidden there than as a naked stellar object in a system.

I think if FDev has had Raxxla in the game as long as they've claimed, and it's near the bubble, this theory makes a lot of sense. I've had it in the 'Things to Try' section of the Thread Summary Document for a while now.

There's 0 incentive for any commander to investigate one. They don't offer discoverer credit for scanning. They are basically lame versions of a ring, but with like 3 mineable rocks total. Any commander would investigate one or two and then never bother with them again. If they put it in a non-KGBFOAM star system, then that eliminates nearly all normal traffic.

The discovery scanner finds stations that are in Rings, but would it find a Raxxla disguised as an asteroid belt?

I investigated all the asteroid belts of these systems, but didn't find anything:
Persephone
Hecate
Sol (no asteroids?)
Shinrarta Dezhra
Atlantis
Delphi
Merope
Atlas
Pleione
Taygeta
Celaeno
Electra - no asteroids
Asterope, Sterope II, Alcyone - No planets
