There are 32 dictatorships in each galaxy, in Elite. None of the dictators are named. Why should you need a name for the one in Lave?
The tourist beacon says Lave was a dictatorship before 3174.

In 3170, before Walden came to power, Galcop was down to 11 member systems. In Elite there are 2048.
That's your problem, not mine. First game appears to happen after the collapse of the trade organization Galactic Cooperative when Walden came to power. As such, it isn't exactly relevant who was in power there. Fortunately, both GCS Saravasti and Azimuth Biotech's records seem consistent that Thargoids leave in 3151 so at least we don't have a debate on facts. It does, however, leave a few unanswered questions about the non-human ships observed after August 19, 3174. I am perfectly fine with the state of affairs as-is because at least explains other rumors at the time such as Oresrians.

On it's face: this seems to suggest Raxxla does exist and Jason Ryder may well have been killed to keep it a secret.
