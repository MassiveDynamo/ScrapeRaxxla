hmmm Saturns rings arnt complete in Elite either....is this a homage, easter egg or clue??

Many of us have spent countless hours investigating Saturn and all its moons specifically because it is so strange in Elite, and it could relate to quite a lot of the Raxxla hunt in various ways. My own investigations were into the moons.

The short answer is no-one has ever found anything yet. But don't let that stop you from looking, you never know
