Well, if memory is correct one of the unregistered comms that ultimately lead to first "Thargoid" crash orbits The Moon. I believe the other was near Jupiter. I put it as "Thargoid" because it is the human name for that species based on a holo-vid from Lave. THARG was the means by which the "Lavian Phoenix Greeting Protocol" was decoded from the beginning of "Lave: Revolution". That said, it doubtful that "Thargoids" are actually called "Thargoids" by themselves. Especially once you add in the annoying detail that Lave was a dictatorship in the first game which should put it well after the departure of said "Thargoids" in 3151 (we are talking 3174 to December 31st, 3199). Just saying, but maybe Robert Holdstock's mention of Oresrians that happen to look like "Thargoids" is an often overlooked important detail.

It literally says in the History of Lave beacon text that Lave has been a dictatorship from before the fall of the Galactic Cooperative.

GalCop fell in 3174. Walden became the new dictator in 3174. All this is well after the first thargoid war 3125-3151. The first game is set during the first thargoid war.
