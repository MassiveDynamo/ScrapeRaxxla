If there is a journey, it has to be connected to game mechanics. Becoming Elite and obtaining permits are probably the personal steps that MB once mentioned.
I think it's very unlikely that the game has a series of invisible check-points that has to be visited in the right order, to open something.
"Personal journey" could also a a discovery that leads you back to the real path. A reminder that even in the first game you start in a backwater system named Lave that should have had absolutely nothing of importance to offer the Universe until it did...
