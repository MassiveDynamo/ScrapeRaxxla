I don’t recall entirely, but as part of another Cmdrs investigation into Sol, I did get into a Support questioning, it went up to a Dev in the end. The purpose was to try and establish how Sol was put together in relation to the hexagon of Saturn, and I gave various examples where Sol was very detailed, but absent in others.

The general consensus was (from memory) that Sol was not intended to be scientifically accurate due to time limitations.

Based on this assessment I don’t believe we should look too deeply into how ED looks, what is / isn’t in game.

It’s very evident there is a great deal in game we can’t see, because either it’s broken or unfinished since launch.
