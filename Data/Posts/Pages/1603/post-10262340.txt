Scratch the above post.

We might be able to say post-3100 since Saud Kruger buys Astrogator in 3270. It is therefore possible Astrogator's Astrogation Console got installed everywhere but then the company collapsed following Highliner Antares. So, actually First Thargoid War is a possibility but there is still a great deal of cover-up involving hyperspace technologies and who made them. I still maintain there wouldn't be cruise ships from Saud Kruger or Narwhal Liners until Starship One without a lot of cover up of hyperspace technologies.

As much as I would love to make it unambiguous for the movement, I cannot do it cleanly enough to get back to full clarity (in other words, it is unclear if the other dictators is propaganda or the truth). This means it is impossible to tell which species without further revelation in the story.
