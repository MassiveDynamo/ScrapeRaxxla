Edit: Additional thought, if they did discover Tharg stuff in a nebula early on they may have then searched other nebula for more stuff to nick?


I wonder when they first started finding the Thargoid tech... I guess the sensor, probe and link could have been like us.... Found those first and then the Thargoids came back and they started processing tissue samples..... Like us... I wonder if they now ask for the newer variants or other samples?
