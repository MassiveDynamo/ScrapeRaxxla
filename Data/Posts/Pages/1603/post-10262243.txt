No, don't think Luna is Raxxla, but from the Toast Luna might be the first step on the Journey....
If there is a journey, it has to be connected to game mechanics. Becoming Elite and obtaining permits are probably the personal steps that MB once mentioned.
I think it's very unlikely that the game has a series of invisible check-points that has to be visited in the right order, to open something.
