2001 Space Odyssey is remembered in the ED docking music (as it was in Elite 1). IIRC in 2001SO the first monolith landed on Earth and affected primitive hominids in pre-history (Guardian times?). A second monolith was found (during 20th Century space exploration) in a magnetic anomaly buried on Luna & when excavated sent a signal to the final monolith in Jupiter orbit (in the book, but changed in film).
Saturn originally in the book, but they couldn't do the rings properly so changed it for the film. Then the 2010: Odyssey Two sequel book made it Jupiter, too, I think.
