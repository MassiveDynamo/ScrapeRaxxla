Mmm, must have missed something. What hidden rank? Where was this discussed/found?
But it would be very good FD obfuscation to have different factions/cliques of PF with slightly different spellings!

Edit: ninja’d- so it turns up when youhand in goid bonds. That would fit with DB’s statement that FD knew why people hadn’t found Raxxla yet since goids weren’t around then. It looks like we need a study into the various cliques/spellings of PF! “Wheels within wheels”! - perhaps we need to get allied with one or all to start getting the unknown permits which are the treasure trail to Raxxla, since some part of PF controls the permits system.

But I don’t see any link of this hypothesis to the codex toast clue...

Edit2: changing BB supplier this afternoon so I expect to be incommunicado until tomorrow (if all goes well!)

No real link to the toast clue as far as I can tell at first glance, unless of course the PF is TRDW ¯\(ツ)/¯ It can’t hurt to increase reputation with the various PF factions in any case.

I have collected a bunch of permits throughout my career, but never worked specifically on the PF factions. I find the best way for me personally to avoid burning out is to just dump my explo data and donate credits in between doing other stuff as opposed to purely focusing on raising the rep with a faction, but that is clearly not the most efficient or fastest way.

The thing that is unique about the PilotsFederation combat bonds is that they appear to increase reputation with a superpower version of the PF, similar to Fed/Imp/Alliance combat bonds. Not sure if there is any real benefit to ranking this up, but since I am already doing some AX activities I will keep an eye on it.
