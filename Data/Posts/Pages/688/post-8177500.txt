I think it's just two expressions of the same thing in two different context (both within the context of game mechanics). PilotsFederation is for things that apply at the equivalent of the Superpower level, and The Pilots Federation is for things that apply at local/Faction level. Can't say for sure of course, but that's always been my take on it.

Do we still see the PilotsFederation info by the way? (Can't remember if it was just a temporary thing or is still going on.)

Just amended my last post, found another one! Those were taken from EDSM list of minor factions (not player factions). Never knew about PilotsFederation spelling before. If itâ€™s ranking is only related to goid kills that seems significant.
