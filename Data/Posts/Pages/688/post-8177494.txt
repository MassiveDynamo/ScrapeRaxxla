You may be correct and it’s a typo/spelling mistake, FD make many of those, but it could also be deliberately subtle obfuscation; I’d certainly never noticed it before! So we should test it. If PilotsFederation is the same faction as The Pilots Federation in Shinrarta then the current rank from Shinrarta should match any rank from Goid hunting, there should be no increase. If not then they are different, which could be meaningful.

From EDSM searching on “Pilot” in Minor Factions I see:

Pilots’ Federation Local Branch - Democracy
Pilots’ Federation Administration - Corporate
PilotsFederation - suspiciously no detail!
The Pilots Federation (in Shinrarta) - Democracy.

This just seems like “wheels within wheels” we know from Premonition applies to TDW! Seems like FD might have given is another clue there! The one with no detail sounds like it might be TDW hub and the one to pursue.

I think it's just two expressions of the same thing in two different context (both within the context of game mechanics). PilotsFederation is for things that apply at the equivalent of the Superpower level, and The Pilots Federation is for things that apply at local/Faction level. Can't say for sure of course, but that's always been my take on it.

Do we still see the PilotsFederation info by the way? (Can't remember if it was just a temporary thing or is still going on.)
