Off Topic - CQC

This is messed up. Cqc is so glitched out on ps4 that its not playable. Or at least it was so bad no one plays it anymore even if they did fix it. Ive sat trying to get in a match for an hour before. Its sad really. Fdev doesn't care about us console players very much is the impression they're giving its been like a year and a half. They dont even acknowledge it as far as i can tell.
Tl;dr no Raxxla for console

You on XB or PS4? XB I keep trying to get a regular match together on XB....apparently usually one Friday eve IGT 18.00-20.00 approx. but haven't tried it yet. I go for late afternoon, evening (both for Europe timezone) and late night 21.00 onwards for US timezone. Had friends who have played early morning and caught US players still on. I always start in DM, never managed TDM or CTF yet. Would help if there was a 'X players waiting in Y lobby' info tab.

A Lot of instancing issues sometimes, rubber banding or seemingly no damage given at times but other times works fine so I just put up with it.

Use discord as well, one for each platform: https://discord.me/elitedangerouscqc

Next post will be on topic, see post 13,872 (don't make me look like an idiot now )
