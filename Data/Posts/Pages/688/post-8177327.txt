Well, as someone pointed out only yesterday (or was it the day before?) Dark Wheel is a clique of PF! So all we have to do is find the correct clique, build rank, and pass the test....

I had not noticed there were different spellings of PF, which to me does strongly suggest they are different factions. Although FD are not known for accurate spelling this seems too important to be a mistake, especially if they are running different ranking bars. Can we run a confirmation check between this goid hunting rank and the rank for the Shin Dez faction?. Elite Premonition by DW was FD-sponsored and stated TDW is an organisation of “wheels within wheels” and the faction in Shin Dez was just “spinning on the outer rim”. Can we list all the spelling variations? If I understand the spellings so far, we have:

1) PilotsFederation who cashes goid hunting bonds (not done any of that myself, but could be a good test of skill & courage, though I don’t hear of any test mission invitation for it nor any relation to the toast but that might be a later phase once allied with the right faction.
2) Pilots Federation in Shin Dez (these cannot be a fake, since they have not been “quietly closed down” as per Felicity’s thinking, but they might well be part of the obfuscation....

Any others?

I think the missing space in PilotsFederation was likely just because it was using the variable name from the code, or just a typo in the name in the code. Could be wrong...

Also, as we're all members of the Pilots Federation, technically any clique of group we have is a clique or group within the Pilots Federation. Consequently, not sure how much we should read into the statement that TDW is a clique within the PF.
