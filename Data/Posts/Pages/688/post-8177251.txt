im surprised there isn't a dedicated squadron for this search for raxxla thread already. or maybe there is one that i missed? i would have loved to chat speculations and tinfoil in game, while doing game activities. would have been nice

edit: on a second thought, i can see why there wouldn't be one. squadrons aren't multi-platform and we would be devided between xbox, pc and ps4. also any big advancements on there would have been missed by people who aren't loged in. while on a forum, everything stays documented for people who join in late to read. ah well. forum it is!

to raxxla!
