im surprised there isn't a dedicated squadron for this search for raxxla thread already. or maybe there is one that i missed? i would have loved to chat speculations and tinfoil in game, while doing game activities. would have been nice

edit: on a second thought, i can see why there wouldn't be one. squadrons aren't multi-platform and we would be devided between xbox, pc and ps4. also any big advancements on there would have been missed by people who aren't loged in. while on a forum, everything stays documented for people who join in late to read. ah well. forum it is!

to raxxla!

We discussed forming a squadron when they were introduced into game, however we couldn’t agree on a name and it quietly slipped down the back of the sofa

I still like “Questers”!

But since we only very rarely come together in a united attempt to explore a hypothesis, and are usually busy checking out our own ideas, it was a moot point anyway!
