A number of pages back we were discussing the possibility of starting a player faction named “The Dark Wheel” to try and test out Flick Farseer’s beliefs about the existence of TDW.
SPOILER: FELICITY FARSEER

If you don’t remember the discussion, there was already a player squadron with that name.

I submitted an application to join them and they have accepted it, allowing me into their ranks.

This tells me straight up they are not the real deal, confirming my suspicions. As we already know TDW does not accept applications. It has also allowed me to see the names of the 3 people in the squadron already, and there recent activity for the season leaderboards, and there isn’t really anything noteworthy.

I salute them for creating the squadron in the first place. A cool little just for fun role play squadron, but nothing more to it than that I’m afraid.

There is no squadron named “Dark Wheel”, “Pilots federation” “Elite Federation of Pilots” or “Circle of Independent Elite Pilots” though...

There have been various players who have set up and disbanded similar squadrons on Xbox & PC as an attempt to reach out to Fdev, to see if something happens. Some of them have mentioned it in the IRH discord as well.
