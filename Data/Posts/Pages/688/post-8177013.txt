I managed to get up to Friendly with them today actually.

It gets a bit complicated though.

I believe the ‘goid killing combat bonds increases reputation with Pilots Federation, which is kind of like a superpower I guess.

Then there are minor factions that have Pilots Federation listed under allegiance, like others may have Federation/Empire/Alliance.

The Pilots’ Federation Local Branch is the minor faction that operates out of Shin Dez. You also have the Pilots’ Federation Administration in the new player systems. Also CQC Holdings minor faction. There may be more I am missing.

Increasing reputation with these minor factions may also increase the hidden Pilots Federation rep as well? Surely there have been those that have had this rep at max, but maybe having this rep at max unlocks access or an opportunity or something that has been missed?

Mmm, must have missed something. What hidden rank? Where was this discussed/found?
But it would be very good FD obfuscation to have different factions/cliques of PF with slightly different spellings!

Edit: ninja’d- so it turns up when youhand in goid bonds. That would fit with DB’s statement that FD knew why people hadn’t found Raxxla yet since goids weren’t around then. It looks like we need a study into the various cliques/spellings of PF! “Wheels within wheels”! - perhaps we need to get allied with one or all to start getting the unknown permits which are the treasure trail to Raxxla, since some part of PF controls the permits system.

But I don’t see any link of this hypothesis to the codex toast clue...

Edit2: changing BB supplier this afternoon so I expect to be incommunicado until tomorrow (if all goes well!)
