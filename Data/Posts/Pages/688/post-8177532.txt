Inara has a slightly different list of factions beginning 'Pilot'

Note two differnt spellings of Local branch with and without apostrophe. Maybe it was fixed in a a patch..

PFA - they run the starter zone. PFLB in Shidez (no apostrophe name has no systems..)
Yeah, I'd imagine the apostrophe thing has changed within FD, and possibly even just been put in differently by different people depending on how they've interpreted the term. Tough one in a way - is it a Federation composed of Pilots or a Federation belonging to Pilots. There'e every chance that there isn't a definitive answer.
