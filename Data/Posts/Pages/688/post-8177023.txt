This is messed up. Cqc is so glitched out on ps4 that its not playable. Or at least it was so bad no one plays it anymore even if they did fix it. Ive sat trying to get in a match for an hour before. Its sad really. Fdev doesn't care about us console players very much is the impression they're giving its been like a year and a half. They dont even acknowledge it as far as i can tell.


Tl;dr no Raxxla for console
It has been like that with Xbox from the start as well, close to impossible to get a match by random chance, solely due to lack of interest from players. No one plays it because there is so much more to do in the base game and not really enough incentive to play CQC.

The only way I was able to play it as much as I did was by organising sessions with friends. There used to be some clubs around that would have weekly CQC matches as well. I suggest trying to look up or organise something similar if you are really keen on CQC. It is a shame that there isnâ€™t anymore incentive to play it as it was a lot of fun.

I would have discussions with the people I used to play with about what could be done to increase CQC popularity. More base game rewards other than the measly credit rewards was the main request.

Some of my favourites that we had discussed were;
An Incursion type horde mode around the CQC assets with waves of NPC enemies and the final boss being a Capital class ship.
Being able to take your own ships into CQC for testing out specific builds and the like.
Multicrew only 1v1 mode.
SRV modes.
Race modes.
CQC available in the base game around some of the installation assets or specific stations.

Haha kind of got a bit off topic there sorry but damn I really think CQC could have been amazing if it just got a little more attention.
