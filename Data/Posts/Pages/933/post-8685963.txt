Yup back in the bubble doing the same thing... gotta get ma trinkets

This has been my thought, too. I even wondered if they could be linked to the independent system Fortuna (lady fortune) or Tiana Fortune (perhaps being nicknamed lady fortune). I'm rounding some up in my carrier, at Seagull Nebula. They drop more frequently there. I've gotten 11 today--could of had way more, but sometimes you get a ship that drops 5-6 and you can't collect them all before other ships do lol. At least not with my 1A collector lol. It's an anarchy system, so no Wanted status. Just fly around hatch breaking everyone in a shield tank (so you can mostly pop chaff and ignore them). Oddly pirate activity is very high in that system, but it's the corporate ships that seem to mostly have them.
