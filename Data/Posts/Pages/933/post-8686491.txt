Okay I've refined my Trinket hunt. Not that these things are worth anything. They're on and off. Sometimes you find them like crazy, sometimes you don't see one in two hours. But when you do find a source, hatch break the ship as many times as you can. I just got 14 from one ship and had to bail on the rest because a pirate scanned me and launched a hatch breaker on me lol. Go after Keelbacks, and T-ships. Then Adders/ Haulers. The Keelback I hatch breaked 3 times for 5-7, each instance.

[Edit]
Do note that some of the limpets flying around may not be yours and they and other NPC steal them/ steal them back. Try to track who's doing it so you can steal them back lol.
