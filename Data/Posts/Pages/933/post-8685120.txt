Oh lord yes, but smiling while I do it. Ill only be disappointed if I actually find it.



I always though the first target would be Colonia and the Colonia Highway and all the outposts, retreat us back to the bubble and squeeze....but depends if its targeted and strategic or just following the other group and destroying as they go.

It’s important to keep on smiling!

Not if the goids are coming from Col70 via Witchhead & California Nebulae. Colonia’s on the far side of the bubble which should therefore be the first to be hit (well, actually Chloe Sedesi......). Now if FD had the goids coming from Bovomit, where I suspect they were originally planned, things would be different and Jaques would be the sacrificial lamb robot mechanoid cyborg mobility scooter.
