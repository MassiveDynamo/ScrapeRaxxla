Was just in Carcosa last night having a look at all of this as I too was thinking the whole "unamed" and "nameless" seemed " a tiny little bit obvious" only thing that seemed of interest to my somewhat untrained eye (other than a gas giant with 8 moons) was an installation named 'Unauthorized Installation'' but i was unable to get close enough in my Paper mache jumpaconda because of trespassing and such. Could be something but sadly I was unprepared to investigate.

Theres Unaauthorised Installations all over. I think theyre the closest to Pirate bases we have, the first one I found was in an Asteroid Belt, you can imagine what I thought lol. I do wonder though if they arent Pirates as such but some hidden organisation. Dunno, they usually have cool piratey names like Blacktooth and are usually orbiting the last body or moon in the system, usually the furthest out.

What I'm going to do, and what I should have been doing, is try to study, word for word, anytime FDev mentions Raxxla or TDW.

That way madness lies...more that it drives you mad theres bits all over the place, 2 minutes here, 30s there, 45 min interview not on Frontier YT channels, GL

I suspect youâ€™re overthinking things.

Oh lord yes, but smiling while I do it. Ill only be disappointed if I actually find it.

Clearly to do that humanity needs a base well outside the bubble to fight from...

I always though the first target would be Colonia and the Colonia Highway and all the outposts, retreat us back to the bubble and squeeze....but depends if its targeted and strategic or just following the other group and destroying as they go.
