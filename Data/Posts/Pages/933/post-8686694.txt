Hey guys. Just a wild proposal here. Trinkets are known to be carried by superstitious pilots. We also know something of value is in them. We may never know that last part, but what if anything from drops, to jump routes are enhanced with these things? The only reason I ask is becuse I feel like I find more Trinkets when I have them. We also know that the Dark Wheel is usually looking for something and could be why they historically had missions for these. Now I don't know if those missions still exist, but if they don't? They may have found what they were looking for.
