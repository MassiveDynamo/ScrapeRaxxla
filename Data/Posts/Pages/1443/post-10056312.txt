As opposed to some form of book cipher (which I think are usually based on numbers which correspond to pages/lines/words of a reference book), a simple anagram of that title is IMHO much more likely.
I refer you to my previous posts:
The Quest To Find Raxxla
Sigh I've been chasing down a distant cloud I saw in the skymap in Shinrarta. Its NGC 7822!! Space Madness!!! :eek::eek: I have mapped and scanned every body in and around this nebula, asteroid belts dropped into also if this helps, it was one of the first places I explored as it was always...

Perhaps more obviously as an anagram the title contains “Atlas”, “Thetis”, “Phanes”, “Pleione”, all names of ED generation ships

Interesting thoughts...

"Alien Paradise Lost (scary, and reminiscent of my Alpha Centauri/Eden hypothesis!)"

Did that one go unnoticed by the Milton hypothesis fans?
