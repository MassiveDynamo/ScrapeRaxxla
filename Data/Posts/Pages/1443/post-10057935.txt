Didn't find a Dredger.
Ditto, I took a round in the neighboring systems in Spirograph until I hit the col70 wall.
Delivered some data to Orion University, got allied status. Nothing unusual so far, so I guess I'll call it the end of this journey for me.
I'll head over to Sirius or SD, not sure yet - to sell off some more data / discoveries.

Then I'm planning on trotting back to Sirius (not spent time there since Horizon), checking a bit of the USS in space, inbox random missions and some random POIs. Just to do something different.
After that it'll be a bit of AX combat since my index-finger has HEALED. Yay!
