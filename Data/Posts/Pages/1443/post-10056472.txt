As opposed to some form of book cipher (which I think are usually based on numbers which correspond to pages/lines/words of a reference book), a simple anagram of that title is IMHO much more likely.
I refer you to my previous posts:
The Quest To Find Raxxla
Sigh I've been chasing down a distant cloud I saw in the skymap in Shinrarta. Its NGC 7822!! Space Madness!!! :eek::eek: I have mapped and scanned every body in and around this nebula, asteroid belts dropped into also if this helps, it was one of the first places I explored as it was always...

Perhaps more obviously as an anagram the title contains “Atlas”, “Thetis”, “Phanes”, “Pleione”, all names of ED generation ships

Agree. I ran the Codex text, and snippets of it too, through an AI bot and the majority of hits identified it as ‘plain text / anagram’ as opposed to some cypher.

There is an oddity about the text, which might just be due to intentional redaction (so as not to intentionally give anything anyway) but the use of the word Astrophel/phil is so contentious. As is the layout of the toast.
