Perhaps this is this your wordpress site?
Nope not my site but I've had similar thoughts to those at the end...

"So do we think this in itself is full of references? I suspect not, but it may be a book cipher or some other form of code..

The 108 stanzas has been linked by some to the story of odysseus.

Astrophel in this context is a man, not a princess and stella is only rather loosely connected to ‘sprialling stars’ and its in no way a ‘children’s story’

So I’m skeptical but in the absence of any other link here, it should be analysed..

‘eye to see’ and ‘cunningly hidden’ do infer some sort of cipher."

I saw a post on here about stenography and the DW toast and did some googling... Book cipher seemed like an option but you'd need the book and a specific issue to work from what I've read... Have any real world books been mentioned in any lore/Poi/Galnet articles/etc?

"As hints for those with eyes to see" was the thing that I've been thinking about and FD have of course used spectrograms in the past too...

... And I've not come across the link of the 108 stanzas to Odysseus before... Another rabbit hole to go down...lol
