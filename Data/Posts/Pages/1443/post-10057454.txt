Totally!

I too enjoyed my trip out the opposite way from the Hesperus. I went out to the NGC Nebula then back via Sothis. Didn't find a Dredger... but I did suddenly realised how absolutely massive the Galaxy is. I mean, is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist, but that’s just peanuts to space...


@Edelgard von Rhein intrigued me by pointing out that Col70 and Wreaken is mentioned in Premonition, so I'm re-reading that again since the first time I wasn't looking for Raxxla and it was so long ago I barely remember any of it. I've just finished re-reading And Here the Wheel (made a bunch of notes), and before that Out of the Darkness because of the Thargoid stuffs. I still believe that the official novels contain some clues - at least as to what Raxxla isn't if nothing else - and I still think that by ruling out what isn't related to Raxxla, we can at least get an idea of what is.
