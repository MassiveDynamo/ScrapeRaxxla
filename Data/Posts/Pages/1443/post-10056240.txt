As opposed to some form of book cipher (which I think are usually based on numbers which correspond to pages/lines/words of a reference book), a simple anagram of that title is IMHO much more likely.
I refer you to my previous posts:
The Quest To Find Raxxla
Sigh I've been chasing down a distant cloud I saw in the skymap in Shinrarta. Its NGC 7822!! Space Madness!!! :eek::eek: I have mapped and scanned every body in and around this nebula, asteroid belts dropped into also if this helps, it was one of the first places I explored as it was always...

This image shows two sources and a spike-like pattern due to the support structure for the transmission grating. That must be it, the support structure would presumably account for the feint circle in the image too.

Perhaps more obviously as an anagram the title contains “Atlas”, “Thetis”, “Phanes”, “Pleione”, all names of ED generation ships
