Hmmmmmm. I just looked up pics of a Beacon since it's been so long since I visited one... and I don't think that's a Beacon:


Beacons are quite fat and have blades, even opened up:

They also don't have whatever that little floating spire is on the top left of my original post.

I do believe that's a new Guardian something.
