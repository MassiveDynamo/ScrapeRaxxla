Agree. I ran the Codex text, and snippet of it too, through an AI bit and the majority of hits identified it as ‘plain text / anagram’ as opposed to some cypher.

There is an oddity about the text, which might just be due to intentional redaction (so as not to intentionally give anything anyway) but the use of the word Astrophel/phil is so contentious. As is the layout of the toast.
The layout has had me thinking it's a bit weird...
