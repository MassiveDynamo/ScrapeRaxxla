Anyway, since our attention-span in this thread is quite like Doug ...
SPOILER: RAXXLA THREAD




Regarding BD-12 1172 (Spirograph) ... (I had no idea what a Spirograph was really)

Ooh that's intriguing! I wonder if maybe the Dredgers would be considered 'independent' in that way? I know they weren't physically in-game back then* but iirc the lore for Dredgers has existed since... was it FE2?

Lots of ringed planets there too, It would be a good place for a Dredger clan ship to refuel. I'm loosely speculating that they must have some systems marked as their own version of green systems, presumably one with many rings would be potentially such a system.

Unfortunately I'm 1300ly away following the approximate vector the other way... tempted to go look at Spirograph though.

I'm zigzagging my way down, I'm 1200LY above just poking some old megaship wrecks from the past.
But I assume we're 5 years late ...


I don't know

Here’s the answer to that:

Edit - as the full date’s not in the text, the post’s from 2020.

I know FDev said this & that at certain stage. But it doesn't exclude that we can find breadcrumbs for ... something.

BD-12 1172 negative results, checked rings, poked some NPCs. I Supercruised 0.2 LY within the system towards Hesperus direction. Nothing to report. As expected.
I'm heading towards the Hesperus site, but Col70 wont let me go directly. As expected.

But it's a nice journey regardless, get to do some more scans, USSs etc.
So I'll be on my way.
