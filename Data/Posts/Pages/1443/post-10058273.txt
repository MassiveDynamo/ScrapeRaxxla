For those with eyes to see....

The transitive English sentence, a sentence that contains all three parts, subject (S), verb (V), and object (O), generally follows the S-V-O order. For example, “Harry wants to play baseball” is an S-V-O statement. However, O-S-V may be used to emphasize the object.

To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!
Subject = jewel
Verb = burns
Object = brow of the mother of galaxies

To the whisperer in witch-space
Subject = whisperer
Verb =
Object = witch-space

101 (5)

the siren of the deepest void!
Subject = siren
Verb =
Object = deepest void

101 (5)

The Parent’s grief
Subject = Parent
Verb =
Object = grief

101 (5)

the Lovers woe

101 (5)

and the yearning of our vagabond hearts!
Subject = our (us)
Verb = yearning
Object = vagabond hearts

(This is not S-V-O... It's V-S-O - reversing the number has the same result... You can take the us out.. I added it)
