The biggest problem with the specific portion of the Raxxla codex is there isn't really a children's story matching "Princess Astrophel and the Spiraling Stars". There is an additional poem by Edmund Spencer called "Astrophel: A Pastorall Elegy upon the Death of the Most Noble and Valorous Knight, Sir Philip Sidney". Though pretty sure that isn't a children's story (presently trying to find the poem in question).

This is cited in Wikipedia as one of the sources - multiple download formats available:
Colin Clouts come home againe : Spenser, Edmund, 1552?-1599 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive
Colophon: London. Printed by T.C. for William Ponsonbie. 1595

NOTE: In case you are curious, I found this by way of just searching for Astrophel. I had been attempting to find a better fit for that particular part of the codex.
