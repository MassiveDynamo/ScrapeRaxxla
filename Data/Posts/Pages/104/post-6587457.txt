Huge everyone I think I remember reading and seeing that the Dark Wheel was actually a minor faction in the game. Does anyone know what system or systems they control? Iâ€™d like to become allies with them. Thanks a bunch.

The Dark Wheel is the dominate Faction among a bunch of planetary bases in Shinrata.
