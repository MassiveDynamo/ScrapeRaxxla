Not sure if this connects with Raxxla. Or even Soontill. But check this out: https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/89cy7q/the_crystalline_forest/

What do you guys think? Could it be real? Could it be a lingering undiscovered thing from 2.2 or 2.3?

I have no doubt that there are plenty of interesting things around the galaxy that are yet to be found. The crystalline forest could be one of those. Like you said though ... not sure if there is a Raxxla/Soontill connection.
