Honestly, dude, I hope you are right.
But I'd bet you are wrong.
Why ? Because just as the Rift mYsTeRy was DW's baby, Raxxla is MB's. And since the Elite/Founders missions and MB disappeared fom ED, if someone knows what he is doing ("..so people know what they are doing, MB"), please just tell us.

I don't think Raxxla was MB's personal project. It's an FD inhouse mystery. DB has had plans for Raxxla long before MB came into the picture.

Personally I think the story is running full speed as 'the Guardians'. I find it very suspicious that FD has decided to name the Guardian AI, Constructs. It's a bit to close to 'on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway to other Universes'.
