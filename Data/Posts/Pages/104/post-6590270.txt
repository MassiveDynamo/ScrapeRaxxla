Honestly guys, I do not think the story situation is as bad as you think. To me it only seems like some threads of the tapestry have gone into the background.

I say this partially based on the AI side of things, which as far as I've seen has been virtually untouched beyond some initial seeds for most of the game so far, but is slowly starting to come back to the fore.

Perhaps I'm applying rose tinted glasses, but my genuine impression is otherwise. Or I hope so at least.

Honestly, dude, I hope you are right.
But I'd bet you are wrong.
Why ? Because just as the Rift mYsTeRy was DW's baby, Raxxla is MB's. And since the Elite/Founders missions and MB disappeared fom ED, if someone knows what he is doing ("..so people know what they are doing, MB"), please just tell us.
