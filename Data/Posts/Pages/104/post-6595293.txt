I think the story is going to be quite AI focused in future. The guardian codex continued with emphasis on guardian AI, we have this biologically driven bio-mechanical AI attacking stations in the bubble, and Felicias Bulwark Project is about to go rogue any moment now. It could be all very interesting.

I still think Raxxla will be linked to the alien story, to the universe of Elite Dangerous, because an obscure easter egg would be such odd choice for something people have big expectations of. Maybe. They had all of it planned before game was even released, that is why it feels so stretched or taking strange turns at times. Perhaps we are at the "The Silent Song of the Spheres" now. "Obfuscated In The Outer Rim" was Formidine Rift.

I completed an exhausting expodition ending in Colonia lately. There are some reasons to believe there would be new guardian systems somewhere, but nothing too interesting has happened lately. I will continue searching for something... here. Flying around Sothis or Eurybia would seem like nice way of spending some time too, maybe next month. (You know, the crystalline gold is obviously made by applying gold to those underground guardian things. Liz Ryder is a Ryder. Eurybia means "wide-force" and "mastery of the sea")

Just some afternoon coffee thoughts.
