Huge everyone I think I remember reading and seeing that the Dark Wheel was actually a minor faction in the game. Does anyone know what system or systems they control? Iâ€™d like to become allies with them. Thanks a bunch.

They don't control any systems, AFAIK. They are, however, present at the Founders World of Shinrarta Dhezra.
