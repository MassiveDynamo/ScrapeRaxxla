Greetings commanders,

Fun fact (maybe its new to someone, or old and I missed it .. then forget it ):
The new odyssey trailer features the song "Space Oddity" from David Bowie..
and there is a system called "Ziggy" and a gas giant called "Stardust" in ED.
(Ziggy Stardust and the spiders from mars..)

Back to our quest:
Currently my exploration vessel sits at the border of the Regor sector and I
keep on shouting at my canopy "let me in!!". I'm running out of ideas. It seems every system in the guardian area has already been visited.. really annoying.
I thought that maybe Dr Melvilles ship is here somewhere. But again .. its a needle in the haystack too. (And maybe another Galnet reference without in-game content.)

The sites/structures are all known, I suppose. The beacons too. So there is nothing new. We checked the doors, we checked the drawings.
Some commanders checked the layouts of the sites..

Does someone know whether the guardian systems are visible in the map before they get explored?
Or do they show up in the civilization filter after they have been explored?
So maybe there are many more and we have to find them.

Just one small hint ... just one.
Space madness kicks in.. those stars laugh at me, do they?
Click to expand...
There's a huge amount of undiscovered systems in the Guardian area.

The brown circle marks the rough extent of the main Guardian area.

While trying to avoid spoilers... no it's not a galnet reference with no in-game content.

Definitely (as can be in the absence of a statement from FD) not all sites. Maybe all the general layouts have been found, but who knows.

They don't all show up even after they've been explored. (Whether some have shown up prior to being explored, I can't say.)

Yep.

Well, the sheer numbers have been hinted at for a long time, as has there being Guardian areas other than the one around Regor.

There might even have been other hints, who knows!

This kinda depends on what you constitute as something new.
