Thanks Jorki,

I figured you and others had already likely covered off a lot of that ground!

It's also something my Cmdr wants to do and see, so it's more about prioritizing RL time to get stuff done, and not only that if it does fall down to a journey everyone must take I'd rather have done (most of) it before finding out the news I need to complete it all to get to Raxxla!

I like the focus on what was around in the early stages of the game, and have also held a long standing suspicion about those faction flags and neck tattoos. Interestingly some of those directly oppose TDW in SD.

Understand! Enjoy all the gameplay, donâ€™t get trapped into Raxxla Quest alone, that path potentially carries space madness, grind, boredom and rage!

Mmm, Passenger missions for people with triangular neck tattoos?
