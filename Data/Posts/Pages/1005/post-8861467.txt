The reference regarding DB saying there are secret invitations is more likely than not, given the game mechanisms in place then and now, to be a description of the permit invitation process.

Cmdrs align with a faction that controls a locked system - thats not widely promoted, you get an invitation and you're in.

Dont feel DB was alluding to DW nor Raxxla at that time.

Honestly feel the whole DW invitation concept is just wistful thinking; a grand idea but honestly, you have to ask the logical question. If a secret mechanism was in place:

A: FD would really want you to find it, because it cost time and money to implement.
B: if there were such a unique mechanism in game FD would want to implement it across the whole game.
C: its more likely, given the improbability of options A & B, that if there is an invitation it will not be skill based, but it uses existing game mechanics, e.g. a locked system invitation.

Its possible that the Dark Wheel station is just locked beind a permit. All we need do is locate the correct faction to align with?

Maybe the older DW missions were this initial invitation process?

FD seem to imply these were put back in (see page 1) but its pretty vague if they really were. The Codex could be pointing us to the source, or it could just be a red herring.

The reference to the Omphalos could just mean - omphaloskepsis!

No, if you watch the DB video he specifically talks about recruitment into a secret society within game. Fairly confident he was referring to TDW.
