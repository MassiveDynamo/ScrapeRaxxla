There's a huge amount of undiscovered systems in the Guardian area.

Heatmap of discovered/submitted systems (EDSM) in the main Guardian area (from 12/03/20, but hasn't changed significantly):

The brown circle marks the rough extent of the main Guardian area.

While trying to avoid spoilers... no it's not a galnet reference with no in-game content.

Definitely (as can be in the absence of a statement from FD) not all sites. Maybe all the general layouts have been found, but who knows.

They don't all show up even after they've been explored. (Whether some have shown up prior to being explored, I can't say.)

Yep.

Well, the sheer numbers have been hinted at for a long time, as has there being Guardian areas other than the one around Regor.

There might even have been other hints, who knows!

This kinda depends on what you constitute as something new.

Mate, put that heat map in a spoiler with a health warning!
Insomnia, 3 hours sleep, and then I sit down to catch up on the thread and my eyes explode!!
