Hello!

I have read some of the pages and i have a ideia.

What if the mother of galaxies is gravity and its jewel is SAG A?

It’s been hypothesised before, but how does that fit into the toast-jewel that burns on the brow of the mother?
If you can solve that riddle we’d love to hear your thoughts!
