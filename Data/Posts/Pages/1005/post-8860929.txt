I'm still of the mind that either Raxxla or DW station is in Polaris.
Would be happy to be proven right or wrong on both accounts.
More than likely.

Polaris is a prime candidate I feel, if the references to Philip Sydneys 'Astrophel' is intentional, to Axis Mundis, the Omphalos and Norse myth as well, may not just be tin foil space madness, as Polaris, or Draco or the 'bears' are applicable, as they all reference that area.

Edit: last time I checked the Polaris lock said 'Polaris permit' not 'unknown permit', is that still the case, if so that to me implies it can be obtained.

The controlling faction is not always the permit provider. Could be some small scale operation in the middle of nowhere.

*edit: 2021 FD recently confirmed Polaris permit isnâ€™t currently available to players

Who knows.

Everytime I reach down the back of the sofa or some old deep coat pocket, I'm probably more likely to find Raxxla.
