I'm still of the mind that either Raxxla or DW station is in Polaris.
Would be happy to be proven right or wrong on both accounts.
The DW station could well be there. I Raxxla is there, it probably need to be well hidden in the system.

We have been to Polaris in FFE. It did have an alien portal at that time. It was Thargoid and lead to their home world Miackce. I think it would be a little underwhelming, if that was Raxxla.

Fleet carriers have revealed the system map for Polaris. It has one gas giant, with eight moons.
