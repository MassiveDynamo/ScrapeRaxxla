Maybe FDev could offer us an online course on philosophy of science, you know, small introductions into Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, Michael Feynman, stuff like that. That could be a fun thing to do as a group. I'm sure there are universities that offer that sort of thing for businesses and, um, why not Elite Dangerous forums lore & roleplay section too. I think somebody would have to contact community managers to make it happen.
