Alright this was interesting; went to Lave to see about that asteroid cloud where the first moon was supposed to be. when trying to get to the second cluster I found the approach taking weirdly long... only to later notice it was stuck on 9.9ls and constantly resetting to this distance.

Probably nothing but a desync, still curious though

Edit: it's happening again, with my ship seemingly just drifting around it, being pushed away
