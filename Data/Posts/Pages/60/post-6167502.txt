Hilariously searching for "Plane" instantly points to Lave: meanwhile engineering my new exploration vessel.... such a chore.

Speaking of "Plane" *Stares at the Abyssal Plain" You know... people claiming the existence of Raxxla being called insane... Abyss? Anyone?... no?

Maybe it isn't hilarious, but a reference to Raxxla being a moon of Lave? At least at some point, or, depending on the accuracy of some of the information, a moon of Lave at certain times only?
