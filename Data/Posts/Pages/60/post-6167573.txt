Exactly: which always makes me think of the line we weren't looking at the "core of the problem"

Well, the problem happens to be that if it were a moon of Lave, that happened to escape orbit, due to the fact that some theories suggest it may have been the source for FSD/FTL tech, does not necessarily limit the search area to within 1000ly of Lave (1000ly, as if it was traveling slower than, or at the speed of light, 1000 or so years have passed, to my knowledge, since it escaped) You mentioned the Abyssal Plain before, I'm out exploring now, headed towards Colonia, but going to SagA, and Beagle Point afterwards, however, is it worth detouring to the Abyssal Plain to check for clues pertaining to Raxxla?
