Operation Ring of Saturn

@Jorki Rasalas have suggested that we do a collective honking search, starting with the ring of Saturn. As to the question of How (*2) an efficient search can be conducted, all suggestions are welcome.

Description: A cooperative honking search of the ring of Saturn.
Who: All TQTFR's (The Quest To Find Raxxla) are invited
Where: Sol (Please remember that you need the Sol permit)
When: TBD (*1)
How: TBD (*2)

The initial idea is to gather many CMDR's in one or more wings/instances and then honk/pulse our way through the ring. The specific details on how to conduct an efficient search is TBD as stated above.

With respect to the When (*1) please send me a PM or a post here (minus email) with:
Email (Not shared here, use for possible Google docs access only)
CMDR Name
Preferred week day(s) and in-game timeslots
Which ED version: Legacy, Horizon or Odyssey
PC, Xbox, PlayStation?
Preferred play mode: Open / PG (which one)
Preferred communication channel
What else have I missed?
As to the ship, I suggest we bring:
A fast ship, 400+ m/s
A Sensor engineered with Wide Angle?
A Detailed Surface Scanner, possibly engineered
A Pulse Wave Analyzer
Access to Sol
A good spirited pilot
Miscellaneous:
Alt's with fuel & repair limpets
Prepare ship/module storage in Sol. Titan City is the closest starport for Saturn.

And please do not bring a SLF as this can give problems with the instancing.

Happy Questing!
