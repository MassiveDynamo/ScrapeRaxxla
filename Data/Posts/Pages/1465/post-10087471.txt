Humor me with this thought: Thargoids aren't real and have never existed. They are nothing but a figment of an overactive human imagination.

All that has ever existed is Humans, Progressive-branch Guardians, and Traditionalist-branch Guardians, a handful of bio-engineered species created by either Humans or Guardians, and a few species that naturally evolved. Otherwise, what we call Thargoids are the Traditionalist-branch of the Guardians. The problem: both groups have bio-ships and are considerably more concerned about Guardian AI becoming aware of their existence. That, or the snake ships were Guardian all along but the purported technological incompatibility is largely a work of fiction (we have bio-chemistry parts to our ships and bio-circuitry). Our ships themselves, may then be part of whatever is possibly externally configuring jumps (aka Raxxla). Even a cursory reading of Guardian technology reveals our communication systems are almost identical to Guardians. There are also multiple references to Through-space holo-comms in earlier games.
