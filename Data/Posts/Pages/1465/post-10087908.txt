It has been confirmed that TDW haven't found Raxxla. At least they hadn't at the start of ED. Unless the DW station is brand new, it's neider Raxxla nor in orbit around it.
Hi Han_Zen
Where does that confirmation come from? The only source I’ve seen is in the book “And Here The Wheel”, but IIRC Allen Stroud advised that nothing is canon if it isn’t presented in-game. It seemed to me that the books are not necessarily canon, just more fluffy flavour.
