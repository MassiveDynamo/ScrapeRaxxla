Sounds interesting, not sure this would work for me as my time is random but let's see.

CMDR Blaggerd
Would try to fit in with others, don't have any regular times
Horizons
PC
Open but happy to PG (not a member of any though)
I only use in game chat to date but open to suggestions

As an aside, has activation of Thargoid devices (star map) ever had any CMDR been on top of the structure as it activates. I don't particularly like this gameplay and only activated a device once or twice, not then been able to get a SRV to the top in reasonable time. Team play would be one option I expect or a CMDR with better SRV skills or perhaps on foot.
