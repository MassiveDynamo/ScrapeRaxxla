Gaia, as I remember it, was the spirit of the Earth.
And also, I remember Gaia was the name of a telescope satellite that was launched in 2013 to the point of lungrage between the Earth and the Sun.
Its purpose was to make a 3D map of our galaxy.
Gaia astronomical observation programme is much wider than that.
