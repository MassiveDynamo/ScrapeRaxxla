Operation Ring of Saturn

@Jorki Rasalas have suggested that we do a collective honking search, starting with the ring of Saturn. As to the question of How (*2) an efficient search can be conducted, all suggestions are welcome.

Description: A cooperative honking search of the ring of Saturn.
Who: All TQTFR's (The Quest To Find Raxxla) are invited
Where: Sol (Please remember that you need the Sol permit)
: TBD (*1)
: TBD (*2)

The initial idea is to gather many CMDR's in one or more wings/instances and then honk/pulse our way through the ring. The specific details on how to conduct an efficient search is TBD as stated above.

With respect to the When (*1) please send me a PM or a post here (minus email) with:
As to the ship, I suggest we bring:
And please do not bring a SLF as this can give problems with the instancing.

Happy Questing!
