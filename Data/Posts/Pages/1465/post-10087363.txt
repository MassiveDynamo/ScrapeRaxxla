ROFL.... you have to watch the live stream to see how conspicuous it was... and that screen cap is from the Burr Pit not me....

I did watch the live stream and chappy on the left makes a BIG deal about the Blue only M&Ms and chappy on the right awkwardly makes the triangle on the desk later....

Just thought I'd point it out as people were talking triangles.....

And I'm still laughing at your pic... but you missed the logo on the hoodie!
