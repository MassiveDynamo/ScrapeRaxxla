Anyone find Raxxla yet?
We've got lots ideas, but no consistency. I am afraid consensus on what we are looking for is somewhat lacking. I just hope when someone finds it, we have some idea that it is important. Because currently, it isn't looking good. Also, we had better hope that we haven't found it, but don't know what it is or think it is something minor.
