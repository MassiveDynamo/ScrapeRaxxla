on the hyperspace planet bug/mystery, I had this a couple of years ago where i got this same bug jumping from a system with no planets at all to a system with just a gas giant present with the sun, unfortunately no evidence (vids or screenys) but just putting it out there that this bug isnt just limited to in system planets thats if you believe me of course
