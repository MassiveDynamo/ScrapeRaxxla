That's good to know! I like to hear all these sorts of encounters because they help to add context, now we have two examples of someone confirming seeing a planet unrelated to a recent planetary mass-lock, and an account of seeing a planet unrelated to planets in the origin or destination system. We can't use it in our search for proof because there's no evidence that others can independely view, but this is very useful none-the-less

That's good info, thanks

Edit: Can you remember when it was more precisely? was it 2 years ago, more? less? Do you recall where you were jumping to/from at all? area of space? what ship, all that stuff is good to know if you can remember

it was around just after Horizons launch date which if i remember was around 2015? only details on location would be around the top of the bubble ( I frequented in that region for some time then both exploring and also doing runs with my Squadron) and I would have been in an Anaconda as that was my main and pretty much flushed out with best jump range per pew pew ship at the time
