Just watching an old episode of Death in Paradise and heard an interesting phrase:
“ my forensics training has highlighted that you need to test everything because you don’t know what you’re looking for until you find it”
Seems highly relevant!
But that doesn't make any sense...

Sorry, just my take on Death in Paradise. We binged a load of them a few years ago, and somebody says in just about every episode. Until some of the later ones, where the writers seem to have cottoned on.
