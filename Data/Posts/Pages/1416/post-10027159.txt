Set Condition One Throughout the Thread!
I found another video of a planet in Witchspace. Post-Odyssey (9 months ago), also from a carrier, like the only other post-Odyssey vid we have.

This time thought we do have both start and end of the jump reported: "Jumping from Lave 2 to HIP 38225 a planet appeared inside the Witchspace so I started recording."


Screengrab of the "Witchspace Planet" in the video for comparison:

Lave 2 in Odyssey, I tried to match the viewpoint of the carrier:

To me this doesn't look like a match for the planet in the video. What do you guys reckon?

Next I went to the HIP 38225 system, planet A1 (the carrier's destination):

Very obviously the planet from the video I couldn't quite match the same geography because the planet is half in darkness, but it's very clearly the same planet. If you spin it round in the system map you can see that exact same surface feature:





Obviously this is just that one carrier video, but I'm going to try the same thing with the other carrier video we have, we know the destination of that carrier so should be easy to identify if that planet is the same as the one seen in witchspace there.

Doing this for the pre-odyssey ones will be harder, but I'll give it a go.

I'm personally happy that this is the solution to these two carrier videos. Thoughts?

Edit: I do just want to point out that ALL of the armchair tech support people in the reddit thread commenting on this were wrong. They ALL said it was the origin planet getting pulled along in the animation.
