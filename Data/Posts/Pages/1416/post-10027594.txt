Here we go:
From our original video, carrier jumping to Delkar system, planet anamundi.


Anamundi (Delkar):

Very clearly the same planet!



Ok then, so we know now that "Planets in Witchspace" from both the carrier videos we've had are definitely a bug, and they're both the same bug.

The bug is the destination planet appears during the transition. Easy

This bug, however, is visibly different from the Horizons videos...
