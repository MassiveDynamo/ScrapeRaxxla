on the hyperspace planet bug/mystery, I had this a couple of years ago where i got this same bug jumping from a system with no planets at all to a system with just a gas giant present with the sun, unfortunately no evidence (vids or screenys) but just putting it out there that this bug isnt just limited to in system planets thats if you believe me of course
Now that you mention it, I have a vague feeling something similar has happened to me, fairly recently (as in this year, but couldn't narrow it down beyond that), and I only barely registered it. Was it briefly and just after the countdown?

Problem with this is, if it isn't just a bug, how do we recreate this? Going on Jorki's last post, I now have in mind a different British TV program: Taskmaster. Specifically a task that asks the contestants to "get to 11 points as fast as possible".

Get to 11 points as fast as possible
Get to 11 points as fast as possible was a team task featured on Series 1 of Taskmaster, as the third task in Down an octave. The task was won by Josh Widdicombe, Roisin Conaty and Romesh Ranganathan in 11 minutes and 12 seconds. The task is presented in a squash court. The teams had to score 11...

So, how do we get to 11 points? Normal rules.
