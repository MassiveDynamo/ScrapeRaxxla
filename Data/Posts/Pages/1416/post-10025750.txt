I've been playing since beta and whilst I've seen planets and stars do all kinds of weird stuff when entering a system or leaving that look like glitches, never seen one midway through a jump...

My view is just log a ticket with FD and ask... If it's a bug/defect or a feature and not if it's anything to do with Raxxla...
Go for it Having Fdev answer would be primo top #1 result in this case!
