Interesting to hear you saw a planet too, do you recall any details?
If I am remembering correctly, it was a rather monochrome planet and could well have been pretty much the same as the pictures. However, I could just have a minor memory fragment that my brain is putting together through influence of information I've read here (I'm not trusting my memory that much atm).

Anyway, I think it was probably around the bubble rather than during deep space exploration. I also think it might not have been the first time. From now on though, I'm going back to keeping Geforce experience on withthe instant record facility in case it happens again. Not too sure what I do if I see it VR though. But I don't play in VR that often anyway, particulaly if I'm going to do on foot gameplay.
