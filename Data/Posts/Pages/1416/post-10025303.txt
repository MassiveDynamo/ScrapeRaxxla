You win the thread. And all the other threads. Actually the whole internet.

Nice to see the occasional return to this old hunting ground!
Really? I just thought I turned up to make the occasional, obvious quip while everyone else ran around like headless chickens doing the real work. At least I'm in and around the bubble for a change, and might be able to check some stuff out. Not that I'm certain what to check out. I don't have any patience for messing around with the contents of Journal files, and I don't currently have a fleet carrier to check look for that planet.

I'm not getting an FC until after my tour of the Pegasus Arm. It's the last of the galactic arms that I'm yet to traverse the length of. Currently, I have no idea when I'll be setting off on that. Bubble stuff might end up being more of a priority soon. Just keeping an eye on the narrative for now.
