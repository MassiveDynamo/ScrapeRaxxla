I got a gut feeling too that it may be a glitch somehow.
Thanks, me too (it does seem 'buggy'), however... we also know that some bugs and glitches are actually content that we're not supposed to see yet...

[Link goes to a thread I posted a while go detailing the encounter that several CMDRs and I had with the 'Maelstrom' a few months back when UIA#2 first appeared. While we were investigating (and involving Canonn discord etc) we were repeatedly told about how this "early discovery" style glitch happens a lot. We all remember things like the barancle discovery glitch, etc.]
