on the hyperspace planet bug/mystery, I had this a couple of years ago where i got this same bug jumping from a system with no planets at all to a system with just a gas giant present with the sun, unfortunately no evidence (vids or screenys) but just putting it out there that this bug isnt just limited to in system planets thats if you believe me of course
That's good to know! I like to hear all these sorts of encounters because they help to add context, now we have two examples of someone confirming seeing a planet unrelated to a recent planetary mass-lock, and an account of seeing a planet unrelated to planets in the origin or destination system. We can't use it in our search for proof because there's no evidence that others can independely view, but this is very useful none-the-less

That's good info, thanks

Edit: Can you remember when it was more precisely? was it 2 years ago, more? less? Do you recall where you were jumping to/from at all? area of space? what ship, all that stuff is good to know if you can remember
