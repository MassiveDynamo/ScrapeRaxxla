Now that you mention it, I have a vague feeling something similar has happened to me, fairly recently (as in this year, but couldn't narrow it down beyond that), and I only barely registered it. Was it briefly and just after the countdown?

Problem with this is, if it isn't just a bug, how do we recreate this? Going on Jorki's last post, I now have in mind a different British TV program: Taskmaster. Specifically a task that asks the contestants to "get to 11 points as fast as possible".

Get to 11 points as fast as possible

So, how do we get to 11 points? Normal rules.

Step 1 is to show whether it's a bug or not. We're just collecting info atm. Interesting to hear you saw a planet too, do you recall any details?

We currently have 4 videos showing a similar-looking planet. We're looking for a similar video showing any other planet to debunk this. Really just need people to get googling and add more videos to the pile! Or find out from Fdev if it's a bug (that's the easier and less accessible option).

If it's not a bug, then we don't know it's related to Raxxla even, but we can cross that bridge when we get there.

Edit: We have video evidence of this "bug" existing for the last 4 years. Anecdotal evidence of it happening since the very early days of the game pre-horizons.
