I could find no mentions of it being permit locked, so naturally I was curious

Contacted edsm here. https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/edsm-elite-dangerous-star-map.179063/page-114#post-8004292

PS: Sorry to disappoint @bigcee75 ;-)

I've re-posted your words on their discord..

[Edit]: they responded that they have removed the lock in the EDSM database. I've asked them what may have caused it. They're not sure but its being marked as PL from at least Nov. 2017..
