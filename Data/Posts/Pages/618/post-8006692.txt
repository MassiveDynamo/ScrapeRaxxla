There are a number of stars that are below the -10,000 LY point at which the Galaxy map stops them being selectable - generally due to them being incorrectly positioned. They're not 'secret' just misplaced (search for Beta Phoenicis, which should be under 200 LY from Sol), and subsequently unreachable.

In the case of the PSR cluster FDev teleported a player there simply to shoot a video. Obviously this wouldn't be the case if there was actually anything significant about those stars. I expect the player had to suicide home anyway.

Anyone explored the possiility that Raxxla might be in Beta Phoenicis?
