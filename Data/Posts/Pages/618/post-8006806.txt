There are two stages of Raxxla Madness:
The second is terminally obsessive fernweh, addiction to strong alcohol, and an interest in obscure mythology
The first stage is looking for Raxxla
Which one is worse?

Addiction to strong alcohol, and an interest in obscure mythology.
Randomly looking for something you don't what is, in 400 million places.

Neither look like a thing a rational person would do.

I would also like to add a third option.

- Doing obscure complex tasks in order to invoke a game mechanic (probably non existent) that gives you an invitation to a secret society that is supposedly also looking for Raxxla, with about the same success rate as us.
