Did anyone notice in the front end 1 video that the sun starts to rise over the planet. That is a symbol in game. A star like shape over a half arc. It shows up in missions selection to indicate some type of mission. I'm not sure which type though.

Just looked it up. It's the symbol for surface missions. I'm assuming, at least in part, this is an add for the new mission types. Does the movie predate the ground missions. And what and when did the other videos come out. Did anyone every identify the location in the video?

BTW, which video are we analyzing to find raxxla?

I wonder if it's possible, if found, to also figure out the exact date of the picture in game via the planets marking and their rotations and/or other things like star positions.

Also, did anyone notice the background of this forum can have a star pattern on it? I wonder if it's from in game.

Also, is it possible the three stars behind this station are something as simple as orions belt?
