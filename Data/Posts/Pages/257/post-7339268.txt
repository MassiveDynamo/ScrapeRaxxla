Just a raw thought (one that has probably already been noted and dismissed, but just in case): just noticed, while playing, that the new Surface Scanner symbols (when scanning) resemble the central part of the Codex's Raxxla logo. I doubt it means anything (like "scan the thing in a precise manner") though, since Raxxla's been presumably findable since day one and these two things are brand new.
