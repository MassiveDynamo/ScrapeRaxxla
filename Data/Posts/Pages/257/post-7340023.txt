I just got to MAIA exploring. I stopped at obsidian orbital. I recognized the voice. The voice kept saying access to maia was by permit only. Got me thinking. What if all permit systems are permit locked because there are player bases within. Maybe it's an organization lockdown option. This got me thinking. Many people think raxxla is within a permit locked system. What if that means Raxxla was found long ago and is simply locked down by the discoverer/owner of the new system. What if the game devs let them keep the discovery hush hush! ;p

BTW, as far as I know I don't have a permit... How did I get in. I though permit systems physically stopped you from entering them.
