Could the star between the horns be Shinrarta Dezhra? I'am not saying it is but it would make sense wrt. becoming elite etc. It might also be easier to confirm this (and rule out that is Raxxla related) than finding the start based on the into video.

Don’t think so for two reasons:
a) SD has been searched and mapped to death, but no sign of Raxxla
b) from the start video you can check the aspect angles of Rigel, Witchhead, LMC and Barnard’s Loop. SD doesn’t fit in with that final image from the video, but I was searching around 500ly out which seemed to fit in visually and is within the realms of feasibility with the lore- not too far outside the current bubble. I was looking for a twin star system, probably G or K, to fit with the non-Horizons start menu screen which I suspect is an image of Raxxla.

I did develop a healthy dislike of trying to match star patterns & identifying them on the galmap!
