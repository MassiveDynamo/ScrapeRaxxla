Hi guys
Off tomorrow on DW2, so my Raxxla Questing will be on hold for a few months, but young Tyko Rasalas (he’s actually a clone, younger and with more hair) may well continue the quest after he’s got his new AspX engineered.

IFF the start screen video is a clue (& I still suspect it is, since it’s the only thing that’s “a little bit obvious”) then it’s more complex than I originally thought. It’s definitely a composite of different viewing angles, and object distances. I followed the star patterns but couldn’t find the three around the Griffin head that seem to indicate something special......

I always get drawn to the star between the ears, like thats the target system.

They probably added/removed stars to throw us off, since the site location that was decoded from that trailer.
