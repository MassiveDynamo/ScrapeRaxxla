What’s happened to famine systems and getting datamined wake exceptions in 3.3? Trying to get a level 5 fsd and cant get above level 2 cos they’ve disappeared...

Since the BGS reset, no famine states have occurred yet (not sure bust had even come up). I think right now the best bet is to visit John Jameson's cobra, stock up on other encoded mats, then visit a material trader.
