But with FD, who knows ?

I've been musing about this too the last few days.

What is the most personal journey of all in ED? Becoming Elite. Everyone does it in a different fashion, and in a different order. Exploration first for me, then trading, then combat - and I know of plenty of others who detest(ed) exploration so left it til last, or hated the grind of raw trading back and forth so left that one too.

So yeah, my money is on getting Elite, and then getting a tip-off mission invite somewhere, or a clue off some POI or tourist beacon somewhere that eventually leads to the Dark Wheel station, which leads to a mission chain which ends at Raxxla.
