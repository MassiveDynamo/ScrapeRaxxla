Jorki means the opening video rather than the menu screen. The menu screen doesn't have anywhere near enough in it to pin down. The video, however, has Barnards Loop and Witchhead Nebula. The star we've been looking for is the yellow one in between the horns on the elite logo.

Could the star between the horns be Shinrarta Dezhra? I'am not saying it is but it would make sense wrt. becoming elite etc. It might also be easier to confirm this (and rule out that is Raxxla related) than finding the start based on the into video.
