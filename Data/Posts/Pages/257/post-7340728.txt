At the start of chapter 13 of 'And Here the Wheel' the location of a CIEP space station. Without spoiling to much the CIEP and The Dark Wheel are somewhat similar organizations. It is supposed to be vaguely near human space, and in a system which contain a red dwarf, asteroid belt, and a blue-green gas giant (which the base supposedly orbits). The book also mentions that the station is spinning such as to generate Imperial standard gravity which suggest it is likely near imperial space. This may present, in the short term, a more tractable target than the potential Dark Wheel station. (Assuming Fdev put this base/station into the game.)

If the requirements for invitation to the CIEP and TDW are similar it would suggest being combat Elite is a basic requirement.
The CEIP favor small ships like sidewinders, and Sakers (the book makes then sounds like a Taipan with an FSD).

At least one of the systems mentioned in the book "CD 32-331" does not appear to exist in game. (Start of chapter 3)

I was out in the middle of nowhere exploring, and was attacked by a pirate. Then a eagle dropped in and then high waked out just as soon as the pirate was dealt with. Following the wake, and then following the eagle until it dropped out of supercruise in the next system led to being ambushed by a wing of high ranked bounty hunters. (A wing consisting of 1 anaconda, and 2 of the alliance ships.)

Bounty hunting + Exploration + their home system having a gas giant with 8 moons made me think Dark Wheel, but I was not able to find anything interesting.

Where exactly is"out in the middle of nowhere?"
