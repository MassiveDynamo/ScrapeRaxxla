Sorry for quoting you 10 pages later, but: can i get a short briefing on this thing / the origin of the first picture?

Is it in the Rift? I've just noticed a similar one in the distance on my way from the Zurara to the edge, and i'm now trying to head to it. Are we chasing the same thing?

It's a galaxy. It can be seen from anywhere with few stars on the sky box.
