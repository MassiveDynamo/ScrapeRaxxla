I personally suspect that we need to pass some sort of test to get a TDW response. However, I'm certain that we've piqued their interest.

Edit:
The going theory is that all current TDW members are decendents of members. The main requirement being born into TDW. However, If we treat the Training Mission where you wake up to being rescued in a dead Sidewinder as being the only thing we remember about our past then things get interesting.
To paraphrase the Codex, "Conversely, some members are believed to go to great lengths to prevent their children from ever becoming involved, since the groups secrets are dangerous." Take that knowledge with our intro mission, add the fact that the drug Hexedit has been used as a way to effectively wipe memories in the past, and you get an interesting picture of who our rescuer might actually be... It's quite the generous act to rescue a ship and recruit the pilot until they can handle themselves.

Also, if we treat the Codex as an in-lore source of knowledge for pilots to view; why mention TDW or Raxxla if you're trying to hide it? Is it a red herring, recruitment tool, or have we somehow 'earned it'? Questions, questions...
