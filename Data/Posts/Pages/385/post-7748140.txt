I personally suspect that we need to pass some sort of test to get a TDW response. However, I'm certain that we've piqued their interest.

Edit:
The going theory is that all current TDW members are decendents of members. The main requirement being born into TDW. However, If we treat the Training Mission where you wake up to being rescued in a dead Sidewinder as being the only thing we remember about our past then things get interesting.
