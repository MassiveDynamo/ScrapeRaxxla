What weeds the theory out? What are you refering too? I thought the theory was the movies that came with the game that are in a sub folder that used to be the openings. Do we know where those stations are yet? That would help invalidate it.
I agree about this. Just because they changed the menu screen doesn't mean the old menu screen is any less potentially raxxla/TDW connected.

Also, just putting out ideas since I don't have as many years researching as most of you. Has anyone acquired a permit to witch's reach? Could this location be related? I feel the name might imply something. Possibly this was where they reached during a misjump through witch space, hence the clever name. Just a thought.
