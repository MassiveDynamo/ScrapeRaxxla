After a few hours and a lot of raxxla videos I've come to ask myself following question: "Why would FDev want us to find Raxxla and not leave it a Myth?" Which I am really having a hard time think of how it would progress the Elite gameplay I mean why should we find the Gateway to another universe if we haven't even discovered 1% of the milky way? Plus there are so many permit locked Systems that FDev reserved for future updates wouldn't finding the gateway to another universe destroy the sense of having those permit locked system if we just move to the next universe?
What do you guys think?
