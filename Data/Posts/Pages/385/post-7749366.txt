There is absolutely no evidence that Raxxla will provide/have/lead to a gateway to another universe. That was a line from (I think) the original Eliteâ€™s novella & I suspect that is no longer canon lore. Even then Raxxla was a myth in that novella, plenty of tall tales will have sprung up around it. FD have said on a couple of occasions that there is only one universe in ED.

It may be a moon, an alien generation ship (Thargoids and Guardians are both reputed to have had planet-sized ships), a wormhole to a different part of this universe, or even a derelict Anaconda.
The fun is in the mystery and the hunt; the finding will be disappointing.
