AndyJ gave an excellent account of the Founder/Elite missions that vanished here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-29#post-5869706

PS: Found the above post in my backup of this thread prior to the upgrade. Unfortunately many links seems broken, including those in AndyJ's post, but I'll do my best to at least fix the OP.
