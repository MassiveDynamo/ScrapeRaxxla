Just another curiosity about Jameson Memorial... I had some modules stored there and wheneve I'd try to retrieve them from a different station, it would show them located at "Levy Station" not "Jameson Memorial"

Not sure if Levy means anything...
just done a search and Levy Station only shows for Omicron Ursae Majoris (not been there so cant check the system). Have you been there? maybe a bug?
