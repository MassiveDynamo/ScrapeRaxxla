Mmm, bug or hint???
Frontier also fixed this with the new UI! Now only shows the system name where the module is located!
(Used a MacMini to load the Elite Dangerous non-Horizons game)


Edit: a positive fix is now I can see the station name in the "current location box" whilst flying in SC once closer to 1000km from any station... this approach is the very same method I use to drop in the Asteroid Cluster in Sol.
