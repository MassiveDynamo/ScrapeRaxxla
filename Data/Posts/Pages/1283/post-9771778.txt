why it crashes when the ID has nothing to point at is because the Searchbar returns something the Game did not expect and has no clue what to do.
I just dug a bit and found that ID 68 and 69 are in reverse order in "something shall not speak of here "
But it seems there is indeed something hidden in SD.
