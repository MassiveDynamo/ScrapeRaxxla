just done a search and Levy Station only shows for Omicron Ursae Majoris (not been there so cant check the system). Have you been there? maybe a bug?
I'm without my PC for the next few weeks... but store a couple of modules at Jameson Memorial, fly to another station and try to transfer them there... you shall see the these modules current location show "Levy Station" not Jameson Memorial
