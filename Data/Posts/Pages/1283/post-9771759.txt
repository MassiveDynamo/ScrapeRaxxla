Mmm, just trying to see when I got Allied with PF in Shinrarta, because I'm sure it happened quite a while before (& separately to) becoming Allied during 2020 Lockdown with "PilotsFederation" rescuing passengers from burning stations then bashing goids in Celaeno. My EDDiscovery travel history shows first entry to SD on 05June2017 but I think it was actually before then.

However just checked with EDSM and dont have any rep (actually -40.514%??) with The Pilots Federation in SD who are crossed out but EDSM shows they are
Independent Democracy Controlled systems:0 Controlled stations:0 and are not a player faction. But Shinrarta is/was their home system. If my rep with them is really so low then that could well be significant quest-wise!

Weren't PF originally in SD but then got turned into a super power in their own right? They arent showing in the Internal Status panel, which shows SD system factions as only: LTT 487 Industry & Future of Arro Naga (both Fed-aligned), then Los Chupacabras & The Dark Wheel (& interestingly the symbols of both of these look like sideways-on Griffins against a star/planet with three dots). Is this significant?

Edit:
just docked at Jameson Memorial. It's owned by Pilot's Federation Local Branch, and I'm Allied with them!! Though no system influence...
Something odd is going on!
