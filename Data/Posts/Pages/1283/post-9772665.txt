Yes, I understand these are real system names, but it’s new to me that FD renamed Sol, Shinrarta etc; how do we know those are the original names? Where do they come from?

Is this from the livestream on Generating Galaxies (not the exact title, it was a long time ago! Dr Ross??) that FD did? I dont think I ever watched that.

So this “searchbar overflow method” uses a real/former system name but subtracts a value for the bodyID to generate a value which can be found within the system map?

I feel as though I have been given insufficient information! (Tremors reference! )

Edit: ah, ninjad by Cmdr Korlod who has answered some of my questions! Thank you!!
