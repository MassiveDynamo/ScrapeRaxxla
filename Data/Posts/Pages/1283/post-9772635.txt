I must say that I dont at all understand this “searchbar overflow” mechanism. Nor why it doesnt work if you tyoe in the body name or BodyID number. And where does the Wregoe... come from?
For the Wregoe/Synuefai and all these names, they are the REAL NAMES of systems we travel between.
Fdevs renamed lot of human bubbles systems.

When you type a body name that is DIFFERENT than the renamed system, galmap searchbar won't find it!

Example 1:
Real Name = Wregoe AC-D d12-0
Renamed Name = Sol

=> When you search for "Mars" or "Earth", galmap searchbar shows it.

Example 2:
Real Name = Wregoe FP-E c25-14
Renamed Name = Shinrarta Dezhra

=> When you search for "Shinrarta Dezhra A" (main star), galmap searchbar returns "No result".
