You could wait in system, for the right inbox mission, do them and see what kind of follow missions you get. Over time you may get enough status with the faction required.
I was wondering if there are multiple cliques of PF within Shinrarta, must also check the surface bases to see if there are different cliques. Notice there is also a PF presence in a nearby system...
