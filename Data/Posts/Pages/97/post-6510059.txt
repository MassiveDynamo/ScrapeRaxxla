Anyway, another online translator comes up as Cariath wounded a horrible beast.

Cariath, seems to be a word for city, and part of the name of cities specifically biblical ones. Cariath Arba being Hebron for example.

Some speculation: Possibly it's a poetic reference to humanity becoming more civilised. Or, given the biblical slant, it may well have a bit more of a religious leaning and in that context be saying that the growth of Abrahimic cities (and the increase in followers of those religions) dealt a blow to the devil - (and translating that into historical reality it would in essence refer to the growth of some Abrahamic city states and their victories against other non-Abrahamic tribes and cities.).

Edit - Ninja'd on the translation by Bathuzad!

Very good our dear Thatchinho and if you apply that allusion of the righteous driving out the wicked to a Welsh context, what would it mean?

Correct, it means "frak the English!", as all good Welsh allusion do.
