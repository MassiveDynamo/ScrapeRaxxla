Exactly. It doesn't matter if Frontier lacks the interest in the Raxxla Quest. As the game progresses, as players come and go, as the developers stop adding new features ... Raxxla will remain until it may be the only thing that keeps a few dedicated players logging in to play. Everything, eventually, will point to Raxxla.

Ever heard of Tibia? https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/art...as-been-a-mystery-for-12-years-now-its-solved

No and glad I hadn't.

There's one sure way to find Raxxla:
1. Immortality
2. Patience
3. Honk

To the first problem the "Jaiotu Raxxla Trust".
Now it's as good as done.

Maybe call it "The Club" or something.
