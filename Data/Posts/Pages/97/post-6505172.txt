The idea of some Guardians making a last-minute gate to escape is a very romantic notion and it's something that might be very plausible. I don't think it currently fits with the uncovered text, but who knows, maybe the Constructs didn't get them all and a small group did escape via a gateway. Maybe the Constructs followed them and that's why we haven't yet (that we know of) run into the Constructs out there.

SPOILER

To support the idea there's a not-inconsiderable amount of entirely tinfoil circumstantial 'evidence' to suggest the PF might *already* be using Guardian technology, that's how they kept their edge all these years.

- It *is* remarkable how we're able to almost instantly reverse-engineer alien technologies and bolt them on to our ships and use them.
- It's amazing that Ram Tah almost instantly cracked the Guardian Language with no sort of Rosetta Stone.
- How he manged to make software to hack into alien databases.
- How we're able to activate long-dormant alien technology by just scanning it.
- How the energy produced by our SRV guns (the only ground vehicle allowed by PF members) happens to be the exact same type needed to charge the Guardian machines.
- It's a well known bit of tinfoil that the loading sequence on the ship UI is covered in what many people call "Guardian Triangles".
- It does seem possible that Ram Tah and Melville had prior knowledge of the Guardians and were both seeking something specific.

These things do many it seem almost exactly like the systems in use today by PF members is based on the same technology as the ancient relics we're finding now.

It's been said before how strange it is that the Guardians made bases thousands of lightyears Corewards but didn't make anything just few hundred lightyears spinwards (we've found nothing in or near the bubble, apparently).

Maybe early explorers *did* find a Guardian installation early on in Humanity's expansion and plundered it for technology - the genesis of TDW maybe - keeping the source of their riches secret, selling off a little bit at a time, never revealing the secret. Maybe after decades or more of research they cracked the data systems and eventually the language, or parts of it, learned of the existence of Raxxla, but not the location. Maybe they've plumbed the depths of what they can get from that tech and were unable to locate Raxxla after centuries of searching (presumably mentioned in the data archives of whatever tech they recovered) and so allowed Ram Tah to release some clues about the Guardians to the general public to essentially crowd-source a bigger search party.

Something like this would explain the near-apathy that everyone but us civilians seem to show to the Guardians. We (as a species) within the last 3 years have discovered an entirely new alien race which is strikingly similar to ourselves and uses remarkable and remarkably compatible technology to ourselves. They fought the same enemy we are and faced many of the challenged we do - yet the general response of the major powers has been "That's pretty cool, aliens huh? well...yes... carry on!". (Paraphrasing). There was nearly a civil war over Meta-Alloys, yet the powers haven't stations ships or research outposts or anything out at any of the Guardian ruins. The only sensible explanation is that they already know about the Guardians and it's non-news to them.

Don’t forget that LYR is setting up “a database of all human knowledge”, while the Powers are now developing “autonomous war machines”. Seems to me the subplot is that humanity is rushing headlong into reinventing a human equivalent ofthe Guardian AI which killed them off.......
