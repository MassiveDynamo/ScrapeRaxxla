Any theory is as good as any other, because it's not RL and everything in the game comes out of the FDevs mind and will (which has proved many times to be inconsistent).
The thing is ... Since MB and DW are out of the party, is there someone among the FDevs interested (and knowing the lore background) in continuing the Raxxla Quest at this moment ?
I doubt it.

You found Raxxla!
Congratulations on winning 1 free paintjob from the Fdev store!
I think that's still overly optimistic.

Did Jesus create the quest for the Holy Grail?

Anything other than a wild goose chase wouldn't be a true quest. We know how much people like being lead on those and finding they've been misdirected, lied too and defrauded. Perhaps fdev have learned it's best to leave those alone.

"Let them eat static".

However unlike life this is fiction so there can be a payoff, "Raxxla is in game and we know where it is". Crow bait.

Sounds a lot like the joke "I know who you are and saw what you did".
