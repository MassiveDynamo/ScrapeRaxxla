I have a Robert Holdstock question (still thinking that Raxxla might be related to Holdstock's non-Elite literature).

The dedication at the beginning of his novel Mythago Wood reads:

For Sarah
cariath ganuch
trymllyd
bwystfil

Does anyone speak Welsh? Google translate renders this as "wolf shook a horrible beast" which doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

Only the essentials - Diolch, Yaki Da, Popty Ping.

Anyway, another online translator comes up as Cariath wounded a horrible beast.

Cariath, seems to be a word for city, and part of the name of cities specifically biblical ones. Cariath Arba being Hebron for example.

Some speculation: Possibly it's a poetic reference to humanity becoming more civilised. Or, given the biblical slant, it may well have a bit more of a religious leaning and in that context be saying that the growth of Abrahimic cities (and the increase in followers of those religions) dealt a blow to the devil - (and translating that into historical reality it would in essence refer to the growth of some Abrahamic city states and their victories against other non-Abrahamic tribes and cities.).

Edit - Ninja'd on the translation by Bathuzad!
