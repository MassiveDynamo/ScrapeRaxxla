No and glad I hadn't.

There's one sure way to find Raxxla:
1. Immortality
2. Patience
3. Honk

To the first problem the "Jaiotu Raxxla Trust".
Now it's as good as done.

Maybe call it "The Club" or something.

To find an exact place in time of a 5+ -dimensional reality, you not only have to find linear coordinates, but you must traverse a maze of alternate realities. In a very specific order and in a very specific way.
For a specific acceleration: Knowing when to turn, how much for how long. (Knowing how much to nerf and when to boost)
The actual path defines the reality we end up in.

"Brilliance is when Raxxla is never ever found, but always sought, with plenty of clues that lead them on.... to something... and nothing.
It is the path to wherever it leads, that is what we seek. Not the actual end or the goal.
The road is better remembered than the final act or destination.
There is no destination, only a road of opportunity." - me

So... when it is good, we are Raxxling (or in a state of Raxxla). Raxxla is a way of life. (Some may think of it as the optimal way of life, or the optimal path, but it is(will become) rather The Road (The Never ending Quest)

Analogue to: Holy Grail, Shangri-La, El-Dorado etc... just out of reach, but you are (striving to get) always closer.

And... wait for it......

I spent a long, long, long time searching for Raxxla in both Elite and Elite Plus. Finding it in Elite: Dangerous may be just as impossible ... but I'll keep looking. Holdstock capture my imagination with it in The Dark Wheel. No reason to not follow that imagination.
