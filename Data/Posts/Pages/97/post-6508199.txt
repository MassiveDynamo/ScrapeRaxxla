I have a Robert Holdstock question (still thinking that Raxxla might be related to Holdstock's non-Elite literature).

The dedication at the beginning of his novel Mythago Wood reads:

For Sarah
cariath ganuch
trymllyd
bwystfil

Does anyone speak Welsh? Google translate renders this as "wolf shook a horrible beast" which doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
