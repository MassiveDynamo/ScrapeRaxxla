Iâ€™ve tried to jump through a bunch of black holes. Many different directions and alignments.
Tried it with most alien objects onboard, as well. Nothing has special has ever happened.

I which there was some way to mess with hyper jumps, but I doubt there is.
Well if we find one, I've got a hyperspace route that goes through Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3 waiting to go.

And there'll be ones for Polaris and lots of other places as well.

Which leads me to strongly suspect that we're not going to get misjumps anytime soon, if at all.
