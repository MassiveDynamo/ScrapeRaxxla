has anyone tried targeting a star system from a system that has a black hole and then kind of trying to jump through the black hole with the frame shift drive?

Edit:
I'm in a system with a few black holes now, I'll just try this out myself and hope for a bottle of Scotch

Well, if you’re in the region of NGC 7822 you could try Altera’s Eye. There is suspiciously heavy npc traffic visiting, there’s a tourist ferry there & lots of other npcs. I’ve had a thought at the back of my mind since my recent visit that maybe I should have tried some experiments since it’s about halfway between Heart Neb & 1C1805 cluster (Mel15)- see earlier post https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-7888079
But I wouldn’t do it with a large amount of scan data. You might want to dock in Gorgon research base & sell it before experimenting with black holes. Seem to remember you get heat damage nowadays if you enter one (at least Sag A*), though I remember exploring inside one about 2 years ago without mishap.

Edit: my recent experience wasn’t related to a time travel gate. Made the 45 jumps & sold my data to NTDW in Shinrarta. Now Allied, but no messages about any station. See Macros sold discovery data before me !
In Jameson, thinking about buying a phantom. Must check DW missions.
