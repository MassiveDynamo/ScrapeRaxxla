has anyone tried targeting a star system from a system that has a black hole and then kind of trying to jump through the black hole with the frame shift drive?
wow. now that's an idea. if it has'nt been tried before, it's worth a try. i doubt the system would be targetable like when behind planets. but a black hole is not a planet, so maybe...

Didnt we have it from Fdev that misjumps are not in ED?
would'nt you say the same thing, if you hid something behind a door, and someone asked you, can that door be opened? also what defines what a missjump is. is it a missjump, if it actually works and leads somewhere? just thoughts.

Also, not trying to discourage or discredit the witchspace idea, just pointing out that there's certainly been a lot of effort there so that you can better inform your own investigation.
no worries, i think that the hyperdiction system is way well made, for it to be only used in 1 case, with the thargoids. there must be other use cases.
also nice catch on the ludens pic. i cant wait to play either. big hideo kojima fan.
