There's actually been quite a bit of witchspace investigation, especially right after the most recent patch on may 14. (There was a short lived bug where you could see planets in witchspace.) Many others here were linking the spinning effect in witchspace to "spiralling stars" around the same time. Tons of others on here have done an insane amount of things to force misjumps, usually informed by the Starship One jump anomaly. Im sorry, dont feel like linking all the posts here, but i bet a quick hit on that search bar up top will show you past hyperspace experiments.

Edit: nice ludens picture, can't wait to play DS
Also, not trying to discourage or discredit the witchspace idea, just pointing out that there's certainly been a lot of effort there so that you can better inform your own investigation.
