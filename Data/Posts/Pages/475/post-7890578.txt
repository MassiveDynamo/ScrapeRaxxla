wich we cant directly see. but we can see it's projected shadow somewhere, or it's indirect effects on something else.
This by itself sounds like a black hole. That's my opinion, from the lesser educated making this the ' what seems obvious to a layman' perspective.

Not necessarily suggesting that that's the answer. Just if they think that they made it obvious maybe we shouldn't overthink it too harshly. Using advanced mathematics and like light Shadow measuring tools aren't the type of thing that people find an obvious answer with. Just speculating, as I stated before you guys are a lot more experienced in this field. I'm just throwing my two cents in
