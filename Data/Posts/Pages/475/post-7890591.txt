This by itself sounds like a black hole. That's my opinion, from the lesser educated making this the ' what seems obvious to a layman' perspective.

Not necessarily suggesting that that's the answer. Just if they think that they made it obvious maybe we shouldn't overthink it too harshly. Using advanced mathematics and like light Shadow measuring tools aren't the type of thing that people find an obvious answer with. Just speculating, as I stated before you guys are a lot more experienced in this field. I'm just throwing my two cents in

I agree: when looking at the image of a rotating tesseract, the thing in ED that it most reminds me of is the gravitational lensing effect of a black hole.
I'm also not suggesting that a black hole is, or is the gateway to, Raxxla. It might be that Raxxla distorts the skybox in the same way, which could enable it to be seen regardless of whether it appears in a FSS scan, i.e. it might be a POI that only shows up within a certain range. (Made a little bit obvious by the lensing effect!)
