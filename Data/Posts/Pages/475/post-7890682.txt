has anyone tried targeting a star system from a system that has a black hole and then kind of trying to jump through the black hole with the frame shift drive?

Edit:
I'm in a system with a few black holes now, I'll just try this out myself and hope for a bottle of Scotch
Iâ€™ve tried to jump through a bunch of black holes. Many different directions and alignments.
Tried it with most alien objects onboard, as well. Nothing has special has ever happened.

I which there was some way to mess with hyper jumps, but I doubt there is.
