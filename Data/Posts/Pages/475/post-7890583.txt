In the same way a circle is a projection of a sphere from 3d to 2d, so a tesseract is the 3d projection of a 4d cube - a cube being the definition of a connected space where all points connected are at 'right angle' to each other and 'sides' of equal length. The animation often presented is of a 4d cube stereographically projected onto 3d space, whilst being rotated in one of the visible dimensions (i.e. it only appears to change because its being rotated). Its also capable of translation like any other object, but it's shape would only change in the 3d projection if it was rotated or if it was translated in the invisible direction, thus changing the projection.
I believe that strictly speaking, Tesseract's a name for the 4 dimensional equivalent of a 3 dimensional Cube, rather than being a name specific to the projection.

For a shape with edges of equal length, and angles between edges of 90 degrees:

2D - Square
3D - Cube
4D - Tesseract, 4-Cube or 4D Hypercube (plus some less common names)
5D - Penteract, 5-Cube or 5D Hypercube (plus some less common names).
Etc.
