Just popping in from hols.

I have no idea if Fdev are planning anything I'm afraid, there's been no new lore or narrative for quite some time. Alessia Verdi is a character associated with previous lore who escaped the destruction associated with Salom√©'s demise 3 years ago and is still alive in3306. She's the daughter of Luko Prestio Giovanni, who was a member of the bona fide "Dark Wheel" before his death in 3303. Her endorsement of this effort should be seen as an encouragement to keep going with your attempt to grab the attention of the powers that be... both in-game and out of it.

Right on, Commanders.

Cheers,

Drew.

So confirmed as RP....for now.

However, dissecting some of it - AV is the daughter of LPG who was member of bona fide DW - Drew was allowed to play around with DW (but not Raxxla), so this can be taken as lore (until it gets retconned) It may be construed that the implication is that Shin Dez DW is the bona fide DW, or why would it matter? It can be argued the opposite that real DW will pay attention once fake DW gets too much attention and system control....also the use of 'bona fide' implies there is at least one fake, something which has been speculated on but this could lean towards confirming it.
