Whats the advice for travellers? KGBFOAM, so hide it in a LYT binary with A secondary, not sure where CRANE comes in yet though

A secondary when LYT is main ?
L0 may contain something like L1 another then no more mass in system. Or L3+ and couple small bodies.
Initial mass was fixed known value. Then this mass created system. And stars are related. For example best way to find ice rings is to check M0 without any other star and with "B" index in name, that basically guarantee giants. Or L0 with less chances but planets will be close.
