The closest I have found matching direct coordinates, are Greek numbers.

RA, X, XLA = Rho Alpha, Chi, Chi Lambda Alpha = 101, 600, 631

Never found anything at any of the +- options that gives.

I have a more positive vibe for the Right ascension = 20(Roman XX). Not sure how the LA fits, though.

LA? They’ll make a movie of the Quest,
when we find it

Want to choose your actor? I think you’ll be played by Mads Michelson, or Stellan Skarsgard
Ninja Penguin would have to be Jet Li
Me? - Bruce Willis, he’s already got the hairstyle!
Simulacrae, given his current pursuits, would have to be Michael Caine
