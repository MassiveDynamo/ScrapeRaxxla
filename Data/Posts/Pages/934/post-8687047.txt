Some game mechanics have a habit of repeating things to make it easier on the memory. Obvious example is GTA where you see the same type of vehicle you are driving filling the roads (be it car, van, bus or truck). Seems a bit extreme for flavour text but its a possibility.

or It could be that you have found the perfect conditions for this RNG item to appear more than other RNG items hence once you find one more are in the same area.

Could be purely RNG, but given our dedication to tinfoilry and the description of the item? Doesn't hurt to be a superstitious pilot and carry one on all your adventures....that is, as long as you don't mind occasional interdictions lol. I rock a combat explorer build, so no sweat off my back.
