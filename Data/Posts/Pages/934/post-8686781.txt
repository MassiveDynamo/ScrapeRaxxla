The only reason I ask is becuse I feel like I find more Trinkets when I have them.

Some game mechanics have a habit of repeating things to make it easier on the memory. Obvious example is GTA where you see the same type of vehicle you are driving filling the roads (be it car, van, bus or truck). Seems a bit extreme for flavour text but its a possibility.

or It could be that you have found the perfect conditions for this RNG item to appear more than other RNG items hence once you find one more are in the same area.
