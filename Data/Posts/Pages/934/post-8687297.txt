I've just been reviewing material / codex / stuff after my break, and noticed this line from the Raxxla Codex entry:
"Undaunted, some Raxxla seekers insisted that the story's author had cunningly concealed facts about the mysterious locale in his book as hints for those with eyes to see. "

And just happened to re-read the 'The Dark Wheel' novella that is linked by Macros on the first post, and 'Eye among the Blind' caught my eye (no pun intended).



Has anyone read this book, or investigated if there is anything that might be concealed to help us in this book? I know the line is more likely a comment about 'Princess Astrophel and Spiralling Stars' but perhaps those with eyes to see look elsewhere too?
