If the name "RAXXLA" is/are co-ordinates then to me at least the destination probably wouldn't be named "RAXXLA" but something else entirely. On the other hand though "RAXXLA" may have been named from the co-ordinates when it was first established. But why name it after co-ordinates in the first place.

This is probably nothing but I put "RAXXLA" into google translate and the only translation was Maltese for "RASH" or more specifically "RAXX LA" = "THE RASH"

Well it certainly causes an itch that needs scratching all the time and can't be ignored or forgotten.

Sorry, I meant who has discussed this topic already and where ? OP is suggesting this in his post.

Theres bits all over this thread, it comes up every now and again, sometimes with a new angle. Could try searching this thread for 'co-ordinates' or 'ascension' maybe? Otherwise just settle in for a long read from P1
