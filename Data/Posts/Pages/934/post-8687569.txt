Probably stupid idea, but we are brainstorming so... In the "Leviathan wakes", sci-fi novel by James Corey, "Star Helix" security service is searching for Juliette Andromeda Mao, which is sometimes called "princess".
There aren't really any stupid ideas in the search for Raxxla. The only stupid here, is to be sure.

Princess Juliette Andromeda Mao? I see a lover(with woe), spiralling stars / galaxy and a tyrant in the name alone. Star Helix is literally spiralling stars, so that one is all good.

Personally I like the "Leviathan wakes". Hypespacing space whales are the best.
