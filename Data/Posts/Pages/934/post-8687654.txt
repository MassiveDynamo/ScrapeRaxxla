Want to choose your actor? I think you’ll be played by Mads Michelson, or Stellan Skarsgard
Ninja Penguin would have to be Jet Li
Me? - Bruce Willis, he’s already got the hairstyle!
Simulacrae, given his current pursuits, would have to be Michael Caine

Mads Mikkelsen is way to pretty has has to nice hair. Stellan is a bit to old, even for me.

I think I would have to say Woody Harrelson, If we're going by looks alone.

Colours, hair and beard are spot on and even the crocked nose is there.
SPOILER

If he lost a few pounds and the confident attitude, he could play me. Talent isn't requirement. I'm pretty basic.
