If the name "RAXXLA" is/are co-ordinates then to me at least the destination probably wouldn't be named "RAXXLA" but something else entirely. On the other hand though "RAXXLA" may have been named from the co-ordinates when it was first established. But why name it after co-ordinates in the first place.

This is probably nothing but I put "RAXXLA" into google translate and the only translation was Maltese for "RASH" or more specifically "RAXX LA" = "THE RASH"
