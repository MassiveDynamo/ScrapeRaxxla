There aren't really any stupid ideas in the search for Raxxla. The only stupid here, is to be sure.

Princess Juliette Andromeda Mao? I see a lover(with woe), spiralling stars / galaxy and a tyrant in the name alone. Star Helix is literally spiralling stars, so that one is all good.

Personally I like the "Leviathan wakes". Hypespacing space whales are the best.
Yes, and even more, in the James Corey's book they find an allien artifact in space (the ring) that opens gateway to the distant parts of the galaxy.

And the Codex says that in that "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" book "Raxxla holds an alien artefact called the Omphalos Rift, which acts as a gateway to parallel universes".
