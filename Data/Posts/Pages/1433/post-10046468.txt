A secondary John Milton universe around Delphi?

Just extrapolating on a historical ramble, I wonder….my rabbit hole into Milton may / may not explain the archeological PF/DW missions link to the celestial spheres… but it never felt right, due to an absence of any link to Lovecraft…(Brookes favourite).

The alignment of Delphi to the Pleiades cannot be underestimated, it may be a discarded narrative, source material from Brookes. But what if it’s not?

McBurney's point is such a weird coincidence…2/3rds from the navel!

‘’. J Milton - Paradise Lost (the distance of heaven from Eden).

Currently on a slow journey northwards in a stock Cobra, then onto Delphi for more of the same. I may update this thread with some map projections.

Post in thread 'The Quest To Find Raxxla'



*McBurney's point system, up through Delphi system

On second thoughts; the distance does look somewhat preposterous; but with nothing else better to do in game…
