Doubt, my dears, is the scourge of real magic. To reclaim your power, you have let your heart lead the way. This is why it doesn't work if you have doubts. Einstein said it best:

"The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift."

You never needed a stargate (which may yet still exist), a mythical station (though plenty of those do exist), you needed a reminder of what you possess already.

I still suspect this trail ultimately leads back to Guardians as the Pilots' Federation has ready and immediate access to their sites and technology. I believe we have a reasonably accurate understanding that the Engineers work directly for The Dark Wheel and by extension Jaques (who seems to be Brenquith and potentially several others - perhaps the clone angle is very much still in play). When I back from a trip to the Temple region (looking for a new home or at least adventure), I intend to try to unlock Lave 2 and Diso 5c since we apparently have the keys that locked them in the first place since we and the Engineers are The Dark Wheel along with Robert Garry and CIEP. I am a good portion of way towards cracking Lave 2. Diso 5c will take a bit of poking around to find its' weakness. Also, yes I am quite aware of the personal narrative component. We wouldn't have the Jaradharre Puzzle Box (it is a rare good):

This entertainment device uses concentrated radiation bursts to detect the desires of the player and automatically creates a game with every feature they could desire. Each unit is unique, and will self customise to represent its owner. Use of another person's puzzle box is considered a great social faux pas.

This rare good is legal in all systems except for Dictatorship systems and Imperial Confederacy systems.
