Merry Yuletide. We celebrated Yule yesterday (24th), we the nordics are a bit strange like that. I guess it's because of our blot rituals back in the days.
And a Merry Christmas to all you 'non bloters'.

Not strange at all mate, there are many of us who still follow the old gods over here in England, ive had a great Solstice, Nameless Day and Yule.
This time of year has always been special.

Happy Yule
To Raxxla!
