The Elite logo took a while to get right. The inspiration was a mix of pilot's wings and logo. The Griffin thing was Philip Castle's idea."

It was from one of the early IAMAs on Reddit with David Braben. More info here on the storied logo: https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_logo
Its not dissimilar to the early RAF wings, British forces have many regiments that used different birds as a logo backdrop.
It also has that flame style from the original SAS cap badge which had a dark 'Cambridge' blue shield (which im sure is a coincidence).
Either way it does look like a military style bold insignia.
