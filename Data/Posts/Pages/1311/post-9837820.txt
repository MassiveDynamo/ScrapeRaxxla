Hey guys! Not sure if something happened before: few days ago I've visited HIP 22460, FORT ASCH - there is a data point, I've scanned it and a mission for black box taking and delivering appeared: Y VELORUM system where to pick them and SOSONG - delivery point system (right when there was a AX CG).
I might overreacting but could it be a new "founders missions" type? // installation type is a new one, Odyssey like
Attaching screens:

Except weird npc-hunter - nothing happened after. By weirdness: there were no cargo, no bounty or notoriety or fines. Though npc followed me after mission completion, since I was in AX ship - he managed to wake out
Was a busy day but it reminded me a books a bit.
