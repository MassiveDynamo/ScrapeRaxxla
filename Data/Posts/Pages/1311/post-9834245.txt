I agree, FD has unintentionally seeded the franchise with doubts, this has been due to poor communication.

Upon reflection it’s possible FD initially focussed the in game narrative around these missions, believing that much like in previous games players would read the news and figure things out.

Many didn’t.

Some of us, myself included, had their own priorities. Mine was to take my backers perks and just set off and explore.

Yup, same pretty much. But the design mistake they made was not realizing people would do that (and get all the permits before they had a chance to put the planned content in, or find late-game planned permit sectors, etc. etc.). And I suspect (but have no proof) that something along these lines is what pooched the Raxxla missions and made them irrecoverable without major time and investment (and/or they realized how quickly those missions might lead to finding Raxxla, and that that would be a Bad Thing(TM) for the game and narrative.)

But yeah, they have definitely sucked at communications. I personally liked the news and finding hints that way and the like, and was very sad to see it (and the player-contributed news also) go away. That was pretty much when I stopped playing, other than my brief comeback for the launch of the latest mess.

Ah well, I'm sure they'll sort it out, it's only been what, ten years now and they haven't?
