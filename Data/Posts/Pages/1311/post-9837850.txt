Good thought on the toast being from the view of the system itself... not considered that before....

"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!"

But how do you work in the other words... the Jewel is on the brow of "the mother of galaxies" and how is the "whisperer in witchspace" if it's a white dwarf?
Sol the mother of Humanity "some places reference sol as the mother of creation therefor for galaxy's, you could say that Lawd is on the brow of sol if viewed in a certain way maybe "whisperer in witchspace" a jump needed from Lawd to somewhere through witchspace to meet such whisperer

Or Lawd is the jewel, witchs reach the whisperer, sol the mother, the other 3 would make the 6 outer portains of the symbol, then in the middle would be raxxla
