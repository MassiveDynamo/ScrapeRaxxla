Ive commented in the past that LAWD 26 is a big anomaly. The secondary star is a Wolf-Rayet star only 22.5 ly from Sol & so would outshine the sun. But it only just struck me yesterday that could therefore be the Jewel, and the primary is a White Dwarf, so could that be the Whisperer?
I’ve had a look at B1 (100% metal, so would be a good candidate for a Guardian arkship), I’ve looked in the ring of A1, I’ve docked in the station, and I’ve got so near to the WD that I dropped out of SC. No sign of anything that might be an omphalos or Raxxla. I fsd boosted in the relativistic jet, but only got 92ly range, so couldn't get to Andromeda, or Colonia....sigh!
Good thought on the toast being from the view of the system itself... not considered that before....

"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!"

But how do you work in the other words... the Jewel is on the brow of "the mother of galaxies" and how is the "whisperer in witchspace" if it's a white dwarf?
