Ive commented in the past that LAWD 26 is a big anomaly. The secondary star is a Wolf-Rayet star only 22.5 ly from Sol & so would outshine the sun. But it only just struck me yesterday that could therefore be the Jewel, and the primary is a White Dwarf, so could that be the Whisperer?
I’ve had a look at B1 (100% metal, so would be a good candidate for a Guardian arkship), I’ve looked in the ring of A1, I’ve docked in the station, and I’ve got so near to the WD that I dropped out of SC. No sign of anything that might be an omphalos or Raxxla. I fsd boosted in the relativistic jet, but only got 92ly range, so couldn't get to Andromeda, or Colonia....sigh!
