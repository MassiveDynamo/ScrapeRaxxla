I agree, FD has unintentionally seeded the franchise with doubts, this has been due to poor communication.

Upon reflection it’s possible FD initially focussed the in game narrative around these missions, believing that much like in previous games players would read the news and figure things out.

Many didn’t.

Some of us, myself included, had their own priorities. Mine was to take my backers perks and just set off and explore. I was not interested in missions, credits nor trading. And on my travels it was pretty clear early on many had the same idea.

If FD got it wrong, it was not because they failed to understand player behaviour, it was because they failed to communicate what actually was in game, and what players ought to be doing to find it.

In ED there is no endgame, you blaze your own trail… however FD continue to fail at communicating if said trail means anything… from all evidence it looks to many that it dose not, hence people focus on grind and materialism, exploiting game loops and quirks to accumulate billions fast, whilst the majority of missions pay peanuts.

If FD want you to find these things they have to continue to iterate such mysteries are out there and there are mechanisms to show you the way…. and I’m not talking about their narrative.

However it's a double edge sword, because being a multiplayer game, this would mean many mysteries would get found incredibly fast… so it's likely that they intentional leave them in situ, and don’t talk about them because possibly like Raxxla there never were any mechanisms and stuff is just ‘out there’ waiting for us to find, eventually.

I always look back at LAWD26 as an example, what was that all about…again I read it, but could not be bothered to engage as I had my own priorities at that time.
