Sol the mother of Humanity "some places reference sol as the mother of creation therefor for galaxy's, you could say that Lawd is on the brow of sol if viewed in a certain way maybe "whisperer in witchspace" a jump needed from Lawd to somewhere through witchspace to meet such whisperer

Or Lawd is the jewel, witchs reach the whisperer, sol the mother, the other 3 would make the 6 outer portains of the symbol, then in the middle would be raxxla
You only need 3 to triangulate. And possibly find the circle. Circles are just a point with 6 even points around it made up of triangles, but with straight lines. Not sure how to translate that into 3d or 4d though.
