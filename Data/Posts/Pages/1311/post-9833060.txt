I agree, FD has unintentionally seeded the franchise with doubts, this has been due to poor communication.

Upon reflection it’s possible FD initially focussed the in game narrative around these missions, believing that much like E1, E2 and E3 players would read the news and figure things out.

Many didn’t.

Some of us, myself included, had their own priorities. Mine was to take my bakers perks and just set off and explore. I was not interested in missions, credits nor trading. And on my travels it was pretty clear early on many had the same idea.

If FD got it wrong, it was not because they failed to understand player behaviour, it was because they failed to communicate what actually was in game, and what players ought to be doing to find it.

In ED there is no endgame, you blaze your own trail… however FD continue to fail at communicating if said trail means anything… from all evidence it looks to many that it dose not, hence people focus on grind and materialism.

If FD want you to find these things they have to continue to iterate such mysteries are out there and there are mechanisms to show you the way…. and I’m not taking about their narrative.

However being a multiplayer, this would mean many would get found incredibly fast… so they leave them in situ for us to find eventually.

I always look back at LAWD26 as an example, what was that all about…again I read it, but could not be bothered to engage as I had my own priorities at that time.

Personally, I don't remember the news in E1.
I'm wondering with the last CG against the Thargoids, people fought a lot for the Federation and raised the bar. And if they do not complete to the end, even for the Federation?
