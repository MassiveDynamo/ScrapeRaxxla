I got triple Elite tonight finally. Pilot's federation gifted me special sign to draw on ship.
So new theory - DW will contact you if ship has this decal when you dock to somewhere
Congratulations!
But needing triple elite is not a new theory, nor is docking at a specific station to get the TDW invitation.
