Conversion in Achenar always struck me as a possible Guardian world thus implying the Mudlarks were potential escapees of the Great Annihilation that turned back to naturalistic living to avoid an angered Guardian AI. Gravity there is 0.90G and was 0.64 Earth masses. Temperature is 317K which is slightly warmer than Earth and surface pressure was 0.89 atmospheres (1 is Earth "normal" at sea level).
Not only that you got speed distance between maybe Sol to Achenar, It took the Feds a whole year to get to Achenar as it stated from start in 2323 and arrived at the start of 2324
