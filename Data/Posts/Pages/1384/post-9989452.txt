I like it and it is really well put together but I am required to disclose this because the following facts have proven endlessly frustrating in determining the range at which Raxxla must been from Sol in light of colonization and/or hyperspace technology:

Per GalNet "Galactic News: Generation Ships" departs in 2097. This is the first generation ship. It is importantly the Mayflower 97. Per "Birth of an Empire" the majority of the convoy reaches Achenar in the middle of the 23rd Century (approximately 2250). It is notable that unlike what the Codex states, Marlin Duval may not have completed the journey as the moons Duval's Grave and Lawrence's Grave exist in Capella. Mayflower 97 is notable for having stopped in Tau Ceti per First Encounters but has never been located. Tau Ceti is 11.94 LY from Sol. Capella is 42.83 LY from Sol. Achenar is 139.45 LY from Sol.

Then we have the beacon in Delta Pavonis (19.93 LY from Sol) that places era of rapid expansion starting at 2230.

Arcturus is settled in 2304 per system description and is 36.71 LY from Sol.

Indeed! I've just read more of the Tourist beacons and realised I made a mistake by not including some info that seems to suggest heavily that in 2161 Earth sent a delegation to Tau Ceti that arrived in less than a year, returned to Earth, then sent a second delegation that arrived in 2163. So... FTL both cheap, relatively quick and easy then. Makes most of my prior post totally wrong

Data taken from Tourist Spot 0169: "Taylor was elected civilian administrator in 2161 ... In response and at the behest of the mission's corporate backers, Earth sent a delegation to Tau Ceti 3 to scrutinise its practices. What they found was widespread active destruction of the planet's native ecosystem ... recommended a second mission be sent in twelve months to judge if any improvements had been made. When this arrived in 2163 ..."

That means that the later info I used about the Federal fleet must have actually meant that they procrastinated for 11 years before dispatching the fleet, which to be fair does sound very realistic
