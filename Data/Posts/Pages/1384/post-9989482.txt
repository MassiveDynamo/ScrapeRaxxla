Though, I do have something close by Sol that would be worthy of a second glance - LAWD 26 (the Bubble's only Wolf-Rayet). Need to validate what phase it would have been in a few million years ago. Guardian stars are a special type of star that can cycle in and out of main sequence several times before dying called asymptotic giant branch stars. It is less than 24 LY away. In case you haven't gathered, Sol's neighborhood is actually very weird compared to the rest galaxy in astronomical terms.
