There are reputation locked progression missions even in Independent or Alliance factions and systems. Rank is more a function of proven skills. Also, in most cases you can take higher difficulty/dangerous missions than your official rank (unless it is explicitly locked to a proven skill level). Mission locks are more often stuff such as cargo space, suit types, passenger cabins, etc.
