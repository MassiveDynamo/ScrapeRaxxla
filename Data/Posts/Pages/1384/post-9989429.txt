Very interesting!

I've no idea of the utility of pointing us to Delphi via (potentially) two different paths, if we're just supposed to go back to the bubble with no real idea where or why??

As an alternate idea: Maybe the Pleiades Delphi is a deliberate misdirection? Essentially, doesn't help you with Raxxla but drops you into the Thargoids for your trouble!

I mean, this is dumb given the context of Elite Dangerous, but there's obviously a Delphi on Earth, and Yggdrasil is an Earth based myth. If the Raxxla logo does contain the symbol for Sol (a circle with a dot could be almost anything ofc so I'm not sold on that) then... I mean... why not assume that all this stuff is pointing at Sol? That does link pretty neatly with your axis mundi idea doesn't it? and @CMDRCorrMorningstarFelian pointed out that the Gamap 'axis mundi' is Sol , of course.

I suppose, given the nature of Elite, a myth from Sol would be as exotic to most people as a myth about deep space portals is to us. I assume Sol in 2296 would be something like The Expanse just before the gate opened, densely packed with ships zooming around all over the place and settlements all over the place.

Haven't been to Sol for a long time, might be worth a trip
