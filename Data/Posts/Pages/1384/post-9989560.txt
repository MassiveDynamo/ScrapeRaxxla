Lawd 26 is an interesting one. Iâ€™ve asked the CMs about it before but it never really went anywhere. The question IMHO is whether the history of ED was written with Lawd 26 B existing as it does in game, or whether it was written with the real life galaxy in mind.
It was supposed to be the White Dwarf below, something got screwed and we got a Wolf instead, id say a few digits or details where inputted wrong and the stellar forge created what the white dwarf was before it went nova
