Conversion in Achenar always struck me as a possible Guardian world thus implying the Mudlarks were potential escapees of the Great Annihilation that turned back to naturalistic living to avoid an angered Guardian AI. Gravity there is 0.90G and was 0.64 Earth masses. Temperature is 317K which is slightly warmer than Earth and surface pressure was 0.89 atmospheres (1 is Earth "normal" at sea level).
