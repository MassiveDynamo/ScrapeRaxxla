Not only that you got speed distance between maybe Sol to Achenar, It took the Feds a whole year to get to Achenar as it stated from start in 2323 and arrived at the start of 2324
There is even more details in "Logistical Nightmare" beacon in Beta Hydri of the trip to Achenar and the results upon arrival. Weirdly mentioned is Federal hunting pack maneuver being weaponized against the Federation due to an intelligence leak that occurred.
