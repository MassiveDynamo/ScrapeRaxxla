All I do recall was the Codex was inserted, literally a few days later players found the Delphi system. Maybe that’s just through playing, and they happened upon it, but I’m aware some players read data logs when a patch is released. Just seems plausible it was uncovered by those ‘watching’.
Delphi was just an existing system that was renamed in a patch. It was already well known prior to that.
