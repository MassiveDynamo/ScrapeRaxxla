It was supposed to be the White Dwarf below, something got screwed and we got a Wolf instead, id say a few digits or details where inputted wrong and the stellar forge created what the white dwarf was before it went nova

Is that speculation or was something actually said about it by FD? The White Dwarf is there, it’s Lawd 26 A, so there wouldn’t appear to be any issues with that itself. The WR just appears to be extra.
