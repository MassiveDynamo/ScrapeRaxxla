I've recently realised that this thread's title is exactly what it's about. I had assumed that the quest for Raxxla was about finding Raxxla, but after years of reading and participating on this thread I'm pretty sure this thread is about the Quest, and continuing the Quest, rather than actually about finding Raxxla and solving the mystery.

I'm not having a go, or saying that the many of you who post here regularly or occasionally are in any way wrong for wanting the Quest to continue indefiintely, just that it's not what I had been assuming.

Have fun in your Questing

Not sure anyone providing input here is not trying to find Raxxla...? But conclusively knowing what it is, is the hardest part?

Unless of course it's actually a MacGuffin
