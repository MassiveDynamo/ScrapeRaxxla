O7 all, been a LONG time since I’ve posted here or even been in game. Like, just prior to Odyssey long time.
Anywho, back when this all started Brooks was quite heavily involved in the story aspect of the game and he was privy to Raxxla. It’s been gone over a billion times I know but he was a really big Lovecraft fan. I haven’t read it in great detail as of yet, more of a quick skim through, but there is “the whisperer in darkness” by lovecraft. Basically a story about a guy who didn’t believe in aliens but was coaxed into meeting with a guy who claimed to have proof there really were aliens. In meeting with him he finds out he plans on meeting with the aliens by letting them keep his brain alive in a jar and taking him out to their meeting place around Pluto. There was already one such brain in a jar in the guys house that could talk to him via an attached speaker, but sounded buzzy and whisper like. He tries to convince the main character to join him in this quest. Going back to meet the guy he finds out that it was an alien disguised as the guy and the brain in the jar was the guy he thought he was meeting.
Anywho, I have to wonder if the whisperer in witchspace is any relation to the story and if perhaps there might be some random encounter or audio to be found around Pluto or Charon etc. could be worse than that I suppose, could be any of the minor planets or Persephone for that matter.
Also, wonder if there is any item to take along as an analogue of the jar.
