I think MB's back tattoo hints at the Quest for Raxxla, depicting travel past various myths, gods, angels, Miltonian cosmology & Lovecraftian monsters, Yggdrasil etc etc. I now don't think it offers direct clues, just flavour...ending up at the gates to Paradise.

I'm wondering, since he spent so much effort inserting Paradise Lost's Miltonian cosmology into the ED galaxy, whether we should take another look at the sequel Paradise Regained to find our way back to Paradise/Raxxla.

Totally agree, the tattoo which is an abstract cover for his ‘unpublished’ story, I believe he actually wrote directly into the game… likely under the nose of FD.

Paradise Regained; it’s not an improbable proposal, but as a book I seem to recall it is rather a separate work, it’s more focused upon the temptation of Christ, it’s far removed from the fall; Satan is far less of an independent anti-hero, more of an atypical villain, and the first works focus on spatial orientation isn’t prominent, it being far more ‘Earth’ bound, I seem to recall?

I could be wrong, I was initially biased about Paradise Lost prior to this Quest, due to having it thrown at us (literally) at school, so likewise there could be some insight there.. And Brooke’s was I understand a lapse Catholic… ironic considering how anti-catholic Milton and his texts were…
