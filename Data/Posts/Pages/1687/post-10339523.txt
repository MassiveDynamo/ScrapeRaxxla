I've given you a like for that but there is something missing-can you show the logo with your annotation of your interpretation? I don't see any tree in it

I agree it is probably not a map (we've tried that hypothesis in various ways) but is therefore likely the destination of this treasure hunt. To me it represents a dodecahedral station....I suspect those were originally modelled on a Guardian ark ship that was discovered early in space flight history but kept hidden. I think that's named RAXXLA. The codex says it's been circulating (i.e. orbiting) for centuries
