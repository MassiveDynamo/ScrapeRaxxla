Yes an odd coincidence? One has to ask where is art imitating life or life imitating art here, how much of this is just a harmonious accident of likeminded persons building something subconsciously; totally random; or FD cherry picking.?
IMHO unlikely to be a coincidence -rule 39!! (https://www.google.com/url?q=https:...QQFnoECAkQAw&usg=AOvVaw28KLvWHY3Ur0Qb3HeYnwgZ)

It could well explain the early secrecy over the derivation of the Shin Dez name, and perhaps why my post on it was deleted, and MB's Dev Diary 1 at 10:22 where he said that FD might start to release more info on the Mars alien artefact....something which never seems to have happened!! ... it's all part & parcel of the Raxxla mystery. I suspect FD Commercial Dept (minor faction aka The Club! ) decided complete silence on anything related to Raxxla was a very good marketing ploy! (& perhaps the underlying reason why MB moved jobs)
