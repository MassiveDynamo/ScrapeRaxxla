Yep, to understand the spatial relationships of your Milton Cosmology theory (& other uses, e.g. marking different exploration features etc) it would be really helpful to be able to assign user-selectable different coloured bookmarks! Never understood why they didn't implement that- a vid where they said they wanted to make it hard to use??? Pah!
