Not sure anyone providing input here is not trying to find Raxxla...? But conclusively knowing what it is, is the hardest part?

Unless of course it's actually a MacGuffin
No no no!
MacGuffins come from a little glen in darkest Scotland, anything related to Raxxla originated in Gamma Velorum!!!


Edit
DB confirmed (with apparent glee/mirth) that we don't know what it is!
Which does make the search a little difficult
Especially since we don't know where to look either!
(Though I have a promising hypothesis to test........)
