Ah thanks for the update, that makes it clear.
Your interpretation of the logo "asterisk" is interesting, hadn't thought about the cyrillic letter, which is "zh", it may well be relevant!
The Founder's World name "Shinrarta Dehzra" came from "In life she saw hope"...I've always thought that implies SD & PF were founded by a female Guardian exile who probably arrived in one of their ark ships (named "Raxxla") and I suspect it was she who left the Mars Artefact (which may have in turn led to the human discovery of Raxxla).

From my notes: Named circa 2013 by Liqua ( Cmdr Aewarin Jameson)/Ughkoff ... it’s an amalgamation of Russian and Arabic: Russian (zhizn' [жизнь] meaning "Life") Arabic (ra'at [رات] meaning "she saw") Russian (nadezhda [надежда] meaning "Hope")

There seems to have been some initial secrecy over the naming!!

Yes an odd coincidence? One has to ask where is art imitating life or life imitating art here, how much of this is just a harmonious accident of likeminded persons building something subconsciously; totally random; or FD cherry picking.?
