but the Cat's Eye nebula is a safer pick for the North
Ya i think there is a very round-about reason Rackham created that “furthest north” station - rackham peak…. He is known as Calico Jack (pirate) …. Personally I think another alias of his is the winking cat (thief) …. Calico being a type of cat and pirates often wearing eye patches…. Cats Eye
