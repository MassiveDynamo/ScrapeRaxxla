A thought about The Dark Wheel verse: 'The jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies' could perhaps mean an orange-coloured star? (The burning part makes me think of flames). I want to link the lines of that verse in with the mythology, in the hope it is giving a route to take that will lead to a particular system, rather than searching through thousands of systems in the Underworld region.
I believe the color we are looking for is a deep red (see first image attachment). This is based on Y-class dwarf in connection to the Soontill stories and a bolded section from "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" in connection to Altuxor/Kamelios/Ivixor B. If Raxxla is found first and Soontill as labeled by Universal Cartographics is not the real location the Soontill story is likely based upon Raxxla/Altuxor/Kamelios/Ivixor B*. Altuxor/Kamelios has a time anomaly in the system and is present in Holdstock's "Where the Time Winds Blow", "Alien World", and "Tour of the Universe" with possible mentions in some other sci-fi works realeased between 1974 - 1980 that I still haven't read, yet. Notable that the Faulcons of Faulcon Manspace and Faulcon-Delacy are linked to this larger mythos.

* - Ivixor B is interestingly enough memorialized by the stoner / doom metal band Electric Wizard from Dorset, England. They have quite interesting lyrics for a number of their songs.

Y'all are the ones who let an alien cultist based out of the California Nebula become one the lead Raxxla Hunters. The old lore comes at a price to the old gods.









Side note: Seriously beginning to wonder if Saramandara Pearls is Pleiades region. Though, they are repeatedly referenced as a globalar cluster and not an open cluster (none of which are especially near Human space). I find it interesting the Raxxlan trading vessel looks all too Human.
