The closest system to Aeolus is Yoruba. I suspect this is the lesson we are supposed to learn (from Wikipedia on Yoruba religion):

Yoruba beliefs explained in brief:
Each person living on earth attempts to achieve perfection and find their destiny in Orun-Rere (the spiritual realm of those who do good and beneficial things).

One's ori-inu (spiritual consciousness in the physical realm) must grow in order to consummate union with one's "Iponri" (Ori Orun, spiritual self).[4]

Iwapẹlẹ (or well-balanced) meditative recitation and sincere veneration is sufficient to strengthen the ori-inu of most people.[2][4] Well-balanced people, it is believed, are able to make positive use of the simplest form of connection between their Oris and the omnipotent Olu-Orun: an adura (petition or prayer) for divine support.

Short-version:
All these place names kind of guide us. Though, I do think keeping in mind larger broad themes such as from Odyssey and Odysseus' journey home may help to keep us on the path.

At this point:
We started off in the real world. Many CMDRs believing (falsely) that Elite Dangerous was a separate Universe.
We stepped into the Otherworld of the past only to realize - hey things look familiar. In the Otherworld, it was revealed this is the same Universe.
We are starting our epic journey to Raxxla after realizing things don't seem so foreign after all.
Clearly the term "Odyssey" is supposed to a guide as to how to proceed.
