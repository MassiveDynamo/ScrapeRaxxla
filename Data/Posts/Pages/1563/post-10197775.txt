In the Artemis system, the Freeholm base, the beacon and the Legacy have a surprising temperature.
Knowing that there is no star nearby, it should not be this high.

For the moment I haven't seen this phenomenon anywhere else.

This number corresponds to the largest number that can be represented on 64 bits minus 1. (2^64-1)
This could be due to the FSS inability to measure the temperature at this location.
(or it is just a bug)
