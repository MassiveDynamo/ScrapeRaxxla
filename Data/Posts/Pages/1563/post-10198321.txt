Thanks mate, a bit better now than I was Friday....
Needless to say I’m not flying at the moment!

Personally, I think naming Planet IX/X in-game as Persephone was the first hint in the revised set of clues. It draws attention to the Eleusinian Mysteries....there are quite a few objects named Persephone in-game!

The Guardians 2.2 update added “Persephone (Planet Nine), Haumea, Makemake, Eris, Orcus, 2002 MS4, Salacia, Quaoar, 2007 OR10 and Sedna to Sol” in 25Oct2016. I suspect the original “Raxxla storyline” (using the Shinrarta permit -it’s a long “personal journey” to reach Elite, different Pilots Federation (factions) spellings in the SD TB, Real Dark Wheel -as one of those PF factions, and E/F missions -given by PF/Real Dark Wheel acting against the TDW faction in SD) was deleted in early 2016.
