The Draco dwarf is very faint. It would not be visible in the sky, from the bubble.
Perhaps itâ€™s findable in the galmap?
The distance from the Draco dwarf to Sol is estimated to be around 260-290kly, significantly farther than even the LMC's 163kly. That seems a hard no for me.

However, given how Milton describes Satan's descent into Eden from a Ptolemaic perspective, the orbital poles are a valid bet indeed - but the Cat's Eye nebula is a safer pick for the North (as it moves significantly slower than even good old Polaris).

The current southern pole is Polaris Australis in the Octans constellation; by 3300 it'll have moved further towards Crux (AKA Southern Cross), so they're possible regions to look around.


(image taken from Wikipedia; Sigma Octantis is Polaris Australis, while the Southern Pointers are Alpha and Beta Centauri)

...is there anything at the intersection of the Southern Cross (Acrux, Becrux, Gacrux, Delta Crucis)?

Hm. Looking at GalMap, Gacrux is in the Bubble (!), significantly farther from the others but not very far from the Old Worlds (!!).
