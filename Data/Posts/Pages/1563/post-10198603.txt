Side note: Seriously beginning to wonder if Saramandara Pearls is Pleiades region

Ya the Pleiades are one possibility. Also Alnilam – Orions belt... the string of pearls… Then there is that whole Pearl Cluster....

My favorite idea is it possibly referring to Indras Pearls / Indras Net which is tied to the Axis Mundi
Indra hung over his palace on Mount Meru a net of silk threads like a spider web… which extends to infinity… at each knot a precious gem …..

Ever wondered why when you look at depictions of the Omphalos you see a net covering it?



An interconnected web of lenses that focus and twist the flow of spacetime..... Sound Familiar ?
