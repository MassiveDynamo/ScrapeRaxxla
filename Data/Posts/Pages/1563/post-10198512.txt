I've been visiting some of the deity / underworld / mythological systems, preferring those that are uninhabited. Many of them are inhabited and some with significant populations.
Today only Ehwaz was interesting as there are many ringed bodies - however there are multiple Fleet Carriers in the system so I am not hopeful of finding anything from ring flybys. Planet 3 has a terraformable water world moon with its own moon and I mapped both and flew by the planet's rings and found nothing. I'll do the other rings in another session, as I don't have much energy and am close to burning out (hot weather and a high pollen count are not helping).

A thought about The Dark Wheel verse: 'The jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies' could perhaps mean an orange-coloured star? (The burning part makes me think of flames). I want to link the lines of that verse in with the mythology, in the hope it is giving a route to take that will lead to a particular system, rather than searching through thousands of systems in the Underworld region.
