Mate, your geography seems a little awry there...pareidolia?
That Omphalos stone is from Delphi, in Greece. Indra was a Hindu god from India which is about 5,700 km away.

Edit
Might represent the swaddling cloth that Rhea wrapped the stone in so Cronus wouldn't realise it wasn't baby Zeus he was about to swallow...did Ancient Greek mothers do crochet?
