Thinking on how we deduce a way forward. The latest expansion is called Odyssey. I think we need to see the wind god Aeolus. Something there should tell us what is next.

Illiad - Journey from Greece and Trojan War
Odyssey - The epic journey home

How did Odysseus find his way home?

Fleeing the land of the Cyclopes, Odysseus found his ships nearing Aeolia, home of Aeolus, the god of the winds. Aeolus used to blow the wind over the sea and the land. After hearing of Odysseus' journey home, Aeolus gave him a bag full of winds that would guide him home safely.
