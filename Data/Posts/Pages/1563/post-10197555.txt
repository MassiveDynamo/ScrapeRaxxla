Interesting find. Brookes wrote a lot on Tau Ceti. Tau Ceti is of course where the Raxxla rumors originated. It mentions galaxies and Small and Large Megallanic Clouds (also referenced by Holdstock). Andromeda Galaxy is also mentioned (also a Holdstock reference).

The Tau Ceti Mission
Follow the Venti probe on its historic twelve light year journey to the Tau Ceti star system.
