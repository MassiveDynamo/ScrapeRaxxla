Yup would be nice to know how to get a Polaris permit. Lave 2 would also be fun.... and Triton? I think that is permit locked too. I tried for a while on the Lave 2 permit but was unsuccessful, I managed to get some missions to the surface, but that turned out to be a bug- still wouldnt let me down.

I suspect there’s no way to get a permit for either Lave2 or Triton. Triton is clearly a Fed Naval base-the steady stream of FNS ships there I think strongly suggests that (though maybe there will eventually be an Imperial/Alliance/Thargoid/Guardian/Xenomorph mission to steal something/get reconnaissance info/bomb it at some later stage when a storyline exists! (I know, I’m being optimistic here! ) ). I think Lave 2 was locked at the request of one of the book authors (Allen Stroud, Lave Revolution), so unless it’s reserved for future content I don’t think we’ll get that one.
