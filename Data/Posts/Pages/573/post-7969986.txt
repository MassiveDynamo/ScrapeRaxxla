Not being able to land on the moon may be a technical limitation, btw: In order to render the moon's surface recognisably, it would then not be possible to generate the surface procedurally to allow landings.
It is. FD commented on this, way back. If you look in the system map, you can see that the Moon doesn't have the 'Landable' crescent. Both Triton and Lave 2 has the crescent in red. This is probably so we can't zoom the map and see craters and other features.
