There is suppose to be some serious narrative coming soon. What if the toast is a premonition, and the whole thing is part of a forthcoming mystery. The jewl that burns bright could be the guardian blue orb "thing". The whisper/siren the thargoids and the greif/woe, either a 3rd race, or taken from the scene in the book, where there are go many thargoid ships about to attack humanity that it blocks out the sun. When the narrative gets to that point, suddenly humanity needs to find raxxla or die.... up step TDW and start recruiting?
