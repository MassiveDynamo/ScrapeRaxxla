Founders got access to Shin without needing to be Elite. In the old days you needed to have the appropriate rank to take a mission, so I assume the Founder/Elite missions were specifically created for that subset of players. They only appear in Shin, right?

As far as I know, Yes. Only FoE missions are handed out at Shin/JM.

Interesting from my observations that only non-offensive missions from TDW give that rank requirement.

(Other factions may be different I haven't kept track of their missions)

Also it's "deliver xxx ...in the name of Democracy" seems to be the titles too.

Never a wing mission, and after covering some missions for a target faction, their subsequent missions drop to ordinary ranks.
