Just to save to chasing a well known dead end...

I thought I might have a go at pew pew. Not normally my cup of fujin tea, but wondering about Thargoid link, for whispers/sirens. Just handed in some combat bonds for thargoid scouts in witch head and had a message pop up that I am now an ally of PILOTSFEDERATION (no space). I have been allied with PILOTS FEDERATION (SD), fairly obviously, for a long while. Eddb.io isnt aware of "no space" and I'm in an Alliance system, controlled by The Allied Commission.

Probably nothing to get excited about, but thought I'd ask if anybody had seen this?
