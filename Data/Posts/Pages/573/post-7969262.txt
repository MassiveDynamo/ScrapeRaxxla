That said, we're probably reading far too much into the 'journey' thing anyway.
Keep in mind that FDev are also on a journey of sorts, attempting to build this game into something that satisfies DB's original vision while placating the ravenous horde of content junkies that keep demanding more! Faster! Harder! Without a flowing narrative lubricating the process there's bound to be, injuries.

But whatever the process, I'd much rather someone finds Raxxla because they figured something out, rather than because FDev decide it's time for someone to find Raxxla.
The two are not mutually exclusive and it comes down to a matter of timing. FDev might anticipate a clue taking months to solve, but we've cracked it a few days. While another might seem obvious to them but we're still stuck and needing a nudge twelve months later. When it's timed right, we barely notice.

I'd prefer they hold back until new stuff is at least beta ready before we get to break it.
