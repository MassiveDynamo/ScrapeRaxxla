“It is a moving portrayal of inhumanity, and like most of the audience, I was left in tears despite – or perhaps because of – the absence of any sentient organisms depicting grand themes of grief and loss.”

Are they trolling us in our loss of Galnet ... or our grief and woe in the dark wheel toast...?

Or are they saying that ... Is the Tionisla Orbital Graveyard ?

That was one of my ideas regarding the Old world alignments.
Tionisla = Parent's grief
Riedquat = Lover's woe
Target = The yearning of our vagabond hearts

Tionisla - Riedquat line leads to something important.

This line passes between Alpha Cygni(Deneb) and Sadr. A bit closer to Deneb.
