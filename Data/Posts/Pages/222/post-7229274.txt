Rebuy Prospect... but I docked there last night, and I'm sure I didn't see Raxxla.

Oh, and Jorki... while I haven't found your view yet, the last few systems I visited last night there was some serious dust. I'm not sure if it is just a bug, but the Witchhead nebula was not visible. Barnard and Rigel were, and I couldn't find anything on galmap that might obscure my view. Even relogged and went further in. supercruise.

Yes, the dust clouds don’t show in galmap, only in game. I started Tyko off at Assellus Prime & there’s a lot of dust around there; he’s currently doing a short Roads to Riches tour to get some funds towards his own AspX & finding a lot of dust around Col 285 Sector.
