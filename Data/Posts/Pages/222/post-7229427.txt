Have some rep for withstanding the tinfoil overload & welcome to the club, squadron, group thread!

Yes, the dust clouds don’t show in galmap, only in game. I started Tyko off at Assellus Prime & there’s a lot of dust around there; he’s currently doing a short Roads to Riches tour to get some funds towards his own AspX & finding a lot of dust around Col 285 Sector.

Great!
Your welcome gift. (Wear it when posting here. We all do !)

Ah thanks, I’ve been labouring under a misunderstanding for 33 years!



I didn’t, but having tried to drive around the magic roundabout once I’m not surprised

Remove mum in law from that apparel at once sir!
they do not fall into the remit of this thread. They exist, are easy to find, always visit without invitation, cause much disruption, & you can’t get rid of them. Perhaps the Thargoid thread would be more appropriate?

Edit: personally I find the tinfoil shorts are more than sufficient.
p.s. The best thing about divorce is that your in laws automatically become outlaws!

Thanks for the warm welcome. I'll be sure to throw on my new shirt and make a nice pair of tinfoil shorts. It's absolutely necessary in this thread!
