There might be an additional clue hidden in those names.
About names and clues.
Jason (Ryder) was about setting up an expedition to fly to the prize Raxxla.
Jason set up an expedition to navigate to the prize Chrysomellon , the Golden Fleece.
There is a Chrysus (gold) system in the GalMap.
But in Colonia.
Anyone there might want to take a look ?
