I think Raxxla is the ‘Sleeping God’ in Peter F. Hamilton’s Night’s Dawn Trilogy. An artificially created sentient naked singularity able to (among other nigh-omnipotent abilities) create wormholes of any size to places of any distance away, and even to other realms/spacetimes, whose purpose is to assist the evolution of biological civilizations who are able to find it and ask for its assistance.
