Not exactly. The twisted men that Rafe mentioned were never identified as being members of The Dark Wheel. The Dark Wheel were looking for Raxxla knowing full well that it had already been located and inhabited by someone else (The Club?).
Ninja'd!

Though I think that strictly speaking TDW only suspected that there were people already on Raxxla, and they took Jason's assassination as evidence that they were correct in that suspicion.
