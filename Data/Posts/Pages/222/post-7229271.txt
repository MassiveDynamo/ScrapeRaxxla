Also want to say that I finally finished reading all 296 pages of the thread. Took about 3 weeks reading here and there but totally worth it. If it weren't for you guys and your dedication I wouldn't have got back into Elite. Just a shout of from me to say thank you to everyone who has contributed to this thread. You folks are what keep me coming back. If anything needs exploring near Colonia then I'm your commander. o7 Gents

Great!
Your welcome gift. (Wear it when posting here. We all do !)
