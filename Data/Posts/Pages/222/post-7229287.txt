Great!
Your welcome gift. (Wear it when posting here. We all do !)

Remove mum in law from that apparel at once sir!
they do not fall into the remit of this thread. They exist, are easy to find, always visit without invitation, cause much disruption, & you canâ€™t get rid of them. Perhaps the Thargoid thread would be more appropriate?

Edit: personally I find the tinfoil shorts are more than sufficient.
p.s. The best thing about divorce is that your in laws automatically become outlaws!
