Miguel Brooks ? Funny. Sounds like a Gibraltar guy or a Brit enjoying a sunny and well fed retirement in La Costa del Sol.
Anyway, worth to look into that as soon as I am back in Colonia sector.
DW said ( link somewhere here) that afahk only DB and MB know about Raxxla. But, right now, the new Game Director must know too..I think.
"If I had a Â£ for everytime I was asked "Where is #Raxxla?" I'd be able to buy modestly outfitted ship in #elitedangerous. I don't know - I'm pretty sure that only David Braben and Michael Brookes are privvy to the secret. " 08/14/2018
