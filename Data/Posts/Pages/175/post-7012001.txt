Oh dang, totally forgot about that. Yeah it was either a shady business, or Space Jesus come to spread the word about Earth Jesus.

Remember how the Unknown Probes/Artifacts/whatever had been scanning ships and producing audio that could be graphed out into a visual representation of said ships? A lot of people (myself included) believed that Frontier was planning to introduce the Thargoids (or another alien species) by claiming that they had copied our ship designs and that, therefore, combat against the aliens wouldn't be any different from combat against any other NPCs. The outcry was quite vocal and a lot of people believed that Frontier shelved the idea due to said outcry. I for one still believe this to be the case.
