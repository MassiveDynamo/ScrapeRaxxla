No. Raxxla is definitely Planet Coaster not Jurassic World. Whoever finds Raxxla gets free coaster rides for life.

Then Iâ€™d better give up now!
I get motion sickness in an SRV, especially since planet surfaces seem to have got more hilly in the last update

How do you spell the activity for watching oranges?
