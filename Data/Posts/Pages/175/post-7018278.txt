mmmmyes.... This and a few press articles and interviews where MB appears as "Game Director" or "Creative Director" (what ED lacks currently) of that jurassic-thing. Someone who knows about management could certainly pull out some...conclusions ? Perhaps this replacement is supposed to be for a limited time.
"So yeah, I worked on that and actually rised through the ranks to become head of QA [Quality Assurance] and then shifted over into production. And I'm now Game Director. (Jurassic)"

Or, this threader might have a point: https://elitepve.com/viewtopic.php?t=7818#p87085
Which would very well fit in the direction ED took since he left.
