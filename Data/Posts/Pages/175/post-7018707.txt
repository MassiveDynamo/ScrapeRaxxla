mmmmyes.... This and a few press articles and interviews where MB appears as "Game Director" or "Creative Director" (what ED lacks currently) of that jurassic-thing. Someone who knows about management could certainly pull out some...conclusions ? Perhaps this replacement is supposed to be for a limited time.
"So yeah, I worked on that and actually rised through the ranks to become head of QA [Quality Assurance] and then shifted over into production. And I'm now Game Director. (Jurassic)"

Or, this threader might have a point: https://elitepve.com/viewtopic.php?t=7818#p87085
Which would very well fit in the direction ED took since he left.

What if the world of that Jurrasic game is what we're looking for, and MB going to that project is actually some kind of covert hint?


The tinfoil thickens methinks
