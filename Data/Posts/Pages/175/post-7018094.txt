Miguel Brooks ? Funny. Sounds like a Gibraltar guy or a Brit enjoying a sunny and well fed retirement in La Costa del Sol.
Anyway, worth to look into that as soon as I am back in Colonia sector.
DW said ( link somewhere here) that afahk only DB and MB know about Raxxla. But, right now, the new Game Director must know too..I think.

The Executive Producer who replaced MB? Yes one would assume so, odd we never hear from him.
