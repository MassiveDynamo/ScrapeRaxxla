Ya, I hear you - I guess ive always got a kick out of philosophies though.

I picked up a book about Hekate and the Chaldean Oracles.
This bit talks about the Cosmic Soul:
"The fact that Timaeus situated in the Soul the basic mathematical and musical proportions, by means of which the Cosmos was ordered and organized, led to the theory that the Soul itself was composed of Number, or of all numbers. This theory was encouraged by (and in turn gave credence to) the Platonic equation of the Ideas or Form with mathematical entities. It was related, too, to the belief that Soul recived the Ideas and then cast them unto chaotic matter in order to construct the Cosmos; Number, in Pythagorean and Platonic theory, was responsible for the organization of physical space and thereby for the construction of the physical Cosmos."

I can see how this would appeal to someone creating a procedural universe.
