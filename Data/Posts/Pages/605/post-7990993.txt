Reviewing (very) old posts, I didn't find what Raxxla is but MB said what it is/was not. (Nov 2014)

'What is the founder's world name?'
'Founder's World'

I dont think it's a lie. Everything I have seen/heard of Drew implies that he is a genuinely nice guy.
I have clearly mixed up my myths with my legends and redact me previous post. Sorry @Jorki Rasalas !
