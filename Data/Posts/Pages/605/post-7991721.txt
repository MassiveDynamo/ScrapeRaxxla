I think u're missing something ...it is a game, which must make money.
Soo ...cultural references cannot be used, or books which are not translated to all languages.
If they could reference something that would be world-well known like Ancient Greek myths.

For example - I never even know there is some "Drew" and his books prior I started to play this game and read this topic on this forum. So making puzzle related on it should be bad idea for selling game.
