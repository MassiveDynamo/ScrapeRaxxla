Was just wondering, if the mother of galaxies (plural) has a mythological meaning, when I looked up 'Galaxy' on the web and found a lot of links to products from a certain Korean company.
Now Samsung apparently is Korean and means "tristar" - according to wikipedia...

Thought 'why not'? In the 34th century, 21st century history might have been considered to be myths for a certain part at least...

Do whatever you want with that piece of information.
