Reviewing (very) old posts, I didn't find what Raxxla is but MB said what it is/was not. (Nov 2014)

'What is the founder's world name?'
'Founder's World'
'I'm a tiny little bit disappointed they didn't call it Raxxla '
'Raxxla is something different ' (< MB)

Are we going to keep looking for a planet ?

There is just a DW's report of what DB told him (July 2014). I can't imagine that it's a lie. Can you ?

What I am not so sure about, is this statement from another "witness" of that famous BAFTA...

Mmm, no, I don’t think it’s a planet. At least not a planet we can land on to reach “an alien gateway to other universes” since Horizons wasn’t released until after the gamma when Raxxla was inserted.
So I’m looking for a derelict anaconda, or a space station (possibly TDW one), or something else, named “Raxxla”.

Whatever it is I hope they have a seriously good lavian brandy, aged for a couple hundred years, to justify the search!
After topping the hedges, mowing the lawn and power raking half the lawn this afternoon I’m ready for one now! The dog walk will have to wait until I’ve cooled down!
