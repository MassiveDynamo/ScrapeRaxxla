"...why people haven't been able to find it..."
Now, maybe the Very Old Guard can remember to what extent the MW was explored back on July 2014... Was the beta/gamma, wasn't it ?
Edastro only shows from may 2015, and has the explored systems counting reset to zero, I think.
That should narrow the possible location to the very inside of the Bubble.
