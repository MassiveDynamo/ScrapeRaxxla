At the risk of re-opening the debate, theres 2 versions of the same conversation, both written by Drew W. One is written a lot later than the other so memory and all that. Im sure I posted both with links to source earlier in this thread. The consistent statement attributed to DB was given as its in the game / it exists. The rest is in one version but not the other.

edit - not using 'version' judgementally just cant think of better description.

MB statement that it 'should...play out in the game' (paraphrasing) makes me wonder if it is a story line rather than a mystery, I hope not.

I do wonder if the first test is not to talk about the first test....and then the DW missions happened and 2 seconds later were all over the internet and then dried up...
