Has anyone seriously looked into why the Frontier gazette says Altair should have 20 bodies but has 5 planets in Elite Dangerous. Ackcanphi should have had earth-like but is just 2 stars. This is just sampling of the initial discovery reports being not even remotely close to what is in-game. There are also several systems such as Enaness that are straight up completely missing. These lore important systems. Shouldn't these match reasonably closely. Even factoring in 2296 - 3308 is 1,012 years and it has been 1,211 years since the first generation ship (2097 per Galnet) there should be at least reasonable consistency. I could understand if one of the systems was Jackson's Lighthouse which per the system description the binary stars formed the magnetar in 2672. I mean if key pieces are gone the immediate assumption should not be retconn but that maybe you need to look nearby or see if the system had a name change over all those centuries.
The Gazetteer isnâ€™t lore. Almost all systems have changed their composition, since the Fe2 galaxy. The system generator was not as accurate, as the one in ED.
many systems were not realistic or even physically possible.

I would focus on the stories from the old games. Not the numbers.
