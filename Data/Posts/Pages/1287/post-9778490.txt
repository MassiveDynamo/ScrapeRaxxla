Information requirements:
location information for Raxxla
Determination of what Raxxla is

Success criteria:
Localisation within 20 ly of actual position
If it’s not static then localisation of position over a period of time that will allow us to find it, say next three weeks

Potential obstacles to plan:
We don’t know what it is, so we probably won’t know when/if we find it
There are no clues

Ummmmmmmmm...........twiddles thumbs.......
