One always must be vigilant. I (we) used to own a studio in town; it was situated within an old 1960’s factory, a very old brick building with many locked and boarded up doors.

On one such occasion we uncovered a door which led down 3 floors to another locked door, at some point we mysteriously gained entry, and found a large (too large to get out of the room) multi faced hexagonal object about 6 foot high, painted gold, made of wood and nailed to the floor, there was a covering of dust everywhere…reminded us of ‘Proteus-4’… true story.
