TOP SECRET- RAXXLA INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION PLAN

Information requirements:
location information for Raxxla
Determination of what Raxxla is

Success criteria:
Localisation within 20 ly of actual position
If it’s not static then localisation of position over a period of time that will allow us to find it, say next three weeks

Potential obstacles to plan:
We don’t know it is, so we probably won’t know when/if we find it
There are no clues

Summary:
Ummmmmmmmm...........twiddles thumbs.......
Click to expand...
maybe location is imprinted on one of the space stations in the bubble.
