Probably not relevant to the Quest, but guardian obelisks now exhibiting different behaviour
Guardian obelisk glitch?
I have done some guardian material collection today, and I have remarked that all obelisks have this animation and sound : Source: https://youtu.be/PeAgCdM0PNw Did someone already notice that before? Or maybe it's a bug? In fact, we can say that all obelisks are trying to... compute...

Tbh I still think Raxxla and Guardians are definitely linked and the monoliths back this Theory mixed with human tech just by design alone, any loading screen especially station and codex has these exact same triangle movement function, Galmap itself can see every star and its exact location in the current galaxy and was introduced via the Pilots Federation through Universal Cartographics megacorp who issue this for free to every spaceship etc,If anything id say Raxxla is something found, exploited to a sense and our galnet and sub systems are a glimpse technological discovery made from it before they lost it,

They may have found it during the Thargoid war (or before leading the Thargoids to us in the first place) while chasing them to one of their staging points that used to be Guardian owned out by col 70 or beyond Guardian space, they may have retrieved a slight bit of techno wizardry to create what we have now and either didnt know it was Guardian in nature at the time or are hiding this fact, the fuel on war may be these same people driving us to war with the Thargoids to push us deeper into the Guardian rabbit hole to once again capture Raxxlas location! It may actually be a Guardian ark ship as previously mentioned, either Guardian, AI or automate controlled to avoid conflict and danger.

This above way would tie it into lore in a big way while also give it basis that Raxxla is infact in the game since gamma and we have been using a piece of it this whole time, this is also a good basis on the "making it a tiny bit obvious" comment while also adding in with the "being used by a lone person or sinister cabal" while also tieing in old lore whichever retconned.

It can be found by everyone and not only once, may refer to the monolith system and we don't know what it is "yet" may indicate we have infact already found it just haven't gained access to it, now I know the monolith system wasnt in the game since gamma however our galmap and system tech has been, it has been the only tech in game since launch that everyone in game could find, use and navigate the Universe using which also adds the "A gateway to other universes" meaning it may be a piece of the gate but also the key to unlocking it.

Our cross species tech is the key, we just have to find the gate, Guardians are "the creators of the door and" we "have the key to open it" ( It will eventually let us use it as we data mine and expand our Guardian cross technology which would tie storyline with everything else) also ties in the direction of Soontill and the Darkwheel, the Sap 8 core containers containing the Crystals, remember Soontill is very close to the closest Guardian ruins and also a marker for Thargoid activity, they may have been working with Guardian tech until the Thargoid war kicked off and all we got from it was Universal Carthographics Galmap for now. (Some ruins also Key shaped and we also have the Ancient Key, Guardian Key)

Guardian beacons are huge, just for a little key seems unlikely and us being able to proccess items as blueprints etc without prior knowledge is a bit strange, our systems knew what they where though

All thin foil obviously
