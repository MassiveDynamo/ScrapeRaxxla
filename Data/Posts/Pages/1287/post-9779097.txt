maybe location is imprinted on one of the space stations in the bubble.
Try every large station (Orbis, Corioilis, and Ocellus) on both ends of the interior. What you thought they shot loitering CMDRs on sight for mere traffic control?!. Remember, this is a deadly secret. Additionally, look very carefully at the large round planetary ports with what looks like a shielded dome (they are very rare). They structurally have the same kind of design as the ends of interior of the large stations. Still trying to decode what exactly the hint is but it isn't something than can be readily explained away with utilitarian design.
