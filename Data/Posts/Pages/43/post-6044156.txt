All CMDRs offering insights, theories, questions, answers, etc. related to Raxxla ever so slightly are most welcome in this thread.
Sent CMDR Flirble Rasok on his circumnavigation expedition 2 days ago. He'll report back if Raxxla is found on the outer rim...He's expected back in 354 days.

I want to believe (it does sound like a signature)

Once I get my new ship; I will be headed towards some barely-to-none explored areas on the most outer reaches of the galaxy too; who knows what we'll find there.
