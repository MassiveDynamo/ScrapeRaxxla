No wonder you went mad and disoriented. Can you believe I can't find that nebula in the GalMap? There surely is something wrong.
Or perhaps your spelling needs some correction?

I'm currently passing through the BLOO DRYE sector, so I'm guessing that the nebula is in a similarly named sector and has been autocorrected into 'BLOOD HAZE'.

It's a community named nebula, a camp on the Sagittarius-Carina mission.

I'm surprised you old rifters don't know about EDSM? No wonder it took you all so long to find the Formidine Rift
