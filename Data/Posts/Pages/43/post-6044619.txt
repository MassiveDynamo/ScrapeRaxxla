All CMDRs offering insights, theories, questions, answers, etc. related to Raxxla ever so slightly are most welcome in this thread.
Sent CMDR Flirble Rasok on his circumnavigation expedition 2 days ago. He'll report back if Raxxla is found on the outer rim...He's expected back in 354 days.

I want to believe (it does sound like a signature)
I got disorientated and flew round in circles for weeks between 15 Sagittarii and the Blood Haze Nebula. I'm convinced that this was down to baby-brain and space madness, but it's just about possible that it might be that the Raxxla gateway to other universes bent space time so that a straight line was in fact a circle. I would appreciate it if some other commanders, especially those talking about penguins, moles and those still trying to find the Formidine rift, could visit the area to check if they suffer the same issues.

Cheers
