I've been out at Sedna in case it relates to the poem: https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/17-APR-3303
Some odd USS I've never seen before, bit nothing seems to be Raxxla related, and a wing of security forces just hanging out nearby.

Is there a guide on searching from glide? I was just trying to spot discolourations etc, but I've never really done planetary searching.
