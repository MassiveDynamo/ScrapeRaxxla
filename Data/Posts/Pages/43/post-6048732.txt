I got disorientated and flew round in circles for weeks between 15 Sagittarii and the Blood Haze Nebula. I'm convinced that this was down to baby-brain and space madness, but it's just about possible that it might be that the Raxxla gateway to other universes bent space time so that a straight line was in fact a circle. I would appreciate it if some other commanders, especially those talking about penguins, moles and those still trying to find the Formidine rift, could visit the area to check if they suffer the same issues.

Cheers

No wonder you went mad and disoriented. Can you believe I can't find that nebula in the GalMap? There surely is something wrong.
Or perhaps your spelling needs some correction?
