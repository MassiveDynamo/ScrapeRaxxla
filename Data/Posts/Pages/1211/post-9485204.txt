what have you found in HIP 22460? all comm ports I scanned at Ash fort came back as "corrupted message". Planet with 2 Thargoid signals and 1 Guardian signal is empty, I can't find a single site or base there. FSS is wrong ?
Same, this Guardian thing is supposedly a bug, I have my doubts. As for site Amber an Bronze, I hear they're possibly the two Thargoid surface sites. I wonder if they are not though.
