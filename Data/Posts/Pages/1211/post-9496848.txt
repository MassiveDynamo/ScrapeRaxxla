Before, like everyone else, I tried to find the riddle of Raxla through the arrangement of stars, etc. But then I realized that I had to go another way to solve it, because the first person who found Raxla would write about it on the Internet. It would immediately cease to be a mystery and thousands of people would fly to it. What could prevent this from happening? And why haven't people done it so far?
So I think it has something to do with personal achievement. But I couldn't figure out which ones, since many people have already reached the 3 Elites.
And then I see in the Odyssey added more Elites and the main numbers to them.
I think the search for Raxxla will be very long.
Surely FDEV wouldn't be so mean that getting Polaris permit requires ELITE V in all possible diciplines...?
