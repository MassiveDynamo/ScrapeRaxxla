Just had to share this with you guys...out on my own, pottering around a few thousand out the bubble and below. Jumped into a system and there were 54 bodies. Only one was scanned and mapped. The eighth moon of the only gas giant in the system. And I though to myself, "I know what that bloke's on about!"
