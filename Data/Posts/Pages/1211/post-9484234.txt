So Hyford’s Cache seems to have taken us no nearer to Raxxla.
The Black Flight mystery
To unlock the intergalactic hyperdrive you have to go to Raxxla and unlock the engineer there. unfortunately the odyssey release bugged out the spawning of the materials that engineer needs. Gonna have to get 10 friends to also find raxxla and attempt to unlock the engineer first and then...

And someone else (me too) has had the Issue with reading a site log not being noted in their codex, which presumably mars the record of the “personal journey”. When/if hands are less painful must revisit that site & see if I can re-read the log in question, but I suspect having read it once it wont update my codex.
No sign of any storyline that will lead to TDW &/or Raxxla....

Very Frustrated of Mu Leonis!
