You have voice attack i think? Maybe look into macros and even see how people are creating bots for the game. Think you might be able to jury rig some sort of voice command fly by wire fun. Just imagine yourself on the deck of the enterprise giving commands to your redshirts
Good thought, but I gave up on VA. Doesn't work as well for me as I expected,
Besides, Spock is no longer with us!

Edit: perhaps VA doesn't like the Jorkshire accent!

But it could also have been hearing the music which I tend to listen to while flying!!


Mmm, if my hands get better maybe I ought to limit myself to 3 hours flying per week !
