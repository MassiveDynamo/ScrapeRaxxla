Same, this Guardian thing is supposedly a bug, I have my doubts. As for site Amber an Bronze, I hear they're possibly the two Thargoid surface sites. I wonder if they are not though.
Guardian signal is the mega ship I think, because there are 2 thargoid bases and nothing else but that mega ship. mega ship should count as human signal but since there is no human base there and no guardian site, mega ship must count as guardian signal. I will go back there later today and I will bring probe and sensor with me to start thargoid machine. When I was there some people were already trying to start the machine but they were saying it is bugged, maybe there is something they are missing.

btw..there is a lot of cmdrs there so if you are to go start the machine, I will advice you to go Solo, in Open you may have to wait in line LOL or risk getting blown up.
