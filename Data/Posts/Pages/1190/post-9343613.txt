Also, with the disappearance of the Alexandria in Delphi. This is right in line with the theory that to track down Alex Ryder's trail, ya gotta follow the path of Alexander the Great.
That Alexander's well known historical locations he had visited and or conquered are in game as clues, and that they lead to what Alex Ryder found, presumably what we are all looking for. That the historical accounts of Alexanders travels actually serve as a map to the treasure Alex Ryder, and likely Jason Ryder had discovered.

Alexander the Great sought ought the Delphi Oracle in 336 BC.

"Alexander the Great visited the Delphic Oracle wishing to hear a prophecy that he would soon conquer the entire ancient world. To his surprise the oracle refused a direct comment and asked him to come later. Furious, Alexander dragged Pythia by the hair out of the chamber until she screamed "You are invincible, my son!"

The moment he heard these words he dropped her, saying, "Now I have my answer"." -wiki

Might be worth mentioning that he also sought out the Egyptian Oracle, Amun-Ra at the Siwa Oasis in the desert.
