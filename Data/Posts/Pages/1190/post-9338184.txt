But thatâ€™s immaterial, since Raxxla in lore started with the first Elite, but hasnt been implemented until ED-Elite 4.
FD has retconned a whole lot of old lore for ED. The only info we can rely on is contained within the current game, plus the few FD comments we have documented (which is why I started that thread, see my signature).
Right, just pointing it out because someone earlier in the thread asked about it.
