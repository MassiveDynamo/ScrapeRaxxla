Yes, The more I see of the game the stronger my belief that your theory that the Guardians came to Sol in the distant past and were the basis for Greek mythology, etc is correct. I think Halsey’s “caretakers” are indeed the Guardians evolved into pure energy-based lifeforms (what did MB say about that?), and moreover I suspect they are the “fireflies” at the heart of the thargoid barnacles and UA/TS. Whether they are now cooperating with the Thargoids, or whether they are captive lifeforms I hope will be revealed eventually.

What concerns me about the possible retcon/move of the Raxxla gateway to the surface is that there are probably still players who only play the baseline. Would DB really disenfranchise them by making Raxxla only accessible from a planet surface?

Ive thought for a while now that there is stuff still to be discovered about the Guardians. I think FD expected us to decode the patterns on the obelisks and when nobody did they had to resort to putting pictures of the artefacts up instead.

I suspect for ED neither the Club nor TDW know how to get to Raxxla, though it’s possible TDW might and there is a great deal of obfuscation over it. Although iff Raxxla is Triton then clearly the Fed Navy knows!
