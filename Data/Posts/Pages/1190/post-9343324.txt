"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies."

OK, we've been here before..

Mother of Galaxies possibly Cassiopeia but where's the jewel?

Jewel possibly Alphekka, but mother of galaxies?

brow

1.
a person's forehead.
"he wiped his brow"

2.
the summit of a hill or pass. (or a hump?)
"the cottages were built on the brow of a hill"

Caph (Beta Cassiopeiae)
Beta Cassiopeiae is the star's Bayer designation. It also bore the traditional names Caph (from the Arabic word كف kaf, "palm" - i.e. reaching from the Pleiades),
Chaph and Kaff, as well as al-Sanam al-Nakah "the Camel's Hump"

What if you rotated the Galaxy Map, so from a viewpoint, the jewel (Alphekka) was on the brow of a hump (Caph).

This would give the first vector.

Maybe the intersection of a second vector (to be found) would be a good place to look?
