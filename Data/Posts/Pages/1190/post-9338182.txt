Forgot to say in Tyko’s search around Sol’s outer planets there are several impact craters shown on the body maps which are reminiscent of navels, including being prominent & near the equator (centre point). What is unsettling me is that Raxxla was inserted in the gamma release, long before Horizons made planetary landings feasible, so should not be on a planet. Unless they decided to retcon it because it hadn't been found by Horizons release? Putting the gateway in a crater with the omphalos hint could then be sensible (& could link to a 2001SO tribute) providing FD were willing to exclude any players without Horizons; I can’t make my mind up about that.

Perhaps there are two different methods of finding it (Horizons vs baseline game)?

I’ve been playing Horizons. Perhaps I should try in the baseline?

Afterthought: I wonder if DB tested Raxxla accessibility for Horizons release? It would be a tad frustrating if Raxxla has been accessible all along in the baseline but a programming bug prevents in Horizons!
