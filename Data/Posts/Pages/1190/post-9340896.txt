Witch's Reach
Spansh has it listed as 39ly away from Sol, which is well within the reach of the 7ly jump range that's being bandied about, it fits with the whole Dark Wheel slogan thing, and its apparently permit locked to the whole galaxy. You think it, and the whole of the Raxxla mystery itself, might be locked by a hard-coded community exploration minimum threshold that'll begin unlocking once the percentage of the Galaxy gets the full scan-treatment? Might be why the Raxxla symbol (the googly eyes thing) has the same pattern as the efficient scanning bonus surface scanner pattern, maybe?
