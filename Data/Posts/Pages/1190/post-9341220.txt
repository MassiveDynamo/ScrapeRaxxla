Mmm, I seem to recall reading (but I have no source, it may have been Redditt! ) that it was not originally locked & someone had visited before it was locked. Probably along with Col70 etc. Someone had reported that it only had a planet named Cauldron & this was before the FC exploit.

That would make sense of the Patch Note which said military convoys had been added there and to some other systems that are now permit locked.

Military convoys used to be dedicated to moving Thargoid stuff around, UA/TS etc, so it might make sense for that permit to be obtainable via Black Flight/Aegis etc. Unless itâ€™s locked for other reasons...
