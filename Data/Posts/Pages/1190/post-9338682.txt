There is a small hint in guardian history 3, that the caretakers may predate the guardians. A dimming of their sun causes a climate change that accelerates their development. Pushing the development of a primitive but intelligente species and dimming / blocking a sun are both things the Firstborn do in the 2001 series.

How this is connected to Raxxla, I don't know. I doubt the Club would have leaked the guardian sites, if it would give an easy path to Raxxla.
Very much sounds like 2001, also shades of Babylon 5's First Ones with their ability to transcend flesh and their interest in poking at younger races.
