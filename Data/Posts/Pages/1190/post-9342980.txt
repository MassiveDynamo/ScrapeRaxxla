So, the new CG is in Orion's nebula, inching super close to the permit locked Horsehead Nebula and much of Barnard's Loop permit locked sectors, such as Col 70 sector.
Here's a excerpt from Robert Holdstock's, The Alien World, page 22.
"They built the stabilizer's [of the Talmor Lens/time and space controller], The Pyramids on Earth [In this book, specifically Egyptian Great Pyramids], the easy way, with the points toward the stars, a disastrous mistake for the Oisir-Raxxla, and the beginning of the end of their dream. [of complete control over time and space]."

We all have heard how the Great Pyramids are lined up perfectly with Orion's Belt, for no really known reason. Well, Barnard's Loop is in the center of Orion's Belt.
Check these 3 stars and see, Alnitak, Mintaka, and Epsilon Orionis (Alnilam).

Well, here we are. I cannot eat enough popcorn for this show.
