Anyone had problems logging into game after the update?
Downloaded at coffee time, did some gardening, now trying to log in.
Log into account OK, runs shaders & planet generation OK, then just keeps saying "failure to connect to authentication server, invalid machine ID"!
even though browser is working fine.
Pah, blooming fleet carriers, never wanted anything to do with em!
Going to reboot PC and walk dog (or boot dog and walk PC!!)
On the ED launcher, go to OPTIONS and choose LOG OUT OF MACHINE, after that log back in and it should fix the problem
