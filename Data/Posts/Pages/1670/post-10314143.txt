It's an interesting idea to search for Rafe's conda, though I'm sceptical that it would lead anywhere- IIRC Rafe wasn't a member of TDW and didn't have any clues to the location of Raxxla.
I was thinking he might have clues on how to get in touch with TDW. He was an ex-member and seemed confident that he could get Alex in.
