It's an interesting idea to search for Rafe's conda, though I'm sceptical that it would lead anywhere- IIRC Rafe wasn't a member of TDW and didn't have any clues to the location of Raxxla.
To be honest confirmation of anything hidden in this way still being in the game would put some good wind into my raxxla sails
