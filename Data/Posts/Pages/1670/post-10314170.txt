I leave this video here. Not only its very intriguing, or the puzzle methods has been used in this game before (Not even mentioning "3301"), but also the last words and the idea of the video matches most of this forum pages visitors. Most people here DONT want to find Raxxla. What would we do with out Raxxla? How would people fall asleep peacefully, if it was taken away? What would fill the void, if it would ever been found? Raxxla is the embodiment of a silent box, where we can throw all our silly goose chases, tinfoil madness and never ending theories to satisfy our need to get away from our selves, and give our mind a piece of juice to run it so silence does not devour us.
