The art from Brookes tattoo is very eerily similar to the William Blake imagery from Cicada 3301. Also, I would urge everyone to read Liber Primus and see if you don't see similarities. Cicadas are a symbol of rebirth. Additionally, Eltie Dangerous didn't really get started until January 1st, 3301. Perhaps that wasn't chance and perhaps Elite Dangerous had an ARG during the Kickstarter and promotional era.

Cicada's first post, mentioning that they are looking for highly intelligent individuals is kind of a resemblence to being an elite, or the guys dark wheel is trying to contact. I will read the Liber primus, but afaik it has not been dechipered completely. And cant wrap my head around why those guys named their selves 3301?
