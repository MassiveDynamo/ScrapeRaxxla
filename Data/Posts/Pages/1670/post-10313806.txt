From memory, Attilius Orbital in CD-43 11917 is also the palm-tree design.
Yes, Attilius Orbital has vast fields of palm trees, a wonderful thing to see, but it is also a very remote and rough area. A kind of untamed wilderness left untouched by modern era. Great natural beauty and empty pizza boxes. I would think twice before staying there for a night though, native CD-43 11917 legends speak of strange hairy monsters living in there, wild men, sasquatch like. I'm sure they are only stories told to scare off young people though... Great shipyard and outfitting selection.
