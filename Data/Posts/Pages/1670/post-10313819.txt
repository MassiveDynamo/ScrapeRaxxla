This makes me think it's quite plausible that Rafe Zetter's Conda home base still exists in what would now be a SC distance within the Tioisla systems. Could his now abandon place have clues left behind I wonder...
Something like this could also easily be a crashed ship poi conda that iirc doesn't usually show up in the nav panel until you're in the orbital vicinity. As these usually aren't really worth the time cost they probably get ignored more often than not.
