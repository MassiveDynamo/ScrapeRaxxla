It is interesting. Mostly because this idea could actually work.
As a lore element it's fully plausible that Rafe's Anaconda is still out there. It was in pretty bad shape and might not have been able to move. Rafe him self wasn't in the best shape either. He may have just died out there.
The Zurara supposedly had text logs at release. These were later updated to voice logs. In the hypothetical case of Rafe's Conda, I would expect something similar. Probably logs that were intended to help Alex get in contact with the Dark Wheel. Hopefully they could help us do the same.

The location is defined as 0.1 ly from Tionisla. This is repeated several times in the book. The vector from Tionisla is not defined.
This is the sequence when they line up for the jump:
"Alex laughed and said, ‘Repeat after me: Lady of Fate, we adore you… ‘
'Get us to Rafe’s, we implore you…’
The monuments and monoliths drifted by. The star field widened ahead of them.
‘Nearly there,’ Elyssia breathed. ‘Get ready for the jump…’"

There is a chance that there is a specific star that we have to aim for. This could be the Jewel, Sol, Shinrarta Dezhra, Lave or something hinted in the book. We just have to pick one and go. It's at least something to actually search for.

It's an interesting idea to search for Rafe's conda, though I'm sceptical that it would lead anywhere- IIRC Rafe wasn't a member of TDW and didn't have any clues to the location of Raxxla.
