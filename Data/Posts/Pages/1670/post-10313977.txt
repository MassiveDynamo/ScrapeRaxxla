Just listing current clues and things fast:


1. Whispers in witchspace symbol, which needs clearing up. (this one is the most important to me bc it could be a literal ingame clue which is huge)
(edit: is there any chance it may need a cipher to show up proper as seen with other mysteries in the game?)

2. An anaconda somewhere with clues. (maybe hidden somewhere in a cluster or in-system like the voyager probes.

3. What significance would a lighthouse have, i know "Jackson's Lighthouse" is in the game.
(may be nothing, just remembered it)

4. "The signal". Is it a constellation / galactic region the "silhouette" is showing?

5. "Jewel on the brow", maybe a star in a constellation.




Statements: "It is in the game and we know where.", "Ayone can find it.", "It is not random.", "More clues and it would be a spoiler."
-that last bit is interesting, because what clues were in the game before we had the ingame CODEX entry on raxxla?

Addendum: i am in the process of unlocking permits in the bubble and there are areas where the "old" signal sources are still active.
("debris field" etc)

Some signals still needs you to be really close to a planet to see them, almost in orbit. (megameter)

It stands to reason that we don't "need" the FSS as it is a newer invention.


Did i miss anything?
