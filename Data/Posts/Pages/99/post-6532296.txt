I can't find it now but there used to be some blurb about how "The Founders" were a collective of individuals that, in one way or another (power, influence, money, other special status) that helped (IIRC) in setting up the Pilot's Federation. It was a long time ago however so might be wrong on some of those facts.

Post edit: from the KS page as one of the rewards:



There was some other explanation somewhere else that went into it some more but I cannot find it right now.

This tourist beacon in Shinrarta Dhezra gives the most info regarding The Founders World that I've found:
SPOILER

It doesn't provide a reason why the planet was named "The Founders World" nor who exactly the "Founders" are (again, I know who the Founders are out-of-game. I'm talking in-game narrative.)

It would be interesting if it turned out that the Founders are actually an alien race and "their" world is actually Raxxla ...
