Doesn't one of the tourist beacons say something about Elite members of the Pilots Federation being allowed to retire to the Founder's World in anonymity? I'd go with "protective of their privacy". You've killed thousands of people's relatives during your time in space. Last thing you want when you retire is be hunted down by some kid looking to avenge his daddy.

...Curious though. Why is it called "The Founders World"? I mean ... I get why it is called that due to the Kickstarter and Founders getting free access at launch but what is the in-game narrative reason?

I can't find it now but there used to be some blurb about how "The Founders" were a collective of individuals that, in one way or another (power, influence, money, other special status) that helped (IIRC) in setting up the Pilot's Federation. It was a long time ago however so might be wrong on some of those facts.

Post edit: from the KS page as one of the rewards:

Be a founding member of ‘The Elite’ in the game, plus all rewards above.

There was some other explanation somewhere else that went into it some more but I cannot find it right now.
