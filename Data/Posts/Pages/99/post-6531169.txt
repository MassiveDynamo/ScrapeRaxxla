BREAKING NEWS!

Raxxla is a PLANT:

From the last chapter of Holdstock's The Dark Wheel:

Rafe chuckled and shook his head. 'You see, that's the big question. Your
father was chasing the mythical plant Raxxla. Does it exist, or does it
not?If it does, then on Raxxla there's an alien construct that's a gateway
to other Universes, and all that's in those Universes in the way of bounty,
and treasures, and aliens, and life...

It's online at World of Spectrum if you don't have it. I have the ZX Spectrum version, checked and it was copied without error - the book contains the same error.

We're meant to be looking for a plant guys...
