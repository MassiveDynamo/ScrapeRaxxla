Like I said, they are alien, they live underground (no lights), Raxxla is the Founders World seen from the inside (a place that is not a place). Looking for the entrance ...

Raxxla is within and all around you,
Lift a finger and Raxxla is there,
Take a dump and Raxxla finds you,
Raxxla is with you always.

He is Raxxla, She is Raxxla,
I am Raxxla, and so's my wife.

Have another hit of Braintree?
