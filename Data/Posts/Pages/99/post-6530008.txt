Spent some time around Founders World yesterday, expecting to find satellite's in USS'; did not see any. Could mean a couple of things: 1) Nobody is down there or 2) They're very protective of their privacy.

Doesn't one of the tourist beacons say something about Elite members of the Pilots Federation being allowed to retire to the Founder's World in anonymity? I'd go with "protective of their privacy". You've killed thousands of people's relatives during your time in space. Last thing you want when you retire is be hunted down by some kid looking to avenge his daddy.

...Curious though. Why is it called "The Founders World"? I mean ... I get why it is called that due to the Kickstarter and Founders getting free access at launch but what is the in-game narrative reason?
