Oolite saga, Mutabilis, near the end. I know it's not canon but I doubt that Drew (after having access to the Frontier Alien Background book) would have spoiled the "concept" or "nature" of Raxxla.

Wait, you are referring to some novel's character saying, not actual Drew stating anything on Raxxla, right?
I mean - even if any character now, inside E would say anything, that wouldn't mean he/she is right.
