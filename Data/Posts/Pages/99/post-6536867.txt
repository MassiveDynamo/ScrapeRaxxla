Any source for that?
(I wasn't aware of such a statement)

Oolite saga, Mutabilis, near the end. I know it's not canon but I doubt that Drew (after having access to the Frontier Alien Background book) would have spoiled the "concept" or "nature" of Raxxla.
I want to believe there isn't one "Raxxla in TDW", and one different "Raxxla in Oolite", and one different "Raxxla in ED" etc... Raxxla is Raxxla, period.
