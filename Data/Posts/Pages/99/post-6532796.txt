This tourist beacon in Shinrarta Dhezra gives the most info regarding The Founders World that I've found:
SPOILER

It doesn't provide a reason why the planet was named "The Founders World" nor who exactly the "Founders" are (again, I know who the Founders are out-of-game. I'm talking in-game narrative.)

It would be interesting if it turned out that the Founders are actually an alien race and "their" world is actually Raxxla ...

Ricardo Bentonio has been telling us all along:
The founders (Club) were (still are) the Guardian AI, so Denton Patreus and LYR are cyborgs controlling the Pilots Federation, hence all the locked sectors.
Zemina Torval is a lizard in human skinsuit and Aryssa is another clone, but those are other storylines....
