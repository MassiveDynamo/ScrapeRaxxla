Thanks. Thought they sounded vaguely familiar but couldn’t remember them. How about the other? And there are a couple of system names that don’t ring a bell either two HIPs and a HR, Eulexia & Maia. I don’t remember Maia cropping up other than thargoid encounters there & thought was outwith the Salomé story.

Eulexia rings a bell, but it could be from something completely unrelated.
HIPs and HRs are part of my Raxxla investigation so I've visited thousands of them - they all blur together after a while.
