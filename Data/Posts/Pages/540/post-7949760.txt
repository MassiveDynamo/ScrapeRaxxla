This is a great watch. Thanks for posting. Yes it confirms what I thought about the quote. I was sure he never said "and we know why it's not been found"
He seems to strongly disagree with my theory that it's near the rift, but....

a) he is guessing as we are. I never thought it was part of what he had written
B) he hinted that there was other stuff to be found out there

Did somebody mention that MB had a book coming out? I had a quick look on Amazon but couldn't find it??

Afaik no Elite books is forthcoming from MB. He did get Elite Legacy published in 2014.

On another note, just sold 36mill worth of explo data in Puleston Arsenal, no TDW invite tho. On the plus side I now have grade 5 for Lightweight Life Support, and all other Colonia Engineers to Grade 5.
