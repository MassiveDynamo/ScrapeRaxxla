I'm sorry to see this thread dissolving into bitterness. There's a strong feeling of frustration, which is understandable, but complaining about what FD May or may not have done is no answer.

We need to rediscover our sense of Fernweh and go back to scratch and examine where this puzzle has taken us.

There are still unexplored things in this game. 10% of tourist beacons remain undiscovered , several in the lore number spans, for instance, showing there is stuff yet to be discovered.

We've covered many possibilities, but even in the last 20 pages there have been interesting new avenues.

Let's get back to work!
