Uuurgh just to add to that thought. In the original game there were 2 missions, the first was found by achieving rank and visiting a system in the 2nd Galaxy Map iirc. The 2nd was the same.

Neither of them had any clues at all that they were even there iirc there were no messages until you docked in that system, nothing in the manual or anywhere mentioned missions or anything. The implication is that you were supposed to find them by chance after reaching the requirement, visiting before meant no message. This was the 1984 BBC version.

Kind of a big Easter Egg, the entire mission gameplay, not announced or mentioned at all anywhere else. Meanwhile Raxxla (presented as a mystery to solve and follow, at least to my childhood mind) and especially the Graveyard (presented as a factual place) weren't.

And its that kind of mind-melting meta-play that means Raxxla definitely is/isn't in the game*
