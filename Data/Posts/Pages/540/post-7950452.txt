Indeed. It’s getting to the point that I’m wondering what is the point of playing!
Is anything actually in-game???

The “mile-wide inch-deep” seems to have shrunk to “kilometre-wide millimetre-deep”!

This is kinda why I keep muttering "There are no clues".

We've seen the Formidine Rift storyline forced to a close. We've seen GalNet story after story that looked like a mystery fade into nothing and be forgotten - to the extent that I never for a second believed Gan Romero was anything other than fluff. The Guardians are just a convenient mechanism to introduce new technologies into the game - once the initial histories had been uncovered, they're just another material to farm.

It makes it impossible to believe that FDev are actively trying to get players to discover Raxxla, or that there's any great over-arching narrative that involves it's discovery, because the only storyline they care about is Thargoids - which is fair, I guess, since a large proportion of players very much enjoy blowing them up (check Steam Charts to see the doubling of active player count when Palin got hosed). If somebody actually does find Raxxla then FDev are going to have to figure out how to tie it into the storyline - or they'll just leave it as another big anticlimax that gets forgotten about in a few months.

All that said, I still think Raxxla is in the game - because at release there were actually people involved in the project who cared about that kind of thing. It's a shame they've moved on to other things.
