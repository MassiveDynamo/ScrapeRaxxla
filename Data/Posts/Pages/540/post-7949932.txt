Romero-thing just another FD hoax

Was the Gan Romero story reflected in-game?
The Gan Romero storyline was always envisaged as an off-camera narrative. The fact that some people assumed it had an in-game component, and went searching for Romero, was for me further evidence that off-camera GalNet stories could be detrimental to the player experience, and cemented our desire to ensure that all GalNet content related to things that were actually in the game.

This has been the problem with GalNet right from the start - at least they've finally figured it out.
Hopefully they will realize that the reason that people have been chasing these stories is because we're desperate for in-game mysteries that we can actually follow (you know, with clues and stuff) and become involved in, rather than just being pointed at the latest CG/II. My breath, however, is not being held.
