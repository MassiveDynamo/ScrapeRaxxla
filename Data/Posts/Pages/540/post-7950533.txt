"Fiction fans gather for literary event"
The magazine thing never was about Raxxla, Soontill, or gigantic reptiliaform psi-projectors though. It was more about advanced game features.
It was kinda big they announced Gan Romero cannot be found in the game. Benedetti is certainly making some wheels turn.
I really liked the use of word "metafiction". You know, if you made a mindmap out of this thread..
