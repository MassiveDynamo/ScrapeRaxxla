The "Reptilian Raxxla" thing is a very old hoax. You can't find much information about it or the original story in english, because this magazine is not english. It's being mixed up with various russian versions of elite, which unlike the legend, though likely original inspiration for it, actually were real, ingenious, and totally unofficial.

Drew probably has his own version of Raxxla. DB either has his own also, or is confused about all the fuss, because it never was something one should seriously go searching for, perhaps a mix of these two. How are legends born?

Starting to suspect that FDev's public relations policy was inspired by Mossad....We will neither confirm nor deny ;-)

Which ironically may have been inspired by british MI5 or something. There may be a connection! ><


Oh, dear lord. What if eulaxia is raxxla?! He's been trying to take us off the hunt this whole time then!! 8\

For the love of abba...

Edit: Eutaxia!
