Cool, I just wouldn’t want you to have taken a paraphrased statement that I can’t find the original source for as something that puts you off the idea of looking for Raxxla in ED!
1. Well it does not cancel the search for TDW and if you can somehow join TDW it will not essentially just continue the search for Raxxla.

2. the game is constantly changing and remaking, then on the obelisk 2x3 glyph then 2x2, etc. Previously, the game was not at all Codex. At this point they can do and remake anything.
