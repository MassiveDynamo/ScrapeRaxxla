Well it’s worth bearing in mind that Ian Bell hasn’t been involved with Elite since the original game, so it’s just his take on Holdstock’s Raxxla given what he (Bell) knew about ED at the time (which may well be less than we do). It was phrased in a way that was quite disparaging to ED, so there may be more than an element of the dispute/falling out between him and David Braben behind what he said.

Even if what Bell said was accurate, it doesn’t mean that ED doesn’t have Raxxla, just that ED’s Raxxla may be different to Holdstock’s vision for Raxxla in Elite. From what I recall of what was said, there was an implication that Braben may not have even known what Holdstock’s Raxxla was. So if that is the case, ED’s Raxxla was pretty much always going to be different to Holdstock’s vision of Raxxla in Elite.

(Please apply a suitable bit of doubt over the statements as well, as I can’t currently find the original source for it all, and it’s always possible that what I’m remembering is what someone else said that Ian Bell said rather than a direct first hand statement from Bell himself.)

I just liked the saying because it fits my idea of the Raxxla myth.

As for today's development of the story of the witch, D-2, etc. I'm still waiting for the Odyssey - Trojan Horse.
