IIRC the Mars Relic was found in space, but there were also fossils found on Mars itself.

Assuming that is indeed correct then it’s established that there were non-Earth based living creatures in Sol well before humanity’s time.

Possibilities:
They came from Mars originally
They came from Earth originally and travelled to Mars
They came from another body in the solar system and travelled to Mars
AFAIK there’s nothing however to say whether (and if so, how) the Mars fossils and Mars relics are related.

Having read that, and last weekend watched Jeff Wayne’s War of the Worlds New Generation on TV, I just gotta say a long, loud & warbling Ullllaaaaaaaa!

TB175 - “The object was found buried on Mars; it was no bigger than a child's hand and is still surrounded in secrecy, even in 3300. No information has ever been circulated as to the properties of this item or its origin, other than it is non-human.”
TB216- the artefact that was found in orbit (of Jupiter) was a message capsule from Augustus Brenquith. I suspect this (& he) might be significant for TDW/Raxxla, but never found anything to follow-on.

Brenquith was a Frontier Gazetteer character. His exploits were highlighted and expanded with more detail added in the guide material.

Later, I produced a variety of spoof Astrogator Tours adverts for Lave Radio.

I sometimes think I missed out a lot by missing the games between Elite 1 and Elite 4, but then I remember that period involved working for a living and raising children....
