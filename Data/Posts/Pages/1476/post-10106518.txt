Hello tinfoil hats mates, recently I have been studying again about Raxxla, well among 1476 pages about raxxla very little really solid we have achieved so far...
But I would like your help and understand if any real clues have been found, what has been investigated recently, I want to be able to help you and update me on the subject.

I will share a little bit of my vision with you:
I have always believed that there is something in Mr Sidney's sonnet astrophel e stella, mentioned in the codex:
"Several versions of the Raxxla story mention an alien artifact: The Omphalos rift, described as a gateway or tunnel through which parallel universes can be accessed. These details however were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to the children's story "Princess Astrophel and the spiralling stars", and soon lost credibility. Undaunted, some Raxxla seekers insisted the story's Author had cunningly concealed facts about the mysterious locale in his book, as hints for those with eyes to see".

I have been studying these sonnets for days, there are references to Greco Roman mythology in the text, but I have yet to find anything or the possible hidden clues "Author had cunningly concealed facts about the mysterious locale in his book, as hints for those with eyes to see."

Besides the poetic and mitorlogical interpretation of the text, there is also the difficulty of translating some terms from an Old English 1500 to be unfolded as well, maybe I'm not seeing how The Barben interpreted it...
