Well it’s worth bearing in mind that Ian Bell hasn’t been involved with Elite since the original game, so it’s just his take on Holdstock’s Raxxla given what he (Bell) knew about ED at the time (which may well be less than we do). It was phrased in a way that was quite disparaging to ED, so there may be more than an element of the dispute/falling out between him and David Braben behind what he said.

Even if what Bell said was accurate, it doesn’t mean that ED doesn’t have Raxxla, just that ED’s Raxxla may be different to Holdstock’s vision for Raxxla in Elite. From what I recall of what was said, there was an implication that Braben may not have even known what Holdstock’s Raxxla was. So if that is the case, ED’s Raxxla was pretty much always going to be different to Holdstock’s vision of Raxxla in Elite.

(Please apply a suitable bit of doubt over the statements as well, as I can’t currently find the original source for it all, and it’s always possible that what I’m remembering is what someone else said that Ian Bell said rather than a direct first hand statement from Bell himself.)

The Quest To Find Raxxla
Looks like we arrived at the same place, more or less, using the same references. Where did this go? What did you end up trying? Why aren't you at Raxxla now? What stopped you? Where did the trail dead end? We (I) never found anything, primarily because some other shiny thing caught my...

The Quest To Find Raxxla
Bill has a something-Quest ship in the cellar. It has caustic damage, so it was probably damaged by Thargoids. The old story had Mic's Quest destroyed by INRA. There were a few other Quest ships in FFE. None of them seem that relevant to ED. There are no traces of a major Mycoid attack or Mycoid...

The Quest To Find Raxxla
I know it is easy to think dismissing me will work, but I actually did do my research. There is very little reason to believe what we thought we knew. Not all humans should be trusted but I am not one of the bad ones. It cost me everything to speak out. I gain literally nothing by speaking out...

(Mmm, I never played them, so what hints are there to Raxxla/TDW in the lore of Frontier: Elite 2 and Frontier First Encounters?)

(In particular “I would say clearly, any attempt to reconcile the main narrative of Elite (original) with Elite Dangerous beyond how it is already connected is only an exercise in personal canon”, so Raxxla in ED may (IMHO highly likely to) be very different from the original novella)

Edit:
Ive tried to find the Ian Bell quote on ED’s implementation of Holdstock’s Raxxla, but failed. I was sure someone had mentioned it in this thread, but my googlefu is weak this morning (weaker than normal) - bad night with copawlot, must have a nap...
