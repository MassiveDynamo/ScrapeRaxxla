It is more to do with physics and when you get anything as extreme as a singularity the garden variety version of physics that predicts events here on Earth starts breaking ... badly. Blackholes and wormholes are each distinct kinds of singularities. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity
Yes, I am aware of that. It's just that if the word space-time were simply replaced with space, nothing would be lost.
What's the point of adding a constant to anything?
(I don't think that's really the point here).
