Or a planet, station, etc...

I have to ask why? The gazetteer even stated which frontier system seemingly had traces of alien civilizations. TDW novella also seems to have fairly obvious hints about locations that might be important.

I mean you do what feels comfortable for you, but seems like you are making this harder for yourself.

I am just saying...maybe trusting the space monk that seems have some ideas that can be backed with in-game evidence may not be the worst choice you could make.

Ya its fairly clear the ED is continuing on from FFE … however… big however… there are many discrepancies (safer to say they are following from an unpublished variant of FFE). So anything from FFE must not be taken as canon but has rather a better chance of being real than the earlier stuff. I think anything prior to FFE would fall under “legends” and maybe even some stuff in it.. but that doesnt stop us from dreaming.
