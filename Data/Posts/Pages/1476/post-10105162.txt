Last I checked, our ships don't generate power on the scale of billions of suns - Wormhole FAQ from the Chandra Space Telescope team



Think for a moment about how absolutely massive most our ships are - nevermind fleet carriers and megaships.

Space-time otherwise known as the fabric of the universe ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime ). Even creating a blackhole requires fairly insane amounts energy and mass in a suitably small region. All I am saying, is your power plant may run your ship but it doesn't generate anything close enough to open a tunnel in space between systems. Something else is doing that.

which means most choices when implementing the game were at least partly informed based upon actual science, physics, chemistry, geology, etc.

Yes, I understand everything, the only thing I don't understand is why you say the word time.
Just space.
