Maths Question:

If we are searching 400bn systems for something that is possibly in 1 of them. Randomly jumping, how many systems on average will we have to search until we find the right system? There must be a probability curve surely. Wild guesses appreciated.

Did you know that if 30 people are in a room its quite probable that someone shares a birthday with you? So it could be a lot less that I think, probably
Probably the reason why we missed it because everyome jump far and almost every system that are close to each other one of them is undiscovored.

I'm jumping 6Ly right now
