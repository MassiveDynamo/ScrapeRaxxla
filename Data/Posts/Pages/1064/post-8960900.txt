Yeah...everytime I find a system like that I think to myself, "Man...no one has been in this system for a long, long time." It's a weird nostalgia for time long gone when there were three different types of scanners and earning enough to buy the unlimited range scanner meant something.
Yeah, I've not actually seen that particular peculiarity for a while. What's more common is seeing the main star tagged, but not the rest of them, or the stars tagged by different players. Overall, I prefer things the way they are now, and I definitely don't miss the whole "face a body and wait ages for it to resolve" that came with the old mechanic. It does, however, slow my exploration down a little, as I rarely leave an untagged system without scanning it all now. Buckyballing is no longer a thing I can stand to do.
