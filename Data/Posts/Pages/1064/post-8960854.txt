Yeah, but prior to that you had to choose to face the star and wait for the scanner to finish it's weird countdown thing, or it wouldn't become "discovered". Honking alone wasn't enough back then. You don't see it much because most people who scanned anything in a system would at least do the primary star as well, but not everyone did. Just means nobody has honked that system since the introduction of FSS.
Yeah...everytime I find a system like that I think to myself, "Man...no one has been in this system for a long, long time." It's a weird nostalgia for time long gone when there were three different types of scanners and earning enough to buy the unlimited range scanner meant something.
