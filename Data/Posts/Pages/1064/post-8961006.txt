Yeah, I've not actually seen that particular peculiarity for a while. What's more common is seeing the main star tagged, but not the rest of them, or the stars tagged by different players. Overall, I prefer things the way they are now, and I definitely don't miss the whole "face a body and wait ages for it to resolve" that came with the old mechanic. It does, however, slow my exploration down a little, as I rarely leave an untagged system without scanning it all now. Buckyballing is no longer a thing I can stand to do.
I see it with some frequency further out...especially if there is a WW or an ELW.

And like you, buckyballing is harder to do now. The FOMO is real.
