Yes, corrected, I meant system.

If it's true that the 52 signals are not findable, as FrakesAnim said, then the Sifi-system just became much more interesting; so there's hope.

EDIT: Ah, I'm stupid, it's 50 bodies (49+1 star), so this would be 2 signals
Not to put a dampener on things, but I think those extra two signals will be the belt clusters. The system map posted earlier shows there is a belt, and total signals includes belt clusters where the total bodies number does not.
