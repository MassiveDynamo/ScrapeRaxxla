Hey fellas. I'm new to the forums so I don't know if what I'm bringing has already been solved but I noticed a couple years ago people were trying to figure out where Cirag was but I didn't see any answers. I combed through some lore snippets and timelines and I found that in the book "the dark wheel" Alex Ryder was at one point involved in a fight or Cirag sometime after his father was killed in 3125, but the planet was renamed and it's location was forgotten. The elite dangerous timeline says that in 3301 the Imperial fleet arrived on the planet Emerald in the Cemiess system to colonize it. The federation showed up to dispute it and they ended up getting in a 30 year long war over it that the Imperial fleet now controls. Seeing as how Emerald is an earth-like planet (well a moon of Jade, technically), it would make sense that a war would break out for control over it. The war would also overlap with the approximate time that the battle in the book took place. So my guess is that Emerald is Cirag. Like I said I don't know if this theory has already been brought up but I think it's a pretty solid guess.
