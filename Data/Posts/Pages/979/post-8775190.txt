We were expecting a reveal, but then we found it, or the middle of it and the then the beginning and the end, but Im not sure what else is missing or whats in between....and Halloween is a Saturday, traditionally a quiet day in the Galxay.

But we have a code that may get some hints.

Well, if youâ€™ve got the beginning, middle and end
Then you need to look for the preface and epilogue!
Edit: oh, and maybe a Foreword, and some judiciously selected critic review comments.....
