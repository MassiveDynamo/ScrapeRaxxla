I can’t remember much about the Winking Cat, but do remember that there seemed to be some emphasis on those widely-separated dates. Not interested enough to pursue it at the moment, but for anyone who is-might it be referencing a long-period (~300 years) comet? Just had a quick look and there’s one named C/1885 R1 Brooks that immediately jumped out at me, but there are a few others around that periodicity (high 200 to middle 300 year period?). Don’t forget that Centuries started at 0AD for first, so 20thC was 1900-1999 etc!

Must get back to preparing for Tyko’s Sweols journey. Decided I want to take a Phantom instead of the AspX (I had a slightly heavy landing on a high G while collecting mats, gonna take a repair limpet!) currently at 68ly but a bit underpowered, want to do a couple of test flights before departure.

And must see grandkids today before second English Covid lockdown starts!!!
