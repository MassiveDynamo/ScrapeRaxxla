ya sorry about that - I honestly thought i hadnt posted that ... was just musing about the crazy geologist from the halloween fun who kept calling the barnacle circles "the stones" supposedly in reference to the standing stone circles from earth...

No problem mate! I very rarely watch livestreams & wasnâ€™t even aware of this one, so when Channel 4 News was mentioned I assumed something of major significance on UK TV Channel 4, not an FD Pythonesque teaser.
