The name Adamastor Is like Zurara, connected to the Portugese age of exploration.
And both were likely named by the club or their surrogates. Is this implying they have or had a naming convention back then.

Perhaps it’s just a coincidence but look at how similar these two entries are; one from the Raxxla codex entry and one from the Prester John Wikipedia article.

Prester John Wikipedia Article: Evidence has suggested that locating Prester John's kingdom in Ethiopia entered the collective consciousness around 1250

Raxxla Codex Entry: The entry does not describe Raxxla or its possible whereabouts, but its existence is evidence that the Raxxla legend was already in the public consciousness by that time.

Later in the Raxxla codex entry Prester John is mentioned which is a legendary Christian king the Portuguese explorers really wanted to locate.

A lot of coincidences or confirmation bias?

Also in MB’s Tattoo, there are some furry creatures amidst the serpents and angels on the lower to middle right side. Does anyone have an opinion about what those are?
