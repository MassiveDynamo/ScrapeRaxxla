I like this Iberian turn of events, lots of interesting stuff to explore, like the Isle of Seven Cities, Seven Cities of Gold, Canary Islands (Islands of the dogs, fortunate islands), exploration of Americas...

I wonder if Juan Eusebio Nieremberg is related to all of this too, such a strange (if suitable in the context) reference from prez Hudson...
