Never a truer word spoken in jest. We are!

believe it or not some people, me included, think there may be more to find. There may be an original destination, but thats far less likely it is possible, and there may be an original destination, to me this would make sense and is what Ill spend some time doing....but not too much

And we still have a code that is not cracked and I think has some info we dont know about.



tinfoil! Why Ch 4? they are British, we have a Channel 4 thats quite well known and CH4 News is as well. They could have gone for groovy hippy channel 27 or just a random one. Why choose one of the 5 terrestrial channels instead of just making something up so that 'any similarities between anybody or any organisation and any persons living or dead is purely coincidental'. is that not even considered anymore. Just seemed like the first thing Id have done is change the Channel to one that doesnt exist just in case, but maybe thats just me.

I do jest a lot!
Well. I'm British; Yorkshire hasn't declared independence ...... yet)
I'd have gone for Channel 42 News -the answers (possibly false news?) about life, the Universe, and everything!
