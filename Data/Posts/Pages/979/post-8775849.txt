I'm having second thoughts about the first line of TDW toast indicating SWOALS IL-Y e0. It is the highest known (EDSM) CN star at 2852ly but a long way out at 32.5 kylies
HD79319 is the highest C star at 2227ly but only 3.5 kylies from Shinrarta, which sounds to me much more likely for a (I presume from their early days with restricted jump ranges) TDW initiation requirement. Moreover the second line is moot. If Whisperer of Witchspace is a NS (someone posted a link to an FD vid on Sounds of the Stars. I listened to it but I didn't hear anything to confirm this) then there doesn't seem to be any that are higher than Goliath's Rest (from a quick whiz around in the galmap couldn't actually see any higher systems), whereas HD79319 is only 468ly from PSR J0922+0638, a dual NS, indeed the Spansh Neutron Route planner takes you through that pulsar to get to HD79319. Currently musing that Siren of the Deepest Void could be a White Dwarf- the deepest void being death? Or it could be a pulsar, which are pretty dangerous!!!

On third thoughts SWOALS IL-Y e0 is above Sag A*, so could rightly be said to be on the brow (above) the mother of galaxies ....
indecision!!!

Ah fourth thoughts!!!
HD 79319 is a one-way trip unless you have a fleet carrier to make the return journey!
You can NS boost to it from the pulsar, but there's only the Carbon star & some planets there hence no return & this therefore cannot form the target of the first line of TDW toast..
