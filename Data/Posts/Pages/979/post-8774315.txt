Can I just say, this a great catch by Filthymick! Well done bro! People have been staring at this tattoo for years and speculating but you just made the connection so many others have failed at getting.

My question now is, is there a female statue out there or painting that matches the other entity on the right side of the tattoo? It seems to me like itâ€™s a battle scene with two forces at play, those on left vs those on the right.
