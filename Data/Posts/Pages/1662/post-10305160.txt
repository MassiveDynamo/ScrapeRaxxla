Exactly my thought too! Hard to unsee it as a bird, but... idk why it would be Like, even if it's a joke or Easter-egg just for fun... it's weird!

Yes! If "Sirens" are the Landscape Signal, and "whisperer" is the D7 anomaly, then there may be more (or these things may not be related?!)

Hmmm, that's interesting too. I believe the segmentation and naming of those segments happened in Beyond Chapter 3 along with the Codex in 2018. The D7 anomaly seems to pre-date that, but possibly the odd shape of the centre of the Galaxy may be intended to resemble it? I wonder why they didn't make the Galactic Centre region just a circle?

Many of us have investigated Saturn a lot for this very reason, sadly no investigations have ever found anything (and the hex isn't present in-game)

Is galactic circle - it being the shape not entirely circular - we see in the game grounded in actual region separation in astronomy? If not that in itself would be clue.
