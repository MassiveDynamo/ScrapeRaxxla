I could be wrong here but I believe megaships act like orbital installations in that you must data-link scan to see interactable parts.
Your right but i see on my notes no dialog.
Normally i scan the ship and then do each data port (like on the Gen ships), so i was either too tired and messed up or there wasn't any lore text.
