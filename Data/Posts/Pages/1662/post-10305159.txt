The area it appears in is the block of sound that can be described as "whispers". I believe this is directly related to the Raxxla Codex clue: "To the whisperer in witch-space...", but... I don't know what it means even if it really is that connection?
IIRC it was stated that if they made the clues clearer it would be a spoiler, and if that symbol (or what it is), isn't a clue, idk what is.
-is there any way to clear it up more or combine it with "The signal" perchance?
