It's sights like that which make me think I might restart playing ED. I never went out to Black &Green, but it cropped up regularly in long distance tourist missions so maybe FD decided to put the ship there.

Incidentally one possibility mooted was that those missions were a way to get the TDW invitation (they were supposed to be daredevil explorers)...see Augustus Brenquith-related tourist beacons.

While musing my Roku stick I found this film on Filmrise...Princess Astrophil and the Spiralling Stars/Prince protecting a Princess from an Alien Dragon?
