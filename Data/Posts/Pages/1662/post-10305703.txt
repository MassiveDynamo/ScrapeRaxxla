Installations tend not to have anything useful at their data links (some of them can be scanned for high-grade data materials, though they won't approve of that) - since they don't move like megaships, there's normally nothing for them to say unless they've been specifically added for plot purposes.

They also never contribute toward system population, even in otherwise inhabited systems - so one placed in an otherwise uninhabited system isn't going to show up that way.

The one at Black in Green is probably just there to look pretty - but since I'm only about 1000 LY away at the moment I can go and do a survey of it later this week to make sure.
(And something like a Comms or Military installation in an otherwise unremarkable system might well be a clue to something - though, since the models were only added in 2.3, not necessarily to Raxxla)
