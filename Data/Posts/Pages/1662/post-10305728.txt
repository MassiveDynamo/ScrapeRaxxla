Thought installations per se had been ingame from the outset? Was it just those two types that were added in later?
They all got added with 2.3 alongside the megaships (and the various hatchbreaking / datalink gameplay around them). As with megaships, they got a bit more work in 3.3 with the BGS changes to add scenarios taking place at them, to make them a bit more interactive.

I'm just thinking of those types as "most likely to be mysterious" but really anything of them nowhere near a tourist spot or obviously inhabited system would be pretty weird.
