I wasn’t initially looking too deeply into such parallels, although I was aware of them.

Instead my aim was to focus upon the locational information only.

The concept has been in my mind for some considerable time, so I’m aware it’s open to pattern bias, but I do believe that there exists numerous spacial alignments or relative proximities, that might identify Shamash and Thetis are positioned intentionally. If this is correct, it could lend greater emphasis upon this hypothetical axis, if so then logically if we follow the Miltonian model - said pendent world ought to be along that axis, or at most relative to it?

Ninsun is the mother of Gilgamesh and helps him by and convincing Shamash to protect her son. In a similar fashion Thetis protects her son Achilles.

The idea of a central world axis can represent "what is known and stable about the world" and so explorers tend to seek out the foreign realms - chaos, night, disorder, death etc, typically on a journey of discovery, enlightenment or as a test. So the fact that Jacques' journey is can be spatially supported by a "branch" coming off the axis, and the proximity of the two epics seems to suggest a firm relationship. That's not to say Jacques path is the focus, more that he represents a 'superhuman' figure in ED, further validating the legendary status of his path.

I agree, the more certainty there is about this axis, there is a chance we could trace its line to find something significant. The axis mundi and omphalos represent the same principle and maybe that is the ideological 'rift' we need to follow to uncover something
