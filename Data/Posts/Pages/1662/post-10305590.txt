It's sights like that which make me think I might restart playing ED
Those pickys were taken from my first Annie which at the time was only lightly engineered as id only been playing a few months.
A mate recommended i did the tourist beacons (i wanted to be an explorer) so off i went, Black In Green is in the first 100, since then i have mapped all the known beacons, and seen some amazing sights but ive done some millage!
