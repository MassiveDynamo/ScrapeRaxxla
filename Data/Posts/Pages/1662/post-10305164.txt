Many of us have investigated Saturn a lot for this very reason, sadly no investigations have ever found anything (and the hex isn't present in-game)
I know it's a weird seemingly disconnected detail but the bobble-head style planets from Sol notably do not resemble those in-game in Sol itself. Also, of the Solar System bodies there are 8 only:
Mercury
Venus (notably lacking an atmosphere)
Earth
Mars (not terraformed and arrid as seen IRL presently)
Jupiter (lacks rings which are present in-game)
Saturn (seems sharply inclined)
Uranus (lacking rings and not loop-sided)
Neptune (lacking rings)
Screenshots taken from Elite Dangerous DLC store (Saturn, Venus, and Uranus):



I don't know but maybe we are looking for system resembling the IRL Sol System but with these key differences (and apparently only 8 planets as Pluto was demoted before release). To me, for as obsessed with realism as Frontier Developments was in building the Milky Way, this seems to be taking artistic license to the realm that this might just be a hint.
