It is. But over the years various game graphics "improvements" now make it difficult to see . It has been discussed in this thread...search for Saturn+Omphalos

It's naming by New York Times readers as "Omphalos" was an obvious head mark...I spent a while fruitlessly trying to headbut my way into it.
