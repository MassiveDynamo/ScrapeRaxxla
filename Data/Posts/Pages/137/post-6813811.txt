I'd say it's the first planet we see. The very first - on the start menu screen.
The thing is however, the background for basic Elite: Dangerous and Horizons look different (which doesn't say they are in different systems though)

Anyway, did anyone attempt to locate any of them anyhow? Any clues?

I postulated this hypothesis a while ago, and spent an hour or so trying to find some clue in the background stars but failed and I couldnâ€™t spot any distinctive objects, nebulae etc. The fact that the start screen is different with/without Horizons could be down to a different body in the same system at a different point in its orbit. By all means have a go at deciphering the star positions yourself, I may have missed something.
