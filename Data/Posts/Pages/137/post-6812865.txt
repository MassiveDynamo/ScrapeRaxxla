Maybe it's the first planet you see when entering a fresh game. Maybe they expected raxxla to be the first thing we found and it was supposed to trigger a game event on someone locating it. And they keep saying there are no hints because it's so simple any hints would immediately destroy any need to hunt for it..

On a second note: "has to be a tiny bit obvious"

Maybe it's a tiny bit and it's obvious... What is the most obvious tiny bit in the game?!

I'd say it's the first planet we see. The very first - on the start menu screen.
The thing is however, the background for basic Elite: Dangerous and Horizons look different (which doesn't say they are in different systems though)

Anyway, did anyone attempt to locate any of them anyhow? Any clues?
