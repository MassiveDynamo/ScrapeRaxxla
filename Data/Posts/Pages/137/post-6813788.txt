You mean the Sap 8 Core Container? Worth a try. Apparently they can be bought at malsipina Gateway, though EDDB doesn't confirm.

Maybe one should simply load up on all existing exotic cargo stuff and make a round trip to the Permit locked Systems.

Ah yes, SAP8. Although I seem to remember there was some suggestion (misdirection?) a while ago about these being related to Sirius propulsion, but it seems like it might be a good idea to try these in the Guardian Data Terminal......
