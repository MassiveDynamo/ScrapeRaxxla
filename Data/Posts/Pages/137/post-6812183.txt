There will be no clues ... That's true, but you have to make a tiny part a little bit obvious so people know what they are doing. (MB)

The thing is, the obvious thing seems to have disappeared from the game since 2.4 ... But no worries, folks, as everything is working as intended [blah]

A 'little bit obvious' could be something like a unique planet image on the System Map - so if you stumble across the right system you're unlikely to miss it.

On my stint out at Colonia earlier this year I couldn't help fail to notice that a lot of the systems in that bubble have also been comprehensively explored. Of course, it's nowhere near the size of the home bubble and I do like your thinking Drew (I like any out-of-the-box thinking on Raxxla), but where does that leave us? Still the same old problems and questions, eh?

The star density around Colonia is, I think, much higher than most of the Bubble so I expect there's a lot more exploring to be done around there.

Regarding whether it helps us to move forward - taking the 'There will be no clues' at face value means that our questions are NEVER going to be answered and that finding Raxxla will take some combination of luck and guesswork.

Also, even if it isn't Raxxla, the base theory still has some merit - why did FDev put Jacques where they put it?
