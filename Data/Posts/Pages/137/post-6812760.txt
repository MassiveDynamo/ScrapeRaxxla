What about the idea of the MKIII cobra reference being a reference to Rebecca's cobra MKIII specifically and not any old stock cobra mkIII? It's potentially a bit of a coincidence that they are both cobra MKIII's.

Sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking.

Rebecca, the Children of Raxxla and the Formidine Rift are all unrelated to Raxxla the planet - yes, the names are confusing, but CoR are a player faction who happened to choose that name.
