If “obfuscate” does imply “garbled” then an L class system might be a good place to hide Raxxla, so RA XX-A L, and other permutations?

Mass-codes stop at letter H, so there cannot be RA XX-A L Systems. If it's in the Name, it can only be a System with A mass code, so a very light Primary star, like all the Brown dwarfes I've found in those Systems.

But here I'm asking again: should we look for Raxxla or maybe for Oisir?

I postulated this hypothesis a while ago, and spent an hour or so trying to find some clue in the background stars but failed and I couldn’t spot any distinctive objects, nebulae etc. The fact that the start screen is different with/without Horizons could be down to a different body in the same system at a different point in its orbit. By all means have a go at deciphering the star positions yourself, I may have missed something.

The start sceen is edited for the looks. There are no stations in such low Orbit between a such Close binary pair of planets. Nothing here.
