On my stint out at Colonia earlier this year I couldn't help fail to notice that a lot of the systems in that bubble have also been comprehensively explored. Of course, it's nowhere near the size of the home bubble and I do like your thinking Drew (I like any out-of-the-box thinking on Raxxla), but where does that leave us? Still the same old problems and questions, eh?
