Please don't think I am being condescending when I say this (I certainly enjoy having posts to read in this thread!), but these recent discussions about rims and what-not seem to have brought us full circle... as in, all the way around the rim.

And so the (dark?) wheel turns... Next up will be someone overlaying the fan-made DW emblem on the galaxy map and proclaiming it marks out where Raxxla possibly is!

I'll finish by saying, please do continue the tin-foiling as I do enjoy reading it. I would be contributing myself but I am totally out of ideas and not even active in-game for now.

If “obfuscate” does imply “garbled” then an L class system might be a good place to hide Raxxla, so RA XX-A L, and other permutations?
