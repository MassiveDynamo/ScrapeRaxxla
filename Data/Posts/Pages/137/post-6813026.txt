On the spectrum version, there were the following missions:

Trumbles. Or was it Trimbles? Obviously based on the Star Trek episode. Buy them off a trader, they slowly but surely multiple and float in front of your view, and become annoying. Cook them near the sun to be rid of them;
Super Nova - transport citizens out of a system as the star increases in size real-time before you cook and die (another way to deal with the Trumbles);
Cloaking Device - blow the ship up that uncloaks at times and scoop the cargo - you then gained a cloaking device;
Thargoid Invasion - head to a system being overrun by Thargoids - they occupy a space station and you must destroy it.

Rock hermits were encountered regularly - basically they were a non-spinning asteroid.

Damn, that game was awesome for 1986 (I had the ZX not the BBC so had to wait).

Bit OT, but related to an earlier poster's musings on special missions.

Oh, yeah - Raxxla. I have no idea or ideas, no clue or clues. And an over abundance of tinfoil, tea and biscuits.
