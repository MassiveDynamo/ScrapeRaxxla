Oh.. I was convinced that Rebecca pointed us to the ~exact mYsTeRy, inside the RR tube. But as you probably know I also was convinced that it was about ghosts, dragons and Raxxla... It turned out in a different way and proved you right. No wonder nobody found the stranded ship until DW held our hand. So...FD-esque. Then, actually, I wont bet on any particular interpretation of the "clues" we currently have.
Though to be fair a couple of people got extremely close. I think SpocksOddSocks got to one system away...but without a breadcrumb trail to find it was always like a needle in a universe of haystacks; FD (& I think DreW) just didn't seem to realise how big the universe is for this treasure hunt. So eventually we had to be spoonfed the location which spoilt the whole hunt. A chain of deployed beacons would have been the obvious thing to put in-game, that's what the book said Zurara was deploying. But.......
