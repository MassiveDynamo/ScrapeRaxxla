Ah, but they were the docile Oresrian thargoids (so we are told). I predict in next year's update we'll come face to face with the ravening Klaxian horde, in a first-person shooter add-on.
FD have got to do it marketing wise to compete with Star Citizen's Squadron42, which may be released also next year (we hear!). But since I'm not into pew pew I'll probably be playing "Auntie Halsey's on-line guide to macrame" by then.

Salome Phase 1 (Official) - There's weird bad stuff in the Rift, but it's not Thargoids
Salome Phase 2 (Unofficial - CoR) - There's weird bad stuff in the Rift, but it's not Thargoids
Salome Phase 3 (Official) - There's bad humans who did stuff in the Rift, and oh look, Thargoids

I'm fully expecting TDW to be Thargoids - probably them Klaxians

No, I'm not still bitter*
