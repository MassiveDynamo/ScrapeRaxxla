They have to keep the forums and your memory clean! 8d

Do they understand how aweful it is they sell content and in other cases make games(not neccesarily this company) and then don't allow conversations on the subjects involved. I've run into too many cases like this in the last decade or so. Sadly we may never had the sense as a whole to reverse this nonsense.

Well, its a game without an age limit so I can see the need for a bad-language filter. This was just a silly example of it kicking in!

I posted a couple of links for you earlier about the ED star-naming convention. For some reason the first (Reddit) link comes up as a barely-readable image. I really don't understand the way this new forum thingy works!
