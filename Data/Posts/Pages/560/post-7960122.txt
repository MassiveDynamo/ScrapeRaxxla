..."solved rift mystery" tonight, pity I didn't play elite when it was current .. (play since mid of this April)...
...also found unknown NS 87 jumps ahead ...
so was thinking plenty - almost hit the star some ..
...I think all 6 parts of toast are different points of view to the same object. Nobody checked that it seems, like "apple is red and same apple is sweet".
And somehow I feel I need to check remnants in crab nebula, will be there on back way. Word "siren" hardly bounds to "supernova Ia" in my mind.

If to join alltogether
1. "siren" - some supernova, it was in crab (we can't catch new)
2. "whisper" - it should be NS (it is in crab)
3. "brow" - well, crab is on horn of tauri ...which is associated with Venus or Zeus in myphs.
...other 3 didn't figure yet also dunno what to search for there ...

It's my next hypothesis to check, now I've got fed up with BH (well, actually two more enroute). But it's a fallacy that you need six coordinates- Hollywood fluff! It's a 3D universe, so you just need three coordinates (four if you count time, but I don't personally think Raxxla is moving).
