Exploring the far MW in search of Raxxla is an enjoyable way to play the game. I did that for a couple of years. But I knew I was somewhat fooling myself, as no average Explorer just like no biowaste trucker is meant to stumble on it by chance. There is a journey to "travel" and its starting point has to be pretty close to the Bubble, IMHO.
