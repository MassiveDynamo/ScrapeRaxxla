anyone better at Simbad etc than me? I'm trying to check Scytale's Crown alternative to Cassiopeia - Corona Borealis in-game (well actually checking in EDSM). The brightest of the crown is alpha Corona Borealis, Alphecca (or Alphekka), Gemma (which means Jewel), Gnosia (Gnosia Stella Coronae), and Asteroth (or Ashtaroth). But I can't find any of those. Simbad says it's also 2MASS J15344125+264252, HD 139006, or HIP 76267, but I can't find any of those in EDSM either, which I find puzzling as I'm sure someone will have visitied it by now. Nor can I find Blaze Star (google references a burlesque dancer), T Corona Borealis which is a recurrent nova. Making me think there is something wrong with my browser accessing EDSM.

ah, checked in galmap - it's alphekka!
Spent a day there as well. It's a dull place.
