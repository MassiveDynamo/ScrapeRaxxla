Oh the amount of fun we had arguing about just that one line.

And then we got Thargoids anyway.

Ah, but they were the docile Oresrian thargoids (so we are told). I predict in next year's update we'll come face to face with the ravening Klaxian horde, in a first-person shooter add-on.
FD have got to do it marketing wise to compete with Star Citizen's Squadron42, which may be released also next year (we hear!). But since I'm not into pew pew I'll probably be playing "Auntie Halsey's on-line guide to macrame" by then.
