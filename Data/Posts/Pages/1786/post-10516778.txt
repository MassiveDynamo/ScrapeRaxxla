Dont know, other than further obfuscation for its own sake. But I conclude that FD clearly are intent on hiding the location of that (& presumably other ) comets. So the logical consequence is that EITHER:
1) it is NOT related to Raxxla - there's a difference between making something "very hard to find" (as raxxla was originally, from the Gamma, MB said so; and comets are very hard to find) and making it impossible to find, OR
2) FD do not want Raxxla to be found.
I think it's safe to assume comets were never a thing, and we were never meant to get into that "comet" instance. They most likely fixed it in Odyssey, which confirms it being a bug. So I think you can discard it as being related to Raxxla.
