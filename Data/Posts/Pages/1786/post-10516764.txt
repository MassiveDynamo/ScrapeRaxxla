But you might want first to try with a corrosion resistant cargo rack and a thargoid sensor...seems a likely possibility given we were told Raxxla is discussed in FD's secret alien lore book...
You know, I LIKE that idea - wasn't the whole point of sensors that you scanned them and they gave directions to another site ? I forget, I was never very good at it, kept breaking them when I tried to scan them after throwing them out my cargo scoop.
