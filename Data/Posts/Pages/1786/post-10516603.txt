Mm, then you may have to turn to the dark side and temporarily become a pirate...you dont need to kill the trader, just use hatch breaker limpets to open their cargo hatch and collector limpets to scoop the theTrinkets.

Arrr Jim lad, the rum's ok but not as good as Lavian brandy. And the wooden leg gets stuck on the cockpit floor.

But you might want first to try with a corrosion resistant cargo rack and a thargoid sensor...seems a likely possibility given we were told Raxxla is discussed in FD's secret alien lore book...
