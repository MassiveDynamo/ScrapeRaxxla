I was honking as close as I could to the comet, trying to make it appear. I've probably done 200 honks before I realised the deep space had vanished. At first I thought it was a lane straight up from the comet toward polaris, but then I realised it went 40LS in every direction
I would suggest get as many commanders into the comet instance as possible (maybe start with a PC pilot who can check the journal for comet bodyid), homing onto your beacon, and honk like a flock of Christmas geese!
Edit
Ah. Didnt know that console & PC players exist in separate universes....I just saw the other day a comment by DB (I'm slowly reviewing old livestreams circa 2015) that they existed in the same universe
