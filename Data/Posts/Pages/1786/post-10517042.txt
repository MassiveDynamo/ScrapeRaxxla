Does it matter where you honk - anywhere near the 6 stations .Do we need to organise a get-together honk with many CMDRs
I was honking as close as I could to the comet, trying to make it appear. I've probably done 200 honks before I realised the deep space had vanished. At first I thought it was a lane straight up from the comet toward polaris, but then I realised it went 40LS in every direction
