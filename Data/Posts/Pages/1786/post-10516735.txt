According to EDSM GB Plendovii is a Democracy. You want an anarchy system, else youll get a bounty and the garda will go for you. Last time I got some I had to go to Lang Wang, but a quick look at ED Inara says there Are plenty nearer to Shinrarta

Yes I find that odd too, I was only going off notices posted on various Wikis about Plendovii, I had actually found trinkets there several times before, which I found odd, although in hindsight they probably are simply transient. I don’t think enough has been done to investigate them, or if it has, it needs collating.

I’ve not attempted piracy for an absolute age, failing in the past either via boredom, objectivity or distraction. I am only now looking at doing it correctly, and will be using warp signature tracking to follow NPCs too, I’ll stick to anarchy system as you’ve kindly advised,

I have a good feeling about Trinkets. I’ve built up a little library of textual sources to postulate a little hypothesis, which I’ve posted previously, but I’m running out of general goals in game to perpetuate my interest, so just going back to these trinkets, as I want first hand experience of holding them.

To actually see what they now do and why and in particular where…again there are some peculiar locations which I have speculated could have had some relevance, but since their link via the missions were removed, trinkets general level of importance has become an unknown, but I speculate maybe it isn’t given they are our only feasibly physical link towards Raxxla (granted via a dead-end)…

Lady of Fate, we adore you.
