Apologies for being late to the party. Is the above a verbatim confirmation that comets are in the game?
i am asking for posterity btw.




Both the Magellanic clouds are front and center on the elite launcher and i don't think it is a coincidence.
(Barnard's Loop used to be front and center ingame until a certain event took place)




That quote refers to the Voyager probes, not raxxla. (hence the "more than once" part)

Comets have been in-game from the beginning, MB said so (see my signature for url to FD quotes thread); however they are just placeholders in StellarForge with no in-game visual implementation.

I found and read the Gamma2Secret thread yesterday-
https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/gamma-2-secret-added.71798/
that the comments applied to Voyager was a player assertion & MB never confirmed it, so it is still possible that they were actually about Raxxla, which was also inserted into game during the Gamma. I am keeping an open mind, but my confidence in those statements applying to Raxxla is much reduced.

There is nothing to say "more than once" cannot also apply to Raxxla.
