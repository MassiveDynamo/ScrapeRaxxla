You know, I LIKE that idea -
i'm guessing you must've missed it when i had already posted/suggested that idea earlier ---> https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10516342 ... ?

wasn't the whole point of sensors that you scanned them and they gave directions to another site ?
Are you referring to 'nav beacons' ? or 'tourist beacons' ?
Anyways, my theory about why i suggested ( asked ) about the 'Thargoid Sensor' item is similar to what others have suspected about the whole 'Trinket of Hidden Fortune' item. But again, what's the harm in trying/testing carrying these 2 items while searching? ( maybe sometimes Pirate or BH npc ships might come after you, however only in certain types of populated systems though )
