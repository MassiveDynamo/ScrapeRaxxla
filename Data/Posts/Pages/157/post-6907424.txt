Someone mentioned that the original 'obfiscated' missions had not been removed, that FDev had limited them to Jameson memorial in SD but no one has been able to unlock them since.
Can anyone cite a reference to a Dev stating this?

Raxxla may have always been in the game but have FDev moved the goal posts.
