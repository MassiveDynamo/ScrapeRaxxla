Sorry, but how's that? You mean Holtzman's No-"things"related ?
Could be. But lore says it would need an infinite sum of energy to obfuscate an entire planet.

Science says that it would require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object to the speed of light, a law of physics regularly broken in the Elite: Dangerous universe. Perhaps Raxxle possesses a device capable of generating infinite power? I'm sure that, where Raxxla in concerned, Frontier would be happy to break the ordinary laws of the game and, of course, of the universe.

Of course on of the few hints that we have, that you Scytale, have often quoted, is that 'it has to be a tiny bit obvious'. Well ... it is VERY obvious that Cassiopeia A is missing from the game. I mean, despite Mr. Brooks' assertion that Cas A simply wasn't in any of the stellar catalogs used to populate the galaxy, it seems pretty obvious that one of the most famous supernova remnants in history is just omitted. Any body fancy a trip?
