FRifters!

I just got back from a three week pilgrimage through Project Dynasty. Went down to the Rift, out to the Zurara, up and over to Hawking's Gap, and then across to the Conflux. Man, you guys were nuts....hats off to you, all! I had the coordinates and had trouble finding a few of them.

Banging around in Colonia remote engineering my farfleet for awhile.

Also, still no Raxxla.
