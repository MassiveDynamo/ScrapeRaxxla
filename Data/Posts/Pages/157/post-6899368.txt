This is probably nothing, which is why I'm not jumping up and down and plotting a route to anywhere any time soon. Though i feel, anything Raxxla, whether it be something we could possibly go on or nothing useful at all, still should be posted here. Though odds are this may have already been posted, considering the age of this forum.

This is a qoute from the link below:

''What is the meaning of RAXXLA numerology analysis. The connection between matter and spirit. These letters stand for material, money, power, ambition, strength, intelligence and courage. But it also represents pride, intolerance, domination and impulsiveness. Esoteric meaning leads us to the representation of material life and the spirit as two circles intertwined for infinite life''









Though keep in mind you can type in any word and get something on it. Such as the individual meaning of each letter but this website defines the word itself. I am unaware of where they sourced their own definitions from because anywhere else i can't find much on 'Raxxla'. Though what I found here is just to good and related to The Dark Wheel to ignore. Also it is easy enough for the person who named this place ''Raxxla'' to have used similar sources from books.









Quite funny and fitting. Would not surprise me if old Holdstock used the letters deliberately to get a fitting meaning.

Does not help us much with location though. Unless the two circles intertwined means something, that is.
