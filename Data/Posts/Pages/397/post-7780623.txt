Maybe XX marks the spot. what about replacing XX with all possible lexecon combinations and see if any system names or galmap results pop up.
There are only six known inhabited systems in Elite Dangerous which have the pattern ra??la

Arabela
Aurawala
Branglal
Draualang
Kaurawalaga
Yuragala

All of them have at least one extra letter, so it's probably nothing to do with any of them.


In the original Elite, Rainla (Galaxy 4) is the only one to fit the pattern, and the order of events involved in the writing of The Dark Wheel means that this is almost certainly coincidental.
