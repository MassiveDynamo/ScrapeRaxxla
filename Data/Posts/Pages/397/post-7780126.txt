Figured i would bring this up here as an odd coincidence that could raise further investigation.
While i was doing some Raxxla research with "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars" , "Omphalos Rift" and "Astrophel Stella" relationships
I took the information that Omphalos being Delphi. Plugged Delphi into Astrophel Stella which indicated it means Wisest Man, or something similar.
This led me to a passage in the book that i continued to focus on.
This passage notes Phoebos which has a direct relation to Apollo.
When i noticed Apollo was a system i figured i would head there and take a look to get started.
This is when i was given a random mission critical mission quest out of no where. With associated signal source in the system.
Upon investigating it turned out to be a simple fetch quest to collect 72 units of some type of oil and hand it in at the station nearby, but what interested me was it was for Elite Trader status only.
Having seen the rumors that Elite status was required to find Raxxla this raised my suspension.

So my question is, are the random missions biased on your current rank and is this a common event that just happened to show up while i was in the Apollo system?
Or is this a unique instance that warrants further investigation?
