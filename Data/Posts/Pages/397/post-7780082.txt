Hey Macros,

I don't have the in-game time to be able to assist materially with verifying 'Operation Less Than Three' personally, however I have been keeping a rolling list of factions that The Dark Wheel has missions for/against for a while now to see if I can collate any data points that might help narrow the focus a bit.

I'm trying to verify if there are a select few factions that remain on their constantly 'active' mission listing so I can focus on these myself.

I thought it might help you out a bit as I started this before your first posting about OL3.

Thank you very much for the list, CMDR. A quick eye-comparison tells me that there's a nice overlap of factions between our lists. Obviously factions are in flux when expanding/retracting to and from systems, so I'm considering how to capture this information.

As I have noted in the benevolent mission table, it appears that TDW in some instances gives both beneficiary and non-beneficiary missions to the same faction, which is a bit puzzling.

Is this something you have experienced?
