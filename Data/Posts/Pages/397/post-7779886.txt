Is the Dark Circle a secret order of galactic gynecologists ?

I am the soul of darkness, Abrasax, the eternal one, Michaēl, but my true name is Thōouth, Thōouth.

"Above the seven planetary spheres was an eighth, the sphere of the fixed stars. In the eighth sphere, these Gnostics taught, dwelt the mother to whom all these archons owed their origin, Sophia"

We used to recite the names of the 365 rulers of heavens and make our nuclear technology based on basilidian numerology. Sophia and Dynamis! Ours emblem is the monad and the supreme majesty of a star. Ho! Sax, Amun, Sax, Abrasax; for thou art the moon the chief of the stars!

I miss those days in the Archambault Terminal, I really do. Good times.
