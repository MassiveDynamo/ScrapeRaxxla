Why would they kill the only person that might know where it is? Just asking your thoughts.

The Cobra that killed Jason Ryder was probably working for 'the wicked men' that are on Raxxla(according to Rafe Zetter).

It would not surprise me if 'the wicked men' and the Club are the same thing.

The Cobra that killed Jason was also responsible for enslaving Elyssia Fields and her sister and killing the rest of her family as they escaped from Teorge. That could be a connection to Drew's clone ladies. Rebecca was part of the Club, long ago.
