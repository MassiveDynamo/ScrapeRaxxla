iPhone markups was the best I can do right now. But just compare the 2 and hopefully you get what I mean. Red is the planet/moon, blue is what looks like the opening/portal between witch space and normal space and yellow is the light (idk why I marked the light lol)

I see what you mean. Difficult to say if it is something or just an effect of the animation.

The best you can do is probably to repeat the jump a few times, to replicate it. If that works, you can change either destination or jump system, to see if you get the same shape in a different size or angle.

Testing over and over is the only way to get a confirmation on something this vague.
