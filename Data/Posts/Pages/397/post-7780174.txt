That is a good question about the rank. I think that if you stay in a system long enough, missions will pop up.
The mission arrived the moment i jumped into system. i was not even finished fuel scooping.
I did the mission by picking up the request from another nearby system. upon return to deliver , again i got the mission critical message the moment i entered the system.
once i deliver the goods i stop getting missions. i even stays in supercruise for a long time to see if i got another and nothing.

Edit: What caught me off guard was how fast the mission came in, and that it only happened in the Apollo system. none other that i jumped to.
I have seen these pop up before like you stated but i had been in system awhile before i was messaged. not the moment i entered the system.
Maybe someone else with elite status in trade or any i guess could jump into apollo to see if they get a mission critical notices right after jumping in.
Assuming they have not already done it. because mine stopped right after completing the quest.

(also of note, the Apollo system was unknown to me at the time, i had no system data available. so i do not feel it was a chain mission for that system.)
