I had a bit of a look round - it's the first eight moon gas giant I've found since becoming aware that eight moon gas giants were the thing - but didn't see anything. It's entirely possible, of course, that the big secret dark wheel base is fiendishly disguised as an utterly unremarkable ice moon 60000Ly from Sol.

No, TDW’s 8th moon station is not disguised as an ice moon, it’s just a normal toroidal station orbiting an ice moon but running at much reduced power so it won’t be detected very easily (remember ship’s scanners operate by heat detection), hence the need for visual location.

Raxxla, however, may be a different story. One of my hypotheses is that it’s an abandoned Guardian ark ship which has gathered sufficient cosmic dust & detritus over the millenia that it now resembles an ice moon. Of course it will be totally dead and incapable of any meaningful operational capability!
