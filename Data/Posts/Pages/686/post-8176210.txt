As opposed TRDW, The Real Dark Wheel, since we are unsure whether TDW in Shinrarta are the real deal!
Personally I doubt TDW in SD are legit. Supposedly, according to the Codex and therefore the people that make the game, they are on a station running low power to remain hidden orbiting the 8th moon of a gas giant. That doesnâ€™t match at all with Jameson memorial and if theyre so bent on remaining hidden why would they have a branch running out of JM offering milk run missions.
