do double check but fairly sure winking cat story dried up at the point of Galfluff announcement (no fake news )

They were last mentioned as part of the Alliance fest of culture which did run out the full length even though the announcement was made about half way through but the WC was before and not mentioned after - think its just Fdevs Pink Panther myself. Cant recall when THE TIONISLA GRAVEYARD (and yes I am shouting about it now) was mentioned, whether before or after but still not there...not cool fdev, not cool. (Is it there in the Beta? If it is don't tell me)

Edit: or were they, my own notes make no mention of WC at Alliane Festival, was it just before?

Data Hacking - go silent running just before limpet actually attaches, once started hacking can turn off SR again (I usually wait until I get the 'System Authorities will arrive in x seconds' message to be sure but thats just me). Think you may have to go SR again to pick up any ejected Mats (not sure if this is classed as criminal so test and let us know)

The no-fluff announcement was made on Aug 7. The last WC story was Aug 31.
