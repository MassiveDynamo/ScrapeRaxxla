I'm curious about Raxxia and though I've not read every thing possible about it, I can't help but wonder if anyone you more serious hunter have ever checked out the system that is locked behind a CQC progress or level basically a curtain of sorts. Apparently the name of the system is Attilius and has to my knowledge at least one orbit station.

Did some basic research and though I've found some cmdr's that have unlocked the permit needed to enter. Only utilize it for it hughs discounts. Non of them do any exploration or had thoughts of Raxxia while there.
