About 8 pages back someone had found a location inside of an asteroid belt. Cant remember if it was in Shin or lft 926 but it was dark wheel affiliated.
What’s this you say? A location in a Belt? That’s interesting and would love to see it. After reading and here the wheel I thought something might be hidden in a belt and that would make it tough to find. Nvm that most everyone ignores them altogether.
