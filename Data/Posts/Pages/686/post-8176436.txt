The Codex says that TDW will issue a test to people it intends to invite to the organization via a person who will not reveal who they are initially until they PSA said test. Perhaps we have all already been issued that message of a test. The game manual says that our FreeWinder was given to us by a mysterious benefactor from an equally mysterious organization. And that what we do with it constitutes out test and determined is we will find out more about them.
