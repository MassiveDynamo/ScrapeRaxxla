I have the permit, the system name is CD-43 11917. The station is Attilus Orbital. I must admit I haven’t had a really good look there personally. I can poke around next time I’m online.
Considering all of the possible permitted systems and area's of space that are totally unlock-able by Fdev, to the one's that actually are unlock-able; It's the only system anywhere that does not require one to be allied with any faction in the game. It's tied to the one and only aspect of the game that's not tied directly to the game, CQC. Though there are a variety of reason's most player avoid CQC entirely. Those that do generally only do it for the status and possible discounts. With my limited research, I've not found any one who's acquired the permit that has ever done any serious exploration in there. Though Fdev has admitted the fact that there was at least one, doesn't mean there hasn't been others. And that for what ever reasons like not caring to explore or doing anything but fulfill their particular agenda which didn't include Raxxia. Afterwards, just proceeded on to their next endeavor.

Perhaps you'll be lucky and be the one who finds it there. If so, remember me. Good Luck Cmdr!
