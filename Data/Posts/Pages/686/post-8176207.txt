Allegedly there was a Twitter response, regarding the question as to whether a special ship/ permit was needed to access Raxxla and they replied back, stating that it has been visitable since 2015 and does not require a special ship, or permit to access.

True, or False? Still, it's not saying much because there are plenty of places to hide it in plain site without having to resort to the more obvious locked systems, or some far and away Owl Nebula, or other obvious places that the extreme explorer is going to try and reach. There are literally billions of stars, too, so they're not just going to lock it in some random star system --it would never be found in a human life time. Therefore it IS sure to be hiding under our noses. Or, rather, the gateway to it is.
I remember the words, but I think that was for the Formadine Rift.
Not 100% sure though.
