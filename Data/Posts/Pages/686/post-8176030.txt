Honestly, has anyone tried flying counter(?) clockwise around Lave 7 times and jumping to Tionisla (however you spell it)? I can't remember the exact amount of jumps it had to be within, but seems like the obvious first choice and I have yet to come a cross a thread where that was a mentioned attempt. I get that Raxxla is no longer supposed to be in Lave, however FDEV may not be taking the written text of Raxxla too literally, since it's not true Elite lore, but more of a tale/ sub-tale surrounded by the politics and conspiracy of the Dark Wheel...heck it may only just be a legend and naysay...who knows? But they may include a puzzle mechanic, for any suspected systems. The point being that a gateway had prevoiusly protected access to Raxxla. It may still yet again.
