Strictly speaking, while DB has stated Raxxla has been in-game from the outset (gamma) I donâ€™t recall any statements from FD that tell us it actually is accessible. We are just working on the assumption/hope that it is. This has been raised several times in this thread- we need someone to grab DB during his next livestream and get his answer to this specific question! If a second question was raised as to whether it is locked behind a permit, that answer would also be really useful!

Allegedly there was a Twitter response, regarding the question as to whether a special ship/ permit was needed to access Raxxla and they replied back, stating that it has been visitable since 2015 and does not require a special ship, or permit to access.

True, or False? Still, it's not saying much because there are plenty of places to hide it in plain site without having to resort to the more obvious locked systems, or some far and away Owl Nebula, or other obvious places that the extreme explorer is going to try and reach. There are literally billions of stars, too, so they're not just going to lock it in some random star system --it would never be found in a human life time. Therefore it IS sure to be hiding under our noses. Or, rather, the gateway to it is.
