I do like the Winking Cat as a Cheshire Cat... something of a "guiding spirit"
I am imagining it has to do with the club storyline though
Combine it with some other possible Alice (chesspiece names?)

I like this as well. I think the Winking Cat wants to throw a wrench in the clubs plans. The discovery of Raxxla could very well do that.

My personal theory is that it’s one of the guardian cities that has forcefields enveloping it (I know forcefield cities were mentioned in guardian lore) populated with at least one powerful AI (Sentient AI being mentioned as outlawed frequently is done for a reason imo)

It would also tie in how all these security measures get bypassed so easily in these articles.

Rogue AI was mentioned in the past as something they wanted in the Galaxy but I don’t think we’ve stumbled upon that in a meaningful way at least.

The Club being this all knowing group that manipulates humanity irks me. If Raxxla or (whatever it is winking cat is hinting at) can upset that balance, please flip the switch.

Just my two cents on the club subject.
