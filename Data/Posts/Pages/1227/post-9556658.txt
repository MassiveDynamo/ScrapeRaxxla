The first Elite itself used the term Galaxies to describe areas that are within the current Elite Dangerous galaxy… i dont think it impossible that the Saramandara Pearls could have been reconstrued as a star cluster to fit in as well.
Especially as the pearls are supposed to be the home of the raxxlans (according to TAW)…. And raxxla is supposed to exist in game…
agreed, but TAW itself doesn't say they are in the Milky way. sure some reinterpretation is possible.
