Once again you embelish in order to support your 'theories'. Saramandarian pearls is a part of a cluster of "200 galaxies" in TAW world. See p15. In fact the universe of TAW has a rather peculiar topography..
The first Elite itself used the term Galaxies to describe areas that are within the current Elite Dangerous galaxy… i dont think it impossible that the Saramandara Pearls could have been reconstrued as a star cluster to fit in as well.
Especially as the pearls are supposed to be the home of the raxxlans (according to TAW)…. And raxxla is supposed to exist in game…
