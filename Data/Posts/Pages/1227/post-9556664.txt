So it isn't a traditional lock (though considering this game's obsession with Chthonic gods/goddesses and Lunar gods/goddesses it wouldn't surprise me if the moon is key to the lore ultimately). That said I swear it mentioned permit on the description panel (will get a screenshot when I play next).
I don't have the source for this at this time, however I was under the impression that the moon is not landable because FD wanted to model it exactly (well, as accurately as possible). Because of that I guess they've not had time to do it. I don't think there's much more to it than that. IIRC the information about this stretches back to the very early days of development, possibly during the first alpha/beta, but I might be wrong.
