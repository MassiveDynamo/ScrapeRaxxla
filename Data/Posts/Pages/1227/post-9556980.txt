So it isn't a traditional lock (though considering this game's obsession with Chthonic gods/goddesses and Lunar gods/goddesses it wouldn't surprise me if the moon is key to the lore ultimately). That said I swear it mentioned permit on the description panel (will get a screenshot when I play next).
The description panel says, This location requires a permit. There is a Moon permit in ED. It's just not possible to obtain. I don't know why they have skipped the red arc on the Moon, in the system map?
