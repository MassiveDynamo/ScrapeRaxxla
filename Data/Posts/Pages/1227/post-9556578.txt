Once again you embelish in order to support your 'theories'. Saramandarian pearls is a part of a cluster of "200 galaxies" in TAW world. See p15. In fact the universe of TAW has a rather peculiar topography..
Not saying it is.. there are actually many references in the Milky Way that would fit jewel/gem/pearl. It was one of the more obvious ones. No certainty there, just guesswork about connections. It would be nice if there were fewer possibilities. That said see this attachment for why I think there is an exceptionally strong lore case for Sol.
