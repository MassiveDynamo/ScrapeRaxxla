@Rochester, Right On Commander! ... And good luck in your travels.

If you feel inclined, why not start a 'journeyman' thread in this area for us to follow? Other than collecting your own notes it's a great way to share information and also remind yourself where you're going... And for us to know what you're up to.

Obviously my first thought is on the fact that your new CMDR will be nowhere near ---- ELITE ---- and that my idea is that we need to be 'some level' (but what?) in order for the missions to 'trigger'... If in fact they do, at all. 1x Elite? 4x Elite? Founder? Founder + nx Elite? We simply don't know.

Either way, Raxxlaspeed and I hope that you make some progress!
