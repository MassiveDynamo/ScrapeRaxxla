This is just an additional idea especially given two key factors: Open Clusters almost always get stretched and Frontier Developments went to considerable issues to model the galaxy. This means "pearls"/"jewels" could have several key meanings:

Potential Possibilities:
Globular Clusters
Open Clusters
Stellar Streams (can be either ripped apart globular clusters, open clusters, or dwarf galaxies).
Stellar associations and moving groups
The reason I say this is the Milky way has quite the collection of necklaces.. (image from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stellar_streams#Milky_Way_streams). This may very well explain TAW's mention of galaxies / sectors (as these in a way could be both). The other possibility is stellar associations and moving groups: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearby_stellar_associations_and_moving_groups
