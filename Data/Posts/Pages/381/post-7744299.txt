First, thanks for digging up the tourist beacon "child's hand" shot and second...

Absolutely, with one hundred percent certainty, not! And, since nobody had found Raxxla by the time the Guardians first started showing up, I sincerely hope they did take full advantage of the opportunity to weave an even deeper narrative, assuming they didn't have that planned the whole time of course, lol
Always glad to clear any doubts with facts.

Assuming that the old missions given by the Dark Wheel were the pathway to Raxxla, something else must have replaced them.
They already retconned a ruined Anaconda with the remains of the Zurara megaship in the Formidine Rift story, although minimally, but nevertheless it wouldn't be the first time for them...
