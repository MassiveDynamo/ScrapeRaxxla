Always glad to clear any doubts with facts.

Assuming that the old missions given by the Dark Wheel were the pathway to Raxxla, something else must have replaced them.
They already retconned a ruined Anaconda with the remains of the Zurara megaship in the Formidine Rift story, although minimally, but nevertheless it wouldn't be the first time for them...
It wouldn’t even be retcon. The Guardians have been in FD’s story plans since long before release.
A lot of what we see now, has been planed since the mid 90’s. Braben probably had plans for expantion packs for FFE back then, so quite a bit of story was left unused.
Changes have been made and new stuff added to fit a multiplayer world, but the main idea for the universe is quite old.
