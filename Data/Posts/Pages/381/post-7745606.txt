Not sure if they were a direct pathway to Raxxla.. If so Macros would have been there with all the missions he did
I can't be sure either, that's why it's just an assumption. Because of their uniqueness and SAP cores it's a reasonable assumption.
That's why I intend to do missions that TDW and their allies give.

Edit: I want to see if becoming allied with the allies and doing difficult missions (and thus proving myself to TDW) will trigger something new.
