The obvious problem with Raxxla being related in any way to the Guardians is of course, that one has been kicking around for three decades in real life, while the other is brand new to the franchise with the Dangerous launch. Raxxla was apparently included at day zero but the Guardians showed up much later.
Can you with certainty exclude the possibility that FDev retconned it to better fit or have a richer narrative?
