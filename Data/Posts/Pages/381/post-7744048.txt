Yeah this is more reasonable explanation. Where do you believe the obelisk be portrayed on the icon?
It's not, but it is implied by the three equidistant radiating curves surrounding the central circle and dot motif although at this stage we've only seen obelisks that radiate light, and are accessible from the centre of one facet, instead of all three which is making me wonder if there's a more active, less derelict site to discover.
