I think this is where a lot of the omphalos arguments are coming from...

I wouldn't think it big enough to be an Omphalos ... maybe a Jewel though.

Assuming that the old missions given by the Dark Wheel were the pathway to Raxxla, something else must have replaced them.

Not sure if they were a direct pathway to Raxxla.. If so Macros would have been there with all the missions he did
But as I understand it the SAP 8 Cores were data crystals that possibly were a map or atleast had coordinates which pointed somewhere...

The martian relic is not described except for size, but I can imagine a Jewel or a Data Crystal being the same.
What if the martian relic was a data crystal and pointed to a location... and people went there?
Eotienses and Alioth were settled soon after the relic was found.
