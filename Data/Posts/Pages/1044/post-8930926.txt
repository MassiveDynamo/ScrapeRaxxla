Just found this link to the early newsletters
Newsletter Archive - Complete List
Hello All, I got to looking for some old newsletters and found out there isn't a good archive listing of them. So, instead of playing today, the day before release, I decided to put together a list for everyone. Please let me know if I missed any or if these are broken and I will fix them...
