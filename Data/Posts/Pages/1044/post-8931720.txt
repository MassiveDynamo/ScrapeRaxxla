I think the alien artifact is nothing more than a pop culture reference to Total Recall. Here is a pretty neat short video showing why.

It's not unlikely that the Mars artefact was a reference to Total Recall, back in 1993. The film was fairly new at that time.
It is also very likely that the artefact helped kick-start human terraforming, considering these timestamps from the FE2 timeline.
2170s - First attempt to terra-form Mars started.
2200s - Earth environmental recovery program started, terraforming of Mars abandoned.
2270s - Second attempt to terra-form Mars started.
2280s - Discovery of first non-human relic in space. Origin still unknown in 3200.
2290s - First man "outside" on Mars (ie breathing unaided) on completion of terraforming.

The artefact has however gotten a deeper role in ED. Braben mentioned in an old interview, that it was an important mystery.

It's also easy to get carried away, when searching for connections. Quator, for example is an old proc. gen. name from the original Elite. It's far older than Total Recall.
