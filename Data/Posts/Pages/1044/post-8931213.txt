Two possible ideas, obviously this is all a long shot, but hear me out.

So, I just stumbled upon this thread after noticing the Raxxla logo looks an awful lot like one of the reference constellations I used in the army. (tactical satcom)
Winter hexagon, which also housed the winter triangle placing Betelgeuse at the center of the hexagon.

Alternatively, and FAR more likely, is that it is modeled after in game elements.
The symbol is a Targeting reticle looking at an 18 probe planet using the DSS.
The points at which you shoot the probes just lines up way too well.
Which could mean one of 2 things, that it is a huge planet, or FDev is trolling the F out of us by making the symbol a surface scanner...

If it is a hint, FDev is possibly telling us we've scanned the planet, and did not see the site on it. (easy to do in a hurry)
Gesturing towards a specific planet size, that would narrow it down significantly.
In theory, if previously scanned, one would need to see the size of a planet needing that many probes.
Then search the databases for matches.
