I was on that very thought... but the logo didn't quite match my thinking...

The reason I'd gone down this line is as a result of looking for the asteroid clusters in Sol.

You slowly cruise about and an asteroid cluster appears on your target holo and you can't select it from the map, pretty sure it's been that way since the start of the game.

My thinking was around whether this is the game mechanic that keeps the Dark Wheel station hidden?

The Dark Wheel station... The station was a toroid design that was kept on minimal power to avoid detection, hence the name "Dark Wheel".

Toroid is the Orbis stations and seeing the picture you pointed out.....





Think I'm running out of tin foil ;-)

The logo is just the station viewed from the front? That would tell us nothing, I prefer to think it's a map.
