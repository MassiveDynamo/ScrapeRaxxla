Ooh, do you have a reference for that DB quote?
I agree it is important, it is a significant part of my hypothesis that Raxxla is hidden somewhere in Sol. It would be nice to hear the word on this!
It's from an old video interview(pre release?). I don't remember exactly which one.
If Drew is still lurking, he may remember. I think the artefact was mentioned in authors guide, as well.

Edit: There is no mention of Raxxla, in connection with the artefact.
