My biggest issue is and always has been that it's impossible to differentiate between what's intended and what's a bug. This wouldn't be a problem if FDev stepped in and said "sorry guys that's a bug" but because it probably suits them to keep this "mystery" or indeed any mystery going, they wont.

It's incredibly unfair to be honest to be searching for a needle in a galaxy sized haystack when the haystack is full of fake broken needles.

I can deal with FDev not dropping raxxla clues or hints but I think it's beyond unfair if they knowingly let us chase shadows they've created in error, that would be incredibly poor form and very damaging to customer trust.

I imagine they read this thread and we need to be able to believe that what we are doing and what we are seeing is intended.
