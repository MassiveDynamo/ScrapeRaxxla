That's what I mean by it could indicate that you're in the right star system. It may not be Sol. Looking at the logo it may mean that a more constant green glow could be an indication of the RAXXLA star system at the symbols on the logo could be 6 main planets, 33 moons, 3 asteroid clusters and RAXXLA, whatever it is.

But then again, it could be a lighting bug.
I don't think ship manufacturers install green glow bulbs in to every ship to indicate to you that you are close to Raxxla
People think too much outside of the game realities - they try to ''fight'' devs.
