Not many interesting TB's left though:

0001-0112 -Many in this area un-found, but these are User Submitted (I believe there was an FD appeal for interesting places for tourism)
0113-0251 - Elite History - these are all found
0252- this may be a history beacon as its on the boundary..
0253-0260 - A couple here in another User submitted section
0261-0499 - All found (Visitor)
0500-0508 - Elite history all found
0508-0548 - User submitted all found
0543-0619 - Volcanism - all found
0620 Odd Elite history beacon found
0621-0631 - user submitted - 1 not found (0630)
0632-0636 Elite history all found
0637 - on a boundary again not found and maybe user or history
0638-0649 - User sumbitted and found
0649 - a leesti oriented history beacon
0650 - 0663 - The most interesting - a batch of not found beacons in a history section
0664 - 0715 - History beacons all found

TL/DR - there are only one batch of 14 all in a sequence that arent found and are not user submitted.. this smells like an area that hasnt been unlocked...
Timing wise contemporary with introduction of Bark Mounds
