What would raxxla need to offer to the game to not be a complete and utter failure for all the years of mystery?

I much prefer the first option you presented but agree the second option would probably be easier and thus more likely.

It would be amazing to be transported to a different version of the simulated galaxy we currently occupy. Things are mostly the same, I don’t imagine things would be vastly different due to technical constraints.

Maybe it is a peaceful galaxy where the Guardians now reside, and their lack of conflict has allowed them to focus on the betterment of the galaxy they live in. Things like Dyson spheres and wormholes are abundant, and natural wonders could be created and organised at a whim. We would have the option to interact with the Guardians in a peaceful manner, and there would be new technological wonders to discover. We could then bring back the knowledge we have gained to our own galaxy to create new ships and modules.

Maybe it is a galaxy that is overrun with Thargoids, and every second spent in it is a battle for survival. We would have to learn a lot about the Thargoids and it would likely be easier to discover their source and weaknesses. This knowledge could prove invaluable in defeating the ‘goids in our own galaxy.

Maybe set during a time where the Guardians and Thargoids were at war, and helping either faction was a valid option that had various rewards. Like the other two galaxies, the rewards we gain could be in the form of new blueprints for new ships, modules and/or engineer mods.

Perhaps previous player actions determine the galaxy you are transported to.

I know all of that sounds a bit outrageous, and is clearly based on nothing more than tin foil hattery, but something along those lines would make the search worth while in my opinion ¯\(ツ)/¯
