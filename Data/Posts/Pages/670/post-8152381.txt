Relationship mapping the ED tourist beacons didn't actually take as much time as I thought it would; and ultimately resolved nothing.

If there are any clues towards Raxxla in game Im resolute its only from the Codex.

Drawing intelligence from other data could provide insight but I'm imagining the dataset would need to be huge, and that's a time-sink Im not keen on tackling.

A shame as it points to the possibility the location is arbitrary and tge Codex was wrapped around it, no carefully constructed (which would mean it could have been reverse analysed).

Likely thats wrong too. Its probably like most things; hidden in plain sight.

There are still a considerable number of Tourist Beacons undiscovered / not listed in the spreadsheet?
