Has anyone made a really determined effort at opening those doors? We get “guardian keys” from the orbiting stations to get blueprints but has anyone tried them on those bunker doors?
That is an interesting idea. I have done the Ram Tah missions previously, but the Guardian space structures with the keys happened whilst I was off game. I have tried to avoid looking up too much info or watch any videos because I would like to see these things for the first time in game, so I admittedly don’t know all that much about them.

Maybe the key does open the door? Or the Key + another guardian or thargoid item could have some kind of use?

Also as a side note; Great discussion going on in here. These sorts of discussions about the game and its many mysteries are some of my favourite parts of Elite Dangerous. Even if it is mostly speculative, I quite enjoy reading through people’s ideas and trying to piece together the puzzles we have been presented with.

o7 to you all
