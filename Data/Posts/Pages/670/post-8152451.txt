Thats my point, we need more data. The more information the greater liklihood of a pattern emerges. At least thats 'something' I suppose.

Twas a longshot and my disappointment is solely from having to stoop towards applying such a process to 'maybe' extrapolate meaning 'from a game'. I mean its not like RL.

I suppose I'm just missing the older DW missions; at least they implied 'something' could have been discovered. (And I still suspect we got too close too soon). Relying on vague hints and theories isn't normally enough. We need hard intel.

In these circumstances informants and 'third party' intel is normally applied.

Does anyone work as an office cleaner? Youd be surprised how many offices just leave information lying around....

Sorry that was a joke.
