Kudos to you cmdr, o7. It was Thomas Edison who said, " I haven't failed, I found 10000 ways that do not work"

Everything we try that doesnt pan out just narrows down the search. Because of this, no ones search efforts will ever be in vain.

Hold your heads high cmdrs, and press on into that cold unfeeling darkness. This galaxy is ours and its secrets shall be as well!

To Raxxla!!
