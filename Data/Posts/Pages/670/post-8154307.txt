Practically speaking I don't think we are going to get a new Galaxy to jump to...maybe a few new systems become accessible with easier to find mats or stuff but that would be it.

More likely we get a sense of achievement and a free paint kit ('My mate went to Raxxla and all I got was this paint kit)

Pretty much whatever it is its going to be disappointing, its too mythical to be found and be rewarding.

Especially if only one player can find it and everyone else is just travelling to it from that point, we know where and what it is....or will we?
