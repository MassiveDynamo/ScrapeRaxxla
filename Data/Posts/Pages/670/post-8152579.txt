Thats my point, we need more data. The more information the greater liklihood of a pattern emerges. At least thats 'something' I suppose.

Twas a longshot and my disappointment is solely from having to stoop towards applying such a process to 'maybe' extrapolate meaning 'from a game'. I mean its not like RL.

I suppose I'm just missing the older DW missions; at least they implied 'something' could have been discovered. (And I still suspect we got too close too soon). Relying on vague hints and theories isn't normally enough. We need hard intel.

In these circumstances informants and 'third party' intel is normally applied.

Does anyone work as an office cleaner? Youd be surprised how many offices just leave information lying around....

Sorry that was a joke.

This is just speculation, but my gut feeling tells me that the E/F DW missions(and the Halsey story) were intended to lead to the discovery of the Guardians. We will never know FD's actual intentions, because the first ruin was found with an out of game method.
Michael Brookes once told that the narrative of Raxxla would play out in-game. I suspect that the Guardians were step one, in this narrative. The old missions were removed when they no longer served a purpose.

Not to long ago the story of Gan Romero figured in Galnet. It's somewhat similar to the Halsey story and I suspect it will lead to a second Guardian cluster that will teach us more about their history. I know a similar region has been found with Brain trees and a central permit locked region around a WR star. The location has not been revealed yet, to allow FD to execute their full plan.

That was a lot of speculation in one post.
