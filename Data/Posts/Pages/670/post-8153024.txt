If you've done both the Ram Tah missions you have to scan very specific obelisks to get the complete data set although some individual pieces appear in many sites. The point being, it's only one piece of data per obelisk, which would suggest they are no longer connected to the larger guardian network(s).

I'd like to see a fully functional Guardian site, maybe gain access via those underground bunker doors.

Has anyone made a really determined effort at opening those doors? We get “guardian keys” from the orbiting stations to get blueprints but has anyone tried them on those bunker doors?
