For me, the silverline of that interview is the "if you're at the correct place and you scan it enough..." and "it is most likelly to reveal itself". All of this implies at you have already to be somewhat sure of its location and then it would reveal itself once scanned enough.

There are some other curious things in Sol... I'm there right now parked inside the asteroid field and I was trying to fly in with my second account and even with wing beacons "On", I'm unable to drop together with myself... and according to EDDB, there are still the Kuiper belt and some other bodies not listed in Sol's in-game system map.

Edits: correcting typos
In RL, Jupiter has 79 known moons. In ED it has 4.
We aren't able to detect bodies smaller than 135km radius, unless they are in a cluster or a ring.

There are endless opportunities for hidden bodies in every system in general and Sol in particular.
