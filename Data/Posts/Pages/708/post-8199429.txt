I've been through ALL videos Frontier have available on their youtube channel and it is no longer there... they might have unlisted/removed it.

I went through all the FD YT channels a few months ago when I’d damaged my shoulder & couldn’t play. I suspect what you saw wasn’t an FD vid. It might have been an independent vid (he’s talked at TED, Baftas etc etc) or with a livestreamer; are you sure it was a video & not an audio podcast?

And are you sure of the date?
