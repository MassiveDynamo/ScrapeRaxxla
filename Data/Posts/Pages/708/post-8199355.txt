Stll trying to find the DB interview/presentation reported by Koben, so far unsuccessful but found a couple I hadn’t seen before.

I’m also only elite in trade & exploration. IFF DB said you have to be elite to find Raxxla (as per Koben’s claim) then I suspect it probably means in combat. We need to find that video!

I've been through ALL videos Frontier have available on their youtube channel and it is no longer there... they might have unlisted/removed it.
