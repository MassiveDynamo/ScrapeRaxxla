Sounds about right for the devs. They don't really know what they're doing in game either and that's laughable. I was watching a video once where they were talking about something but they were practicing manually docking their Corvette, terribly. I recently got my first Corvette after all of the FED rank bonus we had. Rather easy to manually dock I thought, I had no problems and i only recently started doing this manually. It just goes to show that they probably don't play their own game very much. I think the ones that do have perma noob.
