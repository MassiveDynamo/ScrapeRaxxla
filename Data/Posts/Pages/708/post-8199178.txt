Similar to the ground base in the system with the DW Installation then, according to GalMap owned by PF Local and DW is minor faction. PF don't run it though as controlling faction, cant remember who it is.

Confirm dust is from core roid mining, looks cool in that light though.

think Beagle Landing was named when the scientist died in memory of him, that was the reason one of them was named anyway, not sure its that one. So maybe not Christmas Eve related.

Anyone checked out EDSM dashboard map recently? Mine shows Santa leaving Beagle Point on a route to the bubble, is it a message, am I special?

Well, on DW2 I took several weeks to get to Beagle Point. Hope Dancer, Prancer and Rudolph have had a good meal of quirium-soaked oats otherwise Santa wonâ€™t get to Earth on time, never mind deliver all those presents to every child on the planet during Christmas night!
