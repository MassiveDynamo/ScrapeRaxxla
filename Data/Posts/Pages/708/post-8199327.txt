At the risk of dredging up a long buried section of this thread for not much gain, I just want to seek the collective wisdom on the latest 'Job Offer' messages and any relevance to rankings with PF in my quest for TDW/TRDW.

I decided on a whim to re-visit the SD beacons on the PF / Elite and was scanning the Pilots Federation Near Monopoly when I received a Job Offer invitation.

Has anyone else ran into this in Shinrarta Dezhra specifically?


I should clarify I'm only double Elite (still climbing in Combat), and am fully Allied with the DW but no one else in SD.

Fairly sure I’ve had JO in SD, but they seem the same as anywhere else. Seem to pop up after 30 mins or more in-system, got a few on my travels out to Hutton Orbital. But FD could well use a common mechanism as a TRDW test, so the only solution is to successfully complete those & see if anything happens.

Stll trying to find the DB interview/presentation reported by Koben, so far unsuccessful but found a couple I hadn’t seen before.

I’m wondering if the test is to get allied with “PilotsFederation” by killing goids as that seems to be the only mechanism to rank with that particular variation of PF. But still believe we also need to find TRDW station & think that should be locateable.

I’m also only elite in trade & exploration. IFF DB said you have to be elite to find Raxxla (as per Koben’s claim) then I suspect it probably means in combat. We need to find that video!
