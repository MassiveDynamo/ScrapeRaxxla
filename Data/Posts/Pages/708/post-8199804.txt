The point about Sol is that EDDB shows a couple of bodies listed, also some asteroid fields... and they do not appear on system map but I was able to find one of the asteroid fields and I'm parked at it.
Youâ€™re parked at a body not listed in your system map? It must be listed in the contacts at least yeah?
