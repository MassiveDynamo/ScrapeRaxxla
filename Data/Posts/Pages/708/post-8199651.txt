Just found an interesting interview with DB https://www.pcgamer.com/david-braben-on-arena-and-the-future-of-elite-dangerous/ :

“There are missions out there I know almost no players have seen,”... need to befriend the minor factions....missions take you round the galaxy...
Might be the way?

DB "It’s a shame, because the missions actually drive you around the galaxy. But if you keep going back to the same place, you won’t venture very far."

Did Fd originally hold expectations for Cmdr to follow a certain route. Did FD build in some kind of 'grand tour'...or is this arbitrary?

MB "It's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves."
