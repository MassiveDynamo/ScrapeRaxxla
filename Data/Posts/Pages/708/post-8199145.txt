I have to also agree with machina ergo sum about tdw being the actual shadow controlling faction and PFLB being a puppet .

I doubt that TDW controls much. I don't think they are interested in controlling anything.
The TDW agenda is to find truth and treasure. Their goal seem to be to stay uncontrollable, not to take control.
