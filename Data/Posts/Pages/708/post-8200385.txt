AFAIK this was indeed said and documented - but also AFAIK (correct me if I'm wrong) the Devs sometime thereafter specifically checked the Mission System and it was discovered that the supposed "Special Missions" never appeared for anyone. They didn't even spawn, thus they never existed by any practical means.

(remember the old Pre-Horizons Mission System never "drove you around the Galaxy", far from it. It wasn't until LongRange Passenger Missions and LongRange Courier Missions were introduced when Players were tasked to travel very considerable distances. After the payouts were nerfed & capped, that entire Mission Branch basically died with very few CMDRs accepting such poorly paid time sinks)

I don't think I'd ever find that Info again though, way too long ago. I believe the check was done in regard to missing Founder Missions and in conjunction with those Dark Wheel Data Crystal Missions at the time - none of which ever resulted in anything interesting either.

Either way, the statements were rather confusing than clearing anything up. Almost like they were talking about an entirely different Game or something.
