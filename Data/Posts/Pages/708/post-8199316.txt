At the risk of dredging up a long buried section of this thread for not much gain, I just want to seek the collective wisdom on the latest 'Job Offer' messages and any relevance to rankings with PF in my quest for TDW/TRDW.

I decided on a whim to re-visit the SD beacons on the PF / Elite and was scanning the Pilots Federation Near Monopoly when I received a Job Offer invitation.

Has anyone else ran into this in Shinrarta Dezhra specifically?

SPOILER: JOB OFFER

I should clarify I'm only double Elite (still climbing in Combat), and am fully Allied with the DW but no one else in SD.
