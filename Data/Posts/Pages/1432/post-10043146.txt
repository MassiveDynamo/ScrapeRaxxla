I've not heard of Brenquith's 'glistering legacy'. That specific phrase was not applied to him in anything I worked on. Where did you find it?
You have to understand this one caught me off guard. I merely wanted all that was in the First Encounters journals to have a enough legitimacy to be viable for two purposes: Holdstock version of Raxxla and peace with the Thargoids. These depend upon Sohalian Fever and Mycoid being used initially defensively not offensively (specifically against the threat of artificial intelligence, androids, and to a lesser degree cyborgs). We needed the real possibility that the Alliance did actually deliver the antidote . There is also the "Another Species?" journal entry which I believe is where the Guardian narrative originates (really hoping for a narrative plot twist eventually forcing an alliance between Thargoids and Humanity against the Guardian Civil AI and the rogue Human AI from the end of Nemorensis). Anyway, this was on tourist beacon #216 "Ackwada Discovery" towards the end of the second paragraph cited below:

The discovery aroused considerable interest amongst archeologists on Earth at the time while the capsule was in transit to the New Delhi University there was heated debate as to whether the artefact should be opened or not. When the capsule was studied, the seal was seen to be broken, so the matter was resolved. Inside the capsule was a message crystal with the log of the second five years of Augustus Brenquith's solitary search for new worlds, his 'glittering legacy', included in the list of planetary systems that he had stumbled upon was that of Ackwada.
