To my knowledge, that is primary source of the claim. I mean if FDev choose to highlight it, possibly it is important. My post citing it is here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10042210
That doesnt suggest there was a failed colony, only that water was detected and that later efforts were difficult. The date applies to the detection, which could indicate a probe or telescope found water.

There is no documentation to my knowledge of a failed colony. So, based on the evidence provided, I think this is a false conclusion.
