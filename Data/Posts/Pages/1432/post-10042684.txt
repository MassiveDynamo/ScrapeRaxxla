Apologies - I was just ordering a list from a previous post. Us developers - if I see an unordered list I HAVE to pipe it through sort!

In the words of Manuel from Faulty Towers... "I know nooooottthhing"!

POST EDIT - here's the link: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10041796
I suspect someone was hoping for something other than the official in-game system description. Though, why? In-game sourcing is pretty damn authoritative. The planet was Eden and after we realized Proxima Centauri was problematic due to radiation and flares so building a colony was abandoned as not realistic (per description water was detected in 2038). All that is left is a research base (hopefully we can one day visit it in-game). Unless you like being crispy critters I don't advise visiting Eden for extended stays without sufficient protection. In real-life this problem has already been observed recently in 2021 when a flare was visible to the naked eye on Earth and also previously in 2016.

To my knowledge, that is primary source of the claim. I mean if FDev choose to highlight it, possibly it is important. My post citing it is here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10042210
