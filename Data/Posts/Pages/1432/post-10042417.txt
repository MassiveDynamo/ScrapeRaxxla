This came from the first manual written by Robert Holdstock. Curiously we may have not yet seen a full-scale dredger or perhaps they operate as fleets (but oh my god - 40 miles long). The 70,000 is direct from the manual.
The manual wasn't written by Robert Holdstock. The novella was written by Robert Holdstock.

David Braben is a big fan of Traveller the RPG.

I've not heard of 'player submitted lore' that became official. I'm sure some has, but I'm skeptical of anything from the very early period being made official through a process like that. The official documentation was created by the small group I mentioned before and refined internally.
