The manual wasn't written by Robert Holdstock. The novella was written by Robert Holdstock.

David Braben is a big fan of Traveller the RPG.

I've not heard of 'player submitted lore' that became official. I'm sure some has, but I'm skeptical of anything from the very early period being made official through a process like that. The official documentation was created by the small group I mentioned before and refined internally.
Interesting. I thought he did the manual and novella. Good to know.
