Does anyone have the clip or text from Frontier Developments (possibly this was Braben or Michael Brookes but unsure) discussing what the Elite logo actually is? I am pretty sure it wasn't a phoenix but a griffin/gryphon or some creature vaguely reminiscent of something from Sumeria or Egypt. That discussion might be important. I am 99.9% sure Jaques is intentionally named because he is a supplanter of a character that is more important. The Hebrew origins are detailed here and various sites discussing baby names (this may have been relevant in the Shakespeare play that prominently featured a character with the same spelling of the name Jaques but haven't read it). Relevant text:

Jaques is a variation of the French Jacques (which is related to the English James), which means “supplanter” or one who is lesser but replaces one who is greater. There is also the possibility that Jaques is derived from the Hebrew Jacob, or “may God protect.” Of course, those seem to be contradictory… had God protected the greater one, he would have never been supplanted.

By the way the pronunciation is as follows (also from same webpage):
And, by the way, not pronounced like “Jack” or “Jacques”… no, pronounced two syllables, as either “JAY-kweez” or “JACK-wis” (has to be two syllables for the scansion to work right).
