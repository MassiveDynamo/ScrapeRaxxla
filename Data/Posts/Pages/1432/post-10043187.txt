Okay, so are you saying there is no reference to Brenquith's 'glistering legacy'? You created that reference?
Forgive me, that was dyslexia striking. The reference is "glittering legacy" in the beacon vs glisters in David Massey's titled story "..All that Glisters" that specifically mentioned Augustus Brenquith. The two terms, however, are absolutely synonymous. It is early where I live and I haven't had coffee. You may be interested in newsletter#61 (attached).
