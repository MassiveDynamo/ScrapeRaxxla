Forgive me, that was dyslexia striking. The reference is "glittering legacy" in the beacon vs glisters in David Massey's titled story "..All that Glisters" that specifically mentioned Augustus Brenquith. The two terms, however, are absolutely synonymous. It is early where I live and I haven't had coffee.
Sure, happy to forgive any honest mistake. Yes, I agree the two words have linked etymology and meaning. However, as I've indicated, I wouldn't link Brenquith and Jacques through the use of similar words by two different authors. If they were a link, you have to ask, why not use the same word?

Additionally, Brenquith's adventures are celebrated as incredible achievements. That suggests he was either a pre-hyperspace explorer or a very early hyperspace explorer. The 'Griffin' mentioned as being his ship is not connected to the later 'Griffin' class in Frontier First Encounters.
