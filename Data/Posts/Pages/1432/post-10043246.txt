I am 99.9% sure Jaques which is intentionally named because he is a supplanter of a character that is more important. The Hebrew origins are detailed here and various sites discussing baby names (this may have been relevant in the Shakespeare play that prominently featured a character with the same spelling of the name Jaques but haven't read it).
My reading (if there is any significance in the name choice) is that the name is in reference to his physiology as a cybernetically enhanced individual. The 'supplanting' is of his own human physiology within the story, which he mentions by describing how different parts of him have different origins. I wouldn't read that as being any more significant than that - it is an internal reference to the story, not some wider narrative related to the fictional history.
