Okay, so are you saying there is no reference to Brenquith's 'glistering legacy'? You created that reference?

The 'glittering legacy' is from the Ackwada reference in the Frontier Gazetteer. This was written by Kathy inson (surname strangely censored). The Jacques story was by David Massey. Massey also wrote entries in the Gazetteer. Whilst these were definitely read by the authors, I wouldn't link 'glitter' with 'glister' directly.

The Jacques story is an intertextual paradise of exposition. There are lots of connections to different ideas, and historical snippets specifically because of Jacques' long lifespan. My criticism of the text would be that Massey was trying to balance that without establishing a sage character who could effectively be seen as the font of all knowledge in the fictional universe. The way Jacques' conscious memories are linked to his perspective and how the data feed of his cybernetic mind is something he's not keen on at times are part of that as is his small perspective, reminiscing about the war days, but then shifting to a personal story, not a complete encyclopedic overview. Potentially, Jacques can be a problem character for the ongoing narrative. His knowledge of the past could supersede the established canon and should provide answers to mysteries that occurred in his extended lifetime, unless there is a reason he can't. Fairly easy to establish the latter in his lifetime. Data stores burn out, etc.
