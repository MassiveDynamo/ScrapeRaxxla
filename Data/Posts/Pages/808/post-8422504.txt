If memory serves the quote in question comes to us second hand. Drew Wagar had a face to face conversation with David Braben in which David told Drew personally that Raxxla exists in-game. I don't think (I could be wrong) that David has ever directly told the community at large that Raxxla exists in game.

He has, but only in a livestream, not on the Forum.

13:45 minutes in: “does Raxxla exist? There’s an interesting one. What a silly question, of course....You don’t know what it is though!”

That confirms DW’s hearsay (I never disbelieved him, but hearsay evidence requires corroboration!) report from Lavecom meeting and sets the implementation date of Raxxla as prior to the gamma; the “secret added” in the gamma changelogs then fits the Zurara since DW said the FRift storyline was finalised in-game in the gamme (well, not actually finalised, since the original abandoned Anaconda was later upgraded to a derelcit megaship!)

So Vetinari was correct & the gamma reference was not DB but was DW. I “misremembered”!

And welcome back Jaiotu! Was thinking this morning after reading one of your old posts that I hadn’t seen anything from you for a while
