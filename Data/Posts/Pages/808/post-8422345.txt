Apologies if this has already been parsed but has anyone looked into Station X in the crab nebula? The system just has two astroid fields with a station in the field closest to the star.

A quick Google search shows the irl Station X was a British WW2 code breaking facility. I flew down here in a dolphin with no cargo space so I really haven't been able actually do any of the missions.
