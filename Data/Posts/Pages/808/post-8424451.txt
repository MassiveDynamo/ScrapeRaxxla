Even if its real, which it probably isn't, it doesn't really provide any useful information to finding it. Also if you're going .14c it'd take you almost 11 minutes to travel 92Ls, not 6:41.
Unless it is moving too.

It was another guy claiming the same about 7 months ago. So 1 of them lies 200%.
Also ...that size in his target ...is damn huge. 92ls - planet must look like a point from such dist.
And you can be sure it is planet. Check radar - it is planet size like all others around except bigger, which is star.
It could have rings or dust cloud around it.
Also It could teleport player to Polaris after some sort of interaction
