A few days or so ago, some of us were trying to compile a list of female astronomers in an attempt at potential 'mother of galaxies' reference. I found some that i think went unnoticed. In Nuenets there is an installation called Jun Arsenal. I believe this to refer to Jun Chen.

Also in Nuenets is Betancourt Enterprise.

Also Nuentes, Lee Terminal. This one is a coin toss though as there is Janice Lee, Julia Lee, Annette Lee, Joon Hyeop Lee (idk if this one is male or female), among others

The reason i used all of these from Nuenets is it's system description...

"This busy trinary system has terrestrial planets orbiting the two companion stars. The locals aren't particularly friendly and appear to be harbouring a dark secret."

Hmmm.... a 'dark' secret you say? That seems like it could be there 'for those with eyes to see' potentially. Thoughts?
