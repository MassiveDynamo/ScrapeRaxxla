Greetings Commanders,

possibly an old hoax, but it looks interesting nevertheless. I haven't found this link in the forum, so I post it here. If I'm wrong, sorry and forget this post.
So, has someone checked this picture?: Too good to be true?
Could be manipulated, of course. But for me it doesn't seem so. I've checked the image using Gimp and other tools. And it might be real.
I can't find any strange artifacts in this picture, which would suggest a manipulation.
Please prove me wrong or I'll go crazy.
What do you think? Confirmed hoax? Manipulated image? (If yes, how can you tell that it has been manipulated? (I'm eager to learn .. ))

I'm panning and zooming around the galaxy map to find an angle which could lead to the possible area where the pic was taken. Difficult..

Even if its real, which it probably isn't, it doesn't really provide any useful information to finding it. Also if you're going .14c it'd take you almost 11 minutes to travel 92Ls, not 6:41.
