Both David Braben and Michael Brookes have confirmed that Raxxla is in-game, see first post of this thread for source references.

@Vetinari: As far as I’m aware DB said Raxxla has been in-game since the gamma release; what is the source for the interpretation that this was instead in reference to Zurara?

(Edit: it was because I believed DB said this of Raxxla that I produced a whole iPad Notes page on the gamma changelogs for analysis! But there was nothing evident in those )

(Edit2: Drew Wagar did say that the FRift story was finalised during gamma, which would imply that Zurara was implemented then, but I’m convinced DB said something about gamma & Raxxla that was different
)

Of course, being in-game from the outset does not implicitly mean that it has been accessible from the outset; that is interpretation based on understanding of how games are designed and expectations of fair play from FD. Since it appears that a certain (unknown) set of circumstances is required to unlock TDW and/or find Raxxla it is that set of circumstances was not available from the outset. For instance it could require a certain level of Thargoid kills & goids were not implemented from the outset.

That Raxxla is in game does not matter... and Yes we know for ages that it is in game.
Though this does not apply to the fact... “ can you visit or find it”.

It is in game but 99,99% it is locked somewhere behind the permit .... and it is kind of sensible that it will be most likely reachable in New Era content if the rumors are true about space legs and combat vs insectoid Thargoids outside the ships.

Till then keep dreaming find Raxxla... though even New Era has no guarantee that it will be unlocked by then
