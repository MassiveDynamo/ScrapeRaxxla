I’ve spent quite a bit of time in Pollux (and Castor, his twin).
I can’t remember exactly what the working theory was, but Castor and Pollux were Argonauts and sailed with Jason (not Ryder), in the quest for the golden fleece.

I never found anything. Hope you do.
Out of all the stuff I've been able to find, the only connection i was able to put together was the name of their mother, Leda, which was pronounced the same as Lita (as in Lita Crane). So what i loosely concocted was...

Lita = phonetic hint at Leda (mother)
Mother = possible reference hint at Mother of Galaxies (grasping at straws here i know)
