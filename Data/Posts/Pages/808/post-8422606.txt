From beta 1 patch note
-Expanded playable bubble to 21 ly radius (@50 systems)

From the gamma 2.00 patch note:
-Secret added

According to one of the comments on the Gamma, the whole galaxy was opened:
"So there are now 3.9 billion more systems with nothing to do in them but explore solo since I cant group or chat with anyone?"

Raxxla could have been there during the beta but out of reach as not included in the playable area. Couldn't find any other official reference (will edit if I do)

On a totally different subject, does anyone knows which col 70 sector systems are unlocked ? I think I saw some posts about few of them but I can't find those anymore.
I spent hours jumping around the area and using injection plots on the map to find a way in, without success.

Good points!
But after doing (based on my interpretation of TDW toast) some long distance trips out to Heart & Soul nebs, Broken Heart neb & Broken Heart Cluster, and dipping into quite a few Black Holes, I came to the conclusion that Raxxla should be in/near the bubble.
