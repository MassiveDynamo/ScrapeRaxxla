OK, can someone tell me if this blue 'star' is visible to them please (and what your location is roughly)? I'm currently in 'The Void', and can't decide (determine) if this is a star I can reach or is something beyond reach. It is always in this same position. I can't say I've paid much attention to it before. Cheers.

That's a galaxy. You can't get there.

Marcos did some good searching for that one.
