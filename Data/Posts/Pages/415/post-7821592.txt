Interesting development on the Thargoid star map theory.
-The star map is indeed of the andromeda galaxy, the shape and speed are the same to the andromeda which leads me to believe that it is ( I’m like 99% sure) this pretty much confirms my theory of Thargoids coming from a different galaxy as why the HELL would they have a different one in a secret (ish) location and make it hard to access. Raxxla is said to have a gateway to other galaxies. Well Thargoids may have used this we just can’t tell at this time.
-The restricted areas I’ve mentioned seem to create a pattern that is IDENTICAL to the Raxxla flag. Also at each one of the irregular pentagons in the centre there is some sort of nebulae


Now after drawing lines across I have identified a few new areas which arn’t Permit locked and the he shape looks something that someone should weave, kinda like the tales of the star Weaver you guys where on about earlier?
