I think your overlay of the raxxla icon to the galaxy map has to be a very solid lead. I understand some of those permit locked areas can be snuck around and past sometimes when trying to get there. I read on Reddit someone found a way past some of the permit locked cluster to a few unlocked in the midst of them. We need some dedicated pilots that really know how to slip between the permits to check some of those out.
Going to try to go through this, but it's phrased in a slightly puzzling way. I'll take it from the top and see if it clears up.

Every Permit Locked area can be gone round or past. (I'm not sure if that's quite what you meant or if you meant accessing systems within the Permit Locked regions rather than getting past the regions.)

The Col 70 complex can be got inside very easily, no big deal there. (It's the Witchhead, Orion nebulae, Barnards Loop etc.)

The Cone complex used to basically be a giant 3D target, with an unlocked area surrounded by locked areas, but the locked areas were too wide to be able to jump across, and it turned out that the unlocked area should have been locked anyway.

To the best of my knowledge, the other permit locked regions don't have unlocked regions inside. @Edelgard von Rhein did a big tour of them all so perhaps can comment more certainly on that front.

Probably best to double check the Reddit stuff - if it's someone talking about the Col 70 complex then there's nothing to be excited about.
