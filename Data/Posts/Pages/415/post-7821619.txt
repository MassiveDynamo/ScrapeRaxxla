"Lunar" specifically refers to our moon orbiting Earth which is named Luna. This seems to be a common misconception along with the term "solar" system when meaning star system as "Solar" specifically refers to our sun, which is named Sol.

Lol and guys call yourselves commanders and explorers, no wonder we haven't found raxxla.

P.S. this was meant to be funny however the frequent inappropriate usege of lunar and solar is getting tiresome.
