I think he meant you could get to the restricted systems that require a permit to lock on to
Quite probably, but it doesn't really make sense in terms of many of the Permit Locked regions - in a standard Permit Locked region, 'restricted systems that require a permit to lock on to' describes every system in the region - so getting past it doesn't really make sense in that context. There's either unlocked systems within or the entire region is locked. There's no getting past locked systems to get into locked systems, if you follow what I mean.

Anyway, that's all drifting off into a discussion about semantics, which is kind of pointless.

The key thing is, let's see what the reddit post actually said. If they found a genuine case of there being a couple of unlocked systems within an otherwise fully permit locked region, then that's interesting news! (I'm going to nail my colours to the mast on this one though and say that that isn't going to be what's actually happened. Would be good to be wrong though! )
