I think your overlay of the raxxla icon to the galaxy map has to be a very solid lead. I understand some of those permit locked areas can be snuck around and past sometimes when trying to get there. I read on Reddit someone found a way past some of the permit locked cluster to a few unlocked in the midst of them. We need some dedicated pilots that really know how to slip between the permits to check some of those out.
