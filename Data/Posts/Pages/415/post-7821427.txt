I got screen shots working (only with print screen after killing Nvidia Exp. ), so you can see my careworn 'conda on its way to Sag A* - its getting pretty here... Sorry for off topic post. Resuming normal service now..

Vega/Altair/Deneb - havent got a tool for the triangulation, but what if there's something in the middle - long shot tho'

Update - someone on discord has done it for me - Wredguia ZL-H b51-5 - its on EDSM and looks entirely un-interesting - snap - there goes another one..
