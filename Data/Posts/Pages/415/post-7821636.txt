I think your overlay of the raxxla icon to the galaxy map has to be a very solid lead. I understand some of those permit locked areas can be snuck around and past sometimes when trying to get there. I read on Reddit someone found a way past some of the permit locked cluster to a few unlocked in the midst of them. We need some dedicated pilots that really know how to slip between the permits to check some of those out.
I agree
I also found this about the Thargoids and the project dynasty (don’t worry it’s cannon)
"You don't know what I've seen. I've sailed beyond the Formidine Rift, seen the fleets of Octagonal ships blocking out the stars. I've stood on lost worlds, sterilised clean by the Thargoids and erased from humanity's maps. I've seen the graves from the Thargoid wars, countless headstones stretching beyond the curvature of the horizon, little spots of reflected light dottering the abandoned continent ..."
This is pretty much proof Thargoids have a part to play in Raxxla, the dynasty project was to find new life but was actually used to try and find Raxxla. This can’t be a coincidence with the overlays and restricted areas but as of now I’m unable to travel cause I need to get my cutter
