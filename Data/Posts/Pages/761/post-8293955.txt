Ironically you're not far off a mark with the Buddhism comment. My first impression of the "...place but not a place" statement has always been simplistic. It's a place (or type of place) you know about, but you don't know it's a place.

An example of this logic would be Witchspace. It's a place, but we don't think of it as a place you can go to or as a place that holds much significance. Along the same line of thinking, Raxxla could also be an undetectable planet, since it's a place but you wouldn't KNOW it's a place without being able to scan it.

Possibly a contorted way of looking at things, but riddles of this nature often have simple conclusions that subvert expectations by virtue of being obvious when you think about it.
One of the more popular tinfoil concepts I hear about interstellar travel is that in order to avoid breaking the currently believed rules of physics it is necessary to move from the 3D1T state to the 1D3T first. As there is no linear distance one only needs to plot the three time dimensions for arrival just after switching state.

Hey presto, far side of any galaxy you have target coordinates for, via Witchspace. A "time", not a place...

(Note: In game limit to FSD range may still be bound to a relative one dimensional / linear distance / fuel.)
