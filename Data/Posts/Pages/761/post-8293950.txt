Agree. And it seems that the innermost part (closer to mars orbit) appears to give better hits and show the cluster-icon.
However if all the belts appear inside the sun, while having a location out in the belt I suspect it's still bugged.
There's a big chance the triggers (if any) for 'stuff' is also linked to the bugged state inside the Sun.
One of the rules applied to Pluto when demoting to 'dwarf planet' was that it "has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit of other material". Considering the existence of the Greek, Trojan and Hilda formations, clearly Jupiter doesn't qualify to be a real planet either, or am I missing something?

The diagram (spoiler tagged above) gives a great idea of just how much debris is floating around on the ecliptic and as better observation tools are developed I'm confident the quantity will increase. But wait, there's more. Have a look at this animation of the meteors streaming through the inner Solar system.

NEO VI's (Near Earth Object - Virtual Impactor(s)) most likely to hit us and when are tracked by NASA.
