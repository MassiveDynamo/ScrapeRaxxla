A few random thoughts:
Greek Mythos seems to be very important/prominent in the elite universe.
Thargoid interceptor names are greek in origin. Many of the systems & ships in MB's Legacy have greek names (Artemis, Demeter etc). Delphi and Omphalos are also both greek references. It would perhaps warrant a second look.

What might delphi be the center of? The distances to both the Witch head nebula and California nebula are relatively similar.

Compiling a list of systems,bodies etc that have been player/pmf renamed vs those fdev have changed, or intentionally named from the start would likely be very helpful in eliminating naming coincidences etc.

DW mentioned on one of his streams recently about Tianve again so that might be worth thinking about as well. He also made a point of pointing out the old worlds near lave (within ~7 LY) are all in very nearly in the same plane as they were shown in the old 1984 star map.
