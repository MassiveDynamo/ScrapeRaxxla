I was reading, what you have found and it really interests me. I've also done some research and I have come up with some possibilities. As the omphalos stone was mentioned in the codex, I decided to research a bit. The omphalos stone was found inside a temple in the aydton (the second part) which is located in the MIDDLE of the temple. I thought that the galactic region: The Temple has something to do with this (maybe) and that it's in the middle of it. I also read up about some people that were related to it and I found the name Jaques Derrida. Maybe it's located near Colonia where many people have been.

Also the omphalos stone has a connection with the island of Delphi. A system is named after this island and has only one landable planet (5a). I thought that if you were to fly to the coordinates of the Delphi island on this planet you might find something.

One last thing, the codex mention that "The legend exerts a strangely potent fascination on the minds of seekers". Many "seekers" have failed and I found a station named "Seekers Rest" outside the bubble.

I don't know if you have already covered this, maybe it can help.

Might be a stretch but there's a possibility the Delphi link is to the Oracle who has the visions and the pineal gland in the middle of your head, right between the temples. Another stretch is the propensity for calcification in this organ, which some would argue prevents it making DMT and is caused by fluoridation.

Another stretch and you might be able to claim calcification is Omphalos stone-like and limits your 'vision'.

The Egyptians had a fascination with this cross section of the brain, as you can see in the Eye of Horus.

[Edit: Adding a simplified comparison image because the wiki doesn't seem to mention the similarities.]
