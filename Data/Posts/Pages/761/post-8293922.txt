If one is trying to find asteroids without a signal to drop on in sol the most obvious option is the trojan asteroids in the sol/jupiter system. The location can be found by matching both range to sol and range to jupiter, and using the orbit lines to align one self into the ecliptic. (alternatively a distance to another body/bodies could be used to ensure one is properly located more precisely, but that is more involved than just lining up the orbital paths shown in the game visually.)

LaGrange points are the obvious location to place a station etc that is trying to avoid detection due to the relative stability of the orbit, and the relatively minimal station keeping thrust required to stay on station/in place.
Had a look for the Trojan and Greek camps in L4 and L5 (60 deg ahead of and behind Jupiter's orbit). Nada
