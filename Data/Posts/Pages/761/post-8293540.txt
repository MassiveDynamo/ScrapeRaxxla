I was reading, what you have found and it really interests me. I've also done some research and I have come up with some possibilities. As the omphalos stone was mentioned in the codex, I decided to research a bit. The omphalos stone was found inside a temple in the aydton (the second part) which is located in the MIDDLE of the temple. I thought that the galactic region: The Temple has something to do with this (maybe) and that it's in the middle of it. I also read up about some people that were related to it and I found the name Jaques Derrida. Maybe it's located near Colonia where many people have been.

Also the omphalos stone has a connection with the island of Delphi. A system is named after this island and has only one landable planet (5a). I thought that if you were to fly to the coordinates of the Delphi island on this planet you might find something.

One last thing, the codex mention that "The legend exerts a strangely potent fascination on the minds of seekers". Many "seekers" have failed and I found a station named "Seekers Rest" outside the bubble.

I don't know if you have already covered this, maybe it can help.
