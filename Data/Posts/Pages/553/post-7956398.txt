But IFF the toast is a clue and a set of waypoints, then it doesn’t matter the distance between those waypoints, this would be a set of absolutes not relative directions. This was my penultimate hypothesis- travel to Zeta Cass (jewel on brow), travel to siren (NGC 7822), travel to Broken Heart XXX. Your travel history is the “journey you had to undertake” and is visible to the game engine (AI protecting Raxxla if you want a lore explanation ). I still want to know why my PC crashed as I made the last jump, with weird hyperspace transition graphic on the shadowplay recording, whereas Macros had no such crash when he jumped at the same position- one obvious answer is that he hadn’t travelled the route. IFF this hypothesis is correct then maybe I negated my travel history as I did a bit of searching on all the Broken Heart Cluster systems whereas perhaps I should have gone straight to it.
The journey was a long and tedious one however, so I have no urgent desire to retrace the path.....
The cornerstone of scientific discovery is repeatable results. Have you tried again a few times? Peer review is a necessity but only after you have repeatable results.
