But IFF the toast is a clue and a set of waypoints, ..snip...
Imho:
Codex gives clues. -Nothing to do with the "there will be no (out of the game) clues".-

Tau Ceti. Raxxla is close to Sol.
Astrophel. The book doesn't exist. But its title exists ! There stands the clue. (Thank you FD !)
Raxxla is inhabited. Follow any suspect traffic !
Raxxla is a definite place. It exists in space and in time. (Newtonian object)
TDW and Raxxla are bound.
Whisperer, deepest void. Raxxla has something specific to do with witchspace (where we can ear its "song" ?).
Anything else ?

Hm..also russian text looses ambiguity of "to the" ...which in english may point direction and "let's drink for" ... in rus it's clear "let's drink".
Niet khabara, niet bazaara !
