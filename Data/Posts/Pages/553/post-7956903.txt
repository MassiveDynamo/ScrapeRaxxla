I have suspended disbelief on many investigations. And yes, my hypothesis is supported with available evidence as presented.

You wrote, The thing to do is see if it gives you any predictions that you can then test?

This is exactly what I have done. I keep waiting for your rhetoric to help in any manner. I presented the evidence and hypothesis. Perhaps we could get into some philosopher quotes over private messages and spare this channel used for Raxxla related ideas and not semantic debate.
