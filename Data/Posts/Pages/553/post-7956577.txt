Careful. In English “crown” can mean the top of the head (above the brow, which is forehead), as well as the thing that a monarch puts onto the top of their head.
Yeah... but the thing is that the English toast doesn't use this term.
My point is, no toast in any language strictly tells where to search. As I ironically-much showed when comparing localisations. It's just poetry, each one in its own linguistic sensibility.
Only clue: Tau Ceti, etc.. and timeline.
Raxxla is relatively close to Sol and, ofc, obfuscated in some outer rim of "something". It sings/whispers in witch space and is/ is near a beautiful 'spiralling star'.
The Icon. (Stout tin foil hat requiered) : Central point is the Portal, curved lines its whispers, dashes its obfuscation, and 6 paths to reach it, maybe only 3 where we can hear its song or 3 in 3 out. Perhaps a way to bypass the lock of a system if the PF is involved. Which could be Jason Ryder's secret discovery/info.
I so much would like a fog of war mechanic in this game... With a really 'open-world' galaxy and not a discreet succession of maps.
(Probe: until then, back to suffer in the most difficult game ever...Народная Солянка + Объединенный Пак 2.1)
