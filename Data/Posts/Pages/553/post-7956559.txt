Careful. In English “crown” can mean the top of the head (above the brow, which is forehead), as well as the thing that a monarch puts onto the top of their head.

Also used to describe the phase of childbirth where the baby's head starts to become visible.
Plus there's the thing Americans put on their teeth to make them look all shiny.
Also, coinage.
