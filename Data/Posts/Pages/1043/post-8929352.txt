Yes, that’s what I was hoping to find via the green glows. Alas that was not to be!
But I can’t see what that ring thing in the pic is supposed to be, cant read the label
Might be an representation of the orbit of a Coriolis station around a star on the RAXXLA logo.

Let me try to explain what I mean with the RAXXLA logo...

The dot in the middle is a single star
The circle is the orbit of something around the star
The broken circle or 3 pieces of are asteroid clusters around the star
The 33 little dashes are the number of moons in the system
The 6 large shapes on the edge of the logo are main planets

I am seeing the RAXXLA logo as some kind of system map of where RAXXLA is. Just got to find which system it is (if I'm correct and its in game, that is)
