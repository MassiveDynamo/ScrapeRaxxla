But would you class it as a station?
The Dove Enigma mega ship in the Colonia system has landing pads and is used as a station and it has (as far as I can remember, but I may be wrong) habitation rings a bit like an Orbis Starport. But it's been awhile since I've been and maybe remembering wrongly about the habitation rings.
