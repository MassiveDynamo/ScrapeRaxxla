But would you class it as a station?

But the logo may not represent a station!
TDW stealthed station is supposed to be an early Orbis, a toroid, the Dark Wheel.. The logo doesn’t show a toroid!
Nor is it a Coriolis, which is a cubeoctahedron, which is made of squares and triangles. The logo shows (IMHO) one face is a hexagon, such as an icosahedron or something like https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=p...8&hl=en-gb&client=safari#imgrc=IuCnMmGrHKz51M

So the logo may represent some other form of object. My theory, what is my very own, is about dinosaurs.......
Sorry, wrong theory.
My Raxxla_in_Sol theory is that Raxxla is a stealthed Guardian ship hidden somewhere in Sol.

Mmm, maybe I should revert it back to a hypothesis since the green glow “evidence” is no longer applicable.

In the meantime I’m enjoying catching up on the early newsletters. Just up to
us2.campaign-archive elite dangerous newsletter #7

Mmm, #6, #12 &#19 don’t appear to be available
