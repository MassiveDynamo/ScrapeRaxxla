Re the Raxxla logo. I saw a reference to newsletter #11 and found this. The fifth picture is really quite interesting- see on the left; three arcs, central spot and surrounding circle.
Elite: Dangerous Newsletter #11

could the logo actually be a picture of the dark wheel station?
Could also be a pic of the fabled RAXXLA station (if that what RAXXLA is)
