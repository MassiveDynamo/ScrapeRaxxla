Nope, green glow seen in other systems, and other colours seen in Sol. Fairly sure itâ€™s a lighting bug when switching back from orrery-something to do with colour look up table bleeding away slowly. Above my head!
That's what I mean by it could indicate that you're in the right star system. It may not be Sol. Looking at the logo it may mean that a more constant green glow could be an indication of the RAXXLA star system at the symbols on the logo could be 6 main planets, 33 moons, 3 asteroid clusters and RAXXLA, whatever it is.

But then again, it could be a lighting bug.
