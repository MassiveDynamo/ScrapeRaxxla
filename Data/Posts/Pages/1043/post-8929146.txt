Taking a look at the RAXXLA logo, it has got a green background. So the green glow may be an indication that you're in the right star system for RAXXLA?

Just got to decipher the rest of the logo to find it.

Just my tuppence.

Nope, green glow seen in other systems, and other colours seen in Sol. Fairly sure itâ€™s a lighting bug when switching back from orrery-something to do with colour look up table bleeding away slowly. Above my head!
