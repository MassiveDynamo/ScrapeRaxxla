From the Universal Cartographics codex article:

"...Universal Cartographics filled that niche, arising from a merger of Omphalos infotech and Devaine-bright interstellar"

Omphalos infotech - the Omphalos rift, the portal on Raxxla. Perhaps UC knows where Raxxla is, and uses it's total power over exploration data to conceal it's location? Maybe it's impossible to actually find Raxxla, as it's behind one of their permits? It would lend some credibility to the Polaris theory. I'm not sure.
