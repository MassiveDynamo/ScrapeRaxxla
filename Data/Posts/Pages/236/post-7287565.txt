It's probably been commented here or there, but I'm in the planet of the Zuara, in the Formidine. The planet had been scanned and mapped, although you can't land there right now. There's a human signal. I wish I could go there...!

Could you cross post this in the Alien archeology and other mysteries thread? Weâ€™re having a discussion there about the Formidine Rift and Zurara https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showt...foil-Hattery?p=7287533&viewfull=1#post7287533
