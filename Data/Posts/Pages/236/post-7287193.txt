What's an example of a human signal? Like a mining operation or the like?

AFAIK a "Human - 1" indication on a non-landable Planet Scan means there's some Listening post or something similar in Orbit around.
Normally it should be visible from the NAV Panel no later than within 1000Ls.

(Example I've checked myself : Colonia Listening Post around Colonia A 2 B, Atmospheric Planet)

If it's a landable Planet, it normally indicates any human POI, like one of those abandoned Settlements. But I reckon a Listening Post or anything else in Orbit would indicate in the exact same way and is possible.
