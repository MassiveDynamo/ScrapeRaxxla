Wasn't able to manage a screenshot, but when I used the 'hole' clue from Fluk's memorial, and flew to the only black hole around, there was a weird purple pulsing where the black hole should be, in hyperspace. Normal, or...

TINFOILY!?

EDIT: Following the 'hole' clue, I come to the only black hole in the Heart nebula. Fluk's memorial also mentions that he was the light of their life - and this system only has one light-producing entity, a brown dwarf, which was likely the purple pulsing object I saw in hypserspace.

Don't know where to go with this, though.

EDIT2: There is a Neutron star by Soul. Maybe that's the light?
