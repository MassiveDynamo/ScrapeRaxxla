Try asking them more directly to give the info again. They might need to be directed better to give it as they may be too confused by the mass of info they are not used to. They may not be lieing. They just might need help finding the info and focused onto the subject and help finding the info. Basically try to get them to focus on the subject in the conversation.

People saying he's lieing are problem here. You can only really tell if he's lieing after he's answered the questions fully. Before that the accusers are the ones being trolls and making it impossible to get answers from him. It may very well be possible and easy to get the info from him. He may just be overwhelmed.

Do the game devs or mods have control of the redit sub forums? Maybe one of them could try to help him via pm to get the info for people.

It would help if people stopped trolling him and the thread to allow more concentrated efforts to talk with him.
