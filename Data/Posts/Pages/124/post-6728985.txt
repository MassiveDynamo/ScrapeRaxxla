Hey, LuckyLuke got lucky again! Welcome back. Tip Offs are just random events wirh no connection to story AFAIK, although at one point there was some talk by FD about using this or a similar mechanic to "inject" story events into the game. Other than some limited testing (in one of the betas a whole ago) nothing came of that I believe.

nvm.. well...just LoL ! At least it seems there's still quite a lot of people interested in this quest. FDevs should pull out some conclusions ...

You mean like they did with other storylines people were interested in?
