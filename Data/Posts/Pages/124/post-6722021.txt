Some structures, a portal and audio logs would be great. I'm expecting some out of place visual effects, like lensing effects, at best. Using existing game assets in an unusual way, an easter egg. FD have barely promised anything, and do not actively comment or encourage this search.

Dynasty expedition thing is slightly different, I think they were originally planning more gameplay aspects for it, but then didn't.

I don't mind false claims - only if they are entertaining enough. Could be true of course, I suppose there's always a chance somebody out there will find something.
