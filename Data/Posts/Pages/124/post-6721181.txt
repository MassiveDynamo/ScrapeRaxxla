The OP has gone silent which can mean one of the two things......

1) Obvious Troll decided to stop after he had his fun....

2) People told him thats a great find and now he wants to get back there b4 some1 else does...he said 1,5kly west/northwest of bubble so he if he remembered something crucial to his trip he would'nt share it.


i am leaning to 1).....landable planets.....Raxxla was supposed to be accesible before Horizons. Plus seeing his other reddit posts the guy seems weird.....like his looking for some attention.

I don't disagree. Either the OP was a complete Troll or upon learning of the importance had decided to keep the discovery for themselves. By default I lean toward Troll but hope to be proved wrong.
