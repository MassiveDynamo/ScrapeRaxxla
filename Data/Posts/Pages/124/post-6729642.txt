Was this message in Tionisla ever fully solved, or did people just say it was related to the Formidine Rift mystery?
“the vain queen rides a giraffe that remembers her daughter's hero”
I couldn’t find any hard conclusion relating this message directly to the Formidine Rift mystery. With the Tionisla Graveyard connection and “antique” Cobra MKIII, seems like the only real lead in the game. I know these words refer to 4 constellations that are all near each other on a star chart. And the Cetus’ Bane cobra... were any real conclusions made on this? Is it possible there is a cipher using the keyword Raxxla here?
