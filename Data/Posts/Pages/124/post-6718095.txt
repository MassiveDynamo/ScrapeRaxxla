Hmm... This MAY be it.

Every single time someone posts a story like this they make the details vague enough to make what happened seem plausible, but never follow up with a system name and continue to be as hazy and withholding of information as possible. With the tools provided in-game, it's trivial work to follow the trail of stars he explored out to the last one where he was supposedly killed. It would take 10 minutes max to complete such a task, including the time it takes to boot up the game. Until a system name or screenshot is provided, I'm calling bull.
