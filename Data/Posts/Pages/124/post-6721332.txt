I would be really dissappointed if he found it. Not because a years long goal would be over but for the sole reason that i strongly have the feeling that FD will screw this up again. Raxxla will be nothing more than a easter egg and all the hype of the community will become pure rage. Some weird structures left and right..maybe some sort of portal that you cannot interact and a few audio files at best. After the Zurara fail i expect anything from FD. The trolls are the lesser evil here in my opinion.
