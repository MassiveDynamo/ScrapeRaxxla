I had some random funny thoughts about Raxxla, perhaps one of these things will end up being true:

-Raxxla is just a planet named Raxxla which we can’t land on or do anything with.
-Raxxla is guarded by tons of elite pilots that kill you on-sight, and then the Raxxla planet teleports to a random sector in the Milky Way so you can’t go back.
-Raxxla does contain a cool portal structure, but once you decide to go through it you are permanently teleported to another near-empty galaxy created by the Stellar Forge.
-Raxxla does contain a cool portal structure, but once you decide to go through it your account gets reset.
-Raxxla is really just the Founders World.
-Raxxla is gated content behind a permit-locked system.
-Raxxla was already found by someone, but FDev has made some sort of agreement with them about it not to share it’s location...
-Someone in the Children of Raxxla found it, so FDev thought that should be the only mention of the word Raxxla in the game.
-It doesn’t exist the way you think it does and you will be sorely disappointed.
