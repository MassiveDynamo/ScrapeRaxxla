Try asking them more directly to give the info again. They might need to be directed better to give it as they may be too confused by the mass of info they are not used to. They may not be lieing. They just might need help finding the info and focused onto the subject and help finding the info. Basically try to get them to focus on the subject in the conversation.

People saying he's lieing are problem here. You can only really tell if he's lieing after he's answered the questions fully. Before that the accusers are the ones being trolls and making it impossible to get answers from him. It may very well be possible and easy to get the info from him. He may just be overwhelmed.

Do the game devs or mods have control of the redit sub forums? Maybe one of them could try to help him via pm to get the info for people.

It would help if people stopped trolling him and the thread to allow more concentrated efforts to talk with him.

Asking someone to provide evidence is not the same as accusing them of lying. Its simply asking them to supply some form of proof to backup and extraordinary claim. As I've said my default position on these kind of stories, always presented without evidence, is to give them exactly the credence they deserve: None. Given the number of times since 1984 people have claimed to have found Raxxla without providing any proof this is only prudent. Anyone can tell a story about finding Raxxla. Until someone comes back with actual evidence to prove it though ... that's all it is. One more story among the many others.
