I would be really dissappointed if he found it. Not because a years long goal would be over but for the sole reason that i strongly have the feeling that FD will screw this up again. Raxxla will be nothing more than a easter egg and all the hype of the community will become pure rage. Some weird structures left and right..maybe some sort of portal that you cannot interact and a few audio files at best. After the Zurara fail i expect anything from FD. The trolls are the lesser evil here in my opinion.

I don't believe Raxxla will be found. No game developer can create anything like what is in the immagination of the players, so it's not in FDev's interest to let it be found as it will always be an anticlimax.
Look at how much game time is being put in to look for Raxxla, once found all that interest and effort is gone from the game. Whilst it is being looked for FDev can add puzzles and tools around this game play.
For me the fun is in the search (but then, I searched in the original game in 1984 even when I knew it was not in the game to find)
