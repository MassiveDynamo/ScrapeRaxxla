I think its a bit fussy, try going from both ends and if you go off line then it kind of resets itself. I have to give two or three passes normally. Panels seem easier.

If we do ever find Raxxla, then likely we wont be able to open it
Or the cut panel will fall into it, and Raxxla will be lost forever... Maybe that is what happened?
