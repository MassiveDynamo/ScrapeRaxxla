I think you have to cut the whole rectangle IIRC. I remember it took forever when I did it and multiple attempts. Haven't been back in Odyssey since, upgrading latest patch now.
No, just the maglock on the bottom edge. Found a YT if the EDO training mission & he had similar problem, but cant see what he did differently to make it work!
