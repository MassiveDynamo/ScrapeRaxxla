And the star seems very bright, and more distant, so it probably is not the same as shown in the codex entry.

. And the star seems to be an A or B type, whereas the TDW logo in the Codex shows an M subdwarf (M VI) after the colour balance has been corrected-Iâ€™ve posted that in this thread.

Not an expert but isnt there a secondary light source? Looking at the shadow on the planet on the left and the ground the SRV is on? But I agree with the comment about it probably being just artwork anyway.

Yesterday I did manage to prove that the superpower rank is still increasing within Horizons after running Rep++++ missions,

How? Theres a lot of people posting about it, Ill point them your way I suspected it was accruing in the background and just not showing but havent made any attempt to prove it.

That blooming better well not be the solution Or that guitar pedal or whatever it is even if that is in game somewhere obscure.
