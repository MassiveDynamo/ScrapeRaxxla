Recognition? My OST download is still “access locked”!
I’m doing the EDO training mission. I’ve cut the srv access hatch maglock left to right and right to left umpteen times, no response.
Now my suit battery needs replacement
I have two in the Item Wheel
How the **** do I get it from the item wheel & connected into my suit? I move the selection control left to highlight it, I press Interact, nothing happens. It’s this sort of thing that really annoys me. What should be obvious isnt.
I shall google to see if I can find a video on how to change the suit battery, and then how to use the arc cutter...
Or I might just go back and do some ranking missions in Horizons, I know how to do that, & I believe they’ve resolved the display bug....

edit: ah, so by trial & error you have to open Item Wheel, move to option you want, then close to Item WHeel to activate that option. Really....unintuitive!!!
Still cant get the arc cutter to opent he panel though!!
