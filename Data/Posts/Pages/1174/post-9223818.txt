For me this wild goose chase is one of the most entertaining aspects of the game right now. I love puzzles like that. Since I am also familiar with most mythology, especially Greek one, this whole Raxxla myth caught my interest. As a main explorer, it gives me another reason to go out and look for new planets and system. Anyways, thanks to everyone clearing this up I only recently got back into the game again, so I missed out on all that came before, which is why I thought this loading screen might have some significance. And on goes the hunt... ^^
Good luck and welcome (back) to the chase.
