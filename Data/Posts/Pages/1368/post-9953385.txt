Technically X marks a line.
Beautiful lineup of the names. I would love If this was a real hint.
Well, actually there’s a rectangle defined between the X of RAX and the L of LA, then there’s a depth to the rectangle, which is presumably the thickness of the Milky Way there, so its a box. And I think a very big one!!
