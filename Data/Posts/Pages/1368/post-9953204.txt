Yes, I remember reading somewhere that one of the RPG wasn’t regarded as canon, but can’t remember the source...I’m long past RPGing, in fact I’m getting past spaceship flying....

I’d just like to see Raxxla before I hang up my Remlock and Platypus boots!
Natural that they wouldn’t be as you have to provide and go through more material to set a believable context. Frontier were more flexible with the Spidermind license and offered less stringent checking, but the book is more detailed and much the better for it. Asking an evolving game to remain bound to those parameters years later is problematic.

However, the point is moot. I doubt very much the RPGs will give clues to solve this particular quest.
