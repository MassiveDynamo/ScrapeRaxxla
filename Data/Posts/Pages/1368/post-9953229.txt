Missing X marks the spot?
O7 yes that old chestnut, yes it would be very ‘obvious’ wouldn’t it, not outside the realms of plausibility, let us know how you get on.

This reminds me of an old project utilising these same stars; they do from a certain perspective align in a perfect concentric spiral! Alas such searches do not identify all X; Y; Z points so you end up with a relatively large search area, easy to miss something, especially if we don’t know what we’re looking for!
