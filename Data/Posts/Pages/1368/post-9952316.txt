No, I don't.
I worked on both RPGs. They got the same source material (from me, authorised by Frontier) to develop their books from.
I never said the story hooks (which I wrote and linked) were canon. I said they might be interesting.
Cool, then I have obviously been misinformed.

(FWIW I have bought both, and they both have merit both as fun RPGs and for the lore/stories)
