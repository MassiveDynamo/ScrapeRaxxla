Cool, then I have obviously been misinformed.

(FWIW I have bought both, and they both have merit both as fun RPGs and for the lore/stories)
Yes, I remember reading somewhere that one of the RPG wasn’t regarded as canon, but can’t remember the source...I’m long past RPGing, in fact I’m getting past spaceship flying....

I’d just like to see Raxxla before I hang up my Remlock and Platypus boots!
