But, that’s making assumptions that the crossing point of the missing X does indeed mark a small location where something is to be found, and that the missing X aligns with the other letters..and you’re right that you’d then have to search a line, a long line (though there is actually no directional vector, so a cone!)
But I‘m not convinced - IF you hypothesise this is a clue (I suspect not, but someone might have fun checking it out) then the search area should be a box...a very large box.

I get grumpy and pedantic until my morning mug of coffee has had its mellowing effect! ️
