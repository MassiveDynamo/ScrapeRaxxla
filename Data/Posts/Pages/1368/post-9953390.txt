Well, actually there’s a rectangle defined between the X of RAX and the L of LA, then there’s a depth to the rectangle, which is presumably the thickness of the Milky Way there, so its a box. And I think a very big one!!
I think you can ignore the width of the rectangle. An X has a center spot. If the missing X is between the first X and the L you get a triangular plane, from your nose to infinity.
