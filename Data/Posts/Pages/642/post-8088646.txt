And this "clue" from you is from who? Yourself or mathmoss?
It's just ....idea with "galaxy scale" fits existing game mechanic (distance count). It does count from cmdr creation. When I met Palin I had 10000+ already, so it got unlocked.
Because other ideas like "visit that star", "jump into that BH" does not have corresponding mechanic. Nobody will do extra programming just for raxxla.
