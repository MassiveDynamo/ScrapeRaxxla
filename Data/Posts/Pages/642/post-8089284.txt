Very possible, it must be a monster .... bcs codex says 8th body around gas giant. So that on screen must be 8th one around something . I think I saw 1-2 times only when stars orbit bh + super giant pair as planets and then each of them may have dwarfs too.
8th body reference is DW station, not Raxxla...
