...also, except checking his pictures, i tried to imagine why he could propose such a route, even if it is fake.
So got some thoughts i posted somewhen before too, main idea...if u look on raxxla/dw emblems it can be treated as galaxy shape. So what if we was wrong with the scale? So once u zoom out map ... u can see why that guy did such a route. For example "mother" - there is region "Izanami" which is godess of everything, and Sag A* is "jewel" and so on.
So all together this guess is no worse then any other we already spent time on

Lol someone on the discord I'm on recently posted a pic from Full Metal Alchemist (I hope as a joke...). You might as well use that as a lead then. See where Mare Somnia is at. Every clue in the codex & ingame art & design points towards a common mythology and now we are supposed to use Japanese lore? Hmm OK. SMH.
