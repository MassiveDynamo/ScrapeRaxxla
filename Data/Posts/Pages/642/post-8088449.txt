And how do you know whether its that particular cluster of brown dwarfs? Try finding the source. Now information is mixed up because of various people chiming in with their personal opinions or extrapolations of what mathmoss wrote. I personally cannot see the various coordinates at all due to how blurry the pics are even in the original. Really not sure how alexzk came up with those coords. But by all means, those who are convinced should go ahead.
There is pictures set 2-3 pages before. I was looking on it and on ingame map. Picked that was most fitting pictures. Sure it can be more fits ... but will see later. I can't even measure distances as systems are unknown. So 1st is to come there and check if it is realy isolated for regular jump.
