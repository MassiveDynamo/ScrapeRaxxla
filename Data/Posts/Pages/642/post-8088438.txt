If it is the one cluster of brown dwarfs at the center line then it's not hard to explore. I've done that much exploration at the 2mass cluster on the way to heart and sole. The clusters can be explored easily.

Do we have an ETA on carriers. I'm waiting for info to see how it pans out first.

And how do you know whether its that particular cluster of brown dwarfs? Try finding the source. Now information is mixed up because of various people chiming in with their personal opinions or extrapolations of what mathmoss wrote. I personally cannot see the various coordinates at all due to how blurry the pics are even in the original. Really not sure how alexzk came up with those coords. But by all means, those who are convinced should go ahead.
