I might be wrong, but on this image, to my point of view, there is something wrong with the light/shadows.
(Dwarf shadow on rings Vs Station shadows)

I also import this poor quality image into Photoshop, with some manipulations, square artefacts appear around the station...
Might be a Copy/past.
Very possible, it must be a monster .... bcs codex says 8th body around gas giant. So that on screen must be 8th one around something . I think I saw 1-2 times only when stars orbit bh + super giant pair as planets and then each of them may have dwarfs too.
