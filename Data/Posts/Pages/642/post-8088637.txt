Lol someone on the discord I'm on recently posted a pic from Full Metal Alchemist (I hope as a joke...). You might as well use that as a lead then. See where Mare Somnia is at. Every clue in the codex & ingame art & design points towards a common mythology and now we are supposed to use Japanese lore? Hmm OK. SMH.

Not really ...just that route should force you fly 80000 ly. And that is trigger to enable raxxla for u (same as Palin 5000). U could do 80k in any other way. + end of route is near raxxla...kinda
