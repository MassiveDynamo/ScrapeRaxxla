Alexzk - I hope you find it, I really do, but this does have all the footprints of a scam, not just a hoax but a scam from start to finish. Make sure you have large fuel tanks and plot carefully, I wouldn't be surprised if its a dead end dwarf field where you have to explode as run out of fuel. Also consider that others will have followed the route and nobody has fed back anything anywhere. It could be there, it could be there and he never had any info from a dev and never found it but you might anyway. Just don't put your hopes into it.

Machina - You forgot in your excellent summing up post that he has so much respect for others that he only posted it on 2 separate occasions with about a dozen hashtags to spread it around and after saying he wouldn't say where it is out of respect he gives out 'clue' after 'clue' in pics of galaxy about where it is to the point of saying head up at Sag A and theres a path through the Brown Dwarfs. Almost as if hes trying to lead people on but doesnt have the brains to do it properly.
I checked, there are scoopable stars there. 1/3 about are Ms and I saw 2-3 other colors then red from that big distance. Maybe more,
