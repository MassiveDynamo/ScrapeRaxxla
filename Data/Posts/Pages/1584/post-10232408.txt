I was thinking on how we have a few convenient markers around the outer rim: the Titans!
Two of them, in fact (Thor and Leigong) are located below the lost realms area, so they might work as very rough indicators.

But then you still have the problem of the Empire spending on the planets all the creativity they lacked for naming themselves...
