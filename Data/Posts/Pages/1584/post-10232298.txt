Be wary of ‘traditional’ lines of sight and directional alignment, we don’t necessarily know where to look in relation to various fixed points!

But I agree Raxxla, ‘This pendent world’; may very likely hang below the lost realms / axis mundi.

Point being, during my studies into the Yggdrasil construction, and recently the Lost Realms area, I’d seen enough correlating evidence in game to conclude that potentially the axis maybe shifted and the ’tree’ tiered.

This corresponds I’ve observed with various other deity systems, such as the Greek or Celtic pantheons, to name but two; which all seem to fall upon this shifted axis and to my eye likewise tiered!

I attribute this axis to be that set by the ‘in game’ Greek compass!
