Merope...

One of the Pleiades, companions of Artemis, turned into stars to get away from Orion's pursuit.
Also called The Lost Pleiad, who turned her face away out of shame for marrying Sisyphus - who escaped from Tartarus and, upon his return, got punished for trying to outsmart the top deity.

The tale of the eternal rolling guy feels like a suspicious parallel to Satan on Paradise Lost (down to Hell being called the same!), as tenuous of a link as it has.
