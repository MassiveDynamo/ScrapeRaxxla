Any Axis Mundi has to pass trough Earth. That is what axis mundi is. That means that any single point in space can be on the axis mundi, if we want it to. Finding more than one point, is when we start to limit our options. Two stars with near perfect alignment to Earth are what we call optical binaries. Stars that aren't close to each other, bu appear in the same spot, in the sky.

Going by Miltons model of the cosmos, Earth (and the universe around it) is at the end of the pendant. Earth is the center and the pendant is an axis mundi. If we follow this axis 'up', we should reach a gate. This gate leads out of the regular universe and if we continue 'up', we get to heaven.
The same gate should also make it possible to enter hell, but hell does not seem to align with the axis.

If we assume that Raxxla is the gate, we should look towards what we think might be heaven. Looking towards hell does not help, in the Miltoian model.
