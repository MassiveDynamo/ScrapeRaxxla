SPOILER: WHAT IS THE AXIS MUNDI?








SPOILER: HOW COULD THIS APPLY IN ELITE?














Empire, Guardians, Hell
Federation, Humans, Earth
Alliance, Thargoids, Heaven

Which could explain why the Brookes tour crosses both the Pleiades and Synuefe regions!

An Order / Balance / Chaos alignment could be easily drawn as well, but it'd place Order in Hell and Chaos in Heaven, which is... definitely unusual.
