OK, so is the axis really Helios ----> Axis Mundi or is it Boreas -----> Axis Mundi? I know it's tricky to tell from a 2D map like yours but I can see the tiering when I'm in the Galaxy Map, though I find it hard to follow a course that's at an angle. I guess that's by design, so we don't just move the map down and hit the right system too easily! I also don't want to go too far down, as I think it's going to be somewhere amongst the Lost Realms - obfuscated in the outer rim but not beyond it, so to speak.

A part of me feels that Raxxla should be in a named system (though it would not surprise me if it wasn't). Looking at the meta picture tells me two things: firstly, that from the in-game role-played perspective, someone named all these systems for a reason and that is to hide something that might be obvious if there was only one, secondly; from the author's perspective it has to be a fitting tribute to Robert Holdstock and a procedural name for the system with Raxxla would not accomplish that as well as a suitable mythological theme. (There's a paradox here as I think about it - the naming of systems is our clue that something is here yet the fact there are so many also obscures the target!)

I'm going around in circles here, so I'll give it a break, do straightforward exploring whilst my mouse is not working quite right, and go looking again when I get back to the Bubble.
