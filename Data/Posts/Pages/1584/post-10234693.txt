The idea that Earth, Raxxla and heaven all align with the axis mundi and hell does not, is of course fully dependent on accepting Miltons 'geography'.
The axis mundi going through Earth, is not. If it doesn't, it isn't an axis mundi.

The hints we have for an earth axis are rather vague. I would say that the following, can be interpreted in that direction.

1. Silent song of the spheres can be seen as a pointer to Kepler's Earth-centric model of the universe. This is also the traditional Greek model.
2. Spiralling stars may point to some rotational axis.
3. Pendant world directly describes the placement of Earth as directly below heaven.
4. Axis mundi is a system in the game.
5. Delphi, the traditional Greek 'start point' for the axis mundi, is a system in the game.
6. Plenty of other systems that can be linked to world trees, i various religions.

Of these hints only the Spiralling stars and the Pendant world, can be directly related to Raxxla.
Don't forget there is part of the Raxxla mythos whereby the Talmor Lens (presumably what makes the Omphalos Rift operate) is misbuilt on Earth. There is the Lakon Spaceways Transporter (modern iteration Type-6 Transporter) that originated at Earth. Further, Lavian Brandy is made in oak barrels imported directly from Earth. Sol is the most important system in the lore. Even the original The Dark Wheel novella with the first game had Alex Ryder awarded with a flight over London as an award for top scores on the Sim-training.

Sol is the most lore important system in all of the Elite Universe as everything else depends on its existence. Even Lave is based a real star in the same galaxy as Sol.
