Faraway as it currently exists was humanity rebuilding the Talmor Lens. The infrastructure of The Pilot's Federation is wholly dependent on what humans rebuilt. The components are all present and very well known.

Orbital stations (especially the large antenna)
Orbital outposts (again massive antenna)
Surface Ports and Settlements
Surface Installations
Artificial power sources
Artificial structures
Myriad array of engineering components and data
Our ships form ad-hoc components of the larger network. See Guardian Logs - Technology log. CMDRs are integrated via implants allowing telepresence, galaxy wide comms, and remotely controlling our fleet carrier, ships, SRV, SLFs, and everything else. Seo Jin-ae isn't the only Seraph. That was Project Thunderchild and every CMDR is either a genetically enhanced human, cyborg, or android (look at eyes in Holo-Me).

We found Raxxla by finding ourselves. Getting to understand the intergalactic travel part is the next stage of this. That and understanding what and where Omphalos Rift is located.
