The systems are the same but in the opposite direction from between the star systems. Like if you rotated it towards east instead of west. I might be misunderstanding the point of the calculations.

I didn't nkow you could look that up in EDSM. That could be interesting. I'm horrible at figuring that stuff out though.

Well, actually there are infinite number of points which are equal remote from triangle vertexes in 3D ... and they're laying all on 1 line which is perpendicual to plain of triangle and this line goes through the center of circumscribed circle. So yeh can be not exactly where u expected ... that's why I stopped to play with this, solving plain equations and picking exact point in plain is too much for me too have been 20+ years since I did it.
