So, I guess the next thing is is there a best set of systems to represent the poem. Assuming that is even what those things mean to start with. I like the idea of it being based on tourist beacons. Those have info that can be easily attached to the poem.

Is there a way to find the center of mass of the galaxy or for a sector. Or is Sag A the center of mass?
