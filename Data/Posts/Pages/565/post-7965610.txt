I think you are doing it correctly but it's doing it with the one coordinate with a possitive putting in the wrong direction. The rest is correct.

It took me a bit to find the error. I corrected it in the above post. I edit alot so stuff I type gets delayed in appearing sometimes. 8)
Okey, new coords:
const static Point A{4.3125, -1.0625, -27.90625};
const static Point B{ -81.78125, -149.4375, -343.375};
const static Point C{-2426.84375, 295.03125, -1323.625};

Hmm..even more good matches:

Pick responses by "distance", lower "distance" is close to calculated point, or ser radius=10 in link to filter.
