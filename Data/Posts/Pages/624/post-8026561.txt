I would have liked a "randomized" Raxxla, appearing here and there following its wave of probability. Would have matched with "..that is not a place"
But they said "..and we know where it is".

Well, it’s quite possible that it is randomised, so after I find it it’ll move so you can’t follow me
Reactions:
