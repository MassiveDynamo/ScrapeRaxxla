Ok thanks to this post I now know what Raxxla is and where to find it:


Arx are a virtual currency earned by sitting in frobt of your screen just as Aurline bonus miles are earnt.

LAX is an airport in western America.

So Raxxla (or ARX LAX) are a frequent flyer lounge at LAX. Obviously, it is the Star Alliance lounge there.

I heard it is a nice atmosphere there and they serve free cookies.

Anybody able to confirm?

Used to work on occasions in USA & flown via LAX a few times. Last one was in 2014 when the baggage xray machine broke the zip on my rucksack. Aggressive Rogue AI perhaps?
The only gateway to alien worlds I saw was the departure gate for the Canadian flight...
No Dark Wheel station.
Wasnâ€™t terribly impressed with the business class lounge.
