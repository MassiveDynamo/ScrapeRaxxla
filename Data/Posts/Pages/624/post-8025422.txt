It depend on how you define the Randomius part.
If you look at randomness as deterministic and you apply a Newtonian / Einsteinian understanding to the universe, the gods and goddesses of fate are applicable. Particularly the Spindle of Necessity form The Myth Of Er, in Plato's Republic, seem fitting. In that case, Ananke and the Fates are the ruling deities.

If you look at randomness as non deterministic, applying a quantum mechanical understanding, I think we probably have to look in the darker regions of mythology. In Greek tradition, this would be going all the way back to Chaos it self.

As the entire game of ED is based on deterministic randomness, I lean slightly to the first explanation. Raxxla is special though. It cold be different.

True i am just seeing alot of the symbology being used is taken from the platonic descriptions ... Also I imagine the idea that from a mathematical seed the universe is created - fits in nicely with someone creating a procedural galaxy. Further, I think we are looking at the neoplatonic tradition which incorperates a wider variety of mystery cults... Much room for chaos... But ya im just playing around looking for a common theme.
