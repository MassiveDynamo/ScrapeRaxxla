Heart of Gold was powered by an infinite improbability drive, if I remember correctly? upon activation the ship would pass through every point in the universe, and eventually and improbably end up at its destination. Of course, things inside the ship would go oo. Is the key to finding raxxla to build an infinite improbability drive?
