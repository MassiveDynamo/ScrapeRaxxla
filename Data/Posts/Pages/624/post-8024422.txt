In my last game session I complete a tip-off mission from an anonymous stranger after completing some "Founder or Elite" ranked mission for TDW, now I have an "Rescue Mission - Occupied Escape Pods" from another TDW allied partner 'Future of Arro Naga' that I haven't run missions for in quite a while but is on my tracking spreadsheet as having completed FoE missions previously.

Coincidence?

Does anyone know if the mission stack was re-vamped in the September update to offer more random missions directly to pilots?

Or am I being covertly tested...since I've never had one of these before (one can only hope!)?

I would chase it down personally. Who knows if its specifically the invite you want? but it sure can't hurt your rep with them.
