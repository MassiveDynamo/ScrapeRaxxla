Ok because I cant let the Jewel on the brow of the Mother of Galaxies go....

Reverting to the Holy book of the Dark Wheel Page 23:
Elyssia sniggered. 'What god or goddess do you believe in?' 'Randomius Factoria .. .' Alex muttered. 'Me too .. .'
Later on page 39 Elyssia exclaims:
'Holy Mother of the Stars!'

So assuming she is invoking the goddess she believes in: Randomius Factoria is Holy Mother of the Stars...

Next step - who is Randomius Factoria? The lady fate .. Greek goddess / Roman and also associated with the ... (not the game show)

An aspect of Tyche is that she is often adorned with a which symbolized a walled city... maybe an atlantis or eldorado ?

If you read Terry Pratchett's Discworld series (one of my fav), you'd see The Lady (Luck) vs Fate. The idea of Probability vs Predestination. Free will vs Determinism. The Lady has green eyes & Fate has black eyes. A common motif and I'd expect as good writers, they'd have all done a deep dive. Everything that good writers write about is deliberate. Same with Douglas Adams & THGTTG with the Heart of Gold.
