Ok because I cant let the Jewel on the brow of the Mother of Galaxies go....

Reverting to the Holy book of the Dark Wheel Page 23:
Elyssia sniggered. 'What god or goddess do you believe in?' 'Randomius Factoria .. .' Alex muttered. 'Me too .. .'
Later on page 39 Elyssia exclaims:
'Holy Mother of the Stars!'

So assuming she is invoking the goddess she believes in: Randomius Factoria is Holy Mother of the Stars...

Next step - who is Randomius Factoria? The lady fate .. Greek goddess / Roman and also associated with the ... (not the game show)

An aspect of Tyche is that she is often adorned with a which symbolized a walled city... maybe an atlantis or eldorado ?

A utopia on the brow of the mother of galaxies ? Who rules in the first recorded idea of a utopia - the utopia of ?... the Guardians.

It depend on how you define the Randomius part.
If you look at randomness as deterministic and you apply a Newtonian / Einsteinian understanding to the universe, the gods and goddesses of fate are applicable. Particularly the Spindle of Necessity form The Myth Of Er, in Plato's Republic, seem fitting. In that case, Ananke and the Fates are the ruling deities.

If you look at randomness as non deterministic, applying a quantum mechanical understanding, I think we probably have to look in the darker regions of mythology. In Greek tradition, this would be going all the way back to Chaos it self.

As the entire game of ED is based on deterministic randomness, I lean slightly to the first explanation. Raxxla is special though. It cold be different.
