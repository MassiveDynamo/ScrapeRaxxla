Heart of Gold was powered by an infinite improbability drive, if I remember correctly? upon activation the ship would pass through every point in the universe, and eventually and improbably end up at its destination. Of course, things inside the ship would go oo. Is the key to finding raxxla to build an infinite improbability drive?

Which the Infinite Improbability Drive is of course a golden box, The Heart of Gold for which the ship was named after. It is also called the Golden Bail of Prosperity used in the Wikkit Key to open the Slo Time Envelope.

Metaphors overwritten on top of metaphors again and again like a palimpsest.

By now the mythology should be obvious to a few. The "past" is a map which points to the "future" if you stand at the correct location in spacetime and look up. Various articles in Galnet seems to hint at this.

Perhaps the "past" is all an elaborate SOS sent by one of The Missing, much like the stranding of Arthur Dent & Ford Prefect.
