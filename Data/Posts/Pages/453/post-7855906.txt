That was me en route to bubble. Noticed an amazing nebula, ngc something I think. Have to check it out on the way back. Looked like a UFO. still only halfway there

Yep, I saw that on the way back, but had already gone so far and was so desperate to get some ship upgrades that I bypassed it. You're right, it's striking. I'll probably head over there soon now that the ol' Krait is doing 50Ly jumps.

The other possibility is Eta Carinae. Unless something else shiny comes along.
