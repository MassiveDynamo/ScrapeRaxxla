Joining the hunt. Started at the beginning of this thread 4 weeks ago and got to page 300. Decided to skip the rest and find out we are none the wiser haha.
Anyway, I’m elite in trade, almost in exploration but only expert in combat so I decided to grind that just in case. Damn what slow, hard work that is.
I’m a firm believer FDev don’t want isn’t to just stumble upon Raxxla at the expense of everyone else earning the right to grind for it, and the Codex confirmed my belief.
I’m sure TDW don’t know the whereabouts but they know Ryder found evidence of it. I believe they will put the right people on the right path to the evidence when certain conditions are met. Will chip in when I have something to offer.
Fly safe commanders
