Bear in mind that 'galactic regions' were only introduced in v3.3 - so they're unlikely to be part of any process to 'unlock' Raxxla.
I'd also be cautious of trying to use the Dark Wheel faction in Shin to do anything significant, since they're not confirmed to be the actual Dark Wheel.

“Shinrarta is merely a front.’
‘So …?’
‘You should not consider the Dark Wheel a single organisation, gentlemen. How could it survive for so long if it were? The Wheel has many levels, many hubs, cogs, gears and spokes”
“It is more akin to an affiliation of organisations that share certain common goals. Interlocking in purpose. Consider yourselves now spinning on the outermost rim.”
