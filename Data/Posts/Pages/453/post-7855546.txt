I was just there, did a complete survey, came up empty. I wholeheartedly encourage you to go do your own research in Crab, and also to read this thread:

The Search for Gan Romero
Good morning all, I'm off to find Gan Romero. I know it's a fool's errand, but I have a hunch. It's clear that Gan is not simply deluded. Who is calling him and what he is delivering are the real question. New Krait MkII, 37.15Ly range with no guardian FSB. Enough materials for 19 75%...

Just did the Bubble Nebula also, I've seen it referenced here in the last day or so. I'm happy to answer questions, though I didn't find much.
