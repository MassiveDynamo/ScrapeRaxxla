“Do what thou wilt”
Mmm personal opinion, I’m not sold, don’t get me wrong, it’s a great idea but I can’t see any literal connection, just now, it’s all a little too interpretive.
But that’s not surprising, given that Crowley etc collated and utilised various religious concepts, such as Ancient Greek, Egyptian, Christianity, Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism, you name it.
David Bowie in the 70s was also real fan too..

Honestly I like the idea of a rouge planet or ship, as that ties in with the whole lore with ‘whispers’, and the spooky goings on with the generation ship ‘Thetis’. But I’m not sold on any other ‘galaxies’ being out there, Raxxla IMPO is either an Easter egg, some type of engineer FSD booster.

Who knows, anything really is possible, I am more inclined to believe as time moves on, that there are no clues, and it’s at the will of a narrative, cobbled together from a variety of esoteric influences, with no discernible correlation, except the personal preferences of the author.

Anything goes really. I’ve studied Crowley, for my work, might be a fun dalliance.

Do what thou wilt.
