There is definitely a bug in the forum. I cant edit a post- when I try the text to be edited just disappears. Tried it on my iPad, now trying on the PC & it still happens!!
That were many threads since yday. You need open dev tools and reset cookies/application states / whatever mentions this site. Inara will logout as well in result.
