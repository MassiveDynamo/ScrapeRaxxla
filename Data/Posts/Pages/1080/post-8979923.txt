can we somehow technically see if there is a second galaxy in our game client? in the earliest versions of the Elite, several galaxies existed. Perhaps there is such a thing in ED, and then it will be clear to us what to look for ... a portal, a gate, something in this sense
That is datamining, which contravenes FD’s End User Licence Agreement, is considered cheating and hence we don’t discuss such matters (or any results obtained from that or similar practices) in this thread, and the moderators would remove it (quite rightly!).

But FD have said there is only one galaxy implemented in ED.
