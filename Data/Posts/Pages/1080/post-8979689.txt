Yea, Raxxla as jumping ship is a good idea:
1) Fit to Elite Dangerous engine capabilities
2) Interactable without horizons update
3) Easy to control, you can hide it without additional permit locks
4) Explain why DW lost it. Stellar object like planet is hard to lost, but jumping algorithm...
5) Without knowing what are you doing it is almost impossible to find it, brute force is useless as ship will jump out.

So we just need to figure out where it jumps

PS: Gateway to another galaxies is not needed, I think long jumps like few sectors could be already powerful.
