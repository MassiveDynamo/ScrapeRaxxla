Because you didn't visit it yet. There are 2 stars there number 13 and 19, I can see number changing if I switch "visited" checkbox.

That’s a star catalogue name & it’s quite common to have duplicate stars when inputting real life star catalogues as they have different values for the distance from Sol due to inaccuracies in real life astronomical measurement.
