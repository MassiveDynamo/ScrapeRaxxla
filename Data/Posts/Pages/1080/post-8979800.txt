I certainly don't mean ship upgrades if that's what you're getting at, more like a network of 'hypergates' that could help funnel players into less explored areas.
I see. There might be some merit in that idea, but I don't think it would help solve Raxxla mystery, I think it would rather hinder it by diluting the search. Search which is pretty much doomed to fail if you try to brute-force it, there simply are not enough players and the subset of players who would actually look for Raxxla is even smaller number.
