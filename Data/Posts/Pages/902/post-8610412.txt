Hello CMDRs!

Few weeks ago I saw some of Drew's lore videos and these inspired me to join the hunt for Raxxla.

After a lot of reading and learning about the subject I decided: I dont search Raxxla in the game, not in the lore, but I will search Raxxla in real life .. in 1984..when the legend was actually born.

My first idea was: these “codes” (RAX XLA) show some similarities with 6502 (BBC micro processor) assembly codes. It was an interesting research, but it turned out as a dead end…

I contiuned searching the original Elite documents, and found these:
(sry, but these are needed in order to understand the following….)
http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Random_number_generator
and
http://wiki.alioth.net/index.php/Oolite_planet_list

(Anyway, as a hobby programmer I really admire these routines….)

and in the ‘Where do these crazy names come from?’ section there is a downloadable spreadsheet… in the sheet the @@ characters represent the empty strings. Let's see the system 72 in Galaxy 1 … and imagine the empty strings marked as “xx”…its not unusual, at all.

Here goes my theory for what happened.
This is a fictional dialog between Robert Holdstock (RH) and David Braben(DB)...just for fun

1983:
RH- Hi guys, I need some system names from the game...for the novella…
DB – Sure, I printed a testpage for Galaxy 1 yesterday..here it is

The list looked like this on the paper:
…
71 EDINSO 3 ED | IN | SO | IN
72 RA 3 xx | RA | xx | LA
73 ARONAR 4 AR | xx | ON | AR
...etc

RH- Woa..cool names. What are these 2 character codes?
DB – These are the name generator stuff, not inportant, these are not in the game…
RH- So, some secrets? Hah...xx RA xx LA...RAXXLA..it sounds like a forgotten aztec god...or a treasure city….Can I use these?
DB – yeah..why not…

--- FEW MONTHS LATER ---
“Remember: Raxxla!”

So: I think Raxxla = Ra. It is in the Milkyway, it is in ED from start, in the Bubble, close to Sol...etc
Though I really REALLY hope that RAXXLA myth is more than this )
