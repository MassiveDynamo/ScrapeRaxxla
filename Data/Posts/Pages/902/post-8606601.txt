BH's are easy to find, just go below/above plain using NS. Pick some routes which aren't known for EDSM.

W-R's are harder. Seems it was specially hunted + they're concentrated at some regions. Like bubble does not have NS close.

P.S. I still think best guess is W-R star to be raxxla related. It is scientific fact close double star where 1 is W-R make spirals. That what they could use writing codex.
