I just stumbled across a carrier with the name Raxxla K3H-00J I can't find it listed on Inara or anywhere else. It won't let me land I am sure I have not found Raxxla but why won't it let me land and why isn't it listed anywhere?
They may have it set to Squadron or Friend only landing. And Inara may only get the info on it when someone who reports to Inara lands on it (I'm not sure on that one, though)
