As a game designing company, why would you make an afford to put something into the game only to lock it down for the players? Doesn't make any sense to me. It's a waste of ressources. I know they put stuff in often at later times yes but i think i was reading that DB confirmed that RAXXLA was in the game since day one. It might be behind a permit lock yes but i'm pretty sure then this permit is obtainable somehow.
I agree with that line of reasoning personally but there's a lot of things that don't make any sense in this game. So I wouldn't write it off in any sense
