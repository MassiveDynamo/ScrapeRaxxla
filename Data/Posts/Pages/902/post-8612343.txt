I have read a lot about this Raxxla thing and here is my opinion which is worth exactly what you paid for it. I believe Raxxla is in the game just like FD said it is. I also believe it's locked up behind one of those impenetrable permits. The minute Raxxla is found there will be a whole slew of players that will suddenly have not much to do. So my thought is Raxxla will never be found till FD is ready for it to be found. Just my opinion.

Actually it doesn't make much sense to put something into the game and then lock it for the players so they can't reach it. Since they said to us it is in the game i'm pretty convinced it can be found and is not permit locked. But there is a very real possibility that it is hidden like the ancient probes in SOL were hidden which will make finding RAXXLA almost impossible without any clues.
