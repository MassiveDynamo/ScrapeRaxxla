I just stumbled across a carrier with the name Raxxla K3H-00J I can't find it listed on Inara or anywhere else. It won't let me land I am sure I have not found Raxxla but why won't it let me land and why isn't it listed anywhere?

They have turned off landing permission for certain people, can be set to Squadron or friends only, assume you are neither. Wont show on Inara until at least someone on Inara docks on it and maybe only if the FC owner is on Inara, not sure about this.

RE: RAxxLA as code in 1984. Holdstock first wrote about a place called Raxxla in his earlier book, he just reused the name as it wasnt well known or for his own personal amusement or reasons. It was already in use long before the proc generated planet names from strings. The strings were written so that RAXXLA could NOT be proc generated by mistake along with swear words, meaning it was never meant to be more than a cool story to go with the game originally. We the players did all the myth-making ourselves.

Welcome to the tinfoil though, may you spend many hours in wild chases and searches across the galaxy.
