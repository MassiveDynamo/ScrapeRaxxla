I have read a lot about this Raxxla thing and here is my opinion which is worth exactly what you paid for it. I believe Raxxla is in the game just like FD said it is. I also believe it's locked up behind one of those impenetrable permits. The minute Raxxla is found there will be a whole slew of players that will suddenly have not much to do. So my thought is Raxxla will never be found till FD is ready for it to be found. Just my opinion.
I suspect this is actually a fairly common opinion around here, but we press on regardless cos it's fun and you never know.
