You guys keep thinking that you can find Raxxla the easy way ? Jumping into a system and, by chance, here it is ? End of the game ?
Could be... but what a disappointment then. No ?

Yeah that one in billions chance is what keeps me exploring and playing the game, honestly.

I think the only way Raxxla wouldnâ€™t be a letdown is if it ends up being the first landable earth-like world. Then once landed, you could get out of your ship and explore it on foot with your space legs. After fighting off waves of evil reptilian humanoids, because now the game suddenly turns into a flawless FPS, you finally discover a portal. You walk through it and find yourself on another planet in an entirely different galaxy full of new alien races to discover, ships to purchase, and adventures to get in to.

Is that really too much to ask?
