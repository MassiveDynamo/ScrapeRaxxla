When did the art tornqvist live in elite dangerous timeline?

Wrong Art Tornqvist. "Maria" doesn't pronounce similarly to Art. Much more likely to be Marit Tornqvist, with "Marit" pronouncing much closer to Art. And, she illustrates children's books, which deal with fables, which seems to be a bit more apropos to the rest of the Codex.
