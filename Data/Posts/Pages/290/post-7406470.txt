Probably it was in this thread already. This logo of Raxxla looks like triple aspect of Hecate who often was imaged as a triple woman figure. She brings the light by holding torches. Also same visual and back was for Artemis, Persephone and Eileithyia (Ilithyia) who lights the dark for the children. There are two systems with this names but no any variations of Eileithyia.

P.s. My bad English's joke: Ilithyia - Elite(yia)

Well just to elaborate on this, you mention three women and Orions Belt is sometimes known as the three sisters but I Imagine Orions belt has been well explored by now.
