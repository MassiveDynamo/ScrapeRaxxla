I had an hypothesis which I mentioned a while ago but didn’t get taken up. If TRDW is a conglomerate then it should be possible to join it by getting allied with various (half a dozen? a dozen??...) of its affiliates. What type of faction is DW in SD? The background flag in the mission-givers’ photo is repeated across the game, looks like there are four flags or so-is this another clue?

My theory is that all the pirate groups are part of (or used by) the Dark Wheel. It's just a little too convenient that every single system has a pirate group, and they just operate without being stamped out. The only semi-start that we've had so far, the Nysa pirates were the group that gave that mission that followed the whole Child ship business.

EDIT: And Dark Wheel is a democracy. At allied rep, the missions contact is Aide Charlotte Reynolds. The passengers contact is Travel Agent Sylvester Harutyunyan. So we're not talking to their president, heh.
