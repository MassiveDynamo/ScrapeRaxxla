DW in SD have stopped handing out missions, and Felicity Farseer states in the DW codex that DW impersonators get quietly closed down, which seems like a fairly fat hint that the DW in SD is not the true DW.

The Raxxla Codex implies that DW don't know where raxxla is as its 'their principle aim' to find it.

Of course, if the DW don't know where it is then chasing the toast may not help. That leaves even less to go on though, so at least following the DW might lead to some extra information so that there _is_ something to go on.

So in summary, chasing the DW might be the only path available - anyone ever come across Lyta Crane? Only stuff on the oracle (web) is some anime character which seems unlikely - apparently she's a DW expert and could be handy to tap up..

Yelboc.
