Yeah that one in billions chance is what keeps me exploring and playing the game, honestly.

I think the only way Raxxla wouldn’t be a letdown is if it ends up being the first landable earth-like world. Then once landed, you could get out of your ship and explore it on foot with your space legs. After fighting off waves of evil reptilian humanoids, because now the game suddenly turns into a flawless FPS, you finally discover a portal. You walk through it and find yourself on another planet in an entirely different galaxy full of new alien races to discover, ships to purchase, and adventures to get in to.

Is that really too much to ask?

Except you’d be stranded on an alien planet, your ship left behind, your credit balance in a different universe,
and no PF to loan you a new ship!


I’m fully expecting Raxxla to be a letdown, just as Zurara was. The fun is in the hunting, not in the finding.


However FD have, I think, said there’s only one universe in ED so there can be no gateway.
I think it will be a stealthy, maybe derelict, station called “Raxxla Gateway”
end of quest, nothing to see, carry on killing thargoids.
Until another locked sector is opened and the hostile AI start to swarm.
