please for the love of science can we stop thinking that raxxla is behind a permit lock or other such nonsense, having researched raxxla, the formidine rift and other mysterious goings on in ED before ps4 launch. it was said that raxxla is the only planet apart from the core systems that is not procedurally generated (it was placed in a certain spot by FDev) it has been in the game since day one and DOESN'T need any special permits or equipment to get to where it is.
Sources please, because at the moment, that sounds very much like a conflation of Raxxla stuff with FR stuff. And various things you’re saying there contradict Michael Brookes’s statement that ‘there will be no clues’, which although it may have potentially gone out of the window with 3.3, certainly appeared to have held previously.
