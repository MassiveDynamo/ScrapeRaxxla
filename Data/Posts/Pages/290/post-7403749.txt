My theory is that all the pirate groups are part of (or used by) the Dark Wheel. It's just a little too convenient that every single system has a pirate group, and they just operate without being stamped out. The only semi-start that we've had so far, the Nysa pirates were the group that gave that mission that followed the whole Child ship business.

EDIT: And Dark Wheel is a democracy. At allied rep, the missions contact is Aide Charlotte Reynolds. The passengers contact is Travel Agent Sylvester Harutyunyan. So we're not talking to their president, heh.

Exactly. Does nobody else find it strange that DW in SD is a democracy? Doesn’t seem to fit with their alleged goals.

p.s. For old FRifters:
Searched about 70 systems in the Conflux but didn’t find anything out of the ordinary. Noticed 3 of the bases there are roughly aligned pointing about 45 degrees downwards and at an angle of about 45degrees to a line back to the bubble, which seems an awfully strange arrangement. There are now two UCBs at each of the alpha, beta & gamma systems but someone else checked one pair & reported they are duplicating the Dynasty message. Still only one UCB at delta base where there are frequent npc, often one elite & can be hostile, no faction, name & ship ID seems random. Roughly checked the alignment of the UCB, they are not pointing at FRift or bubble as far as I can see; suspect FD didn’t assign any meaning to their pointing direction.
