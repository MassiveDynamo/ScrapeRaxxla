My investigation of the Jewel Box Cluster (NGC 4755) has drawn a blank. I have scanned all the named systems in the cluster and there is nothing artificial here, no Notable Stellar Phenomena or beacons of any kind.
.
One of the stars (HR 4887) is about 1700 LY closer to Sol than the rest of the cluster, although it should be associated with it in real life - but this just happens sometimes in ED. There has been little mapping done and there are only a few First Mapped tags, including the only two worlds with Biological signals, both in the same system (forgot to screenshot the name, will have to check my Codex entry later), featuring Anemones. There is one Ammonia World (CPD-59 4534 planet 1) but no Earth-like Worlds in the named systems, however I have found an untagged Earth-like World in a procedural system close by.
.
The cluster is in the Outer Orion Spur region so I have also taken the opportunity to fill my Codex entries. The cluster does not include all star or planet types but it does have a wide variety and most volcanism types seem to be present (I have not yet seen any nitrogen-based varieties), so it has been worthwhile.
