Not plotted these area in a long time, but how about understanding their relative positions?

How many of these are there in total?
What system are they ?
Is there a pattern? (Last time I checked there was).
What relation is there between these dragons/titans to the other aspects we have identified?

Im working on a revised area map -but the joys of workâ€¦ will add that for the weekend.
