I just find it interesting that the dragons in this instance are named after storm gods - usually its the other way around â€¦. Stormgod slays the dragon/snake. The dragon being tied to chaos/nature.
"And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within" - Isaiah
The fact these titans are directly compared to dragons does signal to me in a small way that there is some kind of double meaning / play of words here. If the Thargoids are equivalent to seraphim, thus angels of 'good', then are we looking at a role reversal situation. Good is evil, evil is good.


What are we being 'judged' for, and for what purpose
