I just find it interesting that the dragons in this instance are named after storm gods - usually its the other way around â€¦. Stormgod slays the dragon/snake. The dragon being tied to chaos/nature.

Not plotted these in a long time, but how about understanding their relative positions currently?

How many of these are there in total?
What system are they in ?
Is there a pattern? (Last time I checked there was).
What relation is there between these dragons/titans to the other aspects we have identified?
