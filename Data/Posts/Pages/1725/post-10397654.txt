I honestly don't think hotspots are involved here. How long have they been in the game for? I thought it was an addition part way through, or with the release of Horizons or am I failing to remember. I've played pre-Horizons, but can't remember it that well.
Hotspots were added in Beyond 3.3 as part of the mining rework (December 2018)

The station designs were added in Horizons 2.2 (October 2016)
