Hotspots were added in Beyond 3.3 as part of the mining rework (December 2018)

The station designs were added in Horizons 2.2 (October 2016)
Hotspots were added in at the same time as the Codex.
I suspect we were supposed to work it out a long time before, but part/a lot of the "Raxxla in-game storyline" was removed (the old E/F mission, and maybe lots of PF factions including TDW+their station). When we hadn't MB decided to revamp the clues, including the codex etc.
