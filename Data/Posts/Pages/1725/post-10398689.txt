I just find it interesting that the dragons in this instance are named after storm gods - usually its the other way around â€¦. Stormgod slays the dragon/snake. The dragon being tied to chaos/nature.
I don't think these are the chaos gods but the gods of order preparing us to fight the gods of chaos. The real danger here is when the Klaxxians (traditional branch) come visiting. I think the Titans are a creation of the Oresrians who gave us a lot of our technology. Remember, the "Thargoids" never actually left and GCS Saravasti and Frontier and First Encounters confirmed that fact. Anyone who thinks this is over soon is in for a rude awakening.

We're stuck in a hive-mind fantasy. Reality isn't so simple.
