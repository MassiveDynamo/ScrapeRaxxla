The issue is that any 'random' set of anything will eventually show apparently meaningful clumping. That's the nature of random

The Nature of random….

Everything existing in the universe is the fruit of chance and necessity… Democritus

“Come, then, let us create a city from the beginning, in our theory. Its real creator, as it appears, will be our needs.” Plato

on creating a Utopia…

Also translated as:
“The true creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention."
- a familiar phrase

The constraints of creating a galaxy on 8-bit computers with limited capacity is a large part of what made Elite what it is.

We are talking about cosmology here. With the universe being guarded/created by a program called Cobra…

There is no question that the the spinning hub of our galaxy wouldn't be pivotal in this….

I think also think that we need to look at the Thargoid machine as a model for galaxy creation. - if we are looking for the omphalos … the divine female womb of creation so to say….. look at the thargoid machine… Where exactly are we putting those probes?



Why does the symbol for Aegis look like part of the Thargoid Machine … and not a shield with a Gorgons Head….




It is a representation of the divine feminine - tripartate goddess call her whatever u want Hecate , Nyx…. The Omphalos Rift
