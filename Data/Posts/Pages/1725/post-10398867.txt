I don't think these are the chaos gods but the gods of order preparing us to fight the gods of chaos. The real danger here is when the Klaxxians (traditional branch) come visiting. I think the Titans are a creation of the Oresrians who gave us a lot of our technology. Remember, the "Thargoids" never actually left and GCS Saravasti and Frontier and First Encounters confirmed that fact. Anyone who thinks this is over soon is in for a rude awakening.

We're stuck in a hive-mind fantasy. Reality isn't so simple.

Ya i dont know about kalaxians or orestrians- i just think the imagery of dragons and stormgods they are using is pointing us a certain way.
