“Graves are the mountain tops of a remote new world,” inscription in the railing atop the land pyramid in Pückler’s park at Branitz.

An example of an earth tumulus or barrow, which the Celts saw as passageways to the Otherworld.

Apparently Edgar Allen Poe’s “the landscape garden” might have had some influence from Pückler, his own writings being vaguely transformative, recalling travels through some gardens being likened to some pastoral ‘Otherworld’?


Still can’t find any direct contextual link to game for Pückler other than his use of the word fernweh; otherwise this is a tenuous romantic, abstract influence at best. We can assume maybe there could be some writerly influence, regard style ect, but logically its too wide. This potential might be an example of why the quest has taken so long to decrypt, not because it is difficult, but because the author may have used unrelated source materials?

FD had indicated as such, through the memorial tour…

To old Celts/Pagans and modern Druids like myself the 'Otherworld' was the true world, our rightful place of residence, we are only in this realm (Earth) to protect nature and in some cases a form of 'test'.
Not that it makes much difference to our narrative.
The one in your picture if the river was there when it was built would have been especially important.

Stonehenge and any form of stone circle, (especially near a river) was also the beginning of the journey onwards.
