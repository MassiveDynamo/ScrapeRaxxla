just because DW may doubt the existence of raxxla in game that doesn't mean that it may be not in the game
True but it’s about context, why does he feel / think that way, I’m genuinely interested.

There are many potential hypothetical assumptions which could back this up, but ultimately no one really knows anything (!) and this quest is founded IMPO upon faith.

Faith that what FD stated is factual and contextually accurate in line with what is promoted in game (the Codex) as content and in line with our own interpretation of their language and any presumption it is currently ’accessible’.

For instance, pre launch D Braben gave public talks where he used the language - yes this/that will be in game, then such things never transpired.

Understandable it being a game under development, and from personal experience is common in corporate entities; an element can exist even when it doesn’t, because the intent is there, and can be changed at any stage.

In the same instance Braben described Sag A as not being in game, which at that point was true, as it wasn’t physically built, yet in the same breath he said yes it did exist at that time and yes you could go there, because it had a location in the galaxy map. Semantics.

So if Drew has evidence or insight let’s hear it. Or is it just a feeling?

When talking of such things it’s useful to put it into context, eg ‘X stated X and here’s the source, but X only states it’s a feeling, so only an opinion’.

Then we save ourselves all this omphaloskepsis.
