The Crane is known as Gruis in astronomy, a southern constellation - well done for picking up on my little hint @Dox Paradox An old theory of mine - having explore the Gruis constellation, and not found anything, was a bit disappointed, especially as one of the stars is a Carbon star (Jewel that burns etc.) - but hey - just another Raxxla theory ..
Alphekka (name in-game) is also known as Gemma and per in-game description 5 Alpha Coronae Borealis. It is the crown jewel of Corona Borealis. The system is just a binary star system, sadly. That said, I ascribe more to the idea that the Alleged Toast points to a specific region of sky (area surrounding Ursa Minor and Polaris). This system and Corona Borealis also seem to link to Thetis who was according to some accounts seen as a cosmic mother figure via Alcman's Cosmogonic Fragment. The thing is there are multiple jewels that fit see V886 Centauri (largest diamond).

Note: The theory document needs a rewrite to factor in history of the Bubble but alas writing all that down to justify the idea would take pages so it hasn't been done. Ideas have evolved a bunch since this was written.
