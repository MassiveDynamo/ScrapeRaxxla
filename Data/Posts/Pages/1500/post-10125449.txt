Just a friendly reminder to all of us to be careful in making public assumptions around persons and various reasons why certain things happened or didn’t happen outside the game, for want of avoiding any allegations, just to protect everyone, because reading between lines is dangerous and from experience it’s likely correct some fallout occurred.

Let’s try and not make too many public assumptions, and if so use third person or just refer to persons as nominals. It’s apparent that some falling out occurred, either way it sounds personal, so let’s try not and cast aspersions .

If someone has recently posted a comment on Twitter that sheds new light on Raxxla, then let’s look at it contextually, based on the evidence provided.
