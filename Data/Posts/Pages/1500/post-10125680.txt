Unrelated to precedent posts, the pdf @CMDRCorrMorningstarFelian posted earlier contains an interesting idea. The Astrophel could be famous persons related to space/astronomy.
Maybe the path laid out by the systems named after them would form a spiral, or lead somewhere...
I found interesting to discover that Ptolemy (famous for his early cosmogonic model) and Komarov (Russian astronaut) were both neighbors in the same region close to a nebula I visited some time ago.
After all we've got spiralling stars printed on a telescope network system...
