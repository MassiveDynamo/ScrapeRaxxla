being a triple elite, ruined relations with all the factions in the capital systems, sirius, in shindez with DW and even PF. i didn't stop there and also lowered my reputation with superpowers to -100. 320 million bounty and endless interceptions is all I got.
with -100 reputation half the bubble is enemies. you fly into the system and the whole radar is red
There are reasons combat ELITE takes forever if done remotely legally and ethically.
