LYTA type stars in Crab Nebula. Alternatively Corona Australis is a constellation (cra) in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere. Its Latin name means "southern crown", and it is the southern counterpart of Corona Borealis, the northern crown...Jewel on the brow could be “crown”
Already checked both (see previous Dark Sirens hypothesis).
Of course just because I didn't find anything doesn't mean there’s nothing there!
The Crane is known as Gruis in astronomy, a southern constellation - well done for picking up on my little hint @Dox Paradox An old theory of mine - having explore the Gruis constellation, and not found anything, was a bit disappointed, especially as one of the stars is a Carbon star (Jewel that burns etc.) - but hey - just another Raxxla theory ..
