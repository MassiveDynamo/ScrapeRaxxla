I read this in Jorkis Summary:

David Braben:
“There are missions out there I know almost no players have seen,”....I wasn’t making friends with the minor factions.

I accepted a mission by TDW today .
i was asked in a message to do a "chaos" mission and kill 20 civilian ships.
so I asked myself what if becoming enemy to a faction triggers events in game?

being a triple elite, ruined relations with all the factions in the capital systems, sirius, in shindez with DW and even PF. i didn't stop there and also lowered my reputation with superpowers to -100. 320 million bounty and endless interceptions is all I got.
with -100 reputation half the bubble is enemies. you fly into the system and the whole radar is red
