Whenever we complete a mission there's 99% of the time two parties involved, two minor factions. Often they seem incompatible and yet work together. Maybe there's a "chain of friendship" we could follow. I don't know if that's clear, but it would result in a "bubble" of reputation (not always neighbor systems that's true).
Did someone follow the "chain of fridnship" starting from The Dark Wheel for instance?
I haven't tried to tackle the tangled web of factions. I have seen factions of superpowers that supposedly hate one-another help each other. That said, there are groups working together that you might not think would. The BGS is a very complex beast. If you want to get an idea of what is going on watch trade, missions (legal and less so), and watch the ground missions vs space. The galaxy is a very complex place. One a related note, the concourse and bars are interesting places for rumors. Listen to random conversations if you have Odyssey. The same applies to music and advertisements in the concourse and bars. Also, overheard on the bar of the bar of the AOE Dharmachakra, "Good systems to visit - anywhere where Onionhead is legal." You see, not only does East India Company (like on Earth) run a thriving network of trade, but they pretty much the main distribution point for Onionhead. The point here: details matter. What a faction claims to care about on paper isn't always the reality (this applies equally to player and non-player factions).

One other bit of advice..

When the presence of great light, look to the shadows to see what is real versus what is purportedly true. Shadows don't know how to lie.

When in darkness, remember this is where the stars form. Everything began in darkness and everything ends there, too. The womb is just as dark as the grave. Darkness reveals all to those who dare to seek out its' solace.
