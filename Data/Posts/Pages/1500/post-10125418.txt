yes I learned that yesterday.
I think in one of his tweets DW Himself mentioned that he doubts the existence of Raxxla in his game.
Mmm, Iâ€™m sceptical. Drew was the first to tell us that DB had said Raxxla is in-game-see my quotes thread.
He did readily admit that he (nor any of the other authors) knew anything about Raxxla (other than MB of course!) & they were forbidden from using it in their stories.
