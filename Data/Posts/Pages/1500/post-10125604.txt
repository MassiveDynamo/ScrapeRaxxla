There are few good areas where one could readily test this: factions Dark Echo (near Alliance/Independent space) and East India Company (border of Fed/Imperial space near Ackwada). Working with either should effectively open up a large region with good standing.
It is not exactly what I had in mind, but why not. I think the diversity of minor faction is more important than the number of systems they control (and I have nothing to support this opinion)
Whenever we complete a mission there's 99% of the time two parties involved, two minor factions. Often they seem incompatible and yet work together. Maybe there's a "chain of friendship" we could follow. I don't know if that's clear, but it would result in a "bubble" of reputation (not always neighbor systems that's true).
Did someone follow the "chain of fridnship" starting from The Dark Wheel for instance?
