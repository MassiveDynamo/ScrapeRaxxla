Why is Col70 suddeny cropping up in this discussion? Look at in-game jump range & travel timeline:

2097 - start of Generation ship launches
Early 22nd Century - first rudimentary "faster than light" drive by Li Qin Jao .
2151 - Tau Ceti/Taylor Colony founded & wave of extra-Sol colonisation started leading to the Core Systems.
2296 first rumour of Raxxla reported (in Tau Ceti)
“2412 Colonisation of Lave by Imperial citizens.
2422 Departure of exploration missions to Diso, Leesti, Zaonce and Riedquat.” -Lave Revolution
2800 - Faraway Jump (used navigational systems to make Hyperspace safer - took hundreds of years to establish) enabling consumer ship usage.
3100 - Quirium Drive (Single-ship safe Hyperdrive jumping using 'Quirium' as 'fuel')
3200 - Class 2B (Totally different type of Hyperdrive, possible wormhole travel)
late 3290s - a emerged that immediately rendered the Type 2b obsolete.
3300 - FSD (Almost exactly the same as the Quirium Drive, but longer range and not Quirium Fuelled)

Sol to Tau Ceti is 12 ly, Sol to Lave is 114 ly & that was colonised 116 years the first rumour of Raxxla. Ergo Raxxla is very close to Sol, even if it were found by a dedicated bunch of explorers and adventurers like TDW who would have gone off into the black for years at a time. I believe it to be within a 114 ly sphere from Sol.

But I don’t think it will be found until TDW have been joined by someone who has reached the necessary threshold on their “personal journey” through the game and then survived the endgame play. If it locatable before the endgame then it would have been found by now-there is an effort underway to search all systems in a sphere around Sol and I think they’re past 120ly by now.

I wouldn't put to much weight on the limitations of jump range, with different types of drives. Both Faraway and Quirium were probably properitarian technologies, only used by GalCop. Limitations to jump freedom(at least the map, probably also range) were implemented to control their pilots. This is described in Imprint.

Achenar was an established colony in 2300, so if was clearly possible to move quite far in the early days.
