1. I believe it is an important question to ask, given the confirmed statements:

"Why haven't we found Raxxla?"

2. Has anyone found any unlocked systems in col 70? I remember reading a comment about drew saying we should pay close attention to the panel on our left. This was in relation to Salome starting there.

This could have been Drew wriggling around the Col70 in-game permit lock to make his book lore compliant (wouldn’t blame him). Or it could be a genuine in-game hole left as an easter egg, since I remember a galnet post (or newsletter statement) that Col70 had been “almost completely locked”.

Edit: In the book Luko could plot a jump into locked space because his ship was old style and he could manually plot a jump. We can’t.
