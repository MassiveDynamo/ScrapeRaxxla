not sure ...rumors does not mean exact location. We have rumors about god last couple thousands years, still nobody saw it.
Initialy they had hyper drive which could push you back million years. This time is 1st mention of raxxla. And then later that codex was added.

Reactions:
Vetinari, Non Grata and Machina Ergo Sum
