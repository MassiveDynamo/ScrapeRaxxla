I wouldn't put to much weight on the limitations of jump range, with different types of drives. Both Faraway and Quirium were probably properitarian technologies, only used by GalCop. Limitations to jump freedom(at least the map, probably also range) were implemented to control their pilots. This is described in Imprint.

Achenar was an established colony in 2300, so if was clearly possible to move quite far in the early days.

True, Sol to Achenar is 139.5 ly, & colonised in 23rd Century, according to the Wiki, so 22??. Around the time of the first Raxxla rumour! I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Raxxla is quite close to Achenar. I did spend a few days searching around there, but I was primarily looking for TDW station at a red subdwarf, based on the codex image.

And the Faraway & Quirium drives weren’t available until 500 & 800 years after the first rumour, so the jump range to find it was very limited and possible travel time to it fairly limited.

I think the first hint to the station was in the Horizons start screen, when it was apparently orbiting a moon/planet of an A-type star. Now the codex apparently shows it orbiting a red subdwarf. Hence I think these visual “clues” are illustrative only, and not 100% pukka. Unless FD are perhaps changing its location in-game over time?
