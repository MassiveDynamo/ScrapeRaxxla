If its the video Im thinking of he was speculating if it was possible to find a way in to the Col Sector or overleap permit-locked, as many others have done.

Gnosis pretty much shows what would happen if we did find a way in that shouldn't be there, its not meant to be discovered until the time is right.

Thread on financial report says ED is 'expanding the galaxy' significantly later this year. Whether that means in terms of area, as in unlocking some permit locked, or whether it means adding more gameplay and content to existing systems is unclear. Also says fdev are committed to free content as they believe it leads to the longevity of the games - which has been proven by the sales and after sales upgrades (50% of ED purchasers bought Horizons - not clear how many 'active' players bought or did not buy but obviously way more than 50%. Reminds me of Elite where there was one copy sold for every single BBC Micro in the UK at the time - considering some must have been company computers that's more than staggering)
Click to expand...

I think the Col70 etc permit locks will come down with the new paid upgrade. The goids will invade in force (even on foot/claw/tentacle/appendage- see the leaked photo) & take over the bubble, ejecting humanity to make a new home around Colonia, or maybe the Dynasty terraformed worlds (hopefully they’ll be finished by then).

Must get on with my “personal journey” - get elite combateer, visit all the tourist beacons, get top rank with all three superpowers, trade & get allied in all bubble systems...anything else I need to improve before TDW notice me?

Hang on! FD...can you delay the next update by a couple of years please???
