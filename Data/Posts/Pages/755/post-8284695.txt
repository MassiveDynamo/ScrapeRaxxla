The loading screen may mean nothing, no reason why it should. Its for planet based stuff so reasonable to assume a planet is used in the loading screen and that's it.

the pic of DW station in Codex may or may not be an in-game shot of the station, if it is it narrows down the type of star, if its not if its just for illustrative purposes then it means nothing. Personally Im about 70/30 that is actual in-game station.
