1. I believe it is an important question to ask, given the confirmed statements:

"Why haven't we found Raxxla?"

2. Has anyone found any unlocked systems in col 70? I remember reading a comment about drew saying we should pay close attention to the panel on our left. This was in relation to Salome starting there.
COL 70 Sector was open for a long period. No significant content was discovered. The sector was locked when it started to become significant in the lore. At the time of decoding of the Thargoid probe(Uses col 70 sector fy-n c21-3 as a fixed reference point), it had been locked.
