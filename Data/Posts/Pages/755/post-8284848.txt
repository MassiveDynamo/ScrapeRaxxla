Regarding Raxxla being close to Sol... just a couple points to consider:

1. On 1984 Elite, we could get military tech (fuel/lasers/etc) so it might be the case that military could have better tech than the publicly available;
2. There's even a tourist beacon about a Thargoids/Human research cooperation facility... humans flying Thargoid ships... who knows how far out mankind could have reached;

But one thing still bugs me... that I found 3 asteroid fields regions in Sol having about 600ls in diameter (2ls hight) between Mars/Jupiter orbits... you can see them on system map but not target it, only fly there in SC and drop in normal space. It is easily possible to have a DW station hidden there... and it would be a massive task to search for it over all that area.
