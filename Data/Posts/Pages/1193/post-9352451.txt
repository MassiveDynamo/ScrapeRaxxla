I think it was Drew who inferred that Raxxla would be within 500 LY of Sol due to the length of time it's been in the lore and the associated jump ranges.
The Potato Hunt is brute forcing this on the Exploration subforum.
For myself If I wanted to hide something in the game I'd likely go for an Icy body orbiting the distant partner of a brown dwarf binary. Plenty of those close to the Bubble that haven't been mapped.
There is also the quote by Braben about looking at a star in his back garden and then logging on and traveling to it; Northern hemisphere, naked eye visible? (the Potato Hunt seems to concentrating on the southern Hemisphere thus far)
Of course this wouldn't square with the previous hypothesis...
