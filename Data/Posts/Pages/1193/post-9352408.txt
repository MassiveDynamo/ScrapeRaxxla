Strange how he didn’t say “I know where it is”…. And assuming he meant FD is a natural assumption, but it could mean the player base/Elite community….

I’m guessing he’d expect someone to ask about it at some point (especially if they had put it in game) and may have prepared an answer with a cryptic clue…

Or you may have caught him off guard and he let it slip because he was desperate for a beer?
Or perhaps he and MB set it up together so he was talking for two people?
Not so sure about this, as I think setting up Raxxla would actually also involve some people from sound, graphics, and possibly CM team, but it might be DB’s and MB’s Easter egg and they personally took charge.
