This paragraph just seems so odd & out of place; it seems contrived! We don’t have access to that “book”, though many people (me included) have gone looking through Philip Sidney’s “Astrophil and Stella” verses.
I agree, this paragraph seems the most likely candidate if you were to look for something to apply the quote "make it a little bit obvious" to. In any case, it is the one part of the whole codex entry I can't make much sense of. It not only has the fictional book title in it, it also seems to relate to the whole Omphalos mythology. But so far I can't really answer the question of: what the flip does Delphi and the Omphalos myth have to do with Astrophil and Stella? IF it is a reference to Sidney's work. We still can't fully rule out that they really tried to make the codex entry self contained, meaning you don't really need more than what is in the codex entry.

But yeah, I am still trying to figure out how Omphalos and Astrophel go together. There are more questions though. "These details (referring to the Omphalos Rift) , however, were later shown to bear a striking resemblance to the children's story Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars, and soon lost credibility." Why make it a children's story specifically? Why is Astrophel suddenly a princess? What do they really mean by Spiralling Stars? Still too much ambivalence, too much room for interpretation.

I did find an interesting piece of art though, a musical I never heard of, while searching for alternative references for Princess Astrophel. It's old enough to potentially have been known by those writing the entry for Raxxla: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_of_the_Stars
