Wow!: Alien Ship At Rhea in Sol. This one It's pretty specific, you might be after something solid.
Well, it jumped out at me because it aligns with the hypothesis I’ve been testing. There may be other versions, try it and see!

Mind, I’ve been looking around here for a while now & not a sniff of an alien ship so far!
But it seems reassuring that I’m on the right lines.
