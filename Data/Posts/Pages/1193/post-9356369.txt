I still struggle with the fact that all the clues -if that is what they are- given in the Codex entry for Raxxla, are applicable to too many candidates. Yes, mother of galaxies can mean Cassiopeia, but might even fit more the constellation of Virgo and all the dozens of galaxies it contains. And many of the queens and goddesses in the sky are featured with jewels on their brow, or wearing diadems. So... let me add another one to the mix!

By looking further into the Astrophel section of the codex entry -since this passage is directly hinting at giving a clue- I came upon a particular edition of Sidney's book, featuring this:


Now this might not mean anything, since it could be the emblem of the guy publishing that edition, but... just found it funny, with the peacock being Juno/Hera's bird, and that bird having many "eyes" to see. The legend of how it became her bird is also interesting, with Juno taking the green eyes of Argus the Watcher, and putting them on her pet bird, the peacock. Anyways, just found it interesting and it shows how easily new interpretations might come up when looking for clues
