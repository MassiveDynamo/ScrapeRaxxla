Mmm, Possibly another hint?
"Most come to Epsilon Eridani for the WorldCraft Theme Park which was set up with no expense spared and costs a small fortune to visit. It is well worth it though, because you can live in a world of almost any fantasy you wish (something that has given it a reputation for seediness). If you want a break from the lushness outside, you can elect to stay for a day at the Ancient London Earth World of 1960 (where every effort has been made to make it as authentic as possible, it even has the stench of pollution).[4]

Every fantasy theme has its own complex which is self contained, with actors to help tourists play a part in adventures and feel that it is real. [4]

There are more wholesome themes on offer too. The War Veterans Trust maintains offices at Oliverport and runs the famous Museum of Armour and Ballistics on New California."

Rekall that Sirius provides the power generators for WC parks, and that they control Robigo, home to the CdE (Seedy) Corproration, and how that system is actually an easter egg (?) to The movie Total Recall, and it's role in not only alternative realities, but also terraforming.
