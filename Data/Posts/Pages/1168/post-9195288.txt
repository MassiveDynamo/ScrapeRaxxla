Not sure if it is relevant or not, but a bit more on Axis Mundi as centre of the universe (as opposed to just being the celestial pole of the Earth) here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_center_of_the_Universe

One thing that jumps out at me there (and goes off on another tangent) is this little snippet: "The 19th century astronomer Johann Heinrich von MÃ¤dler proposed the Central Sun Hypothesis, according to which the stars of the universe revolved around a point in the Pleiades."

Alcyone was apparently the most likely candidate in this theory. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alcyone/
