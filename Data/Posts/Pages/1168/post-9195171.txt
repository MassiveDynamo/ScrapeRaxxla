I found this system called Axis Mundi (meaning axis of the world or also refered to as the navel of the world). Now I came across this system and I couldn't help wondering, is there a connection to Raxxla? I searched the whole system with FSS and found nothing. The system only has 2 suns in it. So I wondered why have an empty system with a fancy name that isn't a real system? Why not a random name and why call it that? I might be going full tin foil hat here but on Raxxla there is this thing called the Omphalos Rift, Omphalos means navel. See the connection?

Very interesting. Per Wikipedia the concept of Axis Mundi is also very closely related to that of the Omphalos:

How close is it to Sol? (Not in game at the moment)
