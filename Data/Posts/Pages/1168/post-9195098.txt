I found this system called Axis Mundi (meaning axis of the world or also refered to as the navel of the world). Now I came across this system and I couldn't help wondering, is there a connection to Raxxla? I searched the whole system with FSS and found nothing. The system only has 2 suns in it. So I wondered why have an empty system with a fancy name that isn't a real system? Why not a random name and why call it that? I might be going full tin foil hat here but on Raxxla there is this thing called the Omphalos Rift, Omphalos means navel. See the connection?
