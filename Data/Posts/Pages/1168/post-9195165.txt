Maybe this roman number aproach and Capellas brow is the first step, maybe somehow we should look for the whisperer in witch space after that turn?
And i didnt understand how did you see Polaris is near there, there is the entire Cameloperdalis constellation between them. Maybe you are being sarcastic but i didnt figure it out
No I wasnt being sarcastic, but I was mistaken. I put it down to insufficient caffeine in my system so early in the morning. I zoomed in on your larger map (https://www.e-rara.ch/zut/content/zoom/3341761) to look at star “e”and saw “Polaris” without examining it closer - it was the middle word of “Circulus Polaris Antarticus”!
