It's 122.91 LY from Sol
Hmm - I wonder if it might actually be centred or equidistant between the pole stars? (Polaris and Polaris Australis aka Sigma Octantis) Or two other stars that might be worth checking out as part of a cosmological Axis Mundi and somehow related to the Omphalos and/or Raxxla??
