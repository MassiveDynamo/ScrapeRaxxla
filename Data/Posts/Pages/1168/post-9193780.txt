Long time lurker here. Please excuse if the formating is off, this is indeed my first post here.

I punched the coordinates into Google Earth.
No direct hit, but something currious came up:

View attachment 229219

Does anybody know, what should have been there?



Edit:
While I'm at it:

The star with e should be HD 34019, the other one HD33654 if I'm not mistaken. They and 9 Aur match up to the drawing.

HD 33654 maps to HR 1692 in game. Nothing interesting here. Moving on to HD 34019.
