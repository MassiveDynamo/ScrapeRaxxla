I wonder if Raxxla is a rogue star system, stuck between known star systems. How can i put this, the only way it will appear is to be in a certain known system where it will then appear in the nav panel list, even then it won't be listed as 'Raxxla' just some any other star system. You would have to be pretty eagle eyed to thing 'ooh that wasn't there before/ in the gal map.

Just a theory, putting it out there.

I hope there is something special there, not just any old pile of ruins. That whever finds it will open up a new area of the game to explore. Like rogue planets or a map of missing off the charts star systems populated by a hidden section of society. That would be cool.
