It was a part of the Formidine Rift Mystery, as part of what we had to find during the Fed vs CoR CG. It was discussed on the Formidine Rift Mysteries thread and was considered as a part of that mysteries, AFAIK.

Yes, they are part of the clues, which as we know, are not necessary to find The Big Thing, settlements on the planets with the logs are only there to help us. Looking at things so far they did not help us a lot
