No. I said:

1 Raxxla is in game
2 The Formidine Rift could be found by players without Horizon
3 The Formidine Rift could be found by lonewolf randomly
4 The Formidine Rift could be found by brute force method but it isn't the best way to find it.
5 The best way to find the Formidine Rift, in your point of view, is collecting the pieces of the puzzle to solving it

Cheers,

Drew.

Wait but no, "2 The Formidine Rift could be found by players without Horizon" what are The base on planet then?
