Wait but no, "2 The Formidine Rift could be found by players without Horizon" what are The base on planet then?
It just means that the Formidine Rift is in space, not on a planet. Any player of E: D 1.x can find the Formidine Rift, that way it is accessible even to the three people who play on Macs ;D

There are many clues/story to the Formidine Rift mystery being added to the game, some may require E: D 2.x to find, but whilst the clues are helpful to find the Formidine Rift, they are not necessary.

At least, that's my understanding
