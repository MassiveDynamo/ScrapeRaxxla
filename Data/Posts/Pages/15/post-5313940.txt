They are clearly not Formidine Rift Mystery, they just another set of clues

Horizons didn't exist when the Formidine Rift mystery was originally composed. When Horizons arrived we took the opportunity to expand the things that players could interact with as part of the mystery and weave in player generated content such as the Galactic Mapping project. Ditto the Guardians, Ditto the Commanders.

Some of the original things in game have been updated due to the game being much more sophisticated than it was at launch. Players have also influenced how the Formidine Rift story unfolds.

Cheers,

Drew.

Finally, I also want to point out that this thread relates to Raxxla, and not the Formidine Rift. We have a whole thread for that matter, so let's not merge dogs and wolves, maybe ?

Yep. I came here to talk about Raxxla myself.

Cheers,

Drew.
