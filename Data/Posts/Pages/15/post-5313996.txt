Now to get back on Raxxla, I'd tend to agree on the thinking that it may not be that far out from the core worlds. As Drew mentionned already the planet used to be reachable through old means, as in, the previous FSD technology that required much, much more travelling times than now. On the other hand, it also allowed to jump straight at any celestial bodies coordinates, lest some heavy manual calculations required from the pilot himself. (cf. Luko in Reclamation).

Another thing worth of note is that, for a few centuries, Raxxla was orbiting the moon of Lave 2 which, incidentally, appears to be permit-locked right now.
It's a fact that the Pilots Federation entirely controls the permit system, and even have its own internal closed circles : The Circle of Independant Elite Pilots, and The Dark Wheel. (cf. And Here the Wheel, and who Robert Garry/his family really are).

Last thing of note, Raxxla itself is considered to be a rogue planet, with the unique ability to move at will anywhere in space, most likely lest some heavy transit times that would certainly not allow it to move, let's say to the other side of the galaxy, hahah !

All of the above is of course based on previous lore and story materials, and as to if this is canonical to Elite: dangerous's storyline or not ... :S
