I probably dream when I listen to the Josh Hawkins BroCast where Drew was guested ?
For those who never listen it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvcYNYIQZ8M

Drew, in this broadcast, you said that you didn't know where was Raxxla but M. Brooks and D. Braben assured you that it was ingame.
You also said in this broadcast that a lonewolf could find Raxxla randomly, that it was findable by brute force method, but the more accurate way to find it was not this method (you said that it was mostly like solving a puzzle than searching a particular object that we'll said : eh, this is Raxxla, look at the USS name).

Drew, you said that kind of things few times, on few broadcast (the Josh Hawkins one, the DJ Truthsayer one) and also here, on this forum (I don't have the link now, but everyone can find it easy).

So, don't say you have no clue about Raxxla. You know that it is ingame, findable by collecting the pieces of a puzzle, etc...

Drew, for all the pilots that are involved in this quest and read this thread, please, confirm that to us.
You must also confirming us that you had a conversation with FDev and they said to you that Raxxla was ingame because you said that few times and now, you seems to contradicting that. Be clear, please.

I hope that it is not a fool's game

Thanks.
