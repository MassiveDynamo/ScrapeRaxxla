I'm not confuse. I know what you told us about the Formidine Rift, and I remember well what you said about Raxxla too. It's clear for me.
You said few times on few broadcasts that Raxxla was ingame (FDev said that to you and authorized you to say that), findable by player, etc... All I mentioned in my post.

That's right that there is some conversation during the BroCast where you told about the Formidine Rift, but you also told about Raxxla and said that I mentioned.

I'm confused now, as you seems to say you never told us what I mentionned.

In that case it's probably a little confusion of the subject changing during discussion on the podcasts.

To clarify.

The Formidine Rift has been in-game for a while and is solvable via in game clues. Those have been clearly seen by many players and parts of the mystery have been unraveled (e.g. beacons and bases). I do know all about this as I wrote it.

I have been told that Raxxla is in-game somewhere in Elite Dangerous too. As for what it is, where it is and how you find it, I do not know any more than any other player. I have *speculated* many times because people have asked me what I think. I might be right and I might be wrong, I do not know.

My current *theory* on Raxxla is that is isn't too far from the core worlds (bubble) as it was reachable many centuries ago by more primitive hyperspace tech. Somehow it has remained hidden. You may need special requirements (equipment, rank, ship) to reach it. There are vague references in missions issued by the Dark Wheel Faction in Shinrarta Dezhra, these may be important, they may not.

The two mysteries are not interrelated as far as I know.

Cheers,

Drew.
