No. I said:

1 Raxxla is in game
2 The Formidine Rift could be found by players without Horizon
3 The Formidine Rift could be found by lonewolf randomly
4 The Formidine Rift could be found by brute force method but it isn't the best way to find it.
5 The best way to find the Formidine Rift, in your point of view, is collecting the pieces of the puzzle to solving it

Cheers,

Okay ^^

Thanks.

But as Hironichu said, there is a pb in that case. There was abandonned outposts on planets to find, during the CG

They are clearly not Formidine Rift Mystery, they just another set of clues

It was a part of the Formidine Rift Mystery, as part of what we had to find during the Fed vs CoR CG. It was discussed on the Formidine Rift Mysteries thread and was considered as a part of that mysteries, AFAIK.

I begin to think its a fool's game
