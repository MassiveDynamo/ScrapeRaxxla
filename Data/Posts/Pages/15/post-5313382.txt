Ok, now it's clear.

And I only mentionned what you told us about Raxxla during these broadcasts, as it is what's having our attention here ^^

So, considering I told only about that you said about Raxxla, you confirm us that I'm right and don't told about the Formidine Rift.

You told us :

1 Raxxla is ingame
2 Raxxla could be found by players without Horizon
3 Raxxla could be found by lonewolf randomly
4 Raxxla could be found by brute force method but it isn't the best way to find it.
5 The best way to find it, in your point of view, is collecting the pieces of the puzzle to solving it

Am I right ?
