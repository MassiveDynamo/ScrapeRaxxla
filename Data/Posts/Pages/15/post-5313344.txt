I'm not confuse. I know what you told us about the Formidine Rift, and I remember well what you said about Raxxla too. It's clear for me.
You said few times on few broadcasts that Raxxla was ingame (FDev said that to you and authorized you to say that), findable by player mostly like we solve a puzzle than with a brute force method, even it's findable by brute force method too, that it could be found by a player without the Horizon extension, etc... All I mentioned in my post.

That's right that there is some conversation during the BroCast where you told about the Formidine Rift, but you also told about Raxxla and said that I mentioned.

I'm confused now, as you seems to say you never told us what I mentionned.
