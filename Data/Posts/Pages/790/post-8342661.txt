Up to 67% Dangerous now. Thanks Macros, the all-energy weapon build is proving faster overall kill rate since I don’t need to restock ammo, however I now have a notoriety of 2 and a 500k bounty. How this happened I do not know. I only attack Wanted ships and am careful not to hit others in the background. I suspect some of those Wanted ships belonged to the faction controlling the system & were wanted by other systems, since the bounty is from the local system. Bah! Thye were very welcoming when I was killing foreign criminals, but protective of their own!
Still, it will allow some time off combat for my arthritic thumbs to recover. Might swap back into my exploration Phantom and pop back to the Cete to pass a couple of hours; didn’t find the second message from the Bifrost.

Here's the Corvette I use for BH/manufactured material gathering. There's room for improvement but it can take easily a wind of dangerous/elite in hazres while standing still. It need 4 pips to weapon the other 2 to system.
You can replace a cargo by a fighter bay to bait ships that are too far: order the slf to attack an enemy before it gets out from your radar, then call it back. It usually does the trick and avoid you to run after a fresh target.

If you intend to fight alongside authorities, gimballed weapons might be safer.
