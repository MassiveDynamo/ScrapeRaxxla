Wanted, Sol Starways

Can often be seen as announcements in Local Chat at installations (often Scientific/Communication installations), quite often random NPC's flying Cobra.
Just as they jump out they announce these things. In and around the bubble, not just Sol.


Clearly they know more about traveling to the unknown than we do.

I have followed a few of these but it hasn't lead me to anything in particular as far as I can see. No patterns.
The pilot return to 'normal scripted behaviour' after jumpout. If the pilots-faction was at war, the pilot will go back to the regular "no more war" chat as soon as they have jumped to another system. Hence delivering these lines of "Sol Starways" seem to be scripted just as they jump out.

If you see a pattern, please start the sequence from another system (installation) 20 LY or more away and see if the pattern appears again.
In my attempts so far, no pattern where they are going.

I have not been able to find any traces of this "Sol Starways" in minor factions nor ship names.
