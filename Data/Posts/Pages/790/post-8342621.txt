Up to 67% Dangerous now. Thanks Macros, the all-energy weapon build is proving faster overall kill rate since I don’t need to breakoff to restock ammo, however I now have a notoriety of 2 and a 500k bounty. How this happened I do not know. I only attack Wanted ships and am careful not to hit others in the background. I suspect some of those Wanted ships belonged to the faction controlling the system & were wanted by other systems, since my bounty is from the local system. Bah! They were very welcoming when I was killing foreign criminals, but protective of their own!
Still, it will allow some time off combat for my arthritic thumbs to recover. Might swap back into my exploration Phantom and pop back to the Cete to pass a couple of hours; didn’t find the second message from the Bifrost.
