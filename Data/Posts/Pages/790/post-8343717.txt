Apologizing for a hoax on the internet... What are you up to?!

When did you start using the internet?

This man is trying to get more views!


Yeah.

He'll probably take the apology back and say something to the victims like, "you hoaxed yourself."

Maybe apologizing personally to the people he lied to would of been a better first step. At one point he called the people who disagreed with his false claims the bullies. It would be in his character to use this response as a reason for him to launch into his normal mode of attacking, acting like he is hurt.

This game gets real Lord of The Flies in groups over ten people.

Tell a lie long enough and people will believe you. Better a raxxla hoax than another 10th insight, morman, dianetic book. But maybe that's his next project.

Blaze your own trail.
