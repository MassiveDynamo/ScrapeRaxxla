Zoom in on Sol via the map, realistic mode. Some constellations are broken, but if you look around you'll see a few of them.
You don't need to be at Sol, just have selected it so it's center.
Also, if you are at another location you can see it if the current zoom location is within a certain distance from sol. Being pointed and zoomed into sol is just the easiest way to accomplish this.
