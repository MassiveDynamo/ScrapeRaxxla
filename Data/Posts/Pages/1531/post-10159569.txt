Thargoid scouts are the way to do it, I killed a thousand or so in the Pleiades during Lockdown....gaining arthritis in my thumb base joints and tendonitis in my wrists. I don’t recommend it!
Personally stuck at Dangerous (my old 84 rank) don’t intend to kill aliens, from a role playing perspective. It’s pretty clear Galnet is riddled with propaganda to cover up superpowers shenanigans.

Like my ranking to mean something, so I now only use violence for self defence (role playing), Exploration has petered-out as I’ve focused on Raxxla and the bubble, Trade just naturally rises on its own, and I ignore all other ranks.

Personally don’t believe Raxxla is rank locked, unless it’s linked to a permit system, but there’s no evidence to indicate otherwise IMOP.
