Personally stuck at Dangerous (my old 84 rank) don’t intend to kill aliens, from a role playing perspective. It’s pretty clear Galnet is riddled with propaganda to cover up superpowers shenanigans.

Like my ranking to mean something, so I now only use violence for self defence (role playing), Exploration has petered-out as I’ve focused on Raxxla and the bubble, Trade just naturally rises on its own, and I ignore all other ranks.

Personally don’t believe Raxxla is rank locked, unless it’s linked to a permit system, but there’s no evidence to indicate otherwise IMOP.

Mmm, I only chased the Combat rank in case triple elite was required for TDW/Raxxla. Regretted it ever since, the hands are still painful!!!
Yes, the anti-thargoid propaganda was always obvious, but it was also always obvious that there was no alternative to war-we don't have the in-game mechanism to communicate....and if the response to that is that this was the real reason behind UA/TS using Morse Code, then my counter is that I tried to communicate with both UA/TS and thargoids using Morse, flashing ship lights & system comms message with no result. Exploration became flat as there seemed to be nothing to find beyond beige planets (I much preferred the pre-Odyssey graphics!). For me the quest is the only thing left, and as I now believe it to be hidden in a planetary ring in Sol by the infamous RNG SC dropout with no indication of where to try then I am indeed becoming jaded.
