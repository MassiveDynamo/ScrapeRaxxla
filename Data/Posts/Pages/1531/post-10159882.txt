I wonder if we haven't seen all of the Raxxla symbol. In TDW, Alex sees markings on attacking ships. These markings are described as: "There had been black and green flags with bright sunbursts on them, and non-terrestrial ideographs on the sides."
Presumably either from whoever conned them into transporting Tharglet-infected Mymurths to Cirag, or more likely Cirag defence force.
