That was before. I do not remember which patch 1-2 years after, but scouts do not give a strong increase in combat rank.
What's interesting, I got my combat rank Elite defending another settlement for the materials for the spacesuit.
Not measured how much they give a strong increase in rank, but ARXs rushes a lot. 2 missions and already 400 ARXs, the ceiling.
