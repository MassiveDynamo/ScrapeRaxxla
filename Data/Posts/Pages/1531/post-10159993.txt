I wonder if we haven't seen all of the Raxxla symbol. In TDW, Alex sees markings on attacking ships. These markings are described as: "There had been black and green flags with bright sunbursts on them, and non-terrestrial ideographs on the sides."
My interpretation of the flag (sans-ideograms):

I think it was symbolic of the mythical Fianna - and the ‘Tests of the Fianna’ in order to join the group. The sunburst taken from what they called themselves “Gal Gréine” which i think means sunbeam or sunburst…. So i kind of think it was supposed to be the dark wheel actively taking part in the test…
