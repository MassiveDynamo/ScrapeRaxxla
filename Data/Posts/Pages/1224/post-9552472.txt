It is safe to assume we know nothing about anything concerning the Dark Wheel and Raxxla apart from what is within the Codex, and certain confirmations made by various FD employees or their partners.

The Dark Wheel may / may not know anything, logic would dictate they don’t because supposedly Raxxla has not been ‘communicated’ as discovered.

But it’s equally plausible it has been discovered and was hidden from the general public as much as it remains either a total mystery, or maybe some elements of it’s location are known but lost to myth or obscured over time through tradition (see toast).

It could be that certain organisations such as the Dark Wheel are either actively searching for Raxxla, or they are not; it could equally be that such organisations are no longer active, we simply don’t know.

All we have as concrete is the Codex, that ‘maybe’ the DW station is out there and that it holds certain information; and the statements by FD that Raxxla ‘it’s out there’ and from Drew that prior to 2017 DW in SD is / was certainly a front.

Draw your own conclusions but I try and be critical of my own assumptions, as much as I am of the reliability of any information.

We can all make assumptions, but until we have definitive ‘key findings’ we can’t make any reliable assessments.
