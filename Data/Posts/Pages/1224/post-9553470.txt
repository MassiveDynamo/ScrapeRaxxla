I do like the idea of raxxla as a wandering moon that jumps from system to system ( possibly the progenitor of the Fleet Carrrier mechanic) and disguises itself among existing moons… working its way on a 50 year cycle… hmmm maybe time to go back over the various “ strange happenings” and look for patterns again.
I think something like that checks a lot of boxes. Though a 50 year cycle is a bit too much for it to be useful to players.
If it just looks like a moon or a planet then it is very easy for players to miss. But if it changes systems every week or month or whatever and a system that it moves through is scanned on multiple occasions over a long enough period of time then it could be noticed when comparisons are made between those scans. If a moon or planet is on some scans and not others that would be highly suspicious.
That's only really useful if it's doing a circuit and it regularly returns to places it has been or if someone catches it when it arrives and can ride it to the new destination(s) and report that to everyone else. This could also explain how it was lost , if an attack or accident killed everyone when it arrived at a destination before anyone could report where it is then it would be lost to everyone left alive. It could just be whereever it landed, in which case it's not very helpful to us, or it might continue to jump around and be possible to notice.
It's also notable that the developers showed us they can hide things in asteroid belts like that salvage ship with no outward indication that anything is there. I find that it would be pretty unfair to players to have hidden anything in there since the beginning without any hints since it took them years to even demostrate that there is ever anything of interest to find in those belts and that ship was only found because they told us where to look, but they're under no obligation to be fair to us.
