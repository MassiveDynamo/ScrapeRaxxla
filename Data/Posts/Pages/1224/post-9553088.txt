I’d like to know why, in his blog, John Harper said (https://panzertard.github.io/elitedangerous-notes/notes/John-Harper): “And there’s Raxxla itself, the mystery, who’s rumours and sightings seem to ebb and flow on a 50 year cycle and we’re approaching that 50-year peak so hearing a lot more sightings and a lot more mystery around Raxxla.” Was this breaking the NDA? Was it an approved hint? Was it more obfuscation???
I do like the idea of raxxla as a wandering moon that jumps from system to system ( possibly the progenitor of the Fleet Carrrier mechanic) and disguises itself among existing moons… working its way on a 50 year cycle… hmmm maybe time to go back over the various “ strange happenings” and look for patterns again.
