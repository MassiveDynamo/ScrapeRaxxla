You use the Toast as a map, but the toast is from The Dark Wheel, and we know from the novels that TDW never found Raxxla. So how can they give us a map if they don't know where it is?
Mmm. I see some difficulties here....
Can we be certain that TDW really dont know where it is & that hasn't been retconned since the novel? Perhaps they found it since that statement? Someone in Holdstock’s original novella had found it IIRC-it was being exploited by a sinister cabal...
And we only have the Codex to say that it is the toast of TDW, might be that cabal’s toast, or someone else’s (the ninja penguin hasn't been seen for a long time, I suspect he found it and has been manipulating the galactic prices for fish!)
