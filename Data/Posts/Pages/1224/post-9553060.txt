You use the Toast as a map, but the toast is from The Dark Wheel, and we know from the novels that TDW never found Raxxla. So how can they give us a map if they don't know where it is?
Good point, given yes in theory they never found it. I think the connection is Judas Syndicate from Wanted. They ended up getting the non-human artifact after it was brought back from the Empire in First Encounters (also discussed in Elite Encounters RPG), and to an extent hinted at via Galnet. This may have given them hint about where to look. I believe I saw mentions of a pirate cache in Tornquist journal entry....

“Cora comes home soused and raving with wild stories, a new one every night. She claims she's found a map to some pirate stash, and all I have to do is loan her my ship so we can go dig it up. Maybe we should go find Raxxla while we're at it” — From the journal of Art Tornqvist, circa 2296

What bears repeating is the Judas Syndicate forms very shortly after Tau Ceti self-sufficient 2159. That is important as this was criminal syndicate of pirates. The gotcha is more of timing and are there multiple of these artifacts. If they got their hands on one leaving Sol or wherever they were originating from they could have known by 2296.
