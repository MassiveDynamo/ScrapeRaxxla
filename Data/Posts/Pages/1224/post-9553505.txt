Also like that our friend the Winking Cat has returned… and stolen a Joker…. Trickster…Hermes…. Mercury? Always assume the wink is for us to see… something
Agreed, I sense a secretive subplot in a lot of these Galnets and the Winking Cat has returned. Oddly, this may be in a way secretly related to Cereberus plague (which by the way wasn't a real plague either). There was shenanigans afoot interfering with the ability to get access to this miraculous ceremonial tea. Bast was system where the cure was discovered. Seriously, look up Heike on Wikipedia.
