Written by:
ANDERSON, KATHLEEN [AGNES CICELY] (21 Jan 1888 – 14 Apr 1972)
(aka Sister Mary Catherine)
1930s – 1940s
Biographer and author of four novels, including (1937), (1939), (1941), and (1946), the last co-written with her sister, novelist Lilian M. ANDERSON. She also wrote four biographies—(1947), (1952), (1954), and (1957).

I like the book because it involves religion and time travel… something of recurring themes in Holdstock. Maybe he knew it. But ya probably not related… i still kinda want to read it though
