Mmm. I see some difficulties here....
Can we be certain that TDW really dont know where it is & that hasn't been retconned since the novel? Perhaps they found it since that statement? Someone in Holdstock’s original novella had found it IIRC-it was being exploited by a sinister cabal...
And we only have the Codex to say that it is the toast of TDW, might be that cabal’s toast, or someone else’s (the ninja penguin hasn't been seen for a long time, I suspect he found it and has been manipulating the galactic prices for fish!)
TDW have not found Raxxla. At least not in 3301. That does not mean that they are clueless.
Jason Ryder knew where to search. He was gathering people for the search party. These TDW members would likely have been told the general direction and aproximate distance, to be able to prepair.
