I like the book because it involves religion and time travel… something of recurring themes in Holdstock. Maybe he knew it. But ya probably not related… i still kinda want to read it though

oh also i think you were more right with the sun wheel description … Id call it a solar cross. Not quite a chi rho as it doesnt make the letters.
Well spotted… those with eyes to see indeed. I’ve edited accordingly.

I feel I may have an aversion to certain iconography.
