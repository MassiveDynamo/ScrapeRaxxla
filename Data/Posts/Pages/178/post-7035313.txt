I, as anybody with a GalMap, can show them the way to Soontill if so. But I wouldn't be surprised by a new inconsistency in E: D...



I don't know if there is a new "personal journey" implemented. I haven't heard about any starting point. Have you ?

I am under the impression that MB implied we would need new game mechanics, to be introduced during the Beyond season, to implement the “personal narrative”, but I could be wrong.
