I have a question. I carried out a mission to destroy ships for the Elite Space Rangers faction, it is in the system 12.13 L from Shinrarta Dezhra. Near the conflict point on the planet appeared a fixed signal - "Vault" when landing it moved. As a result, I found a small base with a sensor for scanning. Q: did they enter the game after the last update?
