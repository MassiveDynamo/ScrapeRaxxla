Raxxla is a mythical planet which only appeared in The Dark Wheel novel of Elite.
The Dark Wheel is a faction in Elite: Dangerous, where it is confirmed by DB there is a planet called Raxxla.
The E/F missions, related to The Dark Wheel faction, are the only known reference to a certain celestial body, The Myth.
The E/F missions stopped or are on standby.
For me: period.


This fits with his evasive answers and the fact that he has only reached the Dangerous rank in combat in all these years, (Inara) while he constantly says he will set up his expedition as soon as he reaches triple E.
And following his Twitch, he doesn't seem to feel like being in a hurry...

Point of Order!!!!
I may be old,with a poor memory, but I don’t think DB ever “confirmed there is a planet called Raxxla”. I think he confirmed Raxxla has been in the game from the beginning, and quite recently he said in a livestream talking to Ed Lewis about Raxxla “ah, but you don’t know what it is”; note the “what” rather than “where” (unless my hearing is going too, which it is given aforesaid age, but it ain’t that bad, yet). So I interpret this as either a freudian slip and it is a planet in-game, or else it is in-game but not a planet; I personally give those two hypotheses weightings of around 20:80. Given FD’s rewriting of previous lore, the fact that Raxxla was a planet in the DW novella need not require it to be a planet in-game. To have been in-game from the beginning suggests that it is either a planet, asteroid, station, star, black hole or ship. Or as we now realise, possibly a comet.
I rather suspect Raxxla is a station (or group of stations) in close orbit around a planet, or comet, hence my repeated question about matching star patterns in the game start screen. Since that start screen image “is just a little bit obvious”.
