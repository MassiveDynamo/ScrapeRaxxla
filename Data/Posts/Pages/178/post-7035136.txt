Soontill was only a secret because the Circle of Independent Elite Pilots kept it as such (there was a large illusionary instillation around the planet that obscured its surface. The "space fog"). Robert Garry's gang of pirates destroyed the CIEP leadership and exposed Soontill to the wider galaxy. (After destroying it surface with the starburst, that is.)

Yes. Destroying it's surface and, along with it, any evidence of having once been a Thargoid installation ... leaving the status of Soontil Relics as questionable. Are they really alien or are they frauds?
