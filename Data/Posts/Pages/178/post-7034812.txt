There was already an inconsistency because in And Here The Wheel, which takes place just prior to the start of the game (and is supposedly canon), the location of Soontill was secret, and only revealed to a very small group via a stolen data crystal that bears a striking resemblance to one of those SAP-8 thingies. But hey, handwavium fixes everything. If the Thargoids can't find it now their intelligence is very, very bad indeed.

Or perhaps the Soontill on the GalMap isn't really Soontill, and someone is being more cunning than we expect. I doubt that though.

Soontill was only a secret because the Circle of Independent Elite Pilots kept it as such (there was a large illusionary instillation around the planet that obscured its surface. The "space fog"). Robert Garry's gang of pirates destroyed the CIEP leadership and exposed Soontill to the wider galaxy. (After destroying it surface with the starburst, that is.)
