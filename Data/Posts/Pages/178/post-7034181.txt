There was already an inconsistency because in And Here The Wheel, which takes place just prior to the start of the game (and is supposedly canon), the location of Soontill was secret, and only revealed to a very small group via a stolen data crystal that bears a striking resemblance to one of those SAP-8 thingies. But hey, handwavium fixes everything. If the Thargoids can't find it now their intelligence is very, very bad indeed.

Or perhaps the Soontill on the GalMap isn't really Soontill, and someone is being more cunning than we expect. I doubt that though.

Most likely Soontill was just a plot device in AHTW and will never do anything else.

The thargoids should know well where it is, after about one million UA have been dropped there to scan the system and the planets.
