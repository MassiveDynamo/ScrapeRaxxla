Like, the Trojan belt.
Yes, except those are individual planetary bodies within a system. Naming for bodies is a mix of real, made-up (from earlier games, community, developers etc.) and procedural. When you said region I thought you meant the biggest regions in the Codex. By Size: Region - Sector - System - individual Celestial or planetary bodies. Then there are other odds and ends superimposed on those like nebulae, dark regions, Messier objects and the like, which are usually real (or at least named after the real ones)
