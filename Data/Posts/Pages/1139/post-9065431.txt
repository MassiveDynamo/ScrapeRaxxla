So, perhaps the link spectrogram is actually Thargoids telling humanity “you infected all these mother ships, you infected Miacke, now clean up your mess”?
It's a long timescale on all this. The mother ships or bases were probably infected during the first Thargoid war, in the 3150s. If Miackce was hit with mycoid, it wasn't until about 3255. This was a result of Mic Turner's actions, in the Pleiades.
Some of the logs of the old Galcop megaships, seem to suggest that the Thargoids were developing cure as early as the late 3100s.

If Col 70 sector fy-n c21-3 is Miackce it would suggest that probes were already present in the Pleiades, in the 3250s.
