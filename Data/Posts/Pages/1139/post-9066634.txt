As far as leads the best leads on "mother of all galaxies" (these are all in the game):
One could make a (largely fictional) argument for Sag A* perhaps also, which would simplify coordinate calculations a bit...


Or Cassiopeia as the mother of Andromeda (although that brings us back to the Vain Queen again, sigh). Also, I don't think any of the main stars in that constellation are depicted as being on her brow, and the brightest star is near her heart. And Andromeda is only one galaxy.

Some interesting Cassiopeia facts though. In some interpretations the constellation is depicted as her crown itself. That would make the jewel on the brow the top middle star of the W, which is Gamma Cassiopeia.

Cassiopeia also circles Polaris roughly every 24 hours... (As do all the constellations formed by circumpolar stars seen from the North Pole)
