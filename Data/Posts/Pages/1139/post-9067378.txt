Well now that is interesting.

27 Gamma Cassiopeia is a trinary (binary? Does a black hole count as a star?) system - Type B primary and a neutron star orbiting a black hole... jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies and spiraling stars? Just coincidence?

Edit: BTW - good luck using parallax to look for a planet or a station around a black hole. That said, easy enough to make the stars spiral, and at around 1,000ls out there are two very bright stars that I can make spiral around each other within the space of the black hole itself, which is likely irrelevant but cool for muh immersion. Screenshot below, will try to get a video snippet tomorrow perhaps. Any of the sky box gurus out there able to identify these two stars (in the black hole). I'm calling them Astrophel and Stella for now. Stella is on the right.




Edit 2: Body exclusion zone hit at 47.2 km, heat 52% (over 90 if you try to supercruise from there, I got lazy and used a heat sink to engage while adjacent, and supercruised around the exclusion zone/event horizon and have some neat video hopefully). Those two stars maintain position once you are near the black hole "sphere" proper, but two other smaller stars (only) of all the stars in the sphere, can be made to parallax if you boost, and they spiral around the black hole. More coincidence? Can't supercruise into it, can't frameshift into it, can't boost into it or fly slowly through the gate a la The Expanse.

Edit 3 Good luck using parallax around a neutron star also - same effect (to a lesser extent) as a black hole.

Edit 4: Meant to mention, before I signed off last night even supercharged the FSD at the neutron star and then tried to frameshift into the Black Hole. Nada.
