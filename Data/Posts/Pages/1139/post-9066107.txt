Wow - that's some major tinfoil. Reminds me I need to try to read back through the thread sometime (shudder).

One minor correction - Acadia (L'Acadie in French today) originally was named by Samuel de Champlain as La Cadie. There is some historical disagreement over whether Champlain was referring to Arcadia (which some other early European explorers called the entire mid to north Atlantic coast), or a local Mi'kmaq word "Cadie" meaning a pleasant place, and which is a common suffix in many indigenous place names in Nova Scotia.

Living in Nova Scotia, I was wondering how long it would be until Oak Island came up, and dreading the moment.

I think the Frontier office here was also responsible for some of the networking code for Elite Dangerous - another mystery.
