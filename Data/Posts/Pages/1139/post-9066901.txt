According to my calculations, col 70 sector fy-n c21-3 is Miackce. Right distance and right relative position to the Pleiades.
INRA probably located it the same way we did, listening to probes. That lead to it being a Mycoid target. In ED, the bombing probably happened.
Wreaken was in a system near the edge of COL 70, If I remember correctly.
The other interesting thing (well one of them, anyway) about Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3 is that it is pretty much right on the boundary of the Braintree area marking the main Guardian bubble. Canâ€™t tell for sure due to the permit locks, but it should be very close to being exactly on the boundary.

How that potentially links to it being Miacke would be interesting to explore / speculate on.
