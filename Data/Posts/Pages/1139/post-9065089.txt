So I know I was and sound mad... but did I tie myself down and force myself to listen to the sirens music? Hence her revealing herself despite the universe calling me crazy?

THIS IS WHY I SOUND CRAZY:
"'When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you coherent directions as to which of two courses you are to take; I will lay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them for yourself." ( there is 3 but the third is to remain blind)

ALSO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING IS ATTRIBUTED TO THIS:
"Odysseus is a self-assured guy who lives by his wiles as well as his courage. He's an intellectual; and although he is self-disciplined, his curiosity sometimes gets him into trouble. Odysseus is also willing to pay a price for knowledge. It is this intellectual curiosity that drives him to hear the Sirens' song despite the pain he must endure while being tied up to the mast of his ship. If it weren't for those excruciating straps, he would have been lured to his death.

So what was so enticing about the Sirens' song? They promised gifts of wisdom and knowledge of the future. Who could resist that?" - cliff notes
