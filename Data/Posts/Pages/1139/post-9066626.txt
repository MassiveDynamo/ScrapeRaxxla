Maybe I already asked, but remind me please, the names of regions and their number are astronomical names or made up by the developers?
The sector system and the regions are creations of the developers (and community in the case of some of the regions). Most sectors are procedurally generated i.e. Bleai Hypeia Sector or the like. There are some named after actual galactic phenomena/locations in both cases.
