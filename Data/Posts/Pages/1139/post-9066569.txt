My opinion.
To count the coordinates of a galaxy in a grid rather than in polar coordinates centered at the galactic nucleus is even worse than Ptolemy times.
Only the polar system can more or less accurately describe the galaxy, otherwise the galaxy would be a cube.
Maybe I already asked, but remind me please, the names of regions and their number are astronomical names or made up by the developers?
