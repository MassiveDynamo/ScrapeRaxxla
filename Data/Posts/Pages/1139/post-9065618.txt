But is it REALLY a Biscuit ?



I vaugely rember this - Some sort of Etruscan Mirror Box ?
Yep, it’s a biscuit!!!
Note, a British biscuit! not an American biscuit, which is a scone. How you eat those with gravy I will never understand! Especially at breakfast. I mean, after a night’s drinking, when the judgement is a little impaired, maybe.

P.S. Jaffa Cakes are cakes!!!
