Rogue Planet is one of the star descriptions that appears in the player journal API. It's not selectable as a filter on the galaxy map, obviously, but I assume it would be classed as non-sequence. Rogue Planet is a star class, not a planet, so I assume it should appear in the left hand description pane in the galaxy map, but this would require a brute force search method. Similarly, if it's not listed in the galaxy map, then finding it by scanning objects in system will also take ages.

I'm currently "collecting" all the different star classes, and haven't found a rogue planet yet. Maybe there aren't any, and it's a red herring as far as Raxxla goes.
