Another thing worth of note is that, for a few centuries, Raxxla was orbiting the moon of Lave 2 which, incidentally, appears to be permit-locked right now.
It's a fact that the Pilots Federation entirely controls the permit system, and even have its own internal closed circles : The Circle of Independant Elite Pilots, and The Dark Wheel. (cf. And Here the Wheel, and who Robert Garry/his family really are).

Last thing of note, Raxxla itself is considered to be a rogue planet, with the unique ability to move at will anywhere in space, most likely lest some heavy transit times that would certainly not allow it to move, let's say to the other side of the galaxy, hahah !

Careful of this. It reminds me strongly of a tale told in a series of non-canon Elite-esque fan-fiction tales called the Oolite Saga by some bloke called Drew Wagar.

Seriously though. Those stories aren't canon in ED or the original Elite. Those ideas might have been used in ED, but I doubt it. I think it's unlikely that Lave has anything to do with Raxxla.

Cheers,

Drew.
