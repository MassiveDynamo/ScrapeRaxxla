Those missions were lost with the switch to "missions 2.0".

If they are important, any chance you could prod the powers to porting them to the new missions system, and restoring them?

This would be nice, been searching mission boards and only reference to raxxla I have seen is a passenger mission to CoR staging post - which is apparently just a tourist beacon. The passenger name is random as far as I can tell so no leads there either.
