This would be nice, been searching mission boards and only reference to raxxla I have seen is a passenger mission to CoR staging post - which is apparently just a tourist beacon. The passenger name is random as far as I can tell so no leads there either.

Careful... As far as i know that's just a passenger mission. it has NOTHING to do with the Raxxla mystery.
