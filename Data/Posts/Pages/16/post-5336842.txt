Wonder if the event on April 29th will shed any light on the subject
Not at all, no.

I extremely doubt it. I think the "Children of Raxxla" are unfortunately named, because they seem to be more interested in Salom√© and the Formidine Rift mystery/Drew's stories, than Raxxla. The two, AFAIK, are not related.
Well, we do care about Raxxla and everything that rotates around it. But let's be frank, and looking back at what Brookes/Braben said about it (and putting the fact that Elite's dev plan is spread across 10 years), there's not much more advancements that can be done about this particular mystery :

- The initial Dark Wheel missions don't exist anymore (If devs come across this place, pretty please guys ... bring'em back)
- We won't have any clues (outside of winks towards hints of hints of a wink, the further the game grows)
- This is probably the most important, and deepest mystery in the game right now. Given their dev plan, don't expect stuff to unwrap tomorrow.

Right now the CoR are just focusing on matters and things we can immediately address/help/solve, which is the formidine rift mystery, and everything around that. If one day it happens that this mystery is solved, we will move forward onto other secret things
