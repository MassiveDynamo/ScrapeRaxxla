Drew, as you are around... Do you know if "Darkness Falls" is lore? I don't think so, but who knows...

It's the closest description I have ever heard about Raxxla until now! It contains the gate orbiting the planet at one side and a generator on the other side, plus they didn't have to travel much to get there. The Elite rogue pilots have a small base in the ELW (Raxxla).

Alas not, no. Anything prior to Frontier Elite 2 has definitely been retconned and you can't use it as lore unless it's specifically cited in GalNet. Quite a lot of stuff from FE2 and FFE has been incorporated, but not all, and crucially, not all the important stuff.

However some of the older material may act as inspiration for ED.

Cheers,

Drew.
