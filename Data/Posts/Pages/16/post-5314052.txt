It could even be a hollowed out asteroid with a hyperspace engine of some sort, similar to Jacques.

It could be an already discovered world/moon... and the inhabitants now long gone, or dead.

It could be some sort of intergalactic jump gate (The original Elite had a concept of Galactic Hyperspace) in orbit somewhere near Lave 2, but like Voyager in Sol, unless you know where to look...

If it is still a living world, and if it has it's own system, then it's one that's not been searched. If it's in the bubble, as some have suggested, it's going to be one of a few that are not being exploited by superpowers... or is it?
