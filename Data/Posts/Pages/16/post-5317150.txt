There are vague references in missions issued by the Dark Wheel Faction in Shinrarta Dezhra, these may be important, they may not.

Those missions were lost with the switch to "missions 2.0".

If they are important, any chance you could prod the powers to porting them to the new missions system, and restoring them?
