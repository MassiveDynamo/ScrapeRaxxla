Drew, as you are around... Do you know if "Darkness Falls" is lore? I don't think so, but who knows...

It's the closest description I have ever heard about Raxxla until now! It contains the gate orbiting the planet at one side and a generator on the other side, plus they didn't have to travel much to get there. The Elite rogue pilots have a small base in the ELW (Raxxla).
