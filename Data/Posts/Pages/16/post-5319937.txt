I'm wondering if it could be possible that Raxxla is connected to the Guardians? The guardians were very advanced and were capable of creating "gateways to other worlds". The worlds were virtual, which is a twist that hasn't been considered as far as I know. What if Raxxla isn't actually a physical place, but a virtual realm where the archives of the Guardians advanced knowledge could be found?

I have been reading this thread by CMDR Dreamstate, which has got me thinking about the guardians and trying to learn more -

Well worth a read for any interested, is the most comprehensive reference I have been able to find on the guardians with all the facts and great speculation.
