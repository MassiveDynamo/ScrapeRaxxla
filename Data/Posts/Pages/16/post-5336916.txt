Not at all, no.


Well, we do care about Raxxla and everything that rotates around it. But let's be frank, and looking back at what Brookes/Braben said about it (and putting the fact that Elite's dev plan is spread across 10 years), there's not much more advancements that can be done about this particular mystery :

- The initial Dark Wheel missions don't exist anymore (If devs come across this place, pretty please guys ... bring'em back)
- We won't have any clues (outside of winks towards hints of hints of a wink, the further the game grows)
- This is probably the most important, and deepest mystery in the game right now. Given their dev plan, don't expect stuff to unwrap tomorrow.

Right now the CoR are just focusing on matters and things we can immediately address/help/solve, which is the formidine rift mystery, and everything around that. If one day it happens that this mystery is solved, we will move forward onto other secret things
This is fair enough. Yet I'm sure you can understand why people think a "Children of Raxxla" video would be about Raxxla. Aren't there other player groups that are disciples of Salom√© that have less misleading names? I understand the CoR have invested a lot in Drew's stories and the associated in-game narrative and I hope you continue to do so, you deserve lots of credit for pursuing and keeping the storyline alive in the minds of other players.
