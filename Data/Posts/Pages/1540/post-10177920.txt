As far as I can see Jaques' journey from Facece to reported HIP 110620 doesn't cross the line from Demeter to Persephone, but does cross through the Underworld bubble as you showed. The trouble is that there's a gap of up to a year (we dont know when he left Facece)...if he was looking for Raxxla, as seems likely, then it's not much of a clue, just another indicator of the general area. But I do like the fact that this Underworld region is only just off the route Sol-Achenar, which fits witht he first rumour date only 4 years after Achenar was settled.
