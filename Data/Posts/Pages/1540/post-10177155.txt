Judging by the responses to my post, again the translation has distorted everything.
I wrote that in fact Raxxla is a state of something, and it can occur in different parts of the galaxy.
That is, the Raxxla can be in one part of the galaxy or the other. Yes, it's a specific place, but it's not one and there are many of them.
If this is in relation to your post: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/post-10176296

“my translator translated that phrase as if Raxxla was a nickname and there were many of them”

Please help us by providing more information, eg what is the translator you’re using and which language.

It’s known that some in game text doesn’t translate well in some languages, as English is the primary base language of the game, so it’s unlikely they took this into consideration. The Codex is also heavy with metaphors, which undoubtedly won’t translate well.

Never the less, we would like to understand and replicate, why you feel there are more than one?
