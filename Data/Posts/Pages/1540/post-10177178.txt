“my translator translated that phrase as if Raxxla was a nickname and there were many of them”

Please help us by providing more information, eg what is the translator you’re using and which language.

It’s known that some in game text doesn’t translate well in some languages, as English is the primary base language of the game, so it’s unlikely they took this into consideration. The Codex is also heavy with metaphors, which undoubtedly won’t translate well.

Never the less, we would like to understand and replicate, why you feel there are more than one?
Yes, I understand you, my native language is Russian.
In the message you wrote about early Raxxla, so there is a late Raxxla.
Earlier I thought that Raxxla is something that moves in space, as in searches all the time there are different systems. Different rifts. Eldorado and other names described different places but they were essentially the same.
