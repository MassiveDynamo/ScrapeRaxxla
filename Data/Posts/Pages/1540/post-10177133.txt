Iv just been doing a good long search in the Delphinus constellation the last while, a good lot of unnmapped/unexplored systems here and since we have the Oracle at Dephi reference mixed with the top of the constellation being a Diamond, The planet Arion in 18 Delphini being named after a greek genius in music (siren?) and a poet (the entire reference is like poetry) and sailed a good bit being kidnapped by pirates (Again a siren, pirate stash, treasure) thought why not take a look

The Oracle at Delphi The second century AD Greek writer Plutarch, talking of ‘The E at Delphi,’ writes: ‘The Inscription “Know thyself” written above the entrance to the temple of Apollo at Delphi is not so much an injunction as a question. It demands a knowledge to the question “Who art thou?” Or how could you answer it? And which self? Do you know the bodily and and mortal or the incorporeal and immortal self?. In the Alcibiades, Socrates says that he who orders “know thyself”
Judging by the responses to my post, again the translation has distorted everything.
I wrote that in fact Raxxla is a state of something, and it can occur in different parts of the galaxy.
That is, the Raxxla can be in one part of the galaxy or the other. Yes, it's a specific place, but it's not one and there are many of them.
