Yup that’s exactly true, it’s reliant upon the two points being accurate, so yes it is a total shot in the dark (well, actually an informed assessment) and I totally accept it’s highly likely an irrelevant waste of time, as they might not be accurate, and this theory likewise is twaddle too.

But it is just simple math, not difficult to apply, and is something to do in game.

Currently in a doldrum so this is going to engage me for ages, my ‘John Milton Universe’ idea was similarly based on practical math yet proven hogwash, but it was fun figuring it out and allowed me to draw a line under that hypothesis, likely the same applies here.

It gives me something to do other than tooling around shooting stuff.


It’s just a hypothesis that the hexagon of the logo implies a hexagonal grouping of systems with Raxxla at the centre...might be correct, might not. But I do think that the region you've identified from Codex interpretation has meaning. The systems are much too close together to be random.

I still suspect the logo is actually a map of how to find Raxxla within its system, or perhaps identifies that system.

I’m sure it will all make sense when (if ever) we find it!
