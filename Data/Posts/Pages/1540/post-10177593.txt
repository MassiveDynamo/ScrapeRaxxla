Ok maths and geometry question.

If you knew two points made up a hexagon, but you didn’t know the location of the other points, within a 3D environment. I assume - and please confirm my math, you don’t need any other points to identify the centre.

If you have two points, the hexagon center is just a straight line parallel to that formed by the two points.

In a 3D environment you then simply need to rotate this centre (effectively forming a sphere) Not knowing the alignment of said hexagon the centre ‘should’ be able to be found, as the point would align somewhere on the outer rim of that sphere?

So ‘if’ we could be certain of at least 2 points in space, and ‘if’ the Raxxla hexagon could be presumed to be represented in space by 6 points, with the centre presumably Raxxla, we could find said centre through only 2 points?

Question is, which two points, and is the hexagon a space map?

So here is one potential concept!

Deepest Void = Tartarus; Lovers Woe / Parents Grief = Persephone.

Draw a line between them, work out its centre, expand a circle so they sit on its circumference. The centre of the Hexagon is someplace on this sphere?

If these two points are representative, and the hexagon is a spacial map, I presume Raxxla is someplace… here?



But this is reliant on these two systems being relevant, and the hexagon being a spacial map. If not it’s just conjecture.
On the one hand I always thought that finding a point in 3D need 3 points, not 6.
On the other hand the triangulation method for calculating thargoid bases was for some reason based on 2, as if the work was not done with a 3D map but with a 2D one.

But I like your position that the 6 dark squares on the logo are mythic code riddles. It doesn't matter if it's the axis or something else.
I wonder if the Codex is written in riddles, will there really be 6?
