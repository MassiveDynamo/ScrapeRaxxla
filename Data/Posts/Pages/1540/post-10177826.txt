Mmm, hexagon, six points... suggestive of the toast. Looking at your “Underworld region” (systems within ~36ly of Asphodel/Axis Mundi)... my mythology is almost non-existent but googling/wikipedia suggests:
Jewel on brow of mother of galaxies->Sol or Hathor? But these are too far from your Underworld region (edit in greek myth the mother would be Hera, but the jewel??) (edit2 Nut (aka Nwt, Nunut, Nent, Nuit) was “the lady/goddess of the stars” but in-game star Nu was a male god...
Whisperer in witchspace -> from Paradise Lost should be Lucifer but cant see a likely system
Siren of the deepest void->Tartarus is the deepest void or Asphodel, but who’s the siren? Erlik or Giltine or Mictlan? Edit 3 Perhaps El Tio?
Parent’s grief -> Demeter
Lover’s woe-> Persephone? Would more likely be Hades/Pluto?
Yearning of vagabond hearts-> Summerland, Cockaigne, Shambhala, Avalon, Tir Na Nog
Some of these are a bit dubious mythologically, but if a regular hexagon shouldn't be necessary. Suggest you check out the coordinates of good matches then see which are likely to form a planar hexagon. You only need four to get a good centre point (actually two, but you need to have diametrically opposites).
