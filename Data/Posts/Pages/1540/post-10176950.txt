@Rochester I had a thought...the logo might represent the rear of an asteroid station, with the dotted line representing the unseen front. The nearest one to your Underworld bubble, and doing a quick couple of triangulations looks like it was in Jaques path out of that underworld area, is the one in Otegine....right in the PF district & noob’s permit required! Anyone with a new account want to check it out? Perhaps that’s where the “omphalos rift” alien device is hidden...of the asteroid stations that Inara listed close to Sol Otegine was the only one that seemed to be a subanagram of “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars”.

My other thought is that the hexagon could represent the outline of a guardian glyph, and so the three arcs might represent the energy pylons of a guardian beacon. Not convinced but it’s a thought.
