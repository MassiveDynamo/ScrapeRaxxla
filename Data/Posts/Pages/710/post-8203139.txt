On the system map there's a "mock up" of the asteroid belt, but you cant't select/target it... according to in-game description it is depleted.
The Asteroid belt in Sol covers a region in space, between Mars and Jupiter. It's location can be seen in the orrery view.
I've never seen any belt clusters in it.
