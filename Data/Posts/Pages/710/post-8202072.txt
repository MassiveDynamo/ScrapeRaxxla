Well I learnt something new today! Don't go to lunch IRL or a in-game Job Offer you've accepted (and attempted) will 'Fail'. Damnit.

On a positive note, I did identify that the Job Offer was originally from 'Future of Arro Naga' who I was allied with, and subsequently have dropped to Friendly.

They also appear to be an ally of TDW as they are on the target list of TDW's Operation Less Than Three's allies that offer the Founders/Elite missions I've been investigating extensively.

I'll keep an eye out for other opportunities, and missions - my ship is now equipped to handle more punishment.

Fly Dangerously.
