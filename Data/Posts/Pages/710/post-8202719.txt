And how will we know where, in such a large system, to look? Perhaps a SC of your system map would have the little 'you are here' arrow? That would make this a lot easier.....
So..... Screen shot of the system map. There a lot of places in Sol that arent showing an asteroid belt. Literally everywhere that isnt an asteroid belt or astronomical body. Almost .25ly radius, feel me?
