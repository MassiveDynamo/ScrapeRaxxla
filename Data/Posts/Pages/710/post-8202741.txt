Sounds like a tough version of one the standard missions, so might be the TRDW test. The phrasing of the message is reminiscent of the old UA military convoy missions, they didnâ€™t know what they were carrying either (though some of them seemed to be carrying either goids or ravening soldier clones who went amok). You probably need to re-ally with the mission giver to stand a chance of getting it again. Might be worth trying this in a wing?

Yeah the same thought occurred to me, so I've already ranked back up with this faction to Allied.

I also noted that as per OLT3, the TDW in SD are providing me Founder/Elite missions with those factions whom I'm not allied with, nor done previous missions for. So I'll keep plugging away at that as an alternate line of investigation (which I can do with limited time) to those of you jaunting about the galaxy snooping in dark corners.
