This is what I've been trying to say... you have to know where to look for it, fly there in SC and drop on the spot. It won't show up on your scanners (left tab) nor on system map... just like that stations orbiting a commet which is like a POI.

I found it by looking between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. To me this is a hint of how the mechanics to get to Raxxla works. Next step is to find the Kuiper belt... the area to look for it is way bigger.

In your hud, you have the asteroid belt targeted. Can you rotate to show the target in front of you?

And what do you see when you drop out of SC? Just asteroids?
