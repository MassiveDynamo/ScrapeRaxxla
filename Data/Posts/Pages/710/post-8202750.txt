So..... Screen shot of the system map. There a lot of places in Sol that arent showing an asteroid belt. Literally everywhere that isnt an asteroid belt or astronomical body. Almost .25ly radius, feel me?

This is what I've been trying to say... you have to know where to look for it, fly there in SC and drop on the spot. It won't show up on your scanners (left tab) nor on system map... just like that stations orbiting a commet which is like a POI.

I found it by looking between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. To me this is a hint of how the mechanics to get to Raxxla works. Next step is to find the Kuiper belt... the area to look for it is way bigger.
