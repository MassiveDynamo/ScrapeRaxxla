Mysterious Stranger / Tip Off missions are covered in another thread with dev responses and an offer to answer how they are generated. To me that implies its pure game mechanics and nothing to do with Raxxla or the DW. They got so close to the answer the dev has offered to fill in the gaps.

Thank Randomonius you spoilered it we take our own risks when we open a spoiler. Never heard arro as short for arrogant, heard aggro as short for aggressive, dunno if that helps.

Journey - When I started I just took a mission and wherever I ended up I took another one and so on, I didn't try and level up with each faction unless for a permit or reasons. I travelled all over doing different missions. I think this is all DB means, that they expected players to do this but instead most stayed in 1 or 2 (or a few local) systems ranking up or whatever. They didn't explore and travel as much as fdev expected. They expected less attention span basically So that journey may be just that and may be completey separate to MB journey.

I've never heard it that way either. But apparently google has heard it enough times for me to have multiples of it as a result.
