On the system map there's a "mock up" of the asteroid belt, but you cant't select/target it... according to in-game description it is depleted.

Yes I understand. However I managed to do it and it points the target at the Sun which is probably a glitch. It would be good to verify that you are not encountering the same, because I can in essence duplicate your photo by looking away from the target and it would look as if I am in an asteroid belt.
So you eyeballed the region of space between jupiter and mars and dropped out of supercruise?

Edit: will post pics later.

Edit 2: Mines a glitch to be sure but your pic shows you dropping out in the belt itself? Are there any asteroids around? It would help if you could target the Sun and give us the distance so we can see for ourselves.
