Journey - When I started I just took a mission and wherever I ended up I took another one and so on, I didn't try and level up with each faction unless for a permit or reasons. I travelled all over doing different missions. I think this is all DB means, that they expected players to do this but instead most stayed in 1 or 2 (or a few local) systems ranking up or whatever. They didn't explore and travel as much as fdev expected. They expected less attention span basically So that journey may be just that and may be completey separate to MB journey.
This describes my first 4 months of playing. I never really got any missions that took me more than 20 ly away and never out of the bubble
