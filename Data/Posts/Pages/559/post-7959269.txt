I get your point, but if we can't trust the sparse information we do have, then we better start bute forcing 400 billion systems and hope FD did really put it in the game!
Yeah, right. Most important is to have fun playing the game. I just trade FD 'information' for FD 'intoxication' too easily, perhaps.
Anyway, as the psycho-Penguin said... nobody is meant to find that station unless invited. Besides it avoids detection as FD tells us.
