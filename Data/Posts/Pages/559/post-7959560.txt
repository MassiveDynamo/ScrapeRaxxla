Mmmmh... TDW station in a system with a red giant just like the Zurara on the RR line in a system with an ELW. Yeah, of course, gonna start searching right now.
That screenshot statement doesn't totally convince me. Sorry but it's just that I no longer trust anything coming from FD in matter of consistency and sensibility...

Totally with you there. My cynicism tells me that the Codex image is just a pretty picture, but once in a blue moon Fdev prove me wrong. This might be one of those times.

By the way, I always took the RR line as a direction to the Rift, not an exact bearing to the 'mystery site'. Would have been a remarkable coincidence otherwise, no?
