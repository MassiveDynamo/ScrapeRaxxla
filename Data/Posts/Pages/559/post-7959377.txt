So Nun/Nu might be in-game, have you tried searching for it? Though being a male god couldn’t fit the “mother of galaxies” (possible) clue.

I did look up female astronomers the other week as a possible solution for “mother of galaxies”. Seem to remember Vera Ruben (alexzk) mentioned her the other day) cropped up as an associate of Edwin Hubble, who might justifiably be called the “father of galaxies”. But couldn’t see how Vera Ruben (or the others) might fit in-game. Might be worth someone else trying, sometimes my searches don’t seem to work. Of late I can’t even get EDSM to tell me of black holes within a radius from a reference system, even though it was successfully doing this last week. Perhaps the Club have hacked my web browser, or maybe I’ve been hexedited;
what are we looking for?
There is a Vera Rubin Complex in the Colonia region (Garuda A 1 b).

A couple of notes, sometimes mentioned before, as words of caution:
TDW toast is 'alleged'
Lyta Crane might be an 'unreliable narrator'. If you were in TDW or knew of their HQ's whereabouts, would you tell people or give hints to where to find them? Would you even want them to go looking, given that the group membership is 'invitation only'? If you were in The Club, I think the answer to both those is 'yes', since they'd want them (or their HQ) neutralised.
