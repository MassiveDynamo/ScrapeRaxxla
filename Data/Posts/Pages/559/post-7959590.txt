Oh.. I was convinced that Rebecca pointed us to the ~exact mYsTeRy, inside the RR tube. But as you probably know I also was convinced that it was about ghosts, dragons and Raxxla... It turned out in a different way and proved you right. No wonder nobody found the stranded ship until DW held our hand. So...FD-esque. Then, actually, I wont bet on any particular interpretation of the "clues" we currently have.
