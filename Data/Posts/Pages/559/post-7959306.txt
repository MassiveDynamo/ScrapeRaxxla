That’s right (sorry, couldn’t remember your name properly, just looked up your previous post & corrected my text). I think she was also involved in developing the galaxy classification system attributed to Hubble, hence the “mother of galaxies”, but can you find a “Ruben” in-game?

Edit: finally found the notes I made. I have as possibilities for " the mother of galaxies" Cassiopeia. Black Hole, gravity, big bang, dark matter, & female astronomers: Nancy Grace Roman, Jocelyn Bell Burnell, Vera Rubin, Margaret J Geller, Sandra Faber, (Hanny van Arkel?), Martha Liller
