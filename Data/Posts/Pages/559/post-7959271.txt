It's also worth noting that FD can modify proc. gen systems, after their generation. They can both insert assets and modify Stellar Forge objects.
An example of this is Hypuae Aim ZP-R b48-0 that has a gas giant, named Travis Green. This one has been in the game since launch. Probably named by a backer.

It's also worth noting that even though I have fully explored Hypuae Aim ZP-R b48-0, Travis Green is not searchable in the galaxy map.

Interesting that something exists in-game that is not searchable in the galmap. I suspect this is a bug, possibly they renamed the gas giant for the backer but didn’t change its original name in the Stellar Forge database, so “Travis Green” is only in the system map/description. Worth reporting as a bug though, just to see their reaction?

Edit: have you tried searching for it using the normal naming convention? Never tried doing that for a gas giant, not sure if it works...
