I like give an additional information of the word brow could also mean. The summit of a hill pass.

I ran into to this post on a website earlier which I found it interesting

Yes “brow of a hill” is the “crown”/top of the hill, just before the slope down the other side.

It seems that Hell is named after the Norse goddess Hel, did look it up but cant remember what she was goddess of. Given the biblical connotations nothing pleasant.
