Yes “brow of a hill” is the “crown”/top of the hill, just before the slope down the other side.

It seems that Hell is named after the Norse goddess Hel, did look it up but cant remember what she was goddess of. Given the biblical connotations nothing pleasant.
I seriously doubt any religious connotations, for reasons of "excluding" or "alienating" sections of the player base

EDIT: Unless it relates to Randimious Factoria of course!
