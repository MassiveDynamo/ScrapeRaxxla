So Nun/Nu might be in-game, have you tried searching for it? Though being a male god couldn’t fit the “mother of galaxies” (possible) clue.

I did look up female astronomers the other week as a possible solution for “mother of galaxies”. Seem to remember Vera Ruben (Alec mentioned her the other day) cropped up as an associate of Edwin Hubble, who might justifiably be called the “father of galaxies”. But couldn’t see how Vera Ruben (or the others) might fit in-game. Might be worth someone else trying, sometimes my searches don’t seem to work. Of late I can’t even get EDSM to tell me of black holes within a radius from a reference system, even though it was successfully doing this last week. Perhaps the Club have hacked my web browser, or maybe I’ve been hexedited;
what are we looking for?
I quoted yday - Forbes called her "mother of dark mater universe".
