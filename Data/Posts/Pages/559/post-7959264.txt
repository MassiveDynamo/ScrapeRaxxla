I’ve been entertaining the thought that TDW station could be a hollowed out asteroid station floating in a sea of other asteroids in the ring of a planet. A star is technically a gas giant, just with a lot of fusion reactions going on, so it could be the 8th body orbiting a star..

I agree with Pete. While TDW (& by implication the Codex) might lie to us, as part of obfuscation, I think this interpretation is too far off the codex text to be likely. The codex says explicitly that it’s a dark (low-powered & stealthy) wheeled station (Orbis, but probably of an old type that is smaller and visually somewhat different from the current ones) that orbits an 8th moon. I think it’s worth checking around all 8th moons (including any submoons, just in case), as well as any submoon(s) of that 8th moon.
