Mmmmh... TDW station in a system with a red giant just like the Zurara on the RR line in a system with an ELW. Yeah, of course, gonna start searching right now.
That screenshot statement doesn't totally convince me. Sorry but it's just that I no longer trust anything coming from FD in matter of consistency and sensibility...
