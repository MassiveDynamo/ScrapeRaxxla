I like give an additional information of the word brow could also mean. The summit of a hill pass.

I ran into to this post on a website earlier which I found it interesting

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld
In the study of mythology and religion, the underworld is a generic term approximately equivalent to the lay term afterlife, referring to any place to which newly dead souls go. In most cultures the term refers to a neutral or dystopic realm of the afterlife, instead of a heavenly or paradisiac one. Sometimes the underworld is identified as "Hell" because Hell is thought to be under the Earth.
