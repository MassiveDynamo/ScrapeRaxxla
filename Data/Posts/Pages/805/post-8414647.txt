Yes, its PSR. The systems all have Pulsars (neutron stars and white dwarfs) as their primary stars. I found one just outside the bubble, in the general direction of Sag A. Not sure why it takes you below the galaxy map first though.
Well ... there are 3-4 clusters below & above galaxy. I saw video on your tube, took name from that and then maps reveals those clusters for a second and gone. I think it was PSR there ...don't recall for sure.
That guy was there, made a video. I think teleported by FDevs.
That channel had many fancy stories between 2 commanders with texts on screen appearing. Like 3-4 years old.
In general "PSR" are common in galaxy, hundreds of them around. So you will have to click search for long until it jumps to fdev area for a second, then all gone - you see nothing again.
