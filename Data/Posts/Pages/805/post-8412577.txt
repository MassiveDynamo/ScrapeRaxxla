Hm...just figured fun fact about our Sun. It is GREEN star ... maximum energy of it is green. That's why grass is green - to reflect maximum and don't burn.
But our eyes has lowest sensitivity for that part it seems (for same reason - to not overrun by most powerful part of spectrum), or colors mixing occurs or both ...and we see it as yellow.
Hmm ...maybe that's why it is G class? From english Green? makes sence...
