I've thoroughly investigated that book twice. I enjoyed it a lot but I'm pretty sure that beacon is the only thing to do with. Technically it's more loosely connected to the dark wheel but still not connected to them at all in game as far as I know. at least so far as I can tell there's no actual CIEP minor faction in game. Great book though, i highly recommend it. I talked with John Harper before. Sadly he wont be doing anymore elite novels but he has a few unrelated available.

There are other interesting places in the book that i wouldn't be surprised to find in game or at least mentioned in a visitors beacon. Let me know if you ever find a place called Smuggler's Junction. Should be hidden in an asteroid belt or maybe a ring. No system given.
