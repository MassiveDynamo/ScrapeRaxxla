Okey, fighter on board is definitively useful. Just left ship 8km above bio signal and landed for scans using fighter on 3.5G
Damn, even fighter can't avoid ground hits there
Haha ... if you ordered co-pilot follow on main ship, never ever drive fighter through mountains - she just hit my ship damn ...i dunno, maybe should fly above, order stay, then do fancy things.
