If I recall right you need to do searcg on galaxy map something like PSR ... there are couple systems above/below galaxy 10000ly away will pop for a second.
Yes, its PSR. The systems all have Pulsars (neutron stars and white dwarfs) as their primary stars. I found one just outside the bubble, in the general direction of Sag A. Not sure why it takes you below the galaxy map first though.
