Im not, Ive spent all my money on Prismatics and still need another 70m to get the last size 8 then I can start saving for Packhounds and then FCs hoorah. If I hit Elite trade Ill restart mining again which will help, dont want to achieve it just through mining.

Anybody got any systems lined up to go to with the 500LY range? Theres one at the bottom Ive got my eye on but its still out of reach.
