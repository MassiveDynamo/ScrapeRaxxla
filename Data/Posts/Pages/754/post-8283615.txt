What were the specifics that Drew said?
Can't remember exact words... but it was when he started talking about the Salom√® event... that she would come from inside the locked Col 70 sector (storywise not actual gameplay mechanics) and people started asking "howcome she would be able to enter the locked region" and the reply was something like "we should always pay close attention to our ship's left panel" insinuating that might be an "entry door"... so, yeah... it was pretty vague... and I'm not sure if he meant the left screen or the left box on main screen showing our current location.
