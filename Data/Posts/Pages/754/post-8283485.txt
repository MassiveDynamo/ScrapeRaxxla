The reason I was commited to go to the Cone nebula was because Drew Wagar kind of insinuated that we could enter the locked regions jumping from an specific star/system/position...

So I was hoping I could access the Col 70 Sector by jumping from the Cone sector.

Anyways, this is way in the past now and yes, looking forward to the Fleet Carriers to arrive!
What were the specifics that Drew said?
