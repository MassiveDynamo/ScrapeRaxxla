The reason this is hard to test is that the only places that don't take days to travel too have so little fuel use in a jump it's impossible to tell the difference visually. Hence it's incredibly hard or annoying to test.
I have verified it and I was wrong , the jump increase corresponds directly to the supercruiser fuel consumption, not by a distance reduction.
