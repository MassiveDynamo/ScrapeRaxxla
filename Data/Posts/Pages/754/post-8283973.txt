Does anybody here have ALL engineers unlocked? If quest gen can track it ... maybe that's how DW will contact u - when all engee unlocked, as they imply many other things to do. Btw, if I got it right ..old DW quests were gone about same time when engee implemented.

I don't yet - it's on my to-do list!

After doing all my research on rank, reputation, and chained missions I've now allocated completing all mission types for TDW in Jameson's which I haven't done to-date, even those pesky mining ones. Oh, and finishing my Elite for Combat (sometime).

Background that is leading me down this path.

SPOILER: ALWAYS EARN REPUTATION EVEN WHEN ALLIED.






SPOILER: CHAINED MISSIONS - HIDDEN FIRST STEPS AND LOTS OF INFO!














Does anyone have a 'full' faction bar for Federation/Empire/Alliance? I think I have federation, but I'll need to check later in-game to be 100%. Don't think I have Empire and certainly not alliance.

I wonder if this is how we might get a DW invite? Take a passenger into the Universe and get a follow-up to drop on a TDW station?! One can only hope... as I've never received a chained passenger mission, never!

Also, have we cataloged what these triggers anywhere? I now wonder what others there might be? Being in-system for x minutes? I certainly haven't done all types of missions, to then receive a chain follow-up (30% chance?) from those.
