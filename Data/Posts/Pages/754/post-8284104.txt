So, if I'm not confusing anything else you are both telling me the opposite answer? I'm seriously trying to clarify this. This literally has happened every time I asked this question.


Ok. So, there is a point to huge fuel amounts and traveling between stars to reach new places.

I was simplifying it to ask the question. And I think that last part isn't true after reaching 2001c. That takes about an hour. So, techinically that isn't true for this game. Actually I don't think fuel consumption ever increases in this game. It's base on solid electrical use and it's just less efficient before reaching the max of 2001c. I'm actually looking for the formula for this. I found it and thought I bookmarked it and then went to find it and like everything else I bookmark doesn't contain the answer anymore... I can never figure out why. Not sure how I keep not bookmarking the correct things. Unless it's the location that wasn't the same...

The reason this is hard to test is that the only places that don't take days to travel too have so little fuel use in a jump it's impossible to tell the difference visually. Hence it's incredibly hard or annoying to test.

Perhaps this is a question for a different thread, or even better one of the developers perhaps during a livestream or message them directly they do post on here. either way I'm sure no one is deliberately lying to you if they believe what they are saying then to them they are telling you the truth
