Folks. I have opened a Discord to garner community views. Four main areas for now.

General Discussion - Anything goes really, just keep it sensible.
Destinations - Where shall we go?
Conduct - How should we organise the Lore Tour, which modes, what's the etiquette for CMDRs, when would it happening etc, which platforms...
Events - Particular events that might be organised within the tour.


Look forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,

Drew.
