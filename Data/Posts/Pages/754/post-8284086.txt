1. I believe it is an important question to ask, given the confirmed statements:

"Why haven't we found Raxxla?"

2. Has anyone found any unlocked systems in col 70? I remember reading a comment about drew saying we should pay close attention to the panel on our left. This was in relation to Salome starting there.

I can only assume you have to be in the right spot around Col 70 look at the left panel go through the list of systems near by and find which ever system within Col 70 is unlocked to the Cmdr.
