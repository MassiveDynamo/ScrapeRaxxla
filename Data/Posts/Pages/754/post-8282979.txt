We looked at the comment about the mission board not knowing your cargo quite a few pages back, not that long ago really. Spotted the engineer comment. We made no progress apart from noting it. No conclusions were made as seems totally unconnected with anything else - max mission range apart from passenger and inbox missions is usually 20LY from the station giving the mission so no apparent link to jump range or any engineering. Mystery currently unsolved.

I noted the typically too - It doesnt typically hide any at all seemingly, any unavailable missions are below the available ones - not enough cargo space, not enough passenger cabins, ship too large for the landing pads at that station or not enough rank or friendship level - So what does typically refer to? Are there missions that dont fall into these 'unavailable' ones or was that just a choice of words. I personally thought it may mean that at some point in the future some missions may be hidden but not yet. Just another thing to keep an eye on.
