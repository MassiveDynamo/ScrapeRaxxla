To paraphrase some very wise humans:

"Kill your ego before it kills you."

- Humanity stumbles upon Raxxla by accident. We might control it now (maybe), but we didn't build the majority of it.

- The Gateway itself is but one piece of a vastly larger puzzle.

- Raxxla is ancient and probably far more so than humanity.

- Our rumors of it are colored by the rose-colored glasses of our cultures. Our cultures are in turn influenced by our perspective.

- Raxxla, as such, can only be found by breaking free of your cultural programming.

- The journey is more important than the destination.
