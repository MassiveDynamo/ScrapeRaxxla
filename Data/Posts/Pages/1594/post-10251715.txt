The question is, Where we given the breadcrumbs?
Everywhere possibly. Everything from beacons, GalNet, logs from INRA, etc. There is very little I would honestly say isn't a hint at the true nature of things. You as a CMDR are kind of tasked with what actually happened and how did we get here. Something that could potentially connect galaxies is going to have a lot of unseen functions. Also, if your technology is reverse-engineered (though perhaps much earlier) there's going to be lessons there (and that's using almost exclusively modern game only). The old stuff just allows for drawing from a lot more material. That said, descriptions on like engineering materials and data are surprisingly good at painting a more full picture. Context is critical in getting a grasp at what you are dealing with in the end.
