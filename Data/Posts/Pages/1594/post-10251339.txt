Why that system, do you have a theory?

There are a lot of permit locked systems, even in the bubble, just curious as to why that one caught your attention

Sol, Shinrarta, Polaris and LFT 509/Ross 54 are my main candidates for progressing the search for the DW and/or Raxxla... Sol is a bit broken and has lots of possible links/hints, Shin Rez has a DW faction and locked until you are Elite, etc, Polaris is locked and has been part of the lore before...... but LFT 509/Ross 54 is broken in many ways and wrong for many weird reasons... ;-)
Polaris is in FFE (Elite 3) as was Miacke in the missions, all were part of the Thargoid narrative that was retconned in the early ED Thargoid days.

Polaris was the final place of the Thargoid mothership which could be docked with.

Shinrata looks like the "Starting" point of the search as it's the start of your dark wheel journey when you get access on hitting Elite
