Then we also have the World's size description as being... "like a star of smallest magnitude close by the moon". Considering the double meanings present, this immediately reminded me of a white dwarf or even a neutron star. A "star of smallest magnitude" could be one that is brightest, or emit a lot of radiation such as during or just before they go supernova. "Close by the moon" could literally mean it is approximately the size of a moon which fits the relatively small size of white dwarfs and neutron stars
There are lots of white dwarfs near Sol, Sirius B being one of the absolute closest 8.59 LY). Sirius A, of course, it noted for its brilliance as viewed from Sol.
