The interpretation may be off. Pendent world is not Earth. It was the entire Universe. You're dealing with a Ptolemic Universe that got applied to a Universe where Earth is important but not central. Therefore, the pendant world is the whole of the Universe from the observer's perspective. The outer-most shell is the observable universe spinning about the point of observation.
