So what's up with the return of the Thetis signal and who is sending it?

The new signal could easily be speculated to be human or Thargoid, but I don't think that fits with Thetis. The Thetis event probably happened hundreds of years ago.
Back then I don't think Thargoids would have seen a single generation ship as any threat. Humans probably didn't have the capacity.

Halsey and Romero seem to have gotten their messages more directly, in a dream like state. This is mind-control via coms systems. The sender is advanced, but not able to go directly into the mind of the receiver. I have no one to hang this on.
I suspect AI
