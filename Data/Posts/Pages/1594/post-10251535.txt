Then we also have the World's size description as being... "like a star of smallest magnitude close by the moon". Considering the double meanings present, this immediately reminded me of a white dwarf or even a neutron star. A "star of smallest magnitude" could be one that is brightest, or emit a lot of radiation such as during or just before they go supernova. "Close by the moon" could literally mean it is approximately the size of a moon which fits the relatively small size of white dwarfs and neutron stars
The only "stars" consistently "close to the Moon" are planets in Sol not actual stars (with the two most likely being Mercury and Venus).
