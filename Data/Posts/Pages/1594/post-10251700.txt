The problem that I see is this, space.

As Douglas Adams said:

“Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space.”

So there we have it we are searching in such a massive area that chances of success without at least some breadcrumbs to follow are not that high disappointingly.
Insofar as hints, I think some of the better ones are information like on Faraway and development of hyperspace technology. Example, there are well known large antenna on large stations and outposts. The large stations (all types including asteroid) have a ring with antenna that seems to important to functionality of modern Frameshift Drive technology. Though, I generally take the stance very little has changed: Saud Kruger Astrogation Console present in all ships (Astrogator acquired by Saud Kruger), fuel scoops present since before first game and in all games since the beginning (see Reorte and Beta Hydri beacons), and Sidewinders and others used to use something like wake scanning to follow ships they escorted. Additionally, it is hard to argue Fleet Carriers aren't using externally configured jumps. The CMDR that owns the carrier can be hundreds of lightyears distant and have a carrier pick them up. The past is the lesson. But, you have to be careful to contextualize the lessons.
