One of the great things I love about the search for Raxxla, is it has brought me back to these and other text, and encouraged me to contextualise them through the prism of astronomy and fine art.

Much is open to interpretation.
Ever considered contextualising it through the main protagonists in game?

Satan as the Thargoids?
Guardians as angels or God?
and humans being the sinful people we are coming from Earth?
