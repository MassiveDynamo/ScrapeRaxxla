Just to clarify in case of any misinterpretation, none of what I was saying was focused on an Earth-centric perspective and I didn't make any reference to Earth or the Sol system. That may be the basis of one theory, but I don't yet see any reason to be constrained to that when searching for a common thread.
My reply was more towards @Rochester which in recent posts had been gravitating towards an Earth-central reference (perhaps unintentionally). Given that, was trying to provide clarification on "pendent world" as Miltonian Cosmogony is solidly Ptolemic but when applied it somewhat breaks the interpretation. That said, I am truthfully not even sure the actual center of human space is anchored at Sol (pretty sure it isn't uniform distance from Sol before hitting unpopulated systems). Sure, Sol is centrally important to humanity because we are from there and it may have where we learn about Raxxla. That said, while important it isn't Raxxla just the (0,0,0) of human coordinate grids. I think the idea is valid but only once you realize Miltonian Cosmogony only works in the modern framework with the center being the observer not a specific planet per se.
