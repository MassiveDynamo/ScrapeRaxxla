No, Lemon Slice is not visitable with FCs. Maybe someone was put there as a special gift as FDev has done in the past with unreachable systems far outside the galaxy, for special reasons e.g. that terminally-ill fellow who had it as a special request.
It is. There were 2 fleet carriers there and I can confirm 1 was owned by a ps4 player. Fdev didn't do us (ps4) any favors. Of that I'm certain.

@RevCaoticFox what was your route to lemon slice?
