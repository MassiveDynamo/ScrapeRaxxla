Just heard back from him. He hasn't been around for a while either in-game or on the forums. Someone contacted him directly via other means recently about something or other, but that was it. He thinks his old account should still be around but he hasn't checked recently.
And what’s/when’s the new book??
AHTW was a good read; I’m always on the lookout for similar calibre reading material!
Edit: anybody know how to turn off the forum auto correct mis-spelling expert idiot on iPad?
