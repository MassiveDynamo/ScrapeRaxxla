I had thought along these lines when I first started searching. I wound up being obsessed with Thurstons Gateway. Itâ€™s the last thing in the system so what is it a Gateway to? Oddly enough if you google Thurston Gateway the first thing not related to Elite is Thurston ROTARY club. The rotary logo looks very familiar.
For a while I thought you had to use the neutron star to jump in the direction of the gateway to maybe initiate a miss jump, but I think I got side tracked by something else in this thread about a year back and forgot all about this.
Anyway first post o7
By the way, it is theoretically possible Thurston ROTARY club next step, thanks for the info.
