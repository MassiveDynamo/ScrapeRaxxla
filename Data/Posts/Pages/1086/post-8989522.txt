Raxxla IS STILL IN SOL!
(Again with this? Yes, AGAIN!!!)



TL,DWR:

Raxxla is to be in Sol’s “empty” main asteroid belt. Ooooooh, I said it!!!! I went there! And if you, commander, don't already believe that, then read on!



























































































Ideally, we coordinate large groups or m… just kidding, guise! Go do what you do, we can collectively come up with wayyyy more and better stuff than I could ever post here! But let’s find whatever is here, Fdev is practically punching us in the face with these clues and hints! Collective wisdom & intelligence provided by groups of us working together in coordinated efforts will get this thing done. Grab friends, grab family, grab squadron mates! DEATH TO RAXXLA! Err....














(Damn you Sidney, you and your metaphorical ramblings!)




You're an awesome friend.
You're a gift to those around you.
You're a smart cookie.


I like your style.
You have the best laugh.
I appreciate you.
