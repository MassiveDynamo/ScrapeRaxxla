I tried going out to lemon slice nebula last night. Spansh said I could make it but my route plotting failed with only 1900Â±ly. I know it was kind of a joke when it was posted but you never know. I can only find references to it being unreachable before FC but now that I have one, does anyone know a route? I've seen that someone has been there on yt.


Also, could you fine cmdrs who have had the Green Glow in Sol's belt locations repost the general how to for that for me? I'm trying to recreate it and possibly help some of my squad see it too
If you mean my post, yes, you can get to Lemon Slice with a FC. The meme image is not in game, I took the image from Google. Frontier has not put the same texture.

Tomorrow I will see if I have the bookmarks and I will give you the route. It took me several days to find a viable path and tritium is scarce in that area, I was almost trapped.
