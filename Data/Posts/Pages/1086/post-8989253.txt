FR is still a must do for new lore players though, thats always 'current'.

Well, FR is really only current until the major Thargoid invasion that was behind the lub’s Dynasty plot.
With the numbers I saw last week massing in the Coalsack I think they’re only waiting for Odyssey release!
(I think they want to chew down on some soft & juicy explorers, instead of having to get them through crunchy occupied escape pods)
