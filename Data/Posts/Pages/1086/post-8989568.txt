The route to Lemon Slice looks like a Question Mark?....

We dont actually know who invented the Dark Wheel, more than likely Holdstock as the author, there was never any real 'lore' in game it was just in the book and our heads. Some of the places were real but no extra lore or connection than any other system.

In Elite the game was limited to 8 "galaxies". The Lave cluster was in galaxy 1. These galaxies were just Galcop control sectors. The 7 ly jump limit was just a property of the Galcop configured Cobra III, which was the only ship available for players. In lore 'Imprint', the rest of the 'real galaxy' existed. It was just not visible on Galcop nav computers. Only by becoming Elite, could a pilot apply for a full jump licence(only in lore, not available to players).

Have I got the right game? In my 1984 BBC Elite I could jump to another system with my installed 7LY Jumpdrive or I could buy a one time use Galactic Hyperdrive to jump to another Galaxy. You had to go in sequence though, from Galaxy 1 to Galaxy 2 and so on. You couldnt jump backwards or around. It was expensive but you didnt need any rank requirement afaik and certainly not Elite.
