The route to Lemon Slice looks like a Question Mark?....

We dont actually know who invented the Dark Wheel, more than likely Holdstock as the author, there was never any real 'lore' in game it was just in the book and our heads. Some of the places were real but no extra lore or connection than any other system.



Have I got the right game? In my 1984 BBC Elite I could jump to another system with my installed 7LY Jumpdrive or I could buy a one time use Galactic Hyperdrive to jump to another Galaxy. You had to go in sequence though, from Galaxy 1 to Galaxy 2 and so on. You couldnt jump backwards or around. It was expensive but you didnt need any rank requirement afaik and certainly not Elite.

That's how it worked. Galactic hyperjump took you to the next galaxy. No rank required. When you got to galaxy 8, the next jump took you to galaxy 1. These 8 galaxies were the sectors in the Galcop network. There was nothing else in the game.

The rest of human space and how you could get there as a Galcop pilot, is only explained in the book Imprint. Earth and Sol aren't explicitly mentioned, but the Federation is.
