Sometimes we discuss images in ED, that might have a connection to Raxxla.

I can't recall if we have done this one?


It's the heading picture for exploration, in the Pilot's handbook. I've never seen anything like that in the game.

Looks like a small moon with a cloud. Perhaps a very small Lagrange planet with a cloud?

Obfuscated, Ghost world, or just some fancy art work?
