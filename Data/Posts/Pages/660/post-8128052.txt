Sometimes we discuss images in ED, that might have a connection to Raxxla.

I can't recall if we have done this one?


It's the heading picture for exploration, in the Pilot's handbook. I've never seen anything like that in the game.

Looks like a small moon with a cloud. Perhaps a very small Lagrange planet with a cloud?

Obfuscated, Ghost world, or just some fancy art work?

Well, I see stars in the background so it would be possible in theory to locate the body based on those. Heard it's been done before.
(Funny how the obvious can stare in your eyes, Exploration...)
PS: And there's a route plotted under Maps..., nah too obvious.
PPS: Updated the OP with the image.
