Hello cmdrs,
I've been interested in Soontill and Raxxla lately and I've already learned a lot, but being a little lazy, especially for reading 1559 pages of thread, could someone tell me what tracks you're currently on and what are they (generally) the ones you have already studied? I also have another question, concerning the relationship between Raxxla and Astrophil and Stella because, not being English, it is complicated for me to read these poems completely ?
