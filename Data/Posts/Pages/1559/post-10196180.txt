Strongest indication for the existence of Raxxla so far is Drew's blog entry[7] the inclusion of Raxxla in the Codex.
I'd actually like to clarify on this particular point: a claim is just a claim until it has a factual basis. There is nothing in the Raxxla codex that really moves it past a myth. This is all the more true when the organization making the claims may not have the best of track records regarding truthfulness.

Where the validation of Raxxla being real first comes into play is the existence of Sol and Earth. Raxxla myth depends upon Earth at a very fundamental level. Raxxla depends on the Oisir-Raxxlans misbuilding the Talmor Lens at Earth. Only with a unified universe can Raxxla exist. This is partly why The Dark Wheel novella has numerous references to Earth, fuel scoops, and Hydrogen.

To be clear, Earth is just where humanity bumps into the alien technology that made Raxxla possible. Earth is not Raxxla itself. Earth, however, is deeply important to Raxxla being more than a myth. The other key piece is Lavian Brandy. This is because it is brewed in oak barrels imported directly from Earth per the in-game description and advertisements.
