The Club isn't a story line as much as a tool for FD to justify changes in the game. As long as nothing happens, they are dormant.

Well, that was a rather creative attempt at dodging reality. Good luck with that. May the odds forever be in your favor.

They should have, but I suspect The Club storyline was dropped.
The delusion is strong with this one.

Care to explain The Colonia Bridge? Project Dynasty seems to be alive and well. I'd also like to point out the Club wanted to consolidate power under the Empire. Who built a number of those Ocellus stations despite it being a supposedly Brewer Corporation initiative? Also, who built the first Coriolis? Jaques in Vetitice/Facece. Lave's Coriolis was the first of the much larger ones. But, yes, the Club is dead and we have absolutely nothing to fear. We can also all just ignore that agreement between President Tyrell Biggs and Emperor Hengist Duval in 3008.
