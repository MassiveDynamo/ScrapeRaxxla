They should have, but I suspect The Club storyline was dropped.
The Club isn't a story line as much as a tool for FD to justify changes in the game. As long as nothing happens, they are dormant.

Drew clearly said that the Club was made up by FD, not him. There is no reason to drop them. They may become useful at some point.
