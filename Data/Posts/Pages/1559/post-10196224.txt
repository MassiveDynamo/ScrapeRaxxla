I don’t think there are many here that doesn’t think Raxxla exist as a lore element. The question is more if we can trust that it’s implemented in the game.
All the things you list above would be the same for Frontier and First encounters as well. Those games did not have Raxxla implemented.

I also doubt that FD has used anything from Alien world. That book is still under copyright. They would probably have to pay and credit Holdstocks family, for that to work.
I am 99.99% sure Braben and Bell personally commissioned the Steven Eisler books and every single one of the ones done jointly between Holdstock and Malcolm Edwards. There is too much emphasis on Earth all prior games, The Dark Wheel novella, the official novels, and said series of books released before the release of the first game.

Lakon Spaceways is and always will be from Sol. The Type-6 Transporter is proof of that. Nevermind, all the lore connected to Faulcon Manspace and Faulcon-Delacy in this game and all prior games. Additionally, Saud Kruger is in the book "Tour of the Universe". Saud Kruger is likely nearly as ancient as both Lakon Spaceways (previously known as Laker Spaceways) and Sirius Corporation.

Sol has forever been a part of the lore.

Raxxla is mentioned in the TDW novella.

Also, a reminder that Galaxy 1 contains Lave and Vetitice (later renamed Facece) but had Sol edited off the maps.
