Achenar marked the end if the river Eridanus, the river of the Underworld
Eridanos (mythological river) - Wikipedia
en.m.wikipedia.org

Nothing about rivers in the codex is there?
Also, fitting the theme, the brightest star in the Eridanus constellation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achernar
(spelling being different because the IAU only officialized it in 2016)

...there's also a close star with the same etymology, Acamar, which was the original "end of the river" as ancient Greeks could not see the former. Hmmmm.
