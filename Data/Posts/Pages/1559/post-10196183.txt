Additionally, the Earth connection implies Raxxla or something based off the alien technology found at Earth and Mars was known by even the first waves of colonists. Granted, not all of humanity may have known (the nature of the Martian Relic is still a secret even in 3309) but some people very much knew something was out there before we even left Sol.

Find the pirates that stole the Tesla and Starman and you probably have the group that knows about Raxxla. If I was guessing, a station near a planet named New America would be a good starting point. I'd start with Zeessze and Facece. Though, I seem to remember bumping into another New America somewhere else so checking GalMap may be in order.

On that note, The Pilot's Federation knows more than they say:

This is damned close to Starman's suit.
