Yes

There are 72 stars on our named list, 5 of them seem to be named for something that's not an astronaut or astronomer. Maybe 4 if Tycho is a name (it might not be)*.

Labyrinth
Legacy
The Veil
Tycho
Yngvi-Freyr

These ones are the odd ones out, and maybe they're just placed there for fun... but maybe they have been named for a reason... The question is, are they a clue?

Recall these there are in proximity to the last stop on the Brookes Tour which mentions Raxxla.

For example: Each term could represent a symbolic or metaphorical concept. "The Veil" might suggest a barrier or separation, "Labyrinth" could imply complexity or a journey with twists and turns, "Legacy" might relate to something passed down through generations. You could easily interpret this in the context of the Raxxla quest!

Tycho is a masculine given name, a latinization of Greek Τύχων, from the name of Tyche (Greek: Τύχη), the Greek goddess of fortune or luck.
Tycho (lunar crater)
Tycho Brahe (Martian crater)
The Tycho-1 Catalogue or Tycho-2 Catalogue of stars

The lunar crater Tycho is interesting from an Elite perspective since that's where the monolith was discovered in 2001: A Space Odyssey, famed inspiration for Elite. I still think it's likely to be a last name that I just haven't found.
