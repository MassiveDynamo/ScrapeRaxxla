I was looking through that earlier as well. Interesting that the futhorc ingwaz rune variant is ·õù
Maybe Raxxla sounds more like Rangla - which is an Icelandic term for wandering


Varuna reminded me of Vestri - the norse dwarf / pillar that holds up the sky. I see there is a Vestani and Vestet in EDSM if that has any spatial relationship.
To me, these runes look more like signs from obelisks, some of which are mistaken for Thargoid artifact markings for some reason.
