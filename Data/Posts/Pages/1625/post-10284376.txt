Galnet suggests that at least some Guardians may have had the ability to to digitise and relocate their mind upon physical death. This would explain both the typical shape shifting of old greek and norse gods, that often turned them self into various animals and the non physical Caretakers.

Given that Guardians had this type of knowledge at the time of their fall those that survived would have had at least a million years to evolve the knowledge, even before the 'time of gods' on earth.

The strange thing is that we as players (Pilot federation members) seem to have the same ability, when we die. Our 'escape pods' do not seem very physical. This is most likely just a gameplay choice by FD, but it is peculiar that they have never given an explanation for it.
You are but a simulation running in the Matrix!
