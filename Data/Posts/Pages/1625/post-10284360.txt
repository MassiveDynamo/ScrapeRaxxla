If only Ram Tah actually gave us a copy of his research notes

I do think there is more to learn from the Guardians but whether they have a connection with Raxxla or not is something I'm curious about.
I do recall the Guardian R&D thread was a great summary for the glyphs / runes. Notably the Ram Tah talked about Guardians deriving their glyphs from ancient hunting sign language (much like some indigenous cultures on Earth) - so it starts to become fuzzy if there is any connection to Norse futhark.
Galnet suggests that at least some Guardians may have had the ability to to digitise and relocate their mind upon physical death. This would explain both the typical shape shifting of old greek and norse gods, that often turned them self into various animals and the non physical Caretakers.

Given that Guardians had this type of knowledge at the time of their fall those that survived would have had at least a million years to evolve the knowledge, even before the 'time of gods' on earth.

The strange thing is that we as players (Pilot federation members) seem to have the same ability, when we die. Our 'escape pods' do not seem very physical. This is most likely just a gameplay choice by FD, but it is peculiar that they have never given an explanation for it.
