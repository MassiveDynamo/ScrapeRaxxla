If only Ram Tah actually gave us a copy of his research notes

I do think there is more to learn from the Guardians but whether they have a connection with Raxxla or not is something I'm curious about.
I do recall the Guardian R&D thread was a great summary for the glyphs / runes. Notably the Ram Tah logs talked about Guardians deriving their glyphs from ancient hunting sign language (much like some indigenous cultures on Earth) - so it starts to become fuzzy if there is any connection to Norse futhark.
