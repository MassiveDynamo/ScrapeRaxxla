VV Orionis was originally a pinpoint location for many back in the day, it was permit locked before col70 and the others also and lies bang center of the nebula, only 7 ships by edsm ever went into it however no map available so wasnt scanned/uploaded

This system was visited for the first time on EDSM by Virosh Lich.

7 ships passed through VV Orionis space, including 0 ship in the last 7 days.

0 ship passed through VV Orionis space in the last 24 hours.

This appears to be a variable star based on name designation. I am still working on naming convention for the cataclysmic variables. That said, asymptotic giant branch stars are generally long period variables so it's still a start (linked to both Soontill and a large number of Pleiades stars).

The current naming system is:

- Stars with existing Greek letter Bayer designations are not given new designations.
Otherwise, start with the letter R and go through Z.

- Continue with RR...RZ, then use SS...SZ, TT...TZ and so on until ZZ.

- Use AA...AZ, BB...BZ, CC...CZ and so on until reaching QZ, omitting J in both the first and second positions.

- Abandon the Latin script after 334 combinations of letters and start naming stars with V335, V336, and so on.

The second letter is never nearer the beginning of the alphabet than the first, e.g., no star can be BA, CA, CB, DA and so on.
