Richards Gap - Mercedes Tharam Richards, astronomy and astrophysics professor. Her investigation focused on computational astrophysics, stellar astrophysics and exoplanets and brown dwarfs, and the physical dynamics of interacting binary stars systems. However, her pioneering research in the tomography of interacting binary star systems and cataclysmic variable stars to predict magnetic activity and simulate gas flow is her most known work.
I think name of discoverer is less important than the fact we have a cluster of names in the Trapezium Cluster related to various aspects of this in one relatively centralized location. That said this is only part of it and we then have to find others like it. The reason I quoted this particular text block is cataclysmic variables seems to echo themes from The Alleged Toast of the Dark Wheel where these variables end up nearly destroying (and in extreme cases result in supernova) each other in the process of close interactions. A gateway is going to involve a lot of energy (e.g. the mythical omphalos rift). Additionally, per "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" the gateway was near a globular cluster. As it turns out, we have search locations (see attached PDF for a list of those connected to globular clusters).
