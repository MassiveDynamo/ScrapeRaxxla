I think it's a case where it violates the spirit of the law but not the letter of it.

It's definitely a bug that should be fixed or implemented properly (and securely) as a feature so you could link a route to any station/body/or combat zone easily from out of game links.

It would be way different the same exact exploit mechanism was used to gain a gameplay advantage or to crash other peoples games.
