Don't worry, Your code "works" as intended.
However, your compiler or OS probably does not.
With gcc on Linux (and %lu instead of %I64u) I get:

Code:
ID_Base=                                                      1887439211    , ID_Overflow=                                                      2528116736     , buffer=                                                      2528116736
