FDevs way of player retention...

Lets limit player numbers per instance to a very low number...infact lets make it near impossible to instance in Open..uhuhuhuhu sounds great

Here Is a bug fix...uh huh created more bugs, Also add Thargoid bugs that arnt a threat anymore unless you choose them to be...

storyline? ah sure its going ahead fine... "Insert two hundred years later meme here"

Add a marksman/sniper rifle....ehh lets make it shoot really slow plasma balls

And uh we made Dinosaurs fun again out of the rest of the profits...huhuhuhu

Lets tell everyone Raxxla is, isnt, maybe, maybe not, cant reach, can reach, is some wierd bug we planted to show you Brabens face into the game to keep players playing...huhuhuhu

Sounds good boss you can go and not engage with the community anymore and lose your enthusiasm as you now have the money you wanted while crashing your fans hopes and excitement
