Don't worry, Your code "works" as intended.
However, your compiler or OS probably does not.
With gcc on Linux (and %lu instead of %I64u) I get:

Code:
ID_Base=                                                      1887439211    , ID_Overflow=                                                      2528116736     , buffer=                                                      2528116736

I'm on Win10 Home 64 bits 21H2
I remember that "int" type are tricky because they depend on x86/x64 architecture.
This is why i used the uint64_t to be sure i have a 64bits variable.

But i totally forgot that linux can have another behavior, so another number retreived.

Thx for you help
