Thanks for this, I was using a different method to target these by figuring out the ids and editing the misc.conf, which required relogging and jumping out of the system.

How do you calculate the searchbar string, from the system ID number?
I think it's the number of the body you want + the N2 number + 2 to the power of the length of the N2 bits in the id64 (which depends on the mass code), but I haven't tested it in too many systems. It feels non-trivial to explain and I think if I tried I'd just end up with something that reaches the solution in a roundabout way and is confusing.
