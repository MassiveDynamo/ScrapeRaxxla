Everything is very tricky here. Why would a real wheel eliminate a pseudo-wheel if everyone is looking for them now? Now public attention is focused on the all-wheel-drive, so it is not profitable for the real wheel to eliminate them. do you understand?
Or it could be that is what they want you to think, and they are hiding in plain site

It seems a little too coincidental that The Dark Wheel faction was giving out unique missions in the past if they were just pretenders. In my opinion anyway.

The installation you found, did it have any data points you could scan or anything besides the mini event at all?
