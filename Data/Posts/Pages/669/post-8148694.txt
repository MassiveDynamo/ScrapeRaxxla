Well, it might be called The Real Dark Wheel!
But there is one other drawback, the premise is based on the assumption that the Codex entries are fully realised in-game. Since there is already a player faction named “Dark Wheel” and they haven’t been closed down then I think the hypothesis is on a hiding to nothing!
The Dark Wheel faction in-game isn’t a player faction though, they were the ones giving out the unique missions, to do with the SAP 8 core containers and the Trinkets of Hidden Fortune etc. It is true they have never been shut down, so it may stand to reason that they are the real deal...

The Dark Wheel squadron is player created. However the only other info I can dig up makes it seem for all intents and purposes to just be a small squadron created for fun by a random cmdr. The fact that they have not been closed down could perhaps be evidence to disprove the hypothesis.

This is an interesting thread to keep pulling on, if it hasn’t been followed to date. Looking into this has brought to my attention that there are quite a few TDW controlled installations in LFT 926. One of which is named “Erebus Security Bureau”, with Erebus being the god of darkness in Greek mythology
