i am currently doing missions for the dark wheel faction in LFT 926. they also have an installation inside the asteroid belt cluster, that has some sort of riot from the npcs. notice how i have the belt targeted, and it has "the Dark Wheel" in the description, rather than the installation itself. wich i found weird. dont know if this exists in shinrata aswell, as i dont have access to that permit. but in LFT 926, they have 2 agents that give missions, and they mostly have wing assassination missions wich im not too enthousiastic about. assasinations of "deserters" of the DW. but i'll grind it out a bit and see.
here's a pic :
SPOILER: DARK WHEEL SCREENSHOT

already found this station, it is not special. wait for the attack on the station and you will be given the choice to defend it or attack.
