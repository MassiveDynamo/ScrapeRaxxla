For L4 and L5 you don't even need exact masses for the star and the planet. As long as the star is more than 25 times the mass of the planet, they are stabile and at fixed positions on the orbit line.
In ED, L4 and L5 seem to be the most common locations for Lagrange objects.

In the RL Sol-Jupiter system, L4 and L5 are heavily populated with the Trojan and Greek asteroids.

I know TRDW station is supposed to be stealthy, but Iâ€™d be quite surprised if it looks like a large wooden horse
