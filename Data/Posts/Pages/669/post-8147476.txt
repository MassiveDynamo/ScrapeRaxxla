Just pick the mass of a small asteroide. It probably doesn't make much difference at all, as the mass of the station is insignificant compared to the planet and the star.

Actually, there may be a quicker and more reliable way...
Is there any in-game station actually placed at a lagrange point???

Edit: Doh, I knew I was having a brain-failure!
Just need mass of star, planet & semi-major axis, station mass unnecessary.
Need to do some in-game testing, unfortunately not tonight...
