Yay my asteroid belt theory panned out!!
If you target the belt with fss does it say it has human signals or did you just find it kinda accidentally? This has me excited...
the belt didnt show any unusual thing. i found it completely randomely, as i noticed how the star looked similar to the one from the DW picture, so i jumped to it, thinking that it would be the ideal place, from wich to recreate that same view, with a station so close to the star.
SPOILER: BELT IN FSS
apparently you receive random mission requests from the DW faction as you fly around in this system, asking for various tasks. i received one as im typing this reply. but i suppose this is normal, as thats how factions in other systems behave too. right?
i should start checking out these belts more often in suspicious systems in the future, as they seem they can hide stuff too. and they are perfect hiding spots since they dont show anything strange before you actually jump to them.
