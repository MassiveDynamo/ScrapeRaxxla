i am currently doing missions for the dark wheel faction in LFT 926. they also have an installation inside the asteroid belt cluster, that has some sort of riot from the npcs. notice how i have the belt targeted, and it has "the Dark Wheel" in the description, rather than the installation itself. wich i found weird. dont know if this exists in shinrata aswell, as i dont have access to that permit. but in LFT 926, they have 2 agents that give missions, and they mostly have wing assassination missions wich im not too enthousiastic about. assasinations of "deserters" of the DW. but i'll grind it out a bit and see.
here's a pic :
SPOILER: DARK WHEEL SCREENSHOT
That is cool, nice find! A base in an asteroid belt that says “The Dark Wheel” rather than having an installation name? Pretty weird. I wonder what else could be hiding in asteroid belts? I mostly ignore them when exploring a system personally, but that sure is gonna change now. Are there any data points to scan that give any unique info or missions?

The current missions are probably related to the War state TDW is currently in. Hopefully they give different missions when they change to another state, or when you get high rep with them?
