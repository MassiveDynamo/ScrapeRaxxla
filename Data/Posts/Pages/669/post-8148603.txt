The main issue I see with doing this is that the minor faction “The Dark Wheel” does exist in game, so a player faction using the same name would likely be rejected. They have a presence in Shinrarta Dezrah and LFT 926 if you wanted to try and gain influence with them. Bear in mind that as far as I know they are no longer offering the special missions they used to, as noted in the OP of this thread.

Also, to make a Player minor faction you need to first create a player group/squadron, and have at least 10 members. A player group named “The Dark Wheel” does already exist, and only has 3 members currently. So that would prevent any one else from even applying for player minor faction status unfortunately.

I really do like the idea though!

Well, it might be called The Real Dark Wheel!
But there is one other drawback, the premise is based on the assumption that the Codex entries are fully realised in-game. Since there is already a player faction named “Dark Wheel” and they haven’t been closed down then I think the hypothesis is on a hiding to nothing!
