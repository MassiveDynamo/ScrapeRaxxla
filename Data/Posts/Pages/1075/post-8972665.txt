It’s not on eddb. There’s a 500 light year bubble there with no recently discovered systems. All early game method. I just as first discovered for nearly 20 jumps at one point. Very interesting because of the bookmark. If not for that I wouldn’t have even called attention to it

Is that around the col 70/Loop area? If so people probably avoid it as they see the bubble and think the same, iv found loads myself on the outskirts
