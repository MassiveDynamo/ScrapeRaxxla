No auto bookmark for me in HIP 71216.
Thanks for checking. Probably just a glitch. I know it wasn’t me because I never clicked on it in the star map and it’s a little below KN Muscae which was my destination. I usually name my bookmarks stuff like “ return for odyssey” or “ fsd booster **** “. Thanks for the effort though!! We will find it soon I’m sure!
