A lot of those posts seem to stop at the name similarity and don't go much further.

Γαλλια / Gallia
This is a very curious one because it seems to connect some other aspects of the Raxxla codex entry.
Gallia being the Latin name for Gaul - homeland of the Celtic tribes seems to suggest there could be a Celtic influence in the clues.

Art Tornqvist:
Art - celtic name for Bear / champion
- thorn branch - hawthorn / fairy tree ? from celtic folklore

(note it is plural) - celtic symbols often use a spiral motif - one spiral - two interlinking spirals, or - three. Perhaps hinting at two or more stars orbiting each other? I wonder if Raxxla is at the barycenter of the star orbits

- a religious stone typically at the centre of the world - centre of the spiralling stars perhaps?

There isn’t much to find, if you are looking for objects. It’s basically the asteroid 148 Gallia. Never found it in the game.
