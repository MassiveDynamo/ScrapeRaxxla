KN muscae - its the central star of planetary nebula NGC 5189 , from my survey of the Muscae constellation here:

Several of the stars are misplaced, one of them by a long way..

I completed this survey a few weeks before the colasack CG appeared. Irritating!
Reactions:
simulacrae, [PS4] Filthymick420 and Vetinari
