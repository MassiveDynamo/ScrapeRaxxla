Sounds like you got a bit of room for improvement there But it will require a lot of engineering. Try the forum for ship builds, look for ExploraConda.

@Macros Black are you on that HIP system? i cant find it on EDDB.
It’s not on eddb. There’s a 500 light year bubble there with no recently discovered systems. All early game method. I just as first discovered for nearly 20 jumps at one point. Very interesting because of the bookmark. If not for that I wouldn’t have even called attention to it
