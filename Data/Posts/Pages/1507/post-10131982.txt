"Whenever someone tries to
usurp the Dark Wheel name, sooner or later they get quietly shut down. And that's how I
know" - Felicity Farseer.

Is it possible the missions were removed for this reason and was communicated poorly to the QA team or something like that?

"It is futile to attempt to
contact the Dark Wheel on one's own initiative, however - it is always they who initiate
contact, initially in disguise, revealing their true identity only once a suitable test of
courage and skill has been discreetly administered, and passed."
