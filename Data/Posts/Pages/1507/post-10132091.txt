Fior a while there was confusion, but I thought more recently they stated that they were no longer in the game.

As for TDW in Shindez, the canon lore book Premonition us explicit in calling them a hoax.

The codex goes to a lot of trouble to cast doubt on them, and I believe it does so to explain the loss of the E/F missions ( my opinion)

Add to that that FD completely ignored the Turning the Wheel campaign, I feel satisfied that they are no use to us in the quest, being a mere shell and distraction.
The confirmation is listed on page 1.

Technically there is no official statement, on the face value no change has ever been officially communicated.

However I raised a ticket (see page 1) as a genuine consumer enquiry and got confirmation at that point they were in game! I then sought confirmation and provided them conflicting evidence, in the form of referencing the FD feedback to previous Cmdrs, and admitted I could not active them either.

Support then went and got clarification from a Dev who confirmed they were not in game.

Much later I posed the same question around the ‘Trinkets’ (in this thread) same standard response was issued as above, I then repeated the above response giving context, and got a second confirmation these missions were removed.

Technically this is not an official press release, but a standard ‘customer enquiry’ on why certain ‘advertised’ assets were not accessible.
