No such thing as a silly question here, there are many rooms here with as many unsolved mysteries and even more prattling Cmdrs scratching glyphs on the ceilings. It can be problematic finding one’s way around. Page 1 is a good start as any.

Nothing is truly known for certain, anything is plausible.

It’s possible that any 3rd party content could have been appropriated by FD and amalgamated into other storylines. There is no way to truly know.

If you feel this is a possibility, go for it, but Drew has actively distanced himself now from the ED IP so it’s rather unlikely in my opinion.
