The Dark Wheel still bugs me.
Raxxla as we know comes from the Alien World, a people a place with history on Earth, no worries, but The Dark Wheel was also listed as a 'Place' (Narathnu Sector), why then use the name for a different entity, a faction?

Raxxla in Elite has most likely nothing to do with Raxxla in the Alien World. Holdstock probably just reused a cool name, form a different story and different universe.

That being said, the string “Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars” do contain the words: ALIEN REPTILIAN PREDATORS
