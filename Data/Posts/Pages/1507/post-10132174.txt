I get this strange feeling we are running in circle for something half-broken, if even reachable...
Yes I suppose it does feel like that, sometimes but it’s evident from FD choice to build and promote the DW and Raxxla Codex’s that whatever was before, something new was implemented.

It makes sense for FD not to confirm if their content was historically broken, as it would potentially pull focus and generate unnecessary negative PR.

Instead they sat on it I suspect and later put the Codex together as either a genuine fix or as an interim bandage.

FD modus operandi it might be construed is to nerf broken content, retro fit content, or pause content until it’s needed.

If the codex was just a placeholder it could be assumed this whole rigmarole is only narratively gated. Yet there exists contradictions to this, so we have to accept public actions as evidence of content being in game.

The above hypothesis can only be resolved when someone finds them in game and you have to access that situation on its own merits, if it’s was narratively gated there will be evidence of this, and FD potentially will have placed themselves into an inevitable negative PR situation, as well as a typical ‘end of game’ situation.

It stands to ‘reason’ this should not be the ultimate objective.

The best solution in my opinion, would be to nerf historical content, separate it from any ongoing narrative, and just place it somewhere in the void, and then take what was left on the worktable and retrofit it something new, to repurpose it (the codex) as some clue towards finding it…
