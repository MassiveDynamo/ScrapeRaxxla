Been reading through Xaintly's compilation of this thread (and this thread) and I'm trying to wrap my head around all of these ideas. It can be difficult to follow. Few questions - would it be folly to consider any of Drew Wagar's work from his Oolite Saga books to be legitimate sources of information regarding Raxxla and The Dark Wheel? If we can consider it I found very interesting that the idea of Raxxla is the generator of witchspace and that witchspace is manufactured. I'm sure this has been expanded upon but I'm losing myself in these 1507 pages of information!

Second, have we confirmed that the TDW minor faction is indeed THE Dark Wheel? I was reading that the missions were removed. Any reason for that? Should I consider getting an Elite rank to gain access to Shinrarta Dezhra?

Thanks and sorry if I'm repeating things that have been said in here
