Been reading through Xaintly's compilation of this thread (and this thread) and I'm trying to wrap my head around all of these ideas. It can be difficult to follow. Few questions - would it be folly to consider any of Drew Wagar's work from his Oolite Saga books to be legitimate sources of information regarding Raxxla and The Dark Wheel? If we can consider it I found very interesting that the idea of Raxxla is the generator of witchspace and that witchspace is manufactured. I'm sure this has been expanded upon but I'm losing myself in these 1507 pages of information!

Second, have we confirmed that the TDW minor faction is indeed THE Dark Wheel? I was reading that the missions were removed. Any reason for that? Should I consider getting an Elite rank to gain access to Shinrarta Dezhra?

Thanks and sorry if I'm repeating things that have been said in here

It would indeed be folly. Drew repeatedly said that he knew nothing about Raxxla, nor did any of the other authors, apart from Michael Brookes. The authors were told to stay off the topic of Raxxla, that was reserved for FD. Drew’s Oolite books are entertaining reads (& free!) but are purely fan fiction and have no relationship to the ED world.

It seems that the only lore that is valid for ED is that contained within the game (Codex, Tourist Beacons) and those parts of the official ED novels that do not relate to Thargoids..there were no diplomatic meetings with Thargoids etc (a shame, I quite like Out of The Darkness).

The one proviso I would suggest is Elite:Legacy, which Michael Brookes wrote. I suspect he might have put a clue in that book-see my earlier post on that and the children’s novel vs codex’s Princess Astrophel.

I think Galnet might also be counted as lore, but be aware that FD said NPCs can lie so nothing said is 100% reliable.
