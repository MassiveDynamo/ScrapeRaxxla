This is probably common knowledge, but Trinkets of Hidden Fortune are still in the game, but do not appear to be carried by Dark Wheel ships anymore. Dark Wheel ships they seem to carry primarily Low Temp Diamonds, and occasionally other high value things things. The DW ships jump between a few systems, often backtracking, or going in a circle. Eventually they seem to break the pattern eventually and jump to different systems. Does not appear to have any obvious pattern or end point. If you try to hunt/track DW ships using a wing is highly recommended. It is too easy to lose the ship flying solo.
