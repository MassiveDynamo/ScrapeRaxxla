Considering the Raxxla outside-the-bubble theory, I got a wild hair to check out the Thargoid progression pattern of disabled stations. The general line doesn't line up from origin to Sol, it points up and beyond the Bubble and there's this nebula about 4klys coreward (Ara-something?) I'm checking out as it seems to line up with their general heading.
