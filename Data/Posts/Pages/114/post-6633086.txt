Occams Razor does not indicate underground cities, unless the PF are Morlocks maybe?

Occams Razor would be that they picked Founders World for a reason that's not related to what it's like to live there. Which means the planet is significant for another reason...

1. Building cities underground would not be an easy thing to do. Why would you do that at all? (as opposed to living in the orbital, which has a 1g ring anyway, and a better view).
2. Why would the richest, most powerful, most dedicated group in the modern era pick a planet to "retire" to where they can't live on the surface?
3. If they're going to retire to a planet, presumably that's because they want a planet, not a space station - if you build underground cities you're essentially building a space station on the ground.

Wouldn't Occam's razor here dictate that the simplest explanation is that Frontier simply screwed up on giving the Founders' World any significant or meaningful attributes? In other words, yet another roll of tin-foil we're all working our way through on this idea...
