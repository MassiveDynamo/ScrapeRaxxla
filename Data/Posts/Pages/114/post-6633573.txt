Here's the thing ...

Shinrarta Dezhra is almost a perfect place to hide Raxxla in plain sight.

Already inhabited by evil men? Got it. The Pilots Federation are no girl scouts. They're the ones that insist on tagging our combat rank to our ships ... thus insuring that helpless newbs will always be easy targets.

According to Lore Shinrarta Dezhra's location is secret.

The Dark Wheel faction are loitering around the system for some unknown reason.

If The Founders World IS Raxxla then it is the perfect man trap: Once someone gets too close to the truth they are simply "retired" to the surface and never heard from again.

"Hey, what happened to CMDR Ryder?"

"I heard he retired to the Founders World."

It could be that nobody actually retires to The Founders World. It could be that the whole retirement angle is merely a cover story to conveniently make these problem children of The Pilots Federation disappear.
