Just a note Re: The sirius "FSD operating outside of normal limits" messages.

I got several of them in NU-2 LUPI which as well has a secondary White Dwarf 169,000 ls from the primary.
I was nowhere near the White Dwarf so I think our engineered FSD are just reacting to stray White Dwarf radiation?
So nothing special about Sirius in this regard.
