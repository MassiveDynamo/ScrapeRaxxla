There are several planets in EDSM listed as tidally locked but whose rotational period does not equal the time it takes to orbit around it's star. I thought those two variables had to be equal in order for it to be tidally locked?

I suppose there could be other factors though ... maybe they are double planets or moons or something.

The data for LHS 1245 does look promising though. While it doesn't prove anything outright about The Founders World it does leave the question open enough to make the argument that the missing City lights are part of some conspiracy.

Checked systems with population greater than Shinrarta up to 100 million.

Not one true candidate, however 3 screwed up in EDDN, need forced DSS, Lampade, Kaurt, and Changai.

Fawaol Tracy 14.4D TL[to planet not star] 90,000,000 no lights,,,

Fawaol ELW Distat no lights and it's close to Earth analogue. Again maybe low oxygen at 10.9% but 1.45 atmospheric pressure. A scuba diving mountain climber is what we need to figure out breathablity.

Too bad we only know population by system and not planet and installation.

On to 70 mil to Shinrarta group.

tictoc

No candidates 70 mil to Shinrarta.

On to 60 mil to 70 mil group.

no elw candidates in 60-70 range.

no valid candidates 50-60 mil pop range
