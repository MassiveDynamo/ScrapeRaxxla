Just this, Shijima. Of course, we ALL know that, but as we like chymeras -hunting... why not "think" they are living hidden underground ?

@Louis
1. I wouldn't , but as top secret sites in RL, maybe THEY have good reasons for it. Reasons we don't know about ... like we didn't know about the Zurara or Wreaken or whatever ...
2. Who says they are retired ? PF ? INRA ? The Club ?
3. Why ? I wish I could ask them ... anyway (it is said) there is people (not so much ..) on this planet and we can't see their lights in the dark? Occam . Whether they live underground or they have Cat-Eye Implants or ...there is nobody there (Soylent Green ? LoL).

Anyway it's just another inconsistency of our FDevs, I bet ...

EDIT: ... and always the sweet possibility of the Portal being on the planet and so it's just an unhinabited "transit planet".
