I was pretty sure at some point in this thread it was mentioned that there is a full size replica of a cobra. Anyone have pictures of the inside, my thinking is maybe if it is a 100% replica like cockpit and all maybe it has some valuable information pulled up on the nav panel.

I'm pretty sure the replica Cobra is 1:3 scale, not full size.

Not that it makes a difference.
