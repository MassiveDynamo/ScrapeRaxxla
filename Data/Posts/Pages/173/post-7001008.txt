So, given that MB himself said "Three will be no clues", isn't all this navel gazing pointless?

I'd take the statement 'there will be no clues' with a grain of salt. I'd guess that what MB meant was that there would be no clues delivered outside of the game itself or beyond what had already been given. We certainly have been given some clues already: Raxxla has been mentioned in at least three of the official novels and the existence of a faction named 'The Dark Wheel' all serve to underline the fact that Raxxla is still very much relevant to the current game. There are likely other clues hidden somewhere in the game.

Besides ... the 'navel gazing' isn't pointless at all. The point of this thread isn't just about Raxxla. Its about community. You could argue that finding Raxxla itself is kind of pointless or that playing some silly space game is kind of pointless (my wife sure thinks it is). What we gain from all of this is a sense of belonging, our shared faith (and frustration) in a pointless quest played out in a pointless game that we all are, nonetheless, invested in.
