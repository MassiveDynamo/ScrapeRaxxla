Nobody has HIP 54530 permit as far as I know. HIP 22460 either. I used to try entering Witch's Reach by scanning wake scans in Donner, but couldn't enter. Before the Aegis moved, I would find meta-alloys in Sol, degraded signal source threat 4. Federal navy corvettes called it alpha site, if I remember correctly. That was near Ariel, as I was interested about recent iteration of seeking for luxuries signal sources. I used to search for Tanya Blaine in HIP 82964, and Colonia. A fixed signal source near Asellus Primus B had a Type-9 called Augustine in it, but many Type-9s are called that. Voyager 2 took some nice pictures of Ariel. The earth-like world in CD-43 11917 is called Ares. Aries is a winged ram. Phobos and Deimos are missing, and Beagle 2 landing is an ocean. The Robotic Avian has a nature. Trinkets of hidden fortune are grave offerings. I will dump this data here, in case I will not survive. The Thargoid assault has not ceased, and they still serve cold tea on-board the Gnosis. My ship is called Tau Ceti.
