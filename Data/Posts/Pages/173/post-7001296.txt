Which reminds me, the other day I came across a permit locked system quite close to Shinrarta, it was in the nav list while I was collecting Colonia passengers at Tchernobog. But then I had a visitor & didnt get around to checking it out, anyone done so?

Here are the permit locked systems within 80ly of Tchernobog. I think I have permits for most of them.
