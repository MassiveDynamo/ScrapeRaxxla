Very possible that the original "personnal journey" concept has been reduced to the "personnal stumbling onto" mechanic we are "enjoying" since MB left.



And so it remained in the official lore. The poor Old Lady hadn't been "actualized". (RR line untill the end of the arm).
This is one thing that makes me believe that Raxxla is not so close to the Bubble as some interesting and consistent tinfoiling suggests. Old lore puts everything much closer than it actually appears ingame.
Times are a changin', we play "Elite: Dangerous" in a much larger scale than "Elite". I hope I will be here to explore a lot of new galaxies when "Elite: Deadly" is released.

That's why I've made up my own 'personal nareative' - setting out to scan all the real world systems in the game. Naturally this is hampered by permit locks, systems being incorrectly placed 10kLY below the galactic plane and 'invisble' systems (if you search by name, the GalMap takes you to the relevant location, but there's no actual system there to jump to).

Still, it'll keep me busy for another 7 years
