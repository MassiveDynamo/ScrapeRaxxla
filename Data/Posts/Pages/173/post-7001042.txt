I like a collaborative effort as much as the next guy. Maybe this is a another example of classic FD communication. I like the idea of Raxxla and that it can be found with a bit of communal brain power and effort but if after all this time there's really no solid evidence of progress maybe we should take MB at his word. The only way it will be found is if someone lands in the right system and decides to drive on the right world, in one of 400B star systems. Unless FD would like to indicate otherwise. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
