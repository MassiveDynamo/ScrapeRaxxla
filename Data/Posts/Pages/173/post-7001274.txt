That's why I've made up my own 'personal nareative' - setting out to scan all the real world systems in the game. Naturally this is hampered by permit locks, systems being incorrectly placed 10kLY below the galactic plane and 'invisble' systems (if you search by name, the GalMap takes you to the relevant location, but there's no actual system there to jump to).

Still, it'll keep me busy for another 7 years

Which reminds me, the other day I came across a permit locked system quite close to Shinrarta, it was in the nav list while I was collecting Colonia passengers at Tchernobog. But then I had a visitor & didnt get around to checking it out, anyone done so?
