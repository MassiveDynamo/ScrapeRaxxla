Although these days Im leaning toward the idea that its not a new world -but an old Labyrinth that contains an even older entity.... The Exile
Definitely the idea of the Labyrinth as a prison / domain for an entity seems appropriate. The notions of "journey we must all take for ourselves" and a "test of skill and courage" as well as a "state of cosmic enlightenment" for reaching it are all befitting the symbolism of a labyrinth. Also the historic design of labyrinth is one that is unicursal with no branching paths (as opposed to a maze) so if Raxxla is such then at least we won't have to contend with dead ends once we find the path........ right?

It would also make sense that the logo represents this in an abstracted manner.
