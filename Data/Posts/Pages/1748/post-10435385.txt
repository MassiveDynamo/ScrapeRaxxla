So ive still been playing with Holdstock and his general mythic geography. He identifies the heart of Ryhope Wood (which is essentially Raxxla for us) as Huxley here:

"I used the name Huxley for the scientist who has discovered the primordial and mythogenetic nature of Ryhope (Mythago) Wood quite deliberately. His journal, an account of the mysteries and wonders that he discovers when he finally succeeds in entering the ‘heartwood’, reflects in its way the sort of thesis I’d always longed to write; but I had become too entranced by fiction ever to apply my mind to the serious task of science."

He is using two of them... The first is obvious as Holdstock had a MSc in Medical Zoology: Thomas Huxley... described as Darwins Bulldog. He joined the voyage of the HMS Rattlesnake and explored the world... (Im thinking Augustus Brenquith)... I feel the need to mention that the Rattlesnake passed by Point Nemo on its journey. The other Huxley would be Aldous Huxley - Thomas' grandson. Aldous Huxley has written quite alot but probably the most pertinent for us would be The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell. Remember that painting the Winking Cat stole.... Self Portrait with Two Circles.... the space inbetween. "There are things known and there are things unknown, and in between are the doors of perception". I supspect alot of Onionhead and a few shiny trinkets of Fortune would help...


In Heaven and Hell you can see alot of where Holdstock got his ideas about utopias etc...

I suspect they make up the the two rivers of Science and Imagination that come together to form Holdstock's Mythegos. By the way a Mythe is where two rivers come together.

Wouldn't be surprised if there is a little Robert Graves mixed into the imagination side as well....

Im off to do some exploring
