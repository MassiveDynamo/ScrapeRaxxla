Taken on its own - yes the assumption would be that. But when you look on whole at the choices made for starter systems and worlds.... I suspect it was chosen on purpose.r
Edit - And yes A large mountain....



I think there is something to this - the idea of the magical world at the edge of the "known" or the "reasonable" world. That has alot to do with places like Atlantis or the land of Prestr John - Ultima Thule, even Point Nemo. Although these days Im leaning toward the idea that its not a new world -but an old Labyrinth that contains an even older entity.... The Exile.

There does seem to be evidence in systems naming and placements that designate some type of watery boundary.

The Styx and Lethe in game are absolutely nowhere close to the underworld, instead they seem to exist on a north/south boundary.

There are systems in game whose naming is after aspects from the epic of Gilgamesh and are linked to the waters of life and creation and in game, again seem to align.

These systems correspond with a clear north / south placement, which aligns with other systems identified with north / south elements, and that aligns with the Greek compass in game and generally my concept of a Miltonian / Brookesian Cosmological model in game.
