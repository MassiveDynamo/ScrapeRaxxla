Just a followup on the Starter systems

Ya im using river analogies...

I believe the systems we start in are related to Holdstocks concepts - the starter systems from Elite / Elite 2 / FFE were related Holdstocks ideas about the otherworld - lets call it his Imagination River.

I think the starter systems in Elite are based off of the Science River....

SYSTEM
PLANET

ELITE /FE
LAVE
LAVE
LAVE STATION
Holdstocks inclusion of ‘lave’ in his idea of a mystical otherworld Lavondyss
FE
ROSS 154
MERLIN
SIROCCO STARPORT
sirocco being a mediterranean wind - related to the planet Kamelos (Timewinds) - oh by the way Kamelos is referring to both the "Eye of the Needle" as well as the fact that it is actually Kamilos - cable or rope.... think Golden Chain – Merlin is the moon of Kamelos and ofcourse the wizard that Holdstock uses in his Keltica series...
FE
SOL
MARS
OLYMPUS VILLAGE
Mount Olympus central mountain of the world
FFE
GATEWAY
HOPE
OLD BLACKELK
Black Elk was an Oglala Lakota medicine man who experienced visons”Black Elk describes being taken to the center of the Earth, and to the central mountain of the world”. He also was present at the battle of Little Bighorn and Wounded Knee – as well as being involved with the Ghost Dance. Holdstock brought in the Idea of Trickster into his myths in the book The Hollowing.

ASELLUS PRIMUS
ASELLUS 3
BEAGLE 2
Beagle 2 was a failed British Martian Exploration Robot. Asellus Primus Description: An independent corporate-run binary system, with a central white F7V star and, further out, a captured planet-less M3V red dwarf. The capture event millions of years earlier doubtless stripped Asellus Primus B of any planets that might have formed with it. Asellus Primus is known for its high tech manufacturing. Also known as 23 Theta Bootis.

DROMI
DROMI 1 ?
MAWSON DOCK
Douglas Mawson – Antarctic Explorer and Geologist.

So ya we may start out coming from different streams of thought but end up in the same place.... ?
Yes there is definitely a story arc path to the Quest for Raxxla and it is tied up in Holdstock Lore
Does that mean there is nothing in game - no, there looks to be way too much put into this for that to be the case. I suspect the "Science" path is supposed to be the sciencing you way through the in-games puzzles path...
