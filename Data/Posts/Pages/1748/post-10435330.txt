I think its just the first crack in what was a mystery with nowhere to start. I think this is the intended first step. Why?

In some versions of the Raxxla story, which were later shown to have a striking resemblance to the children's story "Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars"
The Dark Wheel toast. Where they found it or not, their toast makes some sense now.
To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! > Neutron Star / White Dwarf
To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! > non-sequence jet-cone
So what now? Since there are few white dwarfs or neutron stars in or near the bubble, that is where I shall start.
