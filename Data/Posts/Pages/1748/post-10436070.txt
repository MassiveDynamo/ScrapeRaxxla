Mars might very well be a coincidence as I believe its capital is named after the enormous (over twice the altitude of the Everest and about the size of Italy!) Olympus Mons.

Taken on its own - yes the assumption would be that. But when you look on whole at the choices made for starter systems and worlds.... I suspect it was chosen on purpose.r
Edit - And yes A large mountain....

Going with my Raxxla = New World¹ hypothesis, the person who found it might be like Leif Erikson - the first European to land there, ~500 years before Columbus. However, the Norse failed to settle permanently as the native Thule (ancestors of the Inuit) drove them away.
In fact, it was the latter who advanced further on Greenland instead, coexisting for a while until the former died out there.

Also yeah, the signal looks a lot like the Sagittarius A* spectrum graphs; this discovery earned my first ever mention on the Canonn files and might have discouraged people from completing the expedition...

¹ at least WRT the Codex, not necessarily Brookes' original vision

I think there is something to this - the idea of the magical world at the edge of the "known" or the "reasonable" world. That has alot to do with places like Atlantis or the land of Prestr John - Ultima Thule, even Point Nemo. Although these days Im leaning toward the idea that its not a new world -but an old Labyrinth that contains an even older entity.... The Exile.
