I see arrows pointing outward as if a radio signal source was emitting in every direction from a place situated between stars, a sound obfuscated with voices inside and rumours. A sound that may have a different shape the closer/farther you get from the source, and a message to recompose.
Yes, I saw the same.. those arrows are quite intriguing. Very much resembles looking directly down the spiral of a non-sequence star.

Using someone else's gif isn't as useful as seeing and adjusting. Try '3D Gif Maker' for free in your browser to play with the speed and frames and use the green/black flattened Raxxla logo. By changing the frames you can animate different parts of the logo (2 90 degree frames example)
