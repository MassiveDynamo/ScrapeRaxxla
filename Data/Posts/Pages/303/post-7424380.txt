This thread is wandering away from its subject. I don’t understand why people think Salomé or Rebecca were members of TDW, nor why this is continually coming up in a thread dedicated to finding Raxxla. The medallion that Salomé left behind may, or may not, have been from TDW, but if it was hers she left it behind which signified she was not involved with them; later Aisling used it to frame Salomé by using it against her at the “trial” but it was clearly reported in Galnet that it had been left behind in her ship so how can it have been her’s. Moreover nobody has ever proved that it belonged to Salomé in the first place-anyone could have left it in her ship, and to my mind quite possibly Luko, or Aisling, or .......

I thought Rebecca was involved with the Club; they were the ones behind the Dynasty plot that she helped Salomé to reveal. Why do people think that Club and TDW are the same? DW has clearly said they are different organisations.

DW has also clearly said that he had nothing to do with the Raxxla storyline & he has no idea where or what it is. FD invented the Club and asked him to include it in his FRift storyline, so they had some intentions for that organisation. Whether that is still the case remains open to speculation since we get such veiled hints through Galnet with apparently no confirmatory evidence available to be found in-game.

Come on people, keep it relevant else the moderators will close the thread. If you want to speculate further on FRift and Club generate a new thread for the purpose.

I think TDW come up a lot, and I only bing it up, because potential information about Raxxla would be immensely helpful. And TDW is about the only hope for that beyond the codex.
