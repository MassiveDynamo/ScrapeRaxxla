Come on people, keep it relevant else the moderators will close the thread. If you want to speculate further on FRift and Club generate a new thread for the purpose.

This made me spit my coffee on my keyboard. As crazy as the Mods are around here I doubt that there is one who is crazy enough to try and moderate this thread for subject matter.

Not even the Mad Hatter could wade through this subject matter.

The tinfoil is waist deep at the shallow end. Those who go to the deep end never return.
