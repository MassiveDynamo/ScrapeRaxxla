I was of the mindset that TDW toast was a "map" to where their dark station or Raxxla was located, but what if it's the view from either of those places?

Seems more secretive if it's more of a "you made it!" than a "go here".

But again, without further clues it could be either interpretation.

Guru was back on Twitter, did the CMDR join in the forum again as well?
