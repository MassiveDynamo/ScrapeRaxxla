The Dark Wheel image on page 1...



... looks like a ship, not a station. Compare to this, recently posted images of generation ship Odysseus, orbiting Ross 859 B 1. The thickness of the Dark Wheel "station" ring and structure elements look like the last ring of the ship. And even the star looks similar.

True. And even tho their base is described as a disused starport, Jacques is also a starport but really is also a ship. TDW base could be along the same lines. I doubt it would be this easy, but Jacques was found when someone happened upon a system marked as populated in the Colonia region where no one should have been. And Jacques was also running on low power, albeit unintentionally. Maybe I’ll scan around where we’ve been looking currently, and also the Void region and see if anything pops up.
