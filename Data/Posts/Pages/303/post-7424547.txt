I was of the mindset that TDW toast was a "map" to where their dark station or Raxxla was located, but what if it's the view from either of those places?

Seems more secretive if it's more of a "you made it!" than a "go here".

But again, without further clues it could be either interpretation.

Guru was back on Twitter, did the CMDR join in the forum again as well?

I honestly believe the Dark Wheel toast is just that, a toast. It's meaning to me sounds more like a toast to the explorers who search for Raxxla and the people who have lost loved ones in the search. I think it's just a bit of lore fodder and not much else. They did say that there would be no clues.
