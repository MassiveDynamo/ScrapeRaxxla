Anyone find anything useful by overlapping TDW symbol onto the Raxxla symbol? I tried it but nothing. Even inverting the symbol didn't reveal anything but space madness.

I have not. I still really wonder if overlaying TDW symbol with the galmap, since the center of TDW symbol is the same shape as the Core region of the new GalMap, and other parts of it seem to line up as well. I just donâ€™t have the software to do it myself.
