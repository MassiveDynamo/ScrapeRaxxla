As I mentioned before TDW dont know where it is as finding Raxxla "is their principle aim" -says so in the codex... but they might have a few clues to raxxla if you can prise them out of them..

Want to get their attention? Felicity farseer told us how.. set up a scam organisation claiming to be the DW, and they should come looking for you...

can you still create player minor factions? if not, whats the next best thing..
