Quite off-topic, but waiting for the "last hurrah", I can't pull out of my mind that Generation Ship Thetis which crew went mad when passing near some planet...
Whispers? Siren songs?
Anyone knows if/how much it has been investigated ? I lost the track...

I think a few people searched in vain for the planetary source of the Thetis deadly message. Remember a few posts about it. Might have been in Alien architecture thread. You have tried a forum search havenâ€™t you?
