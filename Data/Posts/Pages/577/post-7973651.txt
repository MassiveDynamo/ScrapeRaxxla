Quite off-topic, but waiting for the "last hurrah", I can't pull out of my mind that Generation Ship Thetis which crew went mad when passing near some planet...
Whispers? Siren songs?
Anyone knows if/how much it has been investigated ? I lost the track...
I spent a day or so looking for the planet, without any joy. I had the same thoughts as you.
