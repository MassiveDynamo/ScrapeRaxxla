Good to hear from you on this Drew, and I agree with what you've said about the need for deeper narrative in the game. ED's depth is what sets it apart. Without the back story and the continued lore, its just a space shoot-em -up.

Maybe FD have done their marketing and truly believe there is more profit to be made from pew-pew than from adventuring. Maybe they are right - the number of people interested in finding R. compared with the number of aspiring gankers... However, if this is FD's thrust, I won't be stumping up for 2020...

That must be why there were 9 or 10 mystery threadnoughts with hundreds of participants while pew-pew is usually whining about this or that feature. Marketing needs to rethink what kind of community ED has me thinks
