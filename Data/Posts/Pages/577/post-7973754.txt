Mysteries have been quite popular. The best pusles in ED, have been those that have a strong meta component. Meaning that solving them requires or greatly benefits from external tools. A large portion of the player base has been quite critical to this approach.

It's hard to make in game pusles, with the same complexity as these meta pusles. If you ad a tool in game, it takes half an hour before everyone know it's use. The UP pusle would have take just a moment to solve, if we had in-game sound visualizers and octal number converters.

This is a hard balancing act for FD.

Personally I don't mind that some things are a bit meta, but it has to be within reasonable limits. FD has so far stuck to the self imposed rule of 'solvable with pen and paper', with the exception of the sonograms. This is of course a truth with limitations. I still can't decode the Morse code, without relying on recording, visualizing and the player made 'alphabet'.

What kind of pusle Raxxla is, is still completely unknown.
