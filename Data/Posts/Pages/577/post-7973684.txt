Good to hear from you on this Drew, and I agree with what you've said about the need for deeper narrative in the game. ED's depth is what sets it apart. Without the back story and the continued lore, its just a space shoot-em -up.

Maybe FD have done their marketing and truly believe there is more profit to be made from pew-pew than from adventuring. Maybe they are right - the number of people interested in finding R. compared with the number of aspiring gankers... However, if this is FD's thrust, I won't be stumping up for 2020...

Nor me. Shame, because no other game has captured and kept my interest for four years, and I would have happily paid for annual updates, but if there is no deeper underlying story that we can interact with & it just reduces down to pewpew with humans or goids or whatever then I wonâ€™t buy the update and will look for an alternative with real exploration possibilities. Looks like a few options might be out later this year or next.
