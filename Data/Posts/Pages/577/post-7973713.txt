That must be why there were 9 or 10 mystery threadnoughts with hundreds of participants while pew-pew is usually whining about this or that feature. Marketing needs to rethink what kind of community ED has me thinks
As a broad, over-generalization, as I see it, there are two fan bases. The traditional gamer who likes pew-pew and the (possibly slightly older on average) fan base, many of whom have been fans since 1984 or 1992 (1992 in my case).

The first set of players is probably larger and is currently very well served.

The second set is probably smaller and increasingly less well served.

Insta-marketing would want to bring in the 1st group of players. Well thought-out, strategic marketing would want to retain the 2nd set, as they are largely more likely to keep playing the game for longer than the 1st set and are likely to buy ALL of the future updates, rather than maybe just 1 initial purchase, or 1 purchase plus 2020, until they move onto the next pew pew game.

Or thats how I see it anyway.
