Quite off-topic, but waiting for the "last hurrah", I can't pull out of my mind that Generation Ship Thetis which crew went mad when passing near some planet...
Whispers? Siren songs?
Anyone knows if/how much it has been investigated ? I lost the track...
I met ship randomly, tried to track that planet back ....and met beacon which sends me to ship So i decided nothing.
