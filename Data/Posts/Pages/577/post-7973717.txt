Maybe FD have done their marketing and truly believe there is more profit to be made from pew-pew than from adventuring.
I suspect there was some disagreement about (how/when/how long) the Raxxla Quest between MB and DB at some point. Or the Quest was so tightly bound to MB's creativity that when he left, that "original" Raxxla did too. Suddenly, we went from dozens of Commanders following a trail spread with breadcrumbs pointing clearly (obviously ?) to The Myth, to nothing at all, for a couple of years until we were the Codex granted.
(I think MB really wanted us to find Raxxla but "some players" (follow my gaze) were coming too close to it and too early in the like of DB or both.)
DW's subtle comment conforts me in what I have been thinking for a couple of years.

You have tried a forum search havenâ€™t you?
Didn't even need to. JulesD gently did it quickly for me !
The path has been searched on April, this year, at least, using the new "Explo" tools. But not sure about their efficiency with some very special surface POIs...
