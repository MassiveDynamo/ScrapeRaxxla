Also known as 42 Alpha Comae Berenices. Diadem is the real name of the star from ancient times.

Named stars without population are plentiful in game. Many have traditional star names, and there are even some that have allegiance and no population, such as Jackson Lighthouse (which appears in an official novel).

Looks like some but not all of the FFE names are in game. Was hoping it explains why only a proportion of the old worlds are in game, but there seem to be no apparent ryhme nor reason to it all.

Welcome to the fray, by the way !
