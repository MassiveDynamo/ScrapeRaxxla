I'm sure I did some as I had access to SD from the start... I wouldn't have been Elite back then tho... Went off to get combat Elite in CZs mainly...
@Emperor So I guess you were a Founder (kickstart backer >£150)?
If so, and are now Elite, have you tried again to get those missions at Jameson's Memorial?

Edit: Kickstarter backers >£85 had access provided to Shinrarta Dezhra from the outset, but only >£150 became "founding members"

Edit2: Just noticed that for the kickstart >£85 the phrasing was "Kickstarter Special: Have the option to start in the founder's world with any starter ship and 4,000 CR". SO the whole system was called "founder's world" at the outset before it was named "Shinrarta Dezhra". So perhaps in the 1.5/2.0 change notes the “Elite/Founder missions are now only available at the Founders World” should actually have said "“Elite/Founder missions are now only available at Shinrarta Dezhra”? i.e. perhaps those missions are still available but from elsehwere in the system??
