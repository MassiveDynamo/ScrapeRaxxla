All correct. The missions left me with a distinct feeling of just being 'regular' missions spread all over the bubble and not just isolated to Shinrarta Dezha, e.g.see Obfuscated In The Outer Rim.
Correct indeed. I remember playing early on and becoming allied with TDW (not Elite at the time in anything, and as a Flounder of the Elite) thinking I would get some 'special missions'. Turns out (as you all probably know) that what this /really/ meant was that you could get higher level missions - in fact - Elite-ranked missions - before getting to Elite. That's how I remember it anyway. I did tip-off missions, 'chained' missions (when they were introduced) thinking that it would lead to something. It never did (RNG hated me?).
