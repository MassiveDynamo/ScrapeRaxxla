It’s interesting isnt it? (Perhaps not?)
The system permit is the “Founders World Permit”, but the planet A4 therein named “Founders World” is inaccessible.
Be that as it may, I’m now working on the hypothesis that the E/F missions may still be available via somewhere in SD other than Jameson Memorial. I’ve checked and there are 6 surface sites in SD that belong to TDW.

Edit: bah, the first two are surface installations, so no missions
And there was I thinking 6 sites maps to the hexagonal logo!

Edit2: but found this for the reason behind the change to E/F missions at Jameson Memorial: Michael Brookes “The Elite and Founder missions are issued by the Pilots Federation which is based at the Founders World.” in response to AndyJ’s question immediately preceding that response.

"Founders are Commanders who backed at the Founders level in the Kickstarter and part of their reward was to be able to access some of these special missions."

"Some of these special missions"... So something different about them and only some of them - there are more?
