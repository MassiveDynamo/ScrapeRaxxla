OK CMDRs,

I've clearly un-lurked!

I have a question: is there anywhere (external links) that details the list of system names in the post 1984 games Frontier: Elite II (1993) and Frontier First Encounters a(1995) that one can look up? Were there many systems? I seem to recall that journey distance was limited because of ship degradation, so perhaps back then the number of 'named' systems was far less than when ED started back in... Well, when the game started

I found this site: - is it valid WRT the system names?

Asking because I played the 8-bit version on the ZX, missed everything else then ultimately played this game, so there are gaps in my knowledge.

All you need for FFE is on Jades page: http://www.jades.org/ffe.htm

System lists here: http://www.jades.org/maps/index.htm

FE2 galaxy is basically the same.

The real systems coordinates in FFE/FE2 are mirrored on the galactic north/south axis(+ - error when importing catalogue data) and rotated to have polaris as north. It's a mess to work with.
