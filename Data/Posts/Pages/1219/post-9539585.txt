Not sure what 'Spansh' means!?

Mmm, OK, so if systems are entered manually, yes I guess there's going to be gaps in the descriptions where they were omitted. Shame. It doesn't look like the Great Raxxla Potato Hunt is capturing such data either.

OK, well what was probably the last 'tiny bit obvious' things for me to check is probably over then. Sticking to just in-game data ideas, I am not sure I can think of anything else to aim for...

What I did find interesting on the front page of this thread where Ascorbius talks about hearing MB say about the 'already visited' status of Raxxla - shame no others can back up the same claim (think it was from Lavecon)!
