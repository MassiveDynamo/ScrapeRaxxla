So sadly, even though the Inara EDSM system data gives the in-game system description, the advanced search doesn't enable us to query systems /only/ with descriptions. Looks like there's an API, so I'll see if we can query based on description. Also took a look at eddb.io and downloaded the systems CSV and populated systems JSON files, again no beans - doesn't look like system descriptions are included.

Again, I don't think there's anything in the system descriptions that will help but I'd love to actually have a read of all bubble-related systems that have some kind of data on them. I am also trying to restrict myself to just in-game data for 'inspiration' (albeit slowly running out).

If anyone knows any other sites that host the data and can filter on description, or have downloads (SQL, CSV, JSON etc.) available, give me a shout. I had a quick look on Alec's best of the forums 3rd party tools, didn't see any other sites that stood out.
