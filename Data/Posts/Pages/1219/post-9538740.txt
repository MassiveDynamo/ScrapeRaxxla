All you need for FFE is on Jades page: http://www.jades.org/ffe.htm

System lists here: http://www.jades.org/maps/index.htm

FE2 galaxy is basically the same.

The real systems coordinates in FFE/FE2 are mirrored on the galactic north/south axis(+ - error when importing catalogue data) and rotated to have polaris as north. It's a mess to work with.
Thanks Han.

OK, that confirms that the system I found wasn't in the original series then.

So, some (any?) of you might be able to help me out. Human systems tend to either have their star cataolgue name OR an in-game designated name, like Rezhas, Lave, etc. That all seems logical from a game perspective.

Yet there are systems out there that have no population, no stations or planetary outposts, or anything of note, yet have a non-catalogue name. Recently I was going from system to system and passed through one named Diadem - a "jewel of a crown". What struck me was that this was the first system that I have knowingly encountered that has a 'strange' system name without any human habitation.

Does anyone know if there are many such systems like this - is this 'normal' - I've not encountered any, which is why the system 'Diadem' stood out to me. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
