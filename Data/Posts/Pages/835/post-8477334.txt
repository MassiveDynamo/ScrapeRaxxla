Had no issue with the debate on if it's real or fake. Only issue (and a big one) was the disrespectful nature of your comments at @Filthymick420 , @Han_Zen and now @Jorki Rasalas . Its these top guys (and a healthy handful of others) who make this thread what it is. Congrats! Earnt yourself another block. Not a great way to "make friends and influence people!"

See Ya !!! lmao

im not here to "make friends and influence people!" im here to find raxxla, is the title of this thread "make friends and influence people!" ? No, its not... bahaha
I have enough real friends, i dont need forum friends, I need facts and fact checking, and if your not willing to discuss that, than good-riddens
