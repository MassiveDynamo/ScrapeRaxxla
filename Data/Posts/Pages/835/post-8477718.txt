Oi, new guy? How's about you pipe down a bit, yeah? These lads have been hunting for Raxxla long before Zeus had grown his beard. We've all seen that screen grab before and as others have already said, it's manipulated. You can chose to believe that it isn't and that's fine. Carry on with that. The rest of us will carry one believing it is. There's been plenty of disagreement in this thread (even some CMDR's claiming that they had found it) but it's always been civil. Let's keep that going, shall we?
