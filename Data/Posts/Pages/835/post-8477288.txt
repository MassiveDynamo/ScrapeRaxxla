Think I’ve done everything I can at Star of India. Tomorrow going to hop along to Alpha Cygni & have a mosey around, see what these anomalies look like from there. The idea of locating them by triangulation seems to be hard work, if not impossible. I’m of the opinion that the star background in the SOI system map bears no relation to what you see out of the cockpit or in the galmap. It seems to be the same in SOI as in Alpha Cent (took a pic of the sysmap there at the start of this investigation). Whether this is true generally, or only for a few defined systems remains TBD; I suspect this could be true as the anomalies have only been reported so far in 3 systems.

Toying with the idea of a short diversion on the way to see SADR & its neighbourhood; not been in this part of the galaxy before-any recommended sights?
