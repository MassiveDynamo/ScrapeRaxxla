lol, it even occurs to me now, that one of you guys could be the original poster of the img to begin with, have found raxxla, and are choosing to spread dis-information about it, lol just like the USA gov does about Area 51 or anything they deem "national security"...

So exactly why would i assume your correct when you say its a hoax img? I shouldnt unless you can show proof, they way any investigation works.

Edit: Ill drop it now, im done....
