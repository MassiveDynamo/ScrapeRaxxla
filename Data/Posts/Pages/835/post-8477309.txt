Goodbye!

BYE! lmao, I dont care how "long youve been around" doesnt make you morally right or factually either.

Also, all ive done since my first post on the topic of these pics, was ask for proof if its real or fake, and all yourself and these others have done is SAY it is fake, not one of you took 60seconds too prove it in any way. Just pointing out that peoples refusal to prove it but instead argue with me for even asking if its real, shows who they are, poeple who ignore facts and legit questions for their own opinions. Basically youre turning this thread into your personal opinions, disregarding anything you personally dislike, regardless of facts, and if that continues, this thread will be usless to find Raxxla becuase it will have most likely ignored needed information or people.

Anyways, ill drop the subject since it seems everyone refuses to address the imgs without an argument because neither side is posting any proof of what they claim to be fact, and im at the point im not going too zoom in for eveyone and prove that the word raxxla has NOT been edited in any obvious way, because i dont have the patience to disprove people who cant or WONT even attempt to back up their assertions that they are right and any other opinion is wrong, its not even worth the effort, ill just disbelieve what they say like they do, and go on with my life.
