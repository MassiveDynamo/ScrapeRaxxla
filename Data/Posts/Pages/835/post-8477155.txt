OK, and this is a leap even considering the topic... Perhaps Raxxla is not the destination but the route, like doing the Kessel run in under 14 parsecs. Maybe the reason the clues never line up is that they aren't meant to be the same place, but rather waypoints, from which the final destination can be inferred?
14 parsecs? Fourteen parsecs???
Millenium Falcon did it in less than 12!!!
