enough with the trolling!
You've said your piece. There is no need to insult people who, frankly, have made significant contributions to this and other threads over several years. Many people here believe the pic you posted is a fake. If you don't then that's up to you, but enough! If you can't be civil then move elsewhere!

Im simply asking for where the fact that is has "clearly been edited" is coming from?
Post a screen shot and prove it, or a link to where in the thread its been de-bunked with proof. dont just go around saying it.

Ill apologize for the Trump comment, "I'm sorry", but people who go around saying somthing becuase they believe it, spreading misinformation without a care, about a game or reality, dont deserve to be treated with respect in my opinon. If its your opinion, say so, as I do, dont go around saying "its fake" "the R isnt right" and thats all there is to it. I can walk around claiming the sky is full of sour jelly candy, but its doesnt make it true just becuase I say so and ive been around a long time. And if its a fact, dont just say so, do as everyone else does, post proof of what you say, or a link too it so we can all learn. Just like I learned from here about a link to a way to triangulate and search edsm, and ive explained to another person about galaxy and consetation names.

And since everyone elses OPINIONS seem to be valid, so are mine. So if you dont like my views or comments, dont comment on them, ignore them, same for everyone who keeps replying to me asking for proof, if you dont want your assertions without facts questioned, dont reply to me or comment on what I say. I have just as much right as any other person to be here, ask my questions, and give my opinions, and if my questions happen to be directed towards attaining proof of other peoples assertions, well, theres no laws against that is there?
