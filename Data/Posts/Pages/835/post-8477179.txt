@RaxxlaHunter I finally made it to IOWHOLZ AA-A H0 and it is certainly a strange system!

What is really odd (buggy?) is that some starts were discovered by PICKER (inc the WR) and others were discovered by DEWIE-54. The only bodies discovered by THE DARK LORD are planets A1 & A2.
Planet A1 is an odd little pink world.

The surface has some geological areas, I had a drive around. Its creepy down there...

...but no hint of anything Raxxlan...

Another bug in the system? is the system maps shows up the brown dwarfs as being T Class???

@Filthymick420 looks like Codex even more bugged than you suggested Sir!
