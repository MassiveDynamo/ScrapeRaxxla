Doh, that’s too obvious!
But the logo can’t be a clue, as you kindly pointed out recently “there will be no clues”!!

I may give that a try, once Ive fitted a new fusion reactor to my ship (new pc psu!) - hopefully arriving tomorrow, if I survive babysitting the 4 & 8 year old grandkids
Honestly, I'm gonna be soooo mad if it turns out that there WAS a clue and that I solved it

I'll probably swing by there tonight, just to see if anything happens.

Fingers crossed your powerplant shows up tomorrow - I know how frustrating waiting for upgrades is
