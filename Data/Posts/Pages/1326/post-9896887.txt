@Jorki Rasalas Thanks for the reply. I do believe it's a real location, but i'm certainly not expecting to find Raxxla there, just a blueish lagrange cloud close to two planets/moons...
@Ataxia I did try some systems via edsm search within some 500+ ly around Sol, all of them had lagrange clouds around their star though, not around a planet or moon...

Now, i did a bit of "mapping" certain star constellations and notable single bright stars in the famous high-resolution wallpaper of the codex entry we all know and love...
And i am currently in the system "Apam Napat", which so far yields the best result of matching the stars/constellations in the skybox with those on the wallpaper... but no stellar phenomenon found :'( There are even a few gas giants with moons around them, some of them even orbiting each other... but nothing...
