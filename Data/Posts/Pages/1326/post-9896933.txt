@Jorki Rasalas Thanks for the reply. I do believe it's a real location, but i'm certainly not expecting to find Raxxla there, just a blueish lagrange cloud close to two planets/moons...
@Ataxia I did try some systems via edsm search within some 500+ ly around Sol, all of them had lagrange clouds around their star though, not around a planet or moon...

Now, i did a bit of "mapping" certain star constellations and notable single bright stars in the famous high-resolution wallpaper of the codex entry we all know and love...
And i am currently in the system "Apam Napat", which so far yields the best result of matching the stars/constellations in the skybox with those on the wallpaper... but no stellar phenomenon found :'( There are even a few gas giants with moons around them, some of them even orbiting each other... but nothing...
Looking at the image again, what if it's from a 3rd moon or planet in a 'trinary' kind of orbit. I know for sure there aren't too many of those around.


Also do you know if it's possible to get an image of the systems in 500ly around sol mapped out to look at? Ugh it's such an easy problem for 3308, but for 21 century fools technology just isn't as... friendly.

I'm on a sojourn out of the bubble at the moment so will work on my list some more when I get back and hopefully I'll have my name on a few new discoveries.
