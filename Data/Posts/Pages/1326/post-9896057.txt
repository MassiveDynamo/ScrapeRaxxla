Talking of Pareco, did anyone try bouncing around the 6 stations in the segmented hex pattern from the Raxxla logo in the Codex?
Maybe that unlocks the center point?
Doh, that’s too obvious!
But the logo can’t be a clue, as you kindly pointed out recently “there will be no clues”!!

I may give that a try, once Ive fitted a new fusion reactor to my ship (new pc psu!) - hopefully arriving tomorrow, if I survive babysitting the 4 & 8 year old grandkids
