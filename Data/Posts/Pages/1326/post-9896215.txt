Sorry to interrupt discussion, just a quick question: Has the "codex/exploration" system, that shows a lagrange cloud in front of 2 celestial bodies, been identified yet?
Not as far as Im aware, but may not be the right thread to ask; might be better in exploration forum.

And may not be a real location. Ever since Guardian bases were found through interpretation of the teaser video FD seem to have avoided giving away anything by visual clues.
Besides...”there will be no clues”
