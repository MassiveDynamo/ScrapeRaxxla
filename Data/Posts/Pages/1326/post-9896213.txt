Honestly, I'm gonna be soooo mad if it turns out that there WAS a clue and that I solved it

I'll probably swing by there tonight, just to see if anything happens.

Fingers crossed your powerplant shows up tomorrow - I know how frustrating waiting for upgrades is
Well, ordered through Amazon & should arrive today. But whether I’m up to installing it after looking after grandkids for 6 hours is another question!

Edt: it’s not an upgrade, it’s a repair. The old psu seems to be dead. Tried disconnecting all the cables and the bent paperclip trick across the 24 way green & black wires, still dead. Some of the mobo is lighting so not totally dead. Suspect a capacitor has died on one of the outputs since I’ve had intermittent restarts for a week or so, most often within a couple of minutes of power up.

Just having a nice calm morning coffee before Hurricane Kids arrive(s)...
Where did I put that valium....
