The closest I ever came to a mis-jump is cutting power either to the FSD or power core during supercruise. It simply isn't possible to do that during a hyperspace jump (a.k.a. "high waking"). Emergency drop from supercruise is a close possible second method and this can be forced. In both "mis-jumps" you come spinning back to real-space and take both hull and module damage.
Close app mid high-wake. Its put me waaay out in a system every time I've done this. Not always in the start or destination system iirc, but it's been 2 yrs since I was trying this so I could be misremembering.
