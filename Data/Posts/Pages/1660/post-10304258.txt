Forgive me as I know most of you have already disregarded my Hoag's Obect speculations (previous iteration) but recent topics has brought it back to my thoughts....


As a lowly console cmdr, I find myself unable to utilize the landscape signal or audio imaging in general. I would however like to for a few things I've been pondering for quite some time but without really know what I should be considering.

If any of you have the time to help with this, I'd greatly appreciate it. I know you all have your own wild geese to chase. I'd imagine the location is easier to pinpoint from Sol(earth), though I'm sure you all have a better idea on that than my own speculation.
