Interesting find
It looks like a pretty normal instrumental track to me, I can't see anything unusual in the spectrogram using any settings where the landscape of D7 anomaly are seen:

This is just a sample but it looks all like this. Pretty normal for this type of music.

What you say about the track titling and apparent lack of in-game application is interesting, and this music certainly is a little bit spooky and mysterious, so if it's intended for Raxxla I won't complain

Is there any Hoag's objects in the? if so I'm happy to record stuff, point me in the right direction
