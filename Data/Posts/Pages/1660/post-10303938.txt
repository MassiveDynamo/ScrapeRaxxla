The name system is secondary, I was just referring to the coordinates that have somehow been measured by players.
The coordinates were reverse-engineered from the name system, essentially.

If you check all the systems in a particular named region ("Blia Aick" or "Wregoe") then they all fall within a defined cube, and by checking enough of them you can narrow down the precise boundaries of the cubic grid this forms.

Assuming this is accurate the corner of the Sol boxel is:
X = -65 offset
Y = -25 offset
Z = 215 offset
(Z=-1065 offset would be slightly more consistent to define Wregoe by its lowest-numbered coordinate consistently)

So if Sol is exactly 49985, 40985, 24105 that means:
(49985 - 65) / 1280 = 39
(40985 - 25) / 1280 = 32
(24105 + 215) / 1280 = 19

This is where my brain starts to implode. Does this mean Sol's "true" coordinates are 39, 32, 19 (?)
Not quite - because you've put the /1280 in, it means that Sol is in the H-class boxel 39 left, 32 up and 19 back from the bottom-left-front corner of the boxel grid.

selbie said:
Is the factor 1280 used to generate a large enough number for greater location precision?
The other way round - the H-class boxels are 1280 LY a side, but the displayed coordinate system measures in LY.
(And the actual coordinate precision of the underlying grid is 1/32 LY)

selbie said:
Perhaps the vector lattice of the coordinates won't allow for systems directly on the boundary or 0,0,0 of a boxel? so they "dislocated" the boxels to keep Sol (ie the point of origin) away from an edge?
This doesn't appear to be the case - Stuemeae GG-Y c1768 has a Y-coordinate of exactly -25, for example.

Even if it was the case, the obvious in-universe dislocation would be to put Sol at the centre of a boxel, rather than arbitrarily off-centre.

selbie said:
Edit: Also does this coordinate offset value relate to the theorized location of the signal? some other clue?
No idea. The vector (65,25,1025) could be used in all sorts of ways, most of which of course are entirely irrelevant even if it does have some meaning.
(Or it could be the offset of SagA* from Stuemeae's corner rather than Sol's offset from Wregoe's corner that's relevant here)

The signal source being intentionally on a (smaller than H-class) boxel corner could be used to give it a definable location given the imprecision of the audio clues. I wasn't able to find any line between two other reasonably nearby systems which goes exactly through that corner, though, so I don't know what you'd do with that information.

It's a curiosity and probably an entirely meaningless one; I've run out of testable ideas for what to do with it in case it had some connection, and I think I've exhausted the most plausible possibilities for "jump through the signal source", so I'll probably be heading elsewhere soon.
