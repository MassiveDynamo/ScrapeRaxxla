If you have an hypothesis you want to explore them go for it, it's a game, a way of (hopefully) pleasurably passing time, so play it like you want.
I was just pointing out a potential flaw in your logic. But MB said only one galaxy was simulated in ED-the Milky Way.
I have a theory you didn't even bother to read it. Only needs to point in the direction to listen you can point your ship at Andromeda and listen. It's in game and is NOT the milky way or part of the milky way.

Pretty sure there are lots of satellite galaxies visible in the skybox.

There are more galaxies than the milky way. You can see them. They don't need to be fully fleshed out coded and accessible.

I really really feel like I stressed that. So, if you're gonna quote me and dismiss my statement, read the statement first.
