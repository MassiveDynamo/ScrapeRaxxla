Well there have been comments from DB and MB on Raxxla being "real" and in game... and of course Drew asked DB directly many years ago... "Frontier know where it is and why nobody has found it", we also "don't know what we are looking for".... and there's also the claim from Acorbius that MB said that someone had visited the system, honked and left.... I've paraphrased but Links on page 1 for you to see/listen to them mention it/answer questions on it...

If these are all true then it's in game, in a system, someone visited it (doesn't rule out it moving, new system permits, etc, etc) and it's probably not obvious if your in that system and easily missed....

I guess we all believe what we want when it comes to Raxxla and it's the one thing that keeps me flying off on wild goose chases from time to time...

So not sure how lying about it would pan out long term.... there could be a feeble story line/unimpressive outcome, but out right lying in public forums wouldn't do their reputation much good.

As for putting something in game for people to find ......there was the Anaconda being used for Drew's story line in the Formadine rift and replacing it with a megaship later when they were added to the game... so even on that score they have form....
