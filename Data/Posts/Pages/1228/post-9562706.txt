My Morse Code is rusty...Perhaps it’s the developers saying “send pizza & beer urgently!”


Edit: a slightly facetious response based on the fact that I’ve given up on EDO. I’m not bothered about walking around surface sites, I found it far too buggy, I got totally exasperated trying to use the laser cutter to get the battery out of the SRV, and my hand problems suggest a controller would be out of the question.

Besides, I dont think Raxxla is in EDO, and apart from the Hesperus storyline, that’s the only thing that still captures my imagination.
