Hi Cmdrs,

OK I’ve had some definitive and much appreciated feedback concerning my enquiry about Polaris, which to my knowledge hasn’t been confirmed before, although I may be wrong.

The permit for the permited system of Polaris is not currently acquirable: “not all permitted systems have a permit” and “Polaris is one of these systems and it is currently not accessible by Cmdrs at this time”. See below.

Although certainly disappointing; because in game there is no indication otherwise, it’s a welcome relief and one mystery we can shelve; and which I suspect is likely linked to the general narrative.

Of course it doesn’t rule out Polaris as the location for either the Dark Wheel or Raxxla, but at least we have a key finding that there is no point chasing down this particular windmill (at least not at this point in time).

My apologies for my scrupulous enquiry but please note my contact with FD was if nothing else, totally polite, honest, to the point and not in the least bit disgruntled; granted however, intentionally written as a loaded question.

I am content to eating my own hat, being proven wrong about my assumption concerning the Polaris availability… a lovely trilby, the same make worn by ‘Miller’ from the Expanse.

My utmost thanks and appreciation Frontier for some welcome feedback, seriously 07.
