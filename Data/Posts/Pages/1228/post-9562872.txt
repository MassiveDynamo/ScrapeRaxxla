Nope they won't. Read "The Dark Wheel" by Robert Holdstock a 48 page short novella which was included with the original Elite versions. Then all I need is to win a 700 million lottery, pay off a lot of Brits and their lawyers and go to Hollywood and make a movie. Then you might get to see Raxxla on the big screen. If it makes millions then MAYBE Frontier will add it to the game. But it is not there for now or so remote 400,000 players have never found it.Why? Maybe it is an invisible planet requiring some hardware module which we don't currently have access to plot a course to it. Real world programming it is not there. Sort of like Thargoids in Frontier: Elite II only present as a graphic on a planetary base. Sorry.

If you owned something like this many years ago playing Pocket PC Elite you were getting close.

Regards
