FD aren't going to give us anything more specific than this line, from the codex: "Raxxla is a definite place, and that it holds a mystical secret"

FD are quite happy to keep it a mystery. Hiding stuff in ED is easy. You could put a decent planet in Sol and no one would find it, as long as it does not scann and has an odd and large orbit.
If it's an asteroid cluster that doesn't scann, it is literally invisible until you get close enough (FD decides what close enough is.)

Non of this takes any programming. It's just settings on a hand placed standard object.
