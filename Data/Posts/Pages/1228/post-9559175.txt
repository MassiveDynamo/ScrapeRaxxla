Hi Cmdrs,

OK I’ve had some definitive feedback concerning my enquiry about Polaris, which to my knowledge hasn’t been confirmed before, although I may be wrong.

The permit locked system of Polaris is “currently not accessible to players at this time”. See below.

Although certainly disappointing, because in game there is no indication otherwise, it’s a welcome relief and one mystery we can shelve; and which I suspect is likely linked to the general narrative.

My sincere apologies if this information has been confirmed in the past. But at least we have an official confirmation.

Of course it doesn’t rule out Polaris as the location of either the Dark Wheel or Raxxla, but at least we have a key finding that there is no point chasing down this particular windmill.

My apologies if my previous post came across too acidic, and please note my contact with FD was if nothing else, totally polite and to the point and not in the least dissatisfied. I am gleefully eating my own hat… a lovely trilby, the same make worn by ‘Miller’ from the Expanse.

My utmost thanks and appreciation Frontier for some welcome feedback, seriously 07.
