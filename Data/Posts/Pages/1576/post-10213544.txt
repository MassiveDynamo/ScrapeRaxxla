‘Incens'd with indignation Satan stood unterrify'd, and like a comet burn'd that fires the length of Ophiuchus huge in th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair shakes pestilence and war’ - John Milton Paradise Lost.

Following on from the identification of ‘Fall’ and ‘Pandemonium’ being in alignment with Demeter and Persephone, the image below shows the constellation Ophiuchus (white) in relation to the fall (set against Yggdrasil for context).

The quote above describes Lucifers decent from heavens stairs (golden chain) through the spheres towards Eden, passing across the constellation Ophiuchus (Interesting side note, it’s believed this was in relation to a real comet viewed during the time of Milton).

The constellation in game, is in my opinion, within such a close correlation with the path of the fall, that this could be intentional, confirming the alignment.

Again if this is correct, this and all the other elements, shows an ‘immense’ level of detail committed to the game. Personally as someone with GIS training, this is not inconceivable, all one needs is a good ‘spreadsheet’.

Again if this is true it’s a work of art - Bravo Michael Brookes, bravo. O7.
Be warned: 36 Ophiuchi is one of those few systems with stations at >4,216,000 LS hauls. Folks, always check your missions for distance at the destination. Holy hell that was a long haul
