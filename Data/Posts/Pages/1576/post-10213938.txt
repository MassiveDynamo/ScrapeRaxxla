that's what I was thinking of. The RX7800XT GPU is out today at around Â£499 (supposedly as Amazon UK still not showing it!).
was thinking I'd run it at low settings to see if I liked it, if not get Steam return, if do then maybe upgrade PC in Black Friday sales....
how did you get it to run?
I'll try again!

nope, just get a dialogue box each time "Graphics card idoes not meet the minimal specifications requirements"

mmm, there was a WIn10 performance update, now installed. Now to check the NVIDIA driver!
