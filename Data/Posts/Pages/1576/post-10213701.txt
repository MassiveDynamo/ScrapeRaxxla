Might be notable as the page from "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" describes the star connected to Kiiry (sirens of deepest void - who happen to look Thargoid) as red to the point of appearing to have the fires of hell. It was notably compared to the Demon Star, Algol.
Wasn't Algol prominently in the Alfred Jeffress Treasure Hunt early on after release? I didn't start until a few years later. Could that whole series have been a Raxxla hint?
