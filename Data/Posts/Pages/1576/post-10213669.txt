Pondering (again) over morning coffee...
Perhaps we should go back to MB’s tattoo, since he never wrote the book it was reputedly to be for then perhaps it was a clue to Raxxla all along? Perhaps we should find the equivalent in-game systems and visit each in turn? The theme was a journey through the underworlds of various mythologies, and these seem to be reflected in @Rochester ’s findings about the in-game Underworld. It would make sense of MB’s phrase “it’s a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves” ( through life to death). A check for a sequence of system visits would be very easy to code, we know that the game stores systems visited and bodies approached in the Journal file, and I think there are around 20 or so possible system suggestions in the tattoo so a pilot would be highly unlikely to make that same journey by random chance.

At the very least another study of the tattoo might be informative (somehow)-we did throw some ideas around in this thread a few years ago (@Scytale was the main proponent) but it didn't seem to get anywhere. There were some potential uncertainties in possible system interpretations and @Rochester ’s knowledge on the various mythologies will be useful. I remember I made a few attempts at that journey myself but maybe I didn't get the right systems? “Fall” might be the start of the journey! The tattoo’s journey ends at the gates to Paradise/Eden, and I suspect (metagaming) that the hour-long trip out to Eden in Alpha Centauri might be a fitting end to the journey and match MB’s sense of humour....make a mistake in the sequence of systems and it would be a lot of wasted time.

Mmm-as well as Paradise Lost should we be looking at Milton’s Paradise Regained? Perhaps the left half of the tattoo is the Loss and the right half is the regaining??

(Perhaps Raxxla is a gold-plated Hutton Mug? ).
