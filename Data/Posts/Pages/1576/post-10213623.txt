36 Ophiuchi is also known as Guniibuu in real-life. It is a red star with 2 companions. Might be notable as the page from "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" describes the star connected to Kiiry (sirens of deepest void - who happen to look Thargoid) as red to the point of appearing to have the fires of hell. It was notably compared to the Demon Star, Algol.

36 Ophiuchi appears to match the amount of bodies in "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide". This legitimately might be the system that contains Raxxla. Well, I guess they weren't kidding about "we know why no one has found it". That's a big damn system.


70 Ophiuchi - no proper name associated
