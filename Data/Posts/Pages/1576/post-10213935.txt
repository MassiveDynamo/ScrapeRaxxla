I promised myself if the game was any good i would finally build a new PC.

It probably isn't the graphics card. The damn thing requires an SSD drive. I have a hybrid SSD with an RTX 2060 gaming pro edition and my build would probably suffer. Besides, I am deeply invested into this Raxxla business so don't think I will be doing Starfield. We may loose some CMDRs temporarily but I suspect they'll be back.
