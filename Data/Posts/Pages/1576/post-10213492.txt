OK, pondered Paradise Lost over lunch. If Adam & Eve are the toast's vagabonds after their expulsion from Eden then perhaps they're yearning to get back to Eden or Paradise? ...
(musing: perhaps Raxxla a wormhole to transport you to Eden in Alpha Centauri ?? It is a long "personal journey"!)

And I read that in PL Satan considered anywhere without the grace of god to be Hell, so wondered if after the expulsion Adam & Eve are in Hell.. so went from Fall to Paradiso and then Hel.

Paradiso is just two stars, nothing to be found (though cannot check for "comets", but Hel is more interesting. Nothing found but there are plenty of unallocated bodyids!

Hel body search
Just a personal aside: Hell is pretty damned subjective concept (e.g. Earth's "twin" Venus vs Soontill 1 and varying cultures interpretation of otherworld, underworld, great beyond, etc). So, one person's Heaven may, in fact, be another's hell. Let's take this a step further. I thought "hell" was the story we were given at the beginning seemingly disconnected from the prior lore. What I uncovered instead made that "hell" look tame and sanitized. The old lore is great deal darker than most realize. Though, I am beginning to at least appreciate the demons that got unearthed during the process.

TL;DR: When is a monster not a monster? When you love it. Pretty much all my preconceived notions have been overturned in this quest seeking the great and mysterious Raxxla. Was it worth the trip through Hell? Yes.

Let me put this way: Raffe Zetter wasn't joking when he said:

Rafe nodded. ‘That’s right, Alex,’ he said softly. ‘You can be deadly, you can be dangerous, and you can end up as pet food in orbit around a dog’s ass-of-a-world like Isveve. But if you’re Elite, and you die, then there’s a reason for your death…’
