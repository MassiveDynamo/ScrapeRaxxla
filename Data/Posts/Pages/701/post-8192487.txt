Have a quick look at the etymology for "gig" and, the related entries: fizgig giglot gigolo whirligig

Do we know if DB / MB have a specific thing for word play like they do audio / number puzzles?

[Edit: If we're lucky there might be some underlying OCD to this. If we can identify that pattern...]
