The further down I go the weirder this stuff gets. Please bare with me as I try to explain. Okay so, I’ll begin with the Alliance Festival. The music portion in Phekda to be precise.

SPOILER: THE TOAST








Phew, what else? None of that’s really “Weird” right? Here goes.

SPOILER: THE OMPHALOS RIFT

Weirder Still!
SPOILER: WEIRD STUFF








Anyways. I’m telling you guys this because I may miss the window and I believe that this may help everyone so why not share (if you do find something let me know at least). Before 12am UTC in the evening sometime. With only a 60 minute window. I think today 13 Dec it might be closed but I could be wrong If so then try again today tomorrow or the next day.

There may be a financial requirement (A lot of luxury items related to this) so there could be a chance that you need to have stuff on you. I’ll update if I find any truth to this.

Thoughts?
