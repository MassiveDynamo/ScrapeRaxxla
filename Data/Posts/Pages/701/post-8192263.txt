Learned a couple things today. Most of note. Neither TDW or Raxxla reside in any of the main 7 stars of the Coronae Borealis constellation (visited a number of stars in between as well on the way)
Second, the bubble isn’t as explored as some may assume. Been flying for the last while with my filters set to non visited stars and economic routes. Just on my trip across and then above the bubble to check this constellation out I found dozens of undiscovered/unmapped planets either in the bubble or close (<50ly) and 2 undiscovered systems in the bubble. Also found an undiscovered civilian outpost (glittering bear. What a name lol).
seems to me there’s lots to find even within and near the bubble. Could well be that TDW or Raxxla yet hide in it.
