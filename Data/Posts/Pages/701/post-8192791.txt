You’re right. The term describes what we’ve been led to believe of Aisling.
I’m convinced now the Lasting Hold does represent Sirius. The “S” Li Yong Rui holds in his hand is probably what this thing looks like. I saw something just like that from Prism but darker and I didn’t think to try to jump in it’s direction. Thought it was a galaxy.

Edit: It would explain his ability to “forecast”. Perhaps they dug up a ship on Lucifer. Reverse engineered it and named it The Antares, the Anti-Lucifer. The antithesis to bringer of light.
Bringer of light is more of a concept. If you look east before dawn while Venus is ahead of the Sun, she is the bringer of light because the Sun rises behind her, when in fact it's the Earth creating an optical illusion. Egypt had a similar concept with the heliacal rising of Sirius around July 19th, the dawn of the Sothic year.

Interesting phenomena, sometimes using the heavens as background, sometimes local bodies instead.
