Did you allow for leap years and seasonal variances due to precession (1 degree every 72 years)?
I didn't. I know it's an acknowledged problem. It's said to annoy Braben quite a bit.

Precession only affects the angle of earths rotational axis. Not the position in orbit and not the position of Polaris.
