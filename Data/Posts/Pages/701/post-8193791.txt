Thought I'd try a Google friendly post:

Q: Has anyone tried to get Allied with all Dark Wheel benevolent mission receivers?
A: Yes
Q: Was a Dark Wheel invitation received?
A: No, not yet

In lieu of the questions above, how about:

Q: Has anyone tried to get Allied with all factions in all systems within a 20Ly range of Shinrarta Dezhra?
A: Yes
Q: Was a Dark Wheel invitation received?
A: No, not yet

Assuming TDW isnâ€™t a fan of the galactic powers, instead of being Allied with the powers has anyone ever become hostile to all the powers?
