It's a highly complex and dynamic system, and the Earth is far from regular in it's orbital positioning...
Not in ED.
It's a simple circular (off center) orbit.

It's just 1286 years in the future. Not much will have happened.
ED also runs on 2014 data for the galaxy. 1286 years of propper motion has not been applied to star positions. It should basically match current data, not future data.
