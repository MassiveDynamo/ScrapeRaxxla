Did a little more checking on the 3D model of the Earth planes.


I put the planes in the corners of the hexagon. The different pole(north) star lines fall into the 'lanes'.
Most interesting was how the Sol - Lave line fits into the third 'lane'.

The viewing direction in this shot is flat in the Galactic plane at 6.55Â° left of Sag A, from Sol. Galactic coordinates: l: 6.55 b: 0.

I've checked it, in game. It lines up in the same way.
I'm sitting at about earth distanse from sol, above what should have been the winter solstice position of earth. Unfortunately the game does not match the calendar, when it comes to earths position. It's about 1/3 of an orbit off.
