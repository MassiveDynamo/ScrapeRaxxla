Have a quick look at the etymology for "gig" and, the related entries: fizgig giglot gigolo whirligig

Do we know if DB / MB have a specific thing for word play like they do audio / number puzzles?

[Edit: If we're lucky there might be some underlying OCD to this. If we can identify that pattern...]
You’re right. The term describes what we’ve been led to believe of Aisling.
I’m convinced now the Lasting Hold does represent Sirius. The “S” Li Yong Rui holds in his hand is probably what this thing looks like. I saw something just like that from Prism but darker and I didn’t think to try to jump in it’s direction. Thought it was a galaxy.

Edit: It would explain his ability to “forecast”. Perhaps they dug up a ship on Lucifer. Reverse engineered it and named it The Antares, the Anti-Lucifer. The antithesis to bringer of light.
