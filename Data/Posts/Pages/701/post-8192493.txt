Just realized, the bands represent different factions. Spectacular Nemesis is Sol. Jade Graceland Empire. Still don’t know what lasting hold is (Sirius?)...Topaz Philharmonic Alliance, then Raxxla. That’s perhaps the order.

I have considered that it could be a ship. Either of the Quest ships or perhaps even the real Antares (Anti-War God). Not sure though.
