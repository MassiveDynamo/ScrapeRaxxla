Thanks for the replies on Witchspace all.

What I was wondering is if the Thargoids are travelling in Dark Matter/Energy, hence why we can’t chase them. Will we one day get the same kind of engine tech reverse engineered so we can travel by Dark Matter/Energy?!

Could Raxxla be a portal to allow us to travel via Dark Matter/Energy....

I find myself pondering all sorts of ideas on Raxxla, I’m somewhat of a lurker to this thread. But I just started thinking about Dark Matter/Energy as a possibility.....

Not sure I'd pin any hopes on dark matter, seems a few are (2019) counter-hypothesising it doesn't exist.
