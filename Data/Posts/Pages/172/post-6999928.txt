Oolite: “Thargoid incursions into the Formidine rift appear to be increasing dramatically.” But, of course, at that time it wasn't any Bovomit nor ED, if I am not incorrect.

Well that would explain some of the tinfoiling. Shame it's not official lore.

Scytale beat me to it. That used to be lore, until it was retconned- I wonder why? Of course the FRift from those early sources was quite close (if I remember) to Riedquat/Reorte......
So, no real source for my hypothesis other than it fits neatly with the way the FRift mystery was set up. And Bovomit is still locked......
