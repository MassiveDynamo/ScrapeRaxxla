Ian Bell co-wrote Elite. He had no involvement in the development of Elite: Dangerous. Given the no-so-friendly relationship that exists between Bell and Braben I'm 100% certain that nothing in Bell's personal wish list is going to have any pertinence to the current game and it's universe.

Thanks for clarifying. I am from "that generation" who were blessed enough to encounter ---- ELITE ---- in its earliest form - when I said co-wrote, I meant the original (although I thiink you probably guessed that).

Good research there, anyway, CMDR Bluecrash.
