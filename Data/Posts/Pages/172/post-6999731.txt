I’ve tended to discount superfast DB as pre-engineers release hype.
The FRift weird lights, suicides and something scary I think was related to an original storyline where the goids were sited in Bovomit, but I think for some reason (unknown) FD changed the storyline & moved them to Col70 region, forgetting that the Cone Sector etc had already had some explorer visits prior to locking them. Might be related to DW’s Dynasty theory being too close to home? I suspect this storyline change resulted in Jaques’ misjump ending up in Colonia...for some reason

Halsey’s “angels” is suspicious and may be related to Raxxla, Thargoids, Guardians, blue fireflies or something yet to be found. As usual there seems to be no opportunity (i.e. insufficient narrative!) to explore this to gain further evidence for theorising.

Jaques’ “singing and then find you” may be related to :
UA/goids (IMHO likely & makes that particular AI something to be monitored closely!),
Raxxla,
or maybe he was found by a Welsh Presbyterian Generation Ship who gave him first aid before being repelled by the alcohol and carried on with their journey.
iechyd da!

edit: @Microsoft - is forcibly insering your windows 10 updates into my nicely working PC taking over 30 minutes??? I want to set off for Colonia!
Edit2: eventually, & this is the update!!! :O

Probably right about the DBX == Engineers thing, but it COULD also be Alien tech discovered by the Dark Wheel via Raxxla

Bovomit Sector being relevant to SOMETHING seems like an article of faith to me - It's over by the Rift, so it MUST be relevant. I've never seen anything that suggests it was in any way related to Thargoids OR the Rift - do you have a source for a link to anything?
