Thanks for clarifying. I am from "that generation" who were blessed enough to encounter ---- ELITE ---- in its earliest form - when I said co-wrote, I meant the original (although I thiink you probably guessed that).

Good research there, anyway, CMDR Bluecrash.

Yes, I figured that is what you meant and only pointed it out as a reason why it is unlikely that anything from Ian Bell's site that isn't contemporary to his partnership with David Braben is likely a non-starter. I'm of the same generation. C64.
