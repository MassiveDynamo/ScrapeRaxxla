Yes, I figured that is what you meant and only pointed it out as a reason why it is unlikely that anything from Ian Bell's site that isn't contemporary to his partnership with David Braben is likely a non-starter. I'm of the same generation. C64.

TBH, I am glad you pointed it out! Last thing we need are some young scamps coming along and creating a completely new tinfoil-saturated theory from it!

Thing I loved about (the original) Elite was that it didn't matter what your version was, they tended to look pretty much the same. I was always jealous of my mates who had C64s - the colours were so much better than the ZX. That didn't matter for Elite though. I still play it occasionally with my old character.
