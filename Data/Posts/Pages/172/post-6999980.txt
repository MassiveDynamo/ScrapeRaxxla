Alternatively, we have a LOT of clues - we just don't recognize them as being associated with Raxxla.

Here's a list of unexplained weirdnesses:

Halsey's disappearance and reappearance babbling about 'angels'
Jaques and the 'singing'
The weird hyperspace lights and suicides in the Exodus logs
The original (there's something scary in the) Rift rumors
Superfast Diamondbacks

These could ALL be phenomena associated with Raxxla, but since they don't explicitly mention it, we discount them as being unrelated.

I'm probably giving FDev way too much credit, but it's nice to speculate.

Aside from Halsey's "Angels" and the Formidine Mystery, i'm unfamiliar with the rest, especially the "Superfast Diamondbacks". Care to explain each to the uninitiated?
