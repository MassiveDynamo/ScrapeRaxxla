Alternatively, we have a LOT of clues - we just don't recognize them as being associated with Raxxla.

Here's a list of unexplained weirdnesses:

Halsey's disappearance and reappearance babbling about 'angels'
Jaques and the 'singing'
The weird hyperspace lights and suicides in the Exodus logs
The original (there's something scary in the) Rift rumors
Superfast Diamondbacks

These could ALL be phenomena associated with Raxxla, but since they don't explicitly mention it, we discount them as being unrelated.

I'm probably giving FDev way too much credit, but it's nice to speculate.

Don't forget Soontil Relics, and the possibility of Soontil as Raxxla and/or early Thargoid civilization, and the old "plague" system Peregrina aka human-Thargoid conspiracy base. Among other stuff that has never adequately been explored/explained in game. Not to mention Polaris. Oh and the Mars alien relic.
