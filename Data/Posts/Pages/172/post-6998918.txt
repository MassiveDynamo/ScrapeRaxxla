Some good tinfoil there. However, Ian Bell's wish list changes over time - so it's unlikely that FD will tie coordinate to a single item on another person's site (even though he co-authored the game). I might be wrong though.

Ian Bell co-wrote Elite. He had no involvement in the development of Elite: Dangerous. Given the no-so-friendly relationship that exists between Bell and Braben I'm 100% certain that nothing in Bell's personal wish list is going to have any pertinence to the current game and it's universe.
