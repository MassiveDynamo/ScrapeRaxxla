Don't forget Soontil Relics, and the possibility of Soontil as Raxxla and/or early Thargoid civilization, and the old "plague" system Peregrina aka human-Thargoid conspiracy base. Among other stuff that has never adequately been explored/explained in game. Not to mention Polaris. Oh and the Mars alien relic.

What's this about a Mars Relic? I've heard of the Butt on Mercury, but no relic.
