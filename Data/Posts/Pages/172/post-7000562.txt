I really love all these myths and lore (as most fellow threaders). But, seriously, if FDevs get overwhelmed by the most simple storylines of their own, we can't ask them so much.

Fair comment, but things we're different when MB was involved - the original Unknown Artifacts puzzles were so much more complex rhan the "Shoot it until something happens" mechanics we have now. Since Raxxla happened on his watch, I still have a little bit of hope left.

And, if nothing else, it gives us something to talk about until we blindly stumble onto Raxxla.
