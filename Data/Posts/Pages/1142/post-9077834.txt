The adamastor was operating under top secrecy protocols.

That’s all that’s need to fully account for the route it took.

Is there more to it? Maybe, but there’s nothing that necessitates there being.
Mmm, you’re more easily satisfied than me mate! I’ve always been a voracious reader, mainly of SciFi and detective thrillers; plots must make sense!
If a ship goes off on a journey she should have a destination (even a woolly one if its an exploration trip!). Sending Adamastor to a LP, fuelled for just that distance, was IMHO very clumsy. FD should understand that in-game events need to make sense (even if it’s not all apparent at the time). If she wasn’t heading for a base beyond the LP then she was just going to an LP to get news that she could have got by staying in Chukchan, so there was no reason for the journey! I’m still convinced I read somewhere that she was heading for a secret base, though that may have been in a Site 23B message-(some of) the group being emergency evacuated to a secret Azimuth Biochemicals base? That could have been in Chukchan I suppose.

I miss MB! Events seemed much more polished in his day, though the occasional coding error crept in (e.g. the inconsistent UA ship diagramming). These illogical plot lines are beginning to spoil the game for me.

Edit: ok, so I’m a lover of Lavian brandy, good wine, dark chocolate AND an obsessive compulsive!
What’s wrong with that?
