My takeaway from the latest Adamastor / Hesperus event is that I can't rely on the FSS scanner showing what is in a system and every detail such as asteroid fields or similar have to be visually inspected. Fair enough, just thinking how much I have crossed off that I now have to go back and reconsider.
