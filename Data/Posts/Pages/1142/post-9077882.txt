Secrets are usually overblown... Its just fun to play with an idea a bit before bringing it to the forums and having it get shot to pieces
My "secret" is very overblown. Assuming it is still there at launch, most people are likely to find it more annoying than helpful in any way.

Just to clarify also, I wasn't trying to speak for anyone, just honouring the wishes of some who asked that alpha stuff not be posted here, while trying to be a tease.
