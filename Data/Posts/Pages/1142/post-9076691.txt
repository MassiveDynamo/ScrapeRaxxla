As for Alpha, it's most likely textures, it's hard to test and replace textures every time.

As for Raxla and the general continuation of the story in the future. I've been thinking a lot about Salome Potter's murder and the accidental uncovering of the 1st Guardian base. And I think that there is no future story, and it is written by the developers only 1 step ahead depending on the actions of the players in the game.
Not so sure about this, Salome Potter (love it lets get it into general use ) was an Author's story and there was a book being written about the events, whichever way they unfolded. It was not a normal Frontier story in any way really. They even washed their hands of it by the end.

And that's a good thing. The game lives and develops, otherwise it would have been passed and abandoned.

this however has almost certainly happened, but to what extent Im not sure and how much has been put back in is another question.
