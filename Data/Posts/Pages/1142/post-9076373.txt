As for Alpha, it's most likely textures, it's hard to test and replace textures every time.

As for Raxla and the general continuation of the story in the future. I've been thinking a lot about Salome Potter's murder and the accidental uncovering of the 1st Guardian base. And I think that there is no future story, and it is written by the developers only 1 step ahead depending on the actions of the players in the game.
