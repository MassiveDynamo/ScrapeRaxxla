As for Alpha, it's most likely textures, it's hard to test and replace textures every time.

As for Raxla and the general continuation of the story in the future. I've been thinking a lot about Salome Potter's murder and the accidental uncovering of the 1st Guardian base. And I think that there is no future story, and it is written by the developers only 1 step ahead depending on the actions of the players in the game.
The Salome thing was lead by Drew, not FD, and he planned for both eventualities.

FD did have something planned for how the Guardian sites would be discovered, but it didn’t happen as they were found via images in the trailer. From what can be pieced together, however, it was the Halsey storyline which was going to lead to the discovery of the Guardian ruins. It seems that it’s the Guardian planets (in their original state) that she had visions of.
