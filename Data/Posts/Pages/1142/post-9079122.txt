My takeaway from the latest Adamastor / Hesperus event is that I can't rely on the FSS scanner showing what is in a system and every detail such as asteroid fields or similar have to be visually inspected. Fair enough, just thinking how much I have crossed off that I now have to go back and reconsider.
I've learned that not much has changed in the three years or so I've been away from the game with regard to how and with whom Frontier communicates with its player base, and that the forum (still) needs a popcorn tag or emoji. Going to be an interesting couple of days till the storm blows over, if it does.
