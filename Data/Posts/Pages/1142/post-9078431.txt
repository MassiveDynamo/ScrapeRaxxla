While they could arguably have just got the destination directly in Chukchan, there’s lots of crew on a megaship, and people talk. Keeping the actual destination secret from the crew until part way into the journey makes a lot of sense - it’s to ensure the actual destination doesn’t get somehow leaked.
The equivalent of the old "sealed orders" that a navy captain could not open to find out what the exact mission is until they were some ways out to sea. Even the captain might not have known until later in the voyage.
