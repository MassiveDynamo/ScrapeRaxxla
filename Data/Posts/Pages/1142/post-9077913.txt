My "secret" is very overblown. Assuming it is still there at launch, most people are likely to find it more annoying than helpful in any way.

Just to clarify also, I wasn't trying to speak for anyone, just honouring the wishes of some who asked that alpha stuff not be posted here, while trying to be a tease.
You just finding Linear Stone Features in the Alpha arent you... but the real question is are they made of FMR, FCR, TMR or FRR ... ?
