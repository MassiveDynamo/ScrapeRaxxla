Here's a brightened and sharpened view of the rear of Aulin Enterprise for those wishing to manipulate the (alleged) Codex Dark Wheel station+star+planet pic for themselves. The aim is to get its colour balance to match the orange of Aulin Enterprise's rear lights.



I got onto this path because I was wondering if the black areas on the Raxxla logo might actually be structure on the DW station. We dont have an example of that now, it's an ancient design, the only example we have is the (alleged ) view of it from the Codex. It's interesting to compare those black areas with Aulin Enterprise above and the (alleged) DW station pic. I dont think the black areas do match up, it seems to me more likely that it's just another Aulin Ent type station.

edit: and its interesting that the DW logo has the same "wings + triangle" symbol at its centre as does the logo for Colonia.
