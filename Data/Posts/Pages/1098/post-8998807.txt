Many moons ago (ha ha) I had found an image of the Pleiades that seemed to match the Thargoid symbol (or one of them, this was pre Codex) also. Basically the symbol seemed to be a reverse image of one of the more gaseous images of the nebula taken from a certain angle. I have no idea where that is now, or which it matched, but will take a look and see if I can find it again and compare it against the one in the codex.
Of course it may be nothing to do with the BLoop. It may be a caste indicator, or rank, or hive membership or age, or lineage, or ....
We need that universal translator machine and ask a friendly Thargoid!!!
