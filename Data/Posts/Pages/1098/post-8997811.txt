I looked at the Codex Map earlier - It is showing a location in the Sanguineous Rim as what you might call the equatorial center and seems to divide the galaxy into 93 slices.... suspicious. Couldnt read everything so some parts are left as dots.

SPOILER: CODEX MAP

Hmmmm wonder if the longitude line on this drawing runs through Chuckchan and the Zero is Barnards Loop... will check tonight
The 0 happens to be where Cone nebula is approximately, also id say the dots are the same numbers as the lines go outwards, the line does not go through chuk also unfortunatly.
