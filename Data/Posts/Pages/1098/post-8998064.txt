I looked at the Codex Map earlier - It is showing a location in the Sanguineous Rim as what you might call the equatorial center and seems to divide the galaxy into 93 slices.... suspicious. Couldnt read everything so some parts are left as dots.

SPOILER: CODEX MAP

Hmmmm wonder if the longitude line on this drawing runs through Chuckchan and the Zero is Barnards Loop... will check tonight
I remember someone claiming that the dot with the circle is an astronomical sign of the sun.
So as far as I know in astronomy there is a division of the universe into four quadrants with the center at .... Sun.
