I took a closer look at the pictures in the Codex yesterday. And I have questions:

2. What are those dots in this picture and in the Raxxla icon in the picture above ? Why are there 3 rings on the galaxy map? (I could be wrong, but I seem to be able to distinguish the usual numbers on the middle row of dots. )
Could this sign just mean a galaxy, like somewhere out there and not a specific place?

I looked at the Codex Map earlier - It is showing a location in the Sanguineous Rim as what you might call the equatorial center and seems to divide the galaxy into 93 slices.... suspicious. Couldnt read everything so some parts are left as dots.

SPOILER: CODEX MAP

Hmmmm wonder if the longitude line on this drawing runs through Chuckchan and the Zero is Barnards Loop... will check tonight
