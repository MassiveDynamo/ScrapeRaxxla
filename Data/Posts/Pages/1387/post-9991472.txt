In terms of astronomical anomalies there is V886 Centauri - the largest diamond in the galaxy. It might fit the "pirate cache" but would be one hell of a treasure. System Description in-game:

This system is centred around a white dwarf which itself is surrounded by the remains of its closest planet that was pulled apart as the star died. The system contains a number of planets - mostly gas giants that support a mixed industrial and refinery economy. A powerful crime family is said to operate within this system.

Article about the system and how it got the nickname of "Lucy" (Beatles reference): Lucy in the Sky

Anton Petrov video on the system:
The Biggest Diamond in the Galaxy

My only concern is while very cool it doesn't fit the rest of the myth unless perhaps the mythical station and/or omphalos rift is in the system given the gas giants. That said, it is a populated Federal system that is a mere 53.98 LY from Sol.

Disclaimer: I have not been there or if I have it was a quick pass because it seemed like nothing at the time.

Clearly, this needs to checked if for nothing else the characteristics of the system.
