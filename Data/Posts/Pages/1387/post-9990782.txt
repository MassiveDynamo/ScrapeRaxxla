There’s a huge flaw!- the hypothesis is based on the premise that the rumour of Raxxla was caused by somebody actually physically discovering it!
Yeah, and like I was saying the Codex comparisons with Atlantis, etc. hint that the rumour didn’t originate with Raxxla’s discovery.

I pointed out a couple of pages ago that IMHO it is more likely that an astronomical anomaly was discovered which gave rise to the rumour. Somebody may later have physically discovered it & perhaps that gave rise to TDW (e.g. legendary explorer Augustus Brenquith, who may have reported the discovery in his message crystal found in Sol). The “Mother Gaia” faction might actually be the “mother of galaxies” and a hint to the Gaia astrometric space telescope which IIRC launched in 2013. Say the anomaly was detected circa 2016, then 2016-2296 is plenty of time for a report of an astronomical anomaly to turn into a rumour. Even without any physical discovery.

Certainly some kind of anomaly could give rise to a rumour. To tie back to current events, what if a Stargoid passed by in those early days of interstellar travel.

For other mechanisms, Halsey and Gan Romero have established ‘visions’, and that’s a plausible source for a rumour of that nature.

There’s the Mars Relic of course, but that was just the first non-human artefact to be found. I don’t think there’s anything to suggest that it was the last found before the modern age.

There’s also the possibility of a transmission being received (the signal encountered by the Tethis being a canonical example), something being passed on from the Mudlarks or another alien species, symbols being found somewhere, etc. etc.

Still, the search has got to start somewhere, and I think the early days of hyperspace travel is worth looking into purely for its own merit regardless.
