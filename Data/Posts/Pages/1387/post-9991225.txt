Weirdly a quick search of EDDB.io has Mimas as existing per public scans but on EDSM does not show it. I would advise DSS scanning the rings themselves. Sol has multiple examples of shepherd moons that are actually in the ring system itself of several planets in Sol.
Aha! I was just looking on it in the galmap! Thanks! Once I've finished killing Azimuth in this CG I'm going to go look at Sol before the Stargoids blow it up
