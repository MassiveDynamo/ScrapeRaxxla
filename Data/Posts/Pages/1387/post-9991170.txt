Since we're talking about early exploration and hyperdrive and it's relation to Raxxla. I think there's something really interesting in the Dark Wheel codex:





The Raxxla codex:



I will assume that the Codex entries are true and I'm reading them at face value for now.

This means that "" a starport disused (for whatever reason), and the early DW started to use it for reasons of secrecy. Also, it continued to operate 'dark' to avoid detection - implying that there was the possibility of others detecting it (deliberately or accidentally).

This is pretty conclusive evidence that (at least) the of Raxxla existed "in the early days of space travel" strongly enough for the Dark Wheel to hunt for it keep an entire wheel-station secret - recall this is several hundred years before civilians had casual access to FTL ships.

Given our discussions of early interstellar travel, I feel like the codex is telling us that the DW wasn't operating that far from Sol, maybe even Sol itself.

Saturn IRL has 8 major moons. Only 6 of them are in Elite Dangerous, does anyone know why Mimas and Hyperion aren't represented? I understand why all the smaller moons and orbital objects aren't, but... I can't figure why not those two??

Weirdly a quick search of EDDB.io has Mimas as existing per public scans but on EDSM does not show it. I would advise DSS scanning the rings themselves. Sol has multiple examples of shepherd moons that are actually in the ring system itself of several planets in Sol.
