That's actually pretty terrifying! (star brighter than the sun) Thanks for that new existential nightmare

I'm be extremely interested in interpretations of Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars. As per my post a while back, I can't help but think it means the Thargoid starmap spiral - but I'd like that not to be the case
I shall detail my current hypotheses in the near future, but want to check a few more systems first & RL is getting in the way.
