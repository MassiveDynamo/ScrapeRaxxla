"Achenar was charted and settled in 2292 by a colonial mission led by Marlin Duval, who sought to establish an independent government outside the rigid bureacracy and social conformity of the Federation."
From Galnet, for info:

“The Achenar system was first colonised in the middle of the 23rd century. It was founded by an expedition led by Marlin Duval, a wealthy woman who had grown disillusioned by the ever increasing rigidity of the Earth governments and stifling social conformity.

Marlin Duval vowed to get as far from Earth as she could, and after a long and treacherous journey across what was then unexplored space, most of the convoy eventually reached the Achenar system.”

So, a 30-40 year discrepancy between the two sources. A possible explanation may be that the spearhead of the expedition arrived in the 2250s and the rest of the convoy then continued to arrive over the subsequent years, with colonisation work underway, culminating with the colony on Capitol being fully established and independent from any need for external support by 2292.

Or one of the sources might just be wrong.
