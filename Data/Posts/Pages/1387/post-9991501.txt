Weirdly a quick search of EDDB.io has Mimas as existing per public scans but on EDSM does not show it. I would advise DSS scanning the rings themselves. Sol has multiple examples of shepherd moons that are actually in the ring system itself of several planets in Sol.
Mimas Orbits closest to Saturn (F ring?) whilst the other missing one Hyerion is near Titan, no idea why they would be missed out.
