Is there a way to get a sol permit without combat. you need fed rank to a certain level. can you do that without ever engaging or killing in combat?!

NVM, looked it up and there are courier missions.

Now the question is, is there a way to get combat rank without killing?! Or the game thinking you killed. Like not giving the final blow. Or getting credit for NPC's in a legitimate way.

Yep. High security areas, stop at Nav Beacons, Res Sites or CZ’s and look for an active fight. Tag the ship with one shot and let the Authorities do the rest. Or just sit in a ship in Multi Crew doing combat and do nothing yourself and you’ll get a cut of the combat pay.
