"Mother of Galaxies" could potentially be interpreted as being Hera (or Juno, in Roman terms), as the Milky Way was said to have come into existence when the infant Heracles (Hercules) was suckled at her breast and then either torn away by Hera or was too enthusiastic and bit her. The resulting spray of milk became the via lactea, or Milky Way Galaxy.

There is no constellation associated with Hera. (Constellations seemed to be reserved for objects and people either killed or "used" by Zeus )
