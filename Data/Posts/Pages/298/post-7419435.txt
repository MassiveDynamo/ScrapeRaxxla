Could be. But Cassiopeia is the mother of Andromeda, which is both a galaxy and a constellation. The only thing that doesn’t fit there (and it may just have been to make the toast sound better) is that it says ‘mother of galaxies’ plural not galactic mother singular. You can see a few galaxies by looking at the constellation but as far as I’m aware only one is named for a child of Cassiopeia.

Spanish ED: madre de las galaxias
French ED : mère de toutes les galaxies (all of them !!)
Portughese ED: mae das galaxias (sorry for the missing tilde)
German ED: Mutter aller Galaxien (all of them !!)'

No Frenchie nor Spaniard nor Potughese nor German would think it refers to Cassiopeia, but to the MW.
Anglocentrism much will not help to find Raxxla... imho.
