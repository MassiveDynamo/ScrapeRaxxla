No Frenchie nor Spaniard would think it refers to Cassiopeia, but to the MW.
Anglocentrism much will not help to find Raxxla... imho.

The MW is Cassiopeia tho yeah? It may not help to think of things only in terms of European terms no, but a lot of the games mysteries seem to be centered on Greek/Roman mythology. And the games devs are British and, whether we mean to or not, we tend to inject our cultural conditioning into our works.

If by MW you mean the shape of the constellation. If you mean Milky Way then yes that’s certainly possible as well, and Hera would be a good place to look.
