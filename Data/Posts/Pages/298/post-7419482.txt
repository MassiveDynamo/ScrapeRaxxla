The MW is Cassiopeia tho yeah? It may not help to think of things only in terms of European terms no, but a lot of the games mysteries seem to be centered on Greek/Roman mythology. And the games devs are British and, whether we mean to or not, we tend to inject our cultural conditioning into our works.

If by MW you mean the shape of the constellation. If you mean Milky Way then yes thatâ€™s certainly possible as well, and Hera would be a good place to look.

If the clues to Raxxla are meant to be understood by the proficient English speakers only, then I agree with you.
If not, that means what that means in every ED localisation. And I repeat, in other languages, nope, it's the MW.
Mother of all galaxies !
