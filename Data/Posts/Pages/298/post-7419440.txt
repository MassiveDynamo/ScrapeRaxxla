As far as TDW goes, the center of their symbol is the same as the shape of the Core region of the galaxy, and other parts seem to match up to the symbol/galactic regions as well. I wonder if a 1/1 overlay would point us to where the three orbs on the symbol might be. Just by eyeballing it (not precise I know) it appears to be The Void.
