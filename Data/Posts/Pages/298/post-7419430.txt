Does not "the mother of all .." mean, also, something like the " largest of all.." in English like in other languages ?
Look at the sky, you'll see the huge MW and then a lot of tiny galaxies.

Could be. But Cassiopeia is the mother of Andromeda, which is both a galaxy and a constellation. The only thing that doesn’t fit there (and it may just have been to make the toast sound better) is that it says ‘mother of galaxies’ plural not galactic mother singular. You can see a few galaxies by looking at the constellation but as far as I’m aware only one is named for a child of Cassiopeia.
