"Mother of Galaxies" could potentially be interpreted as being Hera (or Juno, in Roman terms), as the Milky Way was said to have come into existence when the infant Heracles (Hercules) was suckled at her breast and then either torn away by Hera or was too enthusiastic and bit her. The resulting spray of milk became the via lactea, or Milky Way Galaxy.

There is no constellation associated with Hera. (Constellations seemed to be reserved for objects and people either killed or "used" by Zeus )

You could consider Ananke as the mother of galaxies though (which is a group of asteroids in orbit around Jupiter irl) and given that premise could consider callisto as the 8th moon around Jupiter as a location for TDW.
