You mean the outer rim of Sol system ?

So Tau Ceti was the first system to be colonized.
In Tau Ceti was born the Raxxla myth.
Central circle of Raxxla symbol is like the Sol symbol.
What about exploring the Oort's cloud (The Myth is known to be obfuscated in the outer rim..) in a straight line Sol - Tau Ceti ?
Anyone tried ?

I’ve done it, but only in the direction of Sirius.

It’s not good for the pait job to go out there.
