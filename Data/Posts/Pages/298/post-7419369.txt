Is there a way to get a sol permit without combat. you need fed rank to a certain level. can you do that without ever engaging or killing in combat?!

NVM, looked it up and there are courier missions.

Now the question is, is there a way to get combat rank without killing?! Or the game thinking you killed. Like not giving the final blow. Or getting credit for NPC's in a legitimate way.

BTW, what is the sol symbol being refered to that looks like a circle and dot. Where is it from in game or lore?!
