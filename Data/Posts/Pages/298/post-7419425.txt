I would also have to agree that Astrophil and the Spiriling stars is in reference to a black hole. (Looking at the “eyes to see” part of the entry) In the sonnets they seem to reference, Stella’s eyes are described as both black and bright. And in the end of sonnet 7, we are told why they are so. They’re a trap, used to enhance her beauty to lure men in, ultimately, to their death. Their love of Stella (Asprophil) was the sacrifice, they were a sirens song in a way. And stars do certainly seem to spiral in the warped space around black holes. So it seems the most fitting explanation for that codex entry.
