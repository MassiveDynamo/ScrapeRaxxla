Quite right. It is a nice bit of Fan Art that Drew kindly decided to incorporate into the story of Kahina Loren. Alas, it is only mentioned in text in any official form (either Galnet or Premonition) so the graphical representation remains non-canon.


Yep. The aliens were clever with this one.

That is the one. The Children of Raxxla's logo contains the same visual elements but combined in a slightly different form:


My own avatar ... the Ouroboros circling an unblinking eye ... is an homage to this logo. I chose to replace the Elite emblem and the Pi representation with an eye due to the following image from Steven Eisler's (a.k.a. Robert Holdstock) :


Holdstock's description of the image:

For me that eye, more than anythings else, is the best graphical representation for Raxxla ... though maybe not the Raxxla of the Elite: Dangerous universe. I hold onto due to the connection to Holdstock.

Though there was no confession, I believe we have a suspect.
A wink's as good as a nod,,,,
