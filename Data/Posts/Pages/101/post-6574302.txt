We all know that Raxxla is obfuscated in the outer rim. Don't we ?

That's the assumption ... IF those missions were truly about Raxxla. If we take that as gospel the next question is "what is the outer rim?"

Outer rim of the Galaxy? Outer rim of a wheel? It's obfuscated so don't assume that the meaning of "outer rim" will be obvious.
