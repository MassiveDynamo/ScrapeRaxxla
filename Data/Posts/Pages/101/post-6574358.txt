We all know that Raxxla is obfuscated in the outer rim. Don't we ?

I'll spill one operating theory i'm working on,,,
prob won't pan out,,,
not clever enough,,,
my legs are grizzled,,
my mind is old and bent,

roughly;

What's obfuscated the most from all the rim is the core,
the magic phrase is composed of three lines the first two equal at a 36 character count,
they contain unusual grammar and punctuation.

could be a cipher, the third line the key which appears to be raxxla, it always is

and or galactic coordinates or equatorial coming down to heading and distance

bottom line wondering if it takes the form of some of fdev's other puzzles,
go here, this planet, target this system, fly off in that direction this far,

Hard part of course extracting anything out of the magic phrase,

or some similar version of all that.

Then go back to sucking fumes.
