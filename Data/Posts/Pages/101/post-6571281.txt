This has probably been asked before a while ago but I am curious to see where people currently stand on this.

I am one of those that think that Raxxla would have to be somewhere within 8,000LY from the bubble, just based on old lore history and some comments I've seen about Fdevs expectations of player movements. So I am a bit curious to wonder how many think it has to be beyond that.

I wish I could find it but I seem to remember a speech given by David Braben back around the Kickstarter phase in which he indicated that they didn't expect anyone to reach the center of the Galaxy until a couple of years into the game's active life cycle. I don't think Frontier anticipated that there would be so many players devoted to the effort of honking their way across the galaxy. Based on that premise I highly doubt that Raxxla is a great distance from the Bubble.
