Some additional thoughts regarding Shinrarta Dhezra and the Founders World.

The Founders World is NOT tidally locked but it does have a pretty slow rotation. One day on the Founders World is equal to 42 days on Earth. That's 21 Earth-days spent in perpetual darkness. The population of the entire system is around 85 million. No telling just how many of those 85 million are down on the surface of the Founders World but with such a sparse population there might not be any major cities down there so that might explain that lack of city lights. Need to find an analogous system with a similarly small population and an Earth-like world and see what the city lights look like in that system.
