I like the Egyptian connection. According to The Alien World the pyramids of Egypt were designed by the Oisir-Raxxla as part of their attempt to build the Talmor Lens.

It's a bit fun that Eisler/Holdstock uses the name Oisir-Raxxla.

In an Egyptian mythological context, it's easy to view this as Osiris-Isis or Orion-Sirius, if you will.

This page mainly discusses the old Greek interpretation of the Egyptian Sirius mythology. Lots of juicy stuff:
