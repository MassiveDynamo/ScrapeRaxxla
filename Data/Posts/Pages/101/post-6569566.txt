This has probably been asked before a while ago but I am curious to see where people currently stand on this.

I am one of those that think that Raxxla would have to be somewhere within 8,000LY from the bubble, just based on old lore history and some comments I've seen about Fdevs expectations of player movements. So I am a bit curious to wonder how many think it has to be beyond that.

I'm of the opinion that the alleged "gateway" on (or in orbit around) Raxxla was used by those who found it to return to inhabited space. In game logic, it could be used by future CMDRs to jump anywhere within the Galaxy in one jump (one way). As for how those possible ancient explorers made it to Raxxla in the first place:
1. They went there the long way. Spending months to YEARS traversing the galaxy till they found it.
2. The Dark Wheel (or some other faction) discovered it even earlier and left some hidden, disguised way-points for themselves that lead the way, and were found by some other explorers.
3. Hitchhiked with Friendly Thargoids.
4. Raxxla was A LOT closer once, but has since moved. (possibly from within Lave).
5. Raxxla is [REDACTED], and its location held secret by the still secret and functioning SCP Foundation.
6. other reason.
