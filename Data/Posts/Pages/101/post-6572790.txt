I wish I could find it but I seem to remember a speech given by David Braben back around the Kickstarter phase in which he indicated that they didn't expect anyone to reach the center of the Galaxy until a couple of years into the game's active life cycle. I don't think Frontier anticipated that there would be so many players devoted to the effort of honking their way across the galaxy. Based on that premise I highly doubt that Raxxla is a great distance from the Bubble.

Yup, that's one of the Dev quotes I was thinking off, I'll have to see if I can find it.
