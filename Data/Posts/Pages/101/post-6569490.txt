This has probably been asked before a while ago but I am curious to see where people currently stand on this.

I am one of those that think that Raxxla would have to be somewhere within 8,000LY from the bubble, just based on old lore history and some comments I've seen about Fdevs expectations of player movements. So I am a bit curious to wonder how many think it has to be beyond that.
