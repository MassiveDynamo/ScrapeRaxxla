I'm curious as to who made that map. A lot of those system wouldn't make my list of "The Old Worlds" as they didn't appear in the original Elite.

Really? Surely that disqualifies them. I would have said the "Old Worlds" must by definition have been in the original.

Others conspicuous by there absence like Teorge.

I think if I was going to full-on role play Elite I'd be a Teorge clone.
