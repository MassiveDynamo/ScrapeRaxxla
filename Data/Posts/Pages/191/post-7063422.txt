Raxxla? Where are you? And why is CD-34 9020 the only non-named Old Worlds system?




I made a route on EDSM, maybe we can discover more in these systems about Raxxla. https://www.edsm.net/en/galactic-routes/show/id/1419/name/The+Old+Worlds+Tour

I'm curious as to who made that map. A lot of those system wouldn't make my list of "The Old Worlds" as they didn't appear in the original Elite.
