That's always a possibility. I did a ton of board missions for them to get allied, though, because I hadn't twigged that I could just sell carto data at Neumann Camp, so there is an element of sour grapes if this is how it happens!

I’ve been allied with DW for a while, soon after I got my first Elite, but haven’t really looked for the missions, & was under the impression that they had entirely disappeared until the recent conversation & realised I’d been offered an assassination mission...should have taken it! but wasn’t interested & didn’t read it closely. I just remember being surprised that I was offered it as a follow-on mission after delivering a handful of businessmen 10ly or so for several million Cr.

But how do we know it’s a special mission and not just a BGS mission cropping up for the DW?
