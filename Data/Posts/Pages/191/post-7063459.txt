CMRDs. I know it maybe naive. I know it maybe foolish. I know i maybe utterly wrong. I know it maybe WAY to early to call this. Somebody HAD to have figured this out before.................... I might be on to something. Jaques Station. Gliese 1269. Beagle Point. "A tiny bit obvious".....

I'll work out some waypoints for you if you like like I did for the Wow! signal. It's just trig.

It's a bit of a leap from having a theory about where to look to "I might have found it", btw. We all might have found it on that basis You have certainly proposed a corridor of space just a couple of dozens of thousands of light years long
