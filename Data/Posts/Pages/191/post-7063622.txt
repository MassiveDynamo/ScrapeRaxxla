Very accurate for a sandbox game !

One thought...
I don't have any clue about programming etc... But someone here might have.
DW said (link somewhere here) that he is pretty sure only DB and MB know about R position.
Asking is it possible a game feature quite sophisticated (portal, station/base, hidden faction, etc..) like R is supposed to be, being implemented in the game without the team, or part of it, being aware of its position and whereabouts ? Or it may then just be another uninteresting barren world ...
