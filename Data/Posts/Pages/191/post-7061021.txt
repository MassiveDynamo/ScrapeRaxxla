Following the wetwork mission bug fix a few weeks ago I did about 10 of them in a row for the DW, with no results (was fully-allied with them before starting).

I did notice that there are two types of mission: one type labelled wetwork, another type labelled something else that sometimes mentions wetwork in the mission description.

I'm not sure any of the missions I did were the special ones though, as I wasn't aware of them existing at the time.

I don't think so. I think those are regular procedural BGS faction missions. The DW missions in the OP were hand crafted.
