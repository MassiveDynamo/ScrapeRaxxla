........ i might have found it.

One problem you have is that taking Gleise-Colonia as Jacques *intended* trajectory you go nowhere near Beagle. The line never gets closer than about 24000 ly from BP. I haven't checked for systems at that point but at Y-2000ly below the plane there aren't going to be any. This line drops through the bottom of the galaxy long before getting to the rim.

Jacques is significantly off course where it lies today.

Is there a canonical reason for Jacques malfunction? Sagittarius A seems the most obvious obstacle on a straight run from bubble to Beagle.
