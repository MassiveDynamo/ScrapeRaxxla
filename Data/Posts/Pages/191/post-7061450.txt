But how do we know itâ€™s a special mission and not just a BGS mission cropping up for the DW?

Well we don't / can't, but that's anecdotes for you. Occam's Razor says it was a regular board mission.

One thing we could do is all go and hammer the DW mission board / passenger lounge and try to repeat it.
