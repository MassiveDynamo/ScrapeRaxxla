I left the bubble soon as all these new things started happening. Thargoids, Guardians.. It's not that I wasn't interested, it was all just bit too much. Didn't even visit engineers before leaving. I like simple things, like shooting spaceships in a Gunship, or searching for truth in some nebulae Randomius knows where, but collecting data packages from obelisks, again? The horror. Where's the tinfoil in that.

Quite. The Guardians' puzzle can be cracked in a day. The Formidine Rift took, what? Nearly two years? Even then Drew had to spoon feed us the answers. Raxxla? We may be no closer now then we were when the game went live. It is my sincere hope that, if we find it, we find it through perseverance and hard work. I'll be extremely disappointed if they decide to spoon feed us some easy clues to hurry us along. I'd rather search for fifteen years, find nothing and watch them decomm the game servers first.
