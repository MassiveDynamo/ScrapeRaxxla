Quite. The Guardians' puzzle can be cracked in a day. The Formidine Rift took, what? Nearly two years? Even then Drew had to spoon feed us the answers. Raxxla? We may be no closer now then we were when the game went live. It is my sincere hope that, if we find it, we find it through perseverance and hard work. I'll be extremely disappointed if they decide to spoon feed us some easy clues to hurry us along. I'd rather search for fifteen years, find nothing and watch them decomm the game servers first.

If Raxxla quest is similar to the Rift mYsTeRy, it also can be solved in one day. One precise jump. One POI. Quest solved. SC released. Everything's all right. [big grin]
