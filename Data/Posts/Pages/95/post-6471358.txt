So I'm sitting here doing the thing I do best: obsessing over the quest for Raxxla. I started thinking about Cirag again ... another system that was supposedly hidden from the galactic maps back when Alex Ryder and Elyssia Fields were having their adventures in The Dark Wheel.

I decided to pop the word into Google Translate and let it autodetect what language it was. Google thinks that Cirag in Hindi: चिराग and translates to English as "Lamp" ... which is something we could really use to shine some light on this little mystery.

You could have a look around Jacksons Lighthouse!
