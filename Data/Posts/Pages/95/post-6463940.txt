Totally agree (and also out of Rep).

I kind of look at the evolution of The Dark Wheel as a group as following similar lines as the evolution of many religions. They splinter, split, recombine, merge and go to war against each other and create a constant web of change. The Circle of Independent Elite Pilots was one of these splinters and The Children of Raxxla are one of those groups that merged (though on one of the outer rungs) with TDW. The Dark Wheel is hundreds of years old. Schisms were bound to occur throughout its history as various member's egos clashed while others felt that the group either had the wrong focus or needed to change focus.

It is quite possible that, somewhere, there is a central hub that manages the turn of the wheel and keeps all the various players moving toward a common goal and resolution but many (if not most) of the claimants to The Dark Wheel are likely unaware of each other's existence or, if they do know about each other, consider the others to be "heretics" for not aligning to what they believe to be TDW's core values and mission.

Completely agree. Afraid you’ll still have to make do with some more virtual +rep!

I’d imagine that some of the hub are also inserted into a few of the other groups. Probably not heading them up, but just in positions where they can observe, and if necessary, influence.
