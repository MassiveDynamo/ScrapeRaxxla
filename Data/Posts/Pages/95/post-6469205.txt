What ?
Aren't you right now whirling around the bubble recollecting mats and grinding to get new weapons to pew the Thargs ?
What game are you playing, Doc ? Certainly not FDev's ...

Quite. I have come to realize that I'm playing a totally different game. I've had one peaceful encounter with a Thargoid and, in the account I've been using since around last April, have zero kills. I'm Harmless, Broker and exploration Elite.
Once I get my trade rank to Elite I might think about pulling my trigger at something. Until then ... This game all about Raxxla. Everything else is just a distraction.
