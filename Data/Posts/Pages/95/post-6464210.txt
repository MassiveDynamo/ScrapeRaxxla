You guys, should team up and make another game ED-like with Raxxla, TDW and the Rift as main storyline ( kind of modern and sophisticated Privateer). Success guaranteed. A pity FDevs can't see that.


"the finest trick of the Devil is to persuade you that he does not exist". (Keyser SÃ¶ze paraphrasing Charles Baudelaire) .

If you look at this from FDev's point of view; the "search for Raxxla" is what they want everyone doing not "finding Raxxla" so they can fill the ED galaxy with unrelated meaningless clues getting players to run around in circles for as long as they can. This is where the fun is.
