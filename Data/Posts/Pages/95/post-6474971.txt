I left the bubble soon as all these new things started happening. Thargoids, Guardians.. It's not that I wasn't interested, it was all just bit too much. Didn't even visit engineers before leaving. I like simple things, like shooting spaceships in a Gunship, or searching for truth in some nebulae Randomius knows where, but collecting data packages from obelisks, again? The horror. Where's the tinfoil in that.
