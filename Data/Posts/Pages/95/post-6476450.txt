Quite. The Guardians' puzzle can be cracked in a day. The Formidine Rift took, what? Nearly two years? Even then Drew had to spoon feed us the answers. Raxxla? We may be no closer now then we were when the game went live. It is my sincere hope that, if we find it, we find it through perseverance and hard work. I'll be extremely disappointed if they decide to spoon feed us some easy clues to hurry us along. I'd rather search for fifteen years, find nothing and watch them decomm the game servers first.

I fear that FDev will release "Season X - finding Raxxla", which will spoon feed the clues once they are ready with the implementation of the Raxxla content...
