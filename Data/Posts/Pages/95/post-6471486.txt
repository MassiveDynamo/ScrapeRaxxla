I'm Harmless, Broker and exploration Elite.
Once I get my trade rank to Elite I might think about pulling my trigger at something. Until then ... This game all about Raxxla. Everything else is just a distraction.
Silly, silly me ! Spent weeks, months of tedious play to reach 'Tripple' thinking it was essential for the quest instead of enjoying exploration like our clever Doc !

To find Cirag, I bet you need to be allied with The Bright Wheel first, Doc. [haha]
