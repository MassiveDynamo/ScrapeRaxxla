Well I've been refreshing and the Aide for Future of Arro Naga in SD gives me the same text after a while.

Hmm, unless it's isolated to TDW and Allies (which I doubt), we should be able to prove this easily by anyone allied to another faction in a different system, I suspect these are standard NPC statements when you reach 'Allied' status.

I got these from TDW now at the moment, just have to got back out and in to the Mission screen to have these refresh:




Edited:
Now if these comments are isolated to TDW and Allies, that would be a point worth noting!
Machina and I both duplicated the 'legendary' Aide comment from other factions in other systems, so it appears to be a normal allied status comment.
