Makes me wonder if it's related to not having done anything against the faction. If so that could by why there is a reset commander thing. Which gets into the concept of being reborn potentially to do some things.. Or at least potentially.

Interesting as I believe that mechanic exists in-game. Theres a system that you get the permit by resetting your CQC rank to 0 from 50, or so Ive heard, it may unlock at just level 50. But if reset is required then the game can and does measure at least one rank reset somehow and 'reward' it.

Anyone confirm which version is correct to get the unlock for CQC permit?
