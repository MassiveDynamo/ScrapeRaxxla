Interesting as I believe that mechanic exists in-game. Theres a system that you get the permit by resetting your CQC rank to 0 from 50, or so Ive heard, it may unlock at just level 50. But if reset is required then the game can and does measure at least one rank reset somehow and 'reward' it.

Anyone confirm which version is correct to get the unlock for CQC permit?
One would think if CQC is necessary to unlock anything important in game they would fix the problems in it post haste. Not to mention try to get people to play it in some manner or another. I cant imagine CQC being connected to anything important for these specific reasons but thats just my opinion.
