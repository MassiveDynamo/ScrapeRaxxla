I've just dropped over to Maia, ostensibly to check 5A's colour for TDW station (which is close, but no bodies close enough to generate the picture from the Codex), and so I was having a closer look at nearby bodies.

When I DSS Maia A 6 B (non-landable) I received (4) Notable Human signals? I thought you could only get those from 'landable' bodies?
