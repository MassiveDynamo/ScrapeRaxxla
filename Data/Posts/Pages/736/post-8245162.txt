Ok So ran across this today. ( I know its not a hexagon... but stilll)
Currently has me looking into Veech Surfaces...

There is somewhere a math animation of traveling through Dyson hexagon sphere. With exact number of dashed lines inside.
Posted it some time ago somewhere on the forum. Math rules!
