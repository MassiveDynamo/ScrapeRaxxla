Is saying No to CQC the 1st part of the heroes journey?

Am I the old man who encourages you to join in...am I the 2nd part? Someone could have warned me.

I'm not sure CQC is relevant to Raxxla or DW, but its there and Im a completionist and I cant rule it out and Ill never know if I don't at least try. Not sure the mechanic of resetting and being rewarded (with a sticker) is relevant either, just observing that it is a game mechanic that is used and measured in some way and may be used in some other rank although probably not. Just trying to keep track of what the game measure just in case.
