I think more people would CQC if it was “in game” instead of in the menu.

If competitions were held at different ‘in game’ locations, and you could visit to spectate. They could set up race courses too, around installations like the tutorial, and on the surface.
There could be annual championships. Win trophies, skins, Arx.
