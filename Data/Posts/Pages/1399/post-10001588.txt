To presume that the hexagon eroded over time I think places too much emphasis on FD being 100% scientifically accurate, which is IMPO something it is not.

With respect this is over thinking the problem.

I can’t locate any paper which outlines this as a projected outcome for the absence of the hexagon, but if anyone can please post. I’ll gladly eat my hat.

I too have worked in creative / graphic industries, I agree there is a hexagonal effect, but IMPO this is a ‘graphical’ artifice, not a simulation of a highly complex weather system which has been extrapolated over time to simply fizzle out, if FD are capable of doing that they should be applauded for such an achievement, obviously they have the resources to do it justice.

Does anyone own the Saturn bobble-head in game, how detailed is that too?

Shame we can’t ask Dr Kay Ross.

Lowest common denominator it’s poor design and complacency.
