With respect this is over thinking the problem.

Lowest common denominator itâ€™s poor design and complacency.
I don't agree it's poor design and complacency. If you recall in my Satun post it's very clear FDev worked exceptionally hard to replicate as much as they could of the Saturnian system - just look at the ring comparison, they bascially made an almost 1:1 replica of the rings. They could easily have not done that and just said "it's a thousand years later, the ring structure has changed" - really how many people have compared the rings to Cassini's photos like I did? Probably not many.

Also look at Jupiter's in-game atmosphere. It's a comparatively detailed texture with significant amount of 'depth' illusion:

If Fdev wanted to I'm 100% convinced they could have created a perfect rendition of present-day Saturn's atmosphere, Hexagon and all.

They didn't because it's environmental storytelling. The hexagon - according to present theories - is the result of deep storms (or aliens ). It looks to me like Fdev are showing us "Something happened to Saturn in the last millennia that's altered it's cloud patterns".

@Burning_Scull Excellent! wed defo need more eyes on the Sol system in general. I'd be incredibly excited to see the hexagon of Saturn, I hope you're successful

I'm currently compiling my data on Jupiter and it's moons.
