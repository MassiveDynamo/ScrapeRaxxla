They're taking down the Galnet Archive should we worry about this or ignore it?
On one hand probably not as it’s mostly ‘flavour’, I would imagine it costs a certain amount of coin, so it’s erasure is largely fiscal, my company does the same thing, data costs,

On a larger scale maybe yes as it could identify another narrative shift is coming in game, or a more relaxed attitude towards upkeep, cheaper to destroy than maintain!
