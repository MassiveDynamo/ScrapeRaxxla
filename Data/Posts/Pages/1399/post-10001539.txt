The angle is not very good, but I have marked the sides of the hexagon. This requires checking from a different angle. In all your screenshots, this spot tends to be hexagonal in shape

Thanks! I agree with Rochester, I think this is a result of graphical mapping and effects, I've spent many hours now around Saturn's poles in all light conditions and angles and I don't think this is 'present in game'. I also worked as a graphic designer IRL and I've seen a lot of artefacts from gradients caused by shadows and colour gradients, in short, I think this is a case of apophenia. Although, obviously if you think there's something here then more research is never a bad thing - maybe your own images and post-processing can present a better case?
