The angle is not very good, but I have marked the sides of the hexagon. This requires checking from a different angle. In all your screenshots, this spot tends to be hexagonal in shape

Well spotted, but isn’t this more likely an effect generated by the stellar forge taking short cuts in building cloud patterns and not applying actual more detailed curved lines down to that level of detail.

My math is rusty but a hexagon is the atypical description of a infinite circumstance, eg you use hexagons in graphics to attribute a close proximity of a circle, but not as perfect as our eyes would perceive a natural curved line.

Not wanting to figure out how it’s done I think what we have in game is a compromise. FD taking the easy road.

Then again even though the ‘real’ hexagon isn’t in game, this could be an ironic example of art imitating life!
