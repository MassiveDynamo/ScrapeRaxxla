To presume that the hexagon eroded over time I think places too much emphasis on FD being 100% scientifically accurate, which is IMPO something it is not.

With respect this is over thinking the problem.

I can’t locate any paper which outlines this as a projected outcome for the absence of the hexagon, but if anyone can please post. I’ll gladly eat my hat.

I too have worked in creative / graphic industries, I agree there is a hexagonal effect, but IMPO this is a ‘graphical’ artifice, not a simulation of a highly complex weather system which has been extrapolated over time to simply fizzle out, if FD are capable of doing that they should be applauded for such an achievement, obviously they have the resources to do it justice.

Does anyone own the Saturn bobble-head in game, how detailed is that too?

Shame we can’t ask Dr Kay Ross.

Lowest common denominator it’s poor design and complacency.

Thinking the Hexagon can erode at all is merely a lack of knowledge of how they work and a assumption that the Hexagon is some form of generic storm, it is not and it occurs over and over and over again throughout science, in this case of gas giants you are looking at Rossby wave deformations nothing more. The appearance can come and go in natural cycles the same as it does on elsewhere in nature, from the Quantum scale to Gas giants its pretty standard.

"They didn't because it's environmental storytelling. The hexagon - according to present theories - is the result of deep storms (or aliens ). It looks to me like Fdev are showing us "Something happened to Saturn in the last millennia that's altered it's cloud patterns"."
Incorrect, Rossby Wave Deformations, its incredibly basic science if someones ever told you "Teh Alienz" you should block them as a idiot trying to hinder actual progress.
