Well spotted, but isn’t this more likely an effect generated by the stellar forge taking short cuts in building cloud patterns and not applying actual more detailed curved lines down to that level of detail.

My math is rusty but a hexagon is the atypical description of a infinite circumstance, eg you use hexagons in graphics to attribute a close proximity of a circle, but not as perfect as our eyes would perceive a natural curved line.

Then again even though the ‘real’ hexagon isn’t in game, this could be an ironic example of art imitating life!
As far as we know, all the planets are actually smoothed cubes, respectively, the hexagon cannot be random. From 2000 to the present day, the Saturn storm could naturally blur into this form.
This may be a display error caused by rendering and new lighting. Or as you said, a crutch to create a similar shape.
