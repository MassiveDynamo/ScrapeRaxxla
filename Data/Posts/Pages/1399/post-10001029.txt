Taranis in Celtic mythology, as with Zeus and Donar (Thor) was attributed to the sun; sky and thunder and regarded as a powerful protector of man and leader of the Celtic pantheon, being a sky god Taranis was quick and all powerful, throwing his ‘sun wheel’ or chariot across the sky, eg quick as thunder the voice of lightning.

The sun wheel had various spokes, between four and eight and may have represented the seasons, or the passage of time.

Taranis literally meaning ‘thunder or to thunder’ and likewise is attributed to Oak and Ash trees, it’s open to debate why, but it could be that the Saxons / Norse / Pagans who venerated nature, streams and leafy tree groves, worshipped those types of trees over others because they were older / sturdier and more prone to lightning strikes - connecting them directly to the heavens!

There are no known direct historical links between Donar and Taranis other than the shared association with Jupiter / Jove / Thor, which likely was due to the Romans common practice of appropriation.

Donars Oak….Delphi….?

Any Spiralling Stars / Stargoids on a course to that particular neck of the woods?

More likely FD just mining a common naming library, but odd they would chose a name associated with an all powerful god known for thrashing the opponent and not peaceful in the slightest!
