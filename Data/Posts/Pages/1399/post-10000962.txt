interesting that they have named a UIA as Taranis

I kinda think Tithonus might have been more appropriate
or Eos
a messed up wish turns Tithonus into a cicada
a few references to the wheel the mantis the cicada and bees

or maybe Aristaeus
all his bees were killed because of a mistake.
and some fascinating mythology there...advice from proteus gets him new bees ...


this line is fascinating
'The Kalahari Desert's San people tell of a bee that carried a mantis across a river'

partly finding it interesting because of my thought that some of the Thargoid ships seem to me to be comprised of more than one life form.
mantis in the center control and weapons, cicada on flight control
(just want to add to those that see tiny legs in the canopy, those are the legs/arms of the wings, they extend or retract. look up Cicada)

and bees...reborn bees, black bees.
