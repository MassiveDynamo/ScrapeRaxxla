As I edited my post: they were single Elite afaik, but I suspect the FDevs capable of any perfidy !

Just been looking at the mission descriptions that MacrostheBlack posted on first page. Looks like there are three different types, according to Elite in exploration, trade or combat. Presumably you have to be Friendly/Allied with the DWheel to be able to get them. I'm Elite in Exploration & currently 36%Tycoon working towards Trade, but while I've visited Shinrarta for the engineer and ship equipment I haven't done any missions there yet.
