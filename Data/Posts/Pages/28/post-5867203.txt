If you can decipher MB's mumbling, seems Raxxla (of Elite: Dangerous) would be in the Milky Way. But make your own opinion

Indeed, and he definitely says that but as I was saying, so in high likelihood are the other galaxies of old.

Equally, he might be being tricksy, and it could mean the Milky Way in the old sense of it being a white streaks across the sky (i.e. it might not been in this galaxy, but in another one which is in the direction of the Milky Way when seen from Earth). I think the literal interpretation's probably the correct one though.

Thanks for sharing that stream by the way, lots of interesting stuff in there!
