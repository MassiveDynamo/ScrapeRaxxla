Mind if I ask if you are Triple E ?

I mean, what if people were coming too close to finding Raxxla through these single E missions for the taste of FDEvs and they decided to harden the quest through triple E chained missions? Would be in their style. You follow the 'chain', unlocking systems, receiving new missions, unlocking..regions ! hahahahhaha I bet Raxxla is in Bovomit !

Tripple tripple E, I think.
