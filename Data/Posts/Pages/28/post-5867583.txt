Due to my 'teribble Englich' I am not sure if I understand correctly what MB insinuates in this interview. I mean, would he have used the words "personal journey" if Raxxla was a simple stellar body somewhere fixed, which anybody could jump upon randomly? The following sentence he says then, which I cant understand a single word due to his...gorgeous beard, may also be interesting to analyze.

SPOILER

Also, DB's ...and we know where it is. It is.
Doesn't that overthrow the idea of a 'wandering planet' ?

My excellent British fellow threaders could put me out of doubt....

Thanks for the link, Scytale.

On answering the question "There will be no clues?", Michael answer is interesting: "that is true, I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious, just so people know what they're doing".

The "tiny little bit obvious" part gives me hope that a clue exists that can be picked up by someone smart enough to find it. I'm inclined to vote for Shinrarta Dezhra, "journey of their own" suggests rank, and it is a tiny little bit obvious, since Shinrarta Dezhra is locked to the Elite rank.

More hour long super cruise trips in Shinrarta Dezhra then.
