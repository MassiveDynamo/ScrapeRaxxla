It's been a long time since I've seen the missions mentioned in the OP. As far as I can see there's nothing special about the current missions (all factions) from Jameson Memorial than in any other system/station. Only minor curiosity is that I haven't seen any missions from other systems to Shinrarta Dezhra.

Elite & Founder missions are still on the mission board, they're just 'ordinary' missions.

I can confirm this. Just recently got to Friendly with the Dark Wheel. Have been using both Jameson Memorial and Puleston Arsenal to get missions. Nothing out of the ordinary in the past two weeks.
