I wonder if there are any sectors or systems which are anagrams of raxxla.

System codes only allow us 4 letters due to the format of AA-A An-n

Remove duplicate letters from raxxla though and we get 4. raxl.

Could there be a system called something like Xarxal AX-R L1-10? Don't think so from what i remember of system naming conventions.

Not sure how helpful this could be:

I actually found one - Phooe bRA XX-L A76-0.

There may be a few more, but they are very rare. It may be the only one.

There are plenty of RA XX-L B and RA XX-L C systems, but the A is hard to find.

Edit: It's about 44kly out, but Colonia is half way there.
