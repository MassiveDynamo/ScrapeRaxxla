Thx Scott !
Have a Scotch on me !

Edit: so, it seems we nevertheless have a clue: Raxxla is something physical located in the Milky Way and its finding is not subject to a collective effort.
Unlike the FR mYsTeRy, who is searching matters.


Next step: finding the right quadrant ! :S

And to be sure there aren't no new DW mysterious missions, I am going to achieve this damned triple Elite status and then back to Shinrarta. NPC's beware !

I think you'll soon have more than sufficient NPCs to shake a large Mycoid flask at!

p.s. I'm a Yorkshireman not a Scot, but I'll happily drink a dram of Scotch (single malt!)

were the Dark Wheel SDezhra missions only open to triple elite, or could single elite attempt?
