I feel, like since the game creators first language is English, it should be safe to assume that the way it's written in English is how it should be taken
Oh, yes, am I dumb ? Let just have the others players around the World searching for their own greasy Raxxla wherever they think it may be. Of course. Very FD-esque !
Err.. but what if the translation in other languages was more revealing, specific than in English ??? Naaah.. Can't be. Or... ?

From my understanding on google which I guess the literal translation is The Mother of Galaxies can refer as the Milky Way itself.
Meaning the only Galaxy that bore life.
Besides when looking at the night sky, MW surrounded by trillions of galaxies really looks like their "mother" to me.
