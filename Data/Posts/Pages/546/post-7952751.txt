... make sure to announce where you are going first (so FD can hurry put stuff in there to find ).
This does not work. There's no way that I could have made a louder announcement about the Cassiopeia A expedition (Frontier even published a number of Galnet articles about the event). They knew we were going out looking. We even provided Frontier with a good analog for Cas A located in the right vicinity that they could have just renamed to Cassiopeia A and said, "Good job. We'll take your advice and call this neutron star Cas A."

But no ... the final answer from Michael Brookes was simply that Cassiopeia A doesn't exist in Elite Dangerous. Omitting Sagittarius A* would have been just as egregious!

I'm not bitter or anything.
