About "mother of galaxies", just to remind to our English speakers excellent fellow-threaders that in some other localisation of the game, the wording would be translated as "mother of all the galaxies". Can Cassiopea be called this ? Or shall we remind the many times proven inconsistencies in FD translations, astronomy and story unfolding and say: "meh.. same thing..." ?
( Some other subtle differences in the other verses too. Keywords: корона , cima, etc..)
I feel like, since the game creators first language is English, it should be safe to assume that the way it's written in English is how it should be taken
