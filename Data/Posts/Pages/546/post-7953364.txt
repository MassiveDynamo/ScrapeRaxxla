However her MALE counterpart is far more interesting. The Tellus system has a type L star with 8 moons. The word tellus, telluris is also a Latin common noun for "land, territory; earth," as is terra, "earth, ground". In literary uses, particularly in poetry, it may be ambiguous as to whether the goddess, a personification, or the common noun is meant.
The Greek for Tellus is Gaia and of course, Gaia is known as Mother Earth.
