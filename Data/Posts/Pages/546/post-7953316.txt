So from my understanding of the Constellation Cassiopeia in ED is you should be able to see the Constellations when you Select Sol from the Galaxy Map.

My issue is if we know the main stars that form Cassiopeia. Why is it the constellation line itself not show in ED galaxy map from Sol perspective?
