You are saying they did a "public post" of art, to NOT engage in a question about the posted art? And here I am, engaging with a internet rando about my public post about their public art. It gets pretty Meta ...

Confirmation bias is real.

Edit:

Whenever someone is asked something, they can answer in a few ways

1. Positive/Affirmation
2. Negative/Refutation
3. Does not answer/No data

For some weird reason, you have a leap of logic from "Does not answer" equating to "Positive its related to Raxxla".

Its as if I ask the government "Do aliens exist?" and interpreting their silence as "aliens exist".

There can be many reasons as to why they do not engage.
