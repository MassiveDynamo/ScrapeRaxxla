Tried to search on map "cassiopeiae" - didn't found even "ao cassiopeiae" ...searching "androme" found "andromedae" and "breamen" in loop ...can't see how they can be same...

I wasn't being facetious, be careful over spelling. It may differ in-game from external sources. I just now searched for AO Cass & it took me straight there. It's Alpha Oscar, not Alpha zero. And I don’t think there’s an e at the end in-game.
