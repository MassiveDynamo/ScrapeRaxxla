Guys in my search for Raxxla

Also, the 8th moon story, I think in the game we are NOT having 8 visible moons, but instead is the 8th in the real life. https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Neptune's_moons, Triton is permit blocked, owned by Mother Gaia faction (no way of getting the permit) and is actually the 8th moon of Neptune.

CMDR. Briben source of ideas was maybe (expeculation) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_the_Lifemaker, just a theory haha.
The dates match with elite development time, and they had taloids instead of thargoids. Instead of titan he used triton...

I have to say that not having ANY say from frontier about how to get the permits for Lave moon and Triton is quite disappointing and the reason I'm just firing the game once in a while. At some point there is absolutely nothing else to research towards Raxxla.
