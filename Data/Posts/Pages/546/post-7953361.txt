Tellus, also called Terra Mater, ancient Roman earth goddess. Probably of great antiquity, she was concerned with the productivity of the earth and was later identified with the mother-goddess Cybele. Her temple on the Esquiline Hill dated from about 268 bc. There is a system in game called Cybele. https://eddb.io/system/3936 is the system. There is an Alliance player group based there.
However her MALE counterpart is far more interesting. The Tellus system has a type L star with 8 moons. The word tellus, telluris is also a Latin common noun for "land, territory; earth," as is terra, "earth, ground". In literary uses, particularly in poetry, it may be ambiguous as to whether the goddess, a personification, or the common noun is meant.
