getting caught up on all that I missed is tedious but Im starting to slowly get there. I was passed on a theory by a friend and colleage in Canonn Resarch Group. For now, its just their theory but Im going to look into it and see where it goes. Its interesting enough. If it leads anywhere I'll post what I find here... As to not continue to flood this place with just theories. Which there a lot of!

Good luck commanders, fly safe! o7
