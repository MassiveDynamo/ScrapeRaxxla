Guys in my search for Raxxla

Also, the 8th moon story, I think in the game we are NOT having 8 visible moons, but instead is the 8th in the real life. https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Neptune's_moons, Triton is permit blocked, owned by Mother Gaia faction (no way of getting the permit) and is actually the 8th moon of Neptune.
Spent several hours last week around Calisto, real life 8th moon of Jupiter, based on exactly this idea. Next need to try Saturns 8th moon Enceladus

Edit: may have to do a recount of the moons and try again
