I'm not bitter or anything.

But you made an effort and you got a response.

Not all ideas are matching the Raxxla narrative nor its destined path. But I am pretty sure something in a million will be interesting enough to be related.

And there might even be cases where you go to your announced destination, expecting to find something specific, but the Raxxla clue is something you can't even have imagined to search for. It might be there still, just not the way you expected it to be.

SPOILER: SEARCHING BY IMMERSION


You made a great adventure out of it. That is a path to Raxxla.
