Well, checked all BH in the S171 XX systems in NGC 7822. Nothing to report. A couple were a bit tricky; S171 11 C and S171 36 C were very close to type B companions ( i.e. a couple of Mm) and it got a bit toasty. Also I expected being so close that the companion would visually surround the BH due to the gravitational lensing effect, but I hit the body exclusion zone in both without that happening.

Can't rename ship at Gorgon Research - no livery facilties! Deep Fernweh will have to wait. Might mooch back to the bubble next, but dog requires a walk first...
