Placet is very, very intentional. It got mentioned in an official novel but the specific one escapes me at the moment. I have TONS of notes from the books of places known to be in Elite Dangerous based on clues. It is reasonablely close to the Old Worlds. It seems to have been occupied in the past but sits abandoned. I went there and did an FSS scan when I realized I was nearby not long ago. I had no DSS scanner at the time but bookmarked a number of places if for no other reason than bio-signals. I suspect there may be more to that system. I probably won't make it back there for several weeks. The first two planets are really weirdly named: Placet A and Placet B. The whole system seems weird for it's seemingly emptiness and yet there should have been something there. The same bothers me to no end with Jackson's Lighthouse (which was formerly inhabited but destroyed when the neutron star formed) and HIP 15310 (formerly tourism system with really weird ammonia-oxygen worlds).
