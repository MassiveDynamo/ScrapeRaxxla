I have emailed EDDB for clarification and asked that if possible could they let me know when it was added to the database. Will keep you posted.

Edit - added copy of my email for reference:
Greetings!
The moon Mimas (Sol, Saturn) appears in your lists: https://eddb.io/body/2493462

Yet it doesn't seem to be in-game.

Do you have any information on Mimas in your database that's not shown on the page - the date/time/how it was added?

I'm trying to determine if it's some sort of database error or if it's a hidden moon within the game (for some reason). The size of the body is accurate to the real-world version, but it's lacking some data that would normally be present (mass, materials, etc.)

If you could let me know if Mimas is "real", as in it was actually reported via the automatic tools that link to the game (~EDMC etc), and if possible when it was added to the database, that would be great.

Thanks very much for your time.
Louis.
