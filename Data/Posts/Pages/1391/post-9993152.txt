Sure, but I'm assuming you don't mean the Backrooms and the like? There's a mathematical origin to Liminal places iirc - it means something like "the middle part" where you transition from one place to another place, right?

That's actually a pretty clever interpretation of "place that's not a place"

I was really just joking around with the idea that Mimas is both there and not there (kinda like comets!), it's a place that isn't a place. But actually I like the liminal interpretations better, if not practically then poetically

It's a great example of how you can go down a rabbit hole really quickly!... hmm, rabbit hole... tunnel to other places.... omphalos rift.... maybe that's a clue!! (good natured, joking).

In truth, CMDRs are more or less liminal beings. Powerless and yet powerful almost to god-like proportions. We are exist as vagabonds and vagrants rarely settling to one place. We are both the shepards and wolves of humanity. It truthfully isn't as nutty as it first seems that we and the engineers are The Dark Wheel. I mean it would help to find the station but it would be fine if it doesn't actually exist. We already have the palm tree stations that aren't tourist stations (they are noticably different) and those are scattered all over the Bubble. We have the hermit station (a.k.a. asteroid bases). Duality is often an illusion anyway.

I feel pretty comfortable in stating the letter from a friend came from The Dark Wheel itself in all likelihood. Sometimes looking outside of yourself doesn't work nearly as well as introspection.
