Ever heard of liminal places?
Sure, but I'm assuming you don't mean the Backrooms and the like? There's a mathematical origin to Liminal places iirc - it means something like "the middle part" where you transition from one place to another place, right?

That's actually a pretty clever interpretation of "place that's not a place"

I was really just joking around with the idea that Mimas is both there and not there (kinda like comets!), it's a place that isn't a place. But actually I like the liminal interpretations better, if not practically then poetically

It's a great example of how you can go down a rabbit hole really quickly!... hmm, rabbit hole... tunnel to other places.... omphalos rift.... maybe that's a clue!! (good natured, joking).

EDIT so as not to make a new post: WAIT! the witchspace tunnel is a liminal space, it's a place that's not a place... the Dark Wheel toast mentions the whisper in Witchspace and also didn't they say they'd tweaked the whispers in witchspace in a patch a while back?? You know what, that's actually pretty interesting.
