@Rochester - You did mention that Support message re Trinkets.

@MrSuction - I tried collecting some, even went out to Thor’s Helmet Nebula at one point to get some (then someone mentioned they are frequently found in anarchy systems, just get a ship with reasonable damage resistance, manifest scanner, hatch breaker & collector limpets). I found the most in passenger ships, one Beluga was carrying 100!) . I had up to 7 at various times, tried listening in the hold, tried dropping & listening to them in space, but they made absolutely no sound for me, so I would question what sound settings were being applied! Though I didnt go to Delphi! Milesred’s claims above need to be tested. However I am now far from the bubble. MrSuction-your mission, should you choose to accept it.... this message will not self destruct, there are fire hazards in a spaceship!!

@Rochester - I think many have had lots of fun in chasing down various esoteric avenues in the Quest. As an educational exercise it has value, I’ve certainly explored things that I wouldn't otherwise have, but as a basis for hypotheses about Raxxla I have my doubts, and we’ve seen several instances of mental imbalance when it was taken too far. But IMHO there is an interpretation of the Codex that seems to make sense. Still got a way to go to test my next candidate, but once that’s done I’ll explain. However, I started this journey on Sunday, stopped overnight with a brief continuance Monday (as I said, RL is hectic at present) but on logging into my ship Monday I found the route had expanded-there were 4 extra systems enroute! Deleted the route twice and replanned it! Was there a hiccup in reality Sunday night? Have the incoming Stargoids caused a ripple in the spacetime continuum? Did the invisible Developers (still think they’re really Shadows! ) insert an unscheduled server event??
