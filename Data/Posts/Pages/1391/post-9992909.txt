Exactly I think a lot of us are at the same conclusion.

To delve too deeply into lore, confirmed by Allen to not always be canon; to delve into historical clues, confirmed by FD to be dead ends, leave not a great deal to work with, to delve into literature, is a distraction, albeit a fun an educational one, but ultimately far too wide and thin to present genuine information.

I held off delving into various rabbit holes for some time, for this particular purpose, the information was too thin to warrant it and for myself, became a personal mental exercise, with tongue firmly in cheek when the game itself became rather stale.

In part my own ramblings, are an attempt to rattle the cage of the Codex and test absurd theories because on its own it means little, which I suspect is actually it’s true intent, existing more like grave stones, than mile stones.

To date, I know now from my own Raxxla journey, in my water, the original DW path that set out this thread is effectively dead.

Something is out there for sure, but the DW codex does not point to it, IMPO.

Same with the Raxxla codex, albeit I presume the puzzle was presented half completed for us, we likely already have a location (Delphi) but we are ironically stuck, being far too concerned with our own omphaloskepsis. I strongly feel (in my gut) that it’s next chapter is narratively locked.
