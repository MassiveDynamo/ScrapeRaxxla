I don't remember Mimas ever being in-game.


However, it seems like a lot of effort for little to zero return. Given how The Dark Wheel is described, I would still put their origins in Sol. Whilst Tau Ceti is an option the political idealists that went with Marlin Duval also passed through that system on the way towards Achenar. My instincts say this may be worth checking. Saturn has really complex rings that could easily mask moon(s) and/or hidden stations.
