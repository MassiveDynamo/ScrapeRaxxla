After handing in the black box I was greeted with another message telling me to go to a new location, that the data I had received from scanning the bank had brought up a new ‘mysterious discovery” and sent me 900 light years from the bubble where I discovered a new diamond back explorer but this time it had landed but looks like it ran out of power.
So... i skimmed this bit before... but your statement "After handing in the black box I was greeted with another message..."

Can you detail this a bit more? Specifically:
did you receive a mission when you picked up a black box on Almana?
if not, what do you mean by "handing in"... was it dropped at a search and rescue center?
what did the next message look like? Was it a tip off (as in, was the subject explicitly "TIP OFF" or was it something else? )
900 ly is well away from the bubble... what system was it in, and did a dss scan of the planet show up the site as well?

Just curious about those things because they were mechanics used in a beta a long time ago, but I've never seen them in game since then.
