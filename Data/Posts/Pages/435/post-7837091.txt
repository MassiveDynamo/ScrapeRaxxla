Dear Cmdr Tacticus2711, you provided a marvellous picture of the first DBX of your first tip off-mission and claimed you have found the ship of Cmdr Romero. This was proven wrong by others cmdrs here. So the whole Romero claim should stop here. Am I wrong?
What puzzles me is that you don't kept the data of your second tip off-mission. You didn't shoot another pic? You didn't notice the system's data after travelling 900ly? You don't have anything left in your comm window and haven't done a screeshot of it at least?
Hmmm... Sorry.

Mmmmh... Not really in the spirit of this thread, imho.
Would be a shame if this great thread becomes as toxic as some others.
There is Discord and Reddit for that.
Anyway... Zeitgeist ?

Keep enjoying your search, Tacticus !
