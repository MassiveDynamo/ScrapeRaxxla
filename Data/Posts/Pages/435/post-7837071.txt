Dear Cmdr Tacticus2711,
Keep up the good work. You may notice upon sharing your efforts, however they may turn out, that some Commanders whom haven't appeared to contribute to the hunt(at least since I joined) will begin to throw shade at you. This is to be expected. Please continue your research because, contrary to popular belief, even negative results are positive in trial and error.
Fly Dangerously Commander, o7
100% agree!
