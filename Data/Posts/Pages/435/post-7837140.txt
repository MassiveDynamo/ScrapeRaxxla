Same here. The 2nd had the logs about regret and ruin and a vanishing srv? Sounds mysterious. Did he get picked up by someone? Or abducted?

It's funny how the Gan Romero theories are better here than the Gan Romero thread lol. Those guys are lost hahahaha

Regarding the 'disappearing' SRV:
It's likely that Tacticus simply reached the edge of the map object. The Exodus bases all showed massive SRV activity around the buildings, with established tracks leading through entry 'gates', all of which either faded out or terminated. IIRC some commanders followed the indicated directions for long distances without ever finding anything.

It's possible that it's more significant in this case, but FDev have a habit of adding cosmetic touches that are suggestive, but which aren't followed through.
