Dear Cmdr Tacticus2711, you provided a marvellous picture of the first DBX of your first tip off-mission and claimed you have found the ship of Cmdr Romero. This was proven wrong by others cmdrs here. So the whole Romero claim should stop here. Am I wrong?
What puzzles me is that you don't kept the data of your second tip off-mission. You didn't shoot another pic? You didn't notice the system's data after travelling 900ly? You don't have anything left in your comm window and haven't done a screeshot of it at least?
Hmmm... Sorry.
While the first DBX most certainly isn't Romero's what is interesting is the information from the ship's logs. Some of the descriptions in the logs have similarities to some of what we know about Romero's motivation as well as to some of the things experienced by Jasmina Halsey. And, perhaps more to the point, seem to point toward a certain degree of fenwah that led those poor ships to their doom.
