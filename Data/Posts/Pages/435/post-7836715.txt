Well I handed in the black box at the nearest search and rescue, then received another tip off mission worded similarly to the one previously, both missions has the message ‘tip off’ as there title. DDS didn’t work so I had to use the planetary coordinations to find the exact location of the ship
Interesting. Never heard of search and rescue submissions causing tip offs.

Have a few backed up... might investigate.
