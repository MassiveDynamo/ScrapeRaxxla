Regarding the 'disappearing' SRV:
It's likely that Tacticus simply reached the edge of the map object. The Exodus bases all showed massive SRV activity around the buildings, with established tracks leading through entry 'gates', all of which either faded out or terminated. IIRC some commanders followed the indicated directions for long distances without ever finding anything.

It's possible that it's more significant in this case, but FDev have a habit of adding cosmetic touches that are suggestive, but which aren't followed through.
Regardless if he tracks lead anywhere, I think the data point is the most interesting thing, coupled with the distance from the bubble. Its about the distance that FDev seem to like to place important things, think Guardian sites, etc....
