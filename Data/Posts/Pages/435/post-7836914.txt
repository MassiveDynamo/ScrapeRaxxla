Well I handed in the black box at the nearest search and rescue, then received another tip off mission worded similarly to the one previously, both missions has the message ‘tip off’ as there title. DDS didn’t work so I had to use the planetary coordinations to find the exact location of the ship
Dear Cmdr Tacticus2711, you provided a marvellous picture of the first DBX of your first tip off-mission and claimed you have found the ship of Cmdr Romero. This was proven wrong by others cmdrs here. So the whole Romero claim should stop here. Am I wrong?
What puzzles me is that you don't kept the data of your second tip off-mission. You didn't shoot another pic? You didn't notice the system's data after travelling 900ly? You don't have anything left in your comm window and haven't done a screeshot of it at least?
Hmmm... Sorry.
