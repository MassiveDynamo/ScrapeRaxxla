going through GCSE’s at the moment so I’m restricting my play. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Best of luck with your exams, cmdr. Restricting play is very sensible under the circumstances.

Also, please don't feel like you're under any pressure to put revision / exam preparation to one side to respond to things on here. Though given that, do also try to avoid posting 'I found it! (But no further info.)' type things - it'll just get a barrage of questions and you'll end up looking like a hoaxer if you don't respond. It's better to wait until you've got time to do a fuller post. We're all generally patient, and would probably prefer the fuller post anyway (though I can't speak for everyone on that).

Ultimately, Raxxla will wait, the exams won't.

(I'm not just saying that in an off-hand manner either. The quest has been going on for a very long time. Putting it aside for a month or so is going to be fine. )

Best of luck again!
