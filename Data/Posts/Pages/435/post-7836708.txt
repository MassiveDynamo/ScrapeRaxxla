So... i skimmed this bit before... but your statement "After handing in the black box I was greeted with another message..."

Can you detail this a bit more? Specifically:
did you receive a mission when you picked up a black box on Almana?
if not, what do you mean by "handing in"... was it dropped at a search and rescue center?
what did the next message look like? Was it a tip off (as in, was the subject explicitly "TIP OFF" or was it something else? )
900 ly is well away from the bubble... what system was it in, and did a dss scan of the planet show up the site as well?
Just curious about those things because they were mechanics used in a beta a long time ago, but I've never seen them in game since then.

Well I handed in the black box at the nearest search and rescue, then received another tip off mission worded similarly to the one previously, both missions has the message ‘tip off’ as there title. DDS didn’t work so I had to use the planetary coordinations to find the exact location of the ship
