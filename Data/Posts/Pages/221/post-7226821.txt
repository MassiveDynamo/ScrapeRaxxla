yes, he needs to speak to Jaiotu about Cass A, but since the Dark Wheel “lost” Raxxla & don’t know where it is then I think their toast is unlikely to reveal its location

Indeed but I got to thinking, FD seed clues within the game in this fashion - maybe its a red herring maybe not.

Dark Wheel missions could have disappeared because they related to the Guardians / Thargoids and not Raxxla and someone jumped foward in the narrative with the Unknown Thargoid probes - who knows twis probably just bugged.

Or maybe we were getting too close too soon so they pulled them (most likely). My hunch (and it is just that) is Dark Wheel missions may well pop back to life in regards to the Codex.

FD seed Galnet with clues simular to the toast. The Codex to me is FDs attempt to seed more clues and move things along quicker. They also have a habit of giving us hard nudges from time to time. Maybe - just maybe the toast is such a nudge.
