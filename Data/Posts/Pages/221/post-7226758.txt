1. Mission Report

a)Prism: Found nothing special / passed all plnetary bodies in approx. 45 ls distance, no findings / iirc the Nameplate on Hiram's Anchorage wasn't lighte, guess this doesn't count as a darkened station. Guess I'll scrape prims off my
list.

b) Shibboleth: Went there nothing special / discontinued search will return.

2. Some thoughts on Jorkis idea concerning the start screen: As ist seems the possible target system does never move. Concerning Astrophel and Stella I thought about another unmoving star - Stella Maris, a.ka. the Virgin Star, a.k.a. Polaris our little permit locked system. Did anyone ever try out whether becoming allied with TDW at Founders World unlocks this system? On second thought the poem Verse 22 speaks of "In highest way of heavâ€™n the Sun did ride,". the highest way of heaven of course is south, so this could be a refference to Stella Asutralis (non permit locked). Haven't tried anyone of both alternatives yet, but thought I might add some tinfoil brew.
