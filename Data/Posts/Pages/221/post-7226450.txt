Side note, but has Founders World always been devoid of infrastructure/city lights? I don't know if I've ever noticed before, but most ELWs I've visited in inhabited systems had signs of cities. Founders World doesn't.

Probably always been the case, but I've never noticed it before.

Always been like that.

I guess the inhabitants hate light pollution.
