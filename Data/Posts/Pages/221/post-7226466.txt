yes, he needs to speak to Jaiotu about Cass A, but since the Dark Wheel “lost” Raxxla & don’t know where it is then I think their toast is unlikely to reveal its location

i beg to differ, this map on my toast this morning clearly shows where Raxxla is, just need to overlay EDs galaxy and wham.. there it is.

Rochester and Jaiotu
