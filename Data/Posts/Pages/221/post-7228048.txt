That gives me an idea. Pretend you are at raxxla. Where would you not be? Reverse the thinking...

Rebuy Prospect... but I docked there last night, and I'm sure I didn't see Raxxla.

Oh, and Jorki... while I haven't found your view yet, the last few systems I visited last night there was some serious dust. I'm not sure if it is just a bug, but the Witchhead nebula was not visible. Barnard and Rigel were, and I couldn't find anything on galmap that might obscure my view. Even relogged and went further in. supercruise.
