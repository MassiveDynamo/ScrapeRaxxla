Jaiotu will probably remember the details, but I seem to remember that Michael Brookes said Cass A wasn’t in game for a very mundane reason- think it wasn’t in the star catalogues they used to build the galaxy?

why TDW lost Raxxla is indeed a mystery. Perhaps there’s a mindwiping energy field there?
oh no, if I find it I’ll forget everything!
hang on, who are you?
who am I?

Sorry all. Been on a bit of a break. Yes, Mr. Brookes stated that Cas A was not in the data they used to generate the Galaxy. Still seems like a heck of an omission.
