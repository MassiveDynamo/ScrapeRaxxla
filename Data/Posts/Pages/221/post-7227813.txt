I guess it’s no longer canon, but according toHoldstock wasn’t Raxxla inhabited by a group of twisted elites, the Dark Wheel? In which case they had to know its location!

Not exactly. The twisted men that Rafe mentioned were never identified as being members of The Dark Wheel. The Dark Wheel were looking for Raxxla knowing full well that it had already been located and inhabited by someone else (The Club?).
