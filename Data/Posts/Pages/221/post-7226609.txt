Side note, but has Founders World always been devoid of infrastructure/city lights? I don't know if I've ever noticed before, but most ELWs I've visited in inhabited systems had signs of cities. Founders World doesn't.

No city lights because no cities. Only a couple of "Soylent Green" underground factories.
