There are multiple references to thunder gods in the game. There are references to princess being rescued from dragon…the heros quest…. And references to the celestial axis.

All of these can be related to the early myths involving (usually a thunder god) fighting a dragon/serpent. Sometimes related to a world axis, often the snake is a”world” snake … later the gods are replaced with larger than life Heros and the snake is guarding some kind of boon or treasure…

Ya this is the kind of stuff Holdstock enjoyed - especially in his Mythagos. The Arthur legends have alot of that - and when i think of Art Tornquist i think of Holdstocks Ragthorn …
