Searching those 3 systems in game brings up a peculiar coincidence - all 3 are in close proximity to a nebula - the Seagull, the Crescent, and Iris nebulae.
Seagull Sector - Hell Port is technically "south-southeast" of Achenar, but that's a stretch considering they likely mean downward below the galactic plane.

Another thought: the name Beaumont derived from French means "Beautiful Mountain" so perhaps that could refine the names to look for.

Many roid stations were actually implemented in game in nebula intentionally by FD to aid exploration.
