Does the reference to Beaumont identify a location in game, there ought to be enough information in its description to illicit some perimeters? I believe we have investigated this hypothesis previously, but it was long before my Lost Realms discovery… I think it might have legs…the area of the Lost Realms has a high concentration of systems all named after ‘Otherworlds’, and it’s in the same vicinity of Brookes Tours and a system named after ‘the Guardian of the Eastern Gate’, this area is generally my alternate go-to in opposition to the Miltonian model… I wonder if it still holds some unknown mysteries?

Looking for a system far below Achenar.

A populated system.

A mining base in an ~500ls from a populated planet.

Yep, there are a few interestingly named candidates.
Hell Port
Medusa's Rock
but then Iris Vacations stands out the most - it is exactly on 2AU at 499ls.
