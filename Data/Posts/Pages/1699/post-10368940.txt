Art's name can be interpreted as a double meaning for a "bad thorned room" - aka. a prison.
I think that is stretch. Tornqvist or Törnqvist / Törnkvist as it is usually written in Swedish is a single word, describing a single object. A twig with thorns.

A kvist is also a structure on a house, like this:


Where a one or several vertical windows are placed on a slanted roof and merged in with it's own roof and walls. This increases the usable are of the room under the roof and improves light conditions.

If you where in that part of the house you could say you are in the kvist, but technically the kvist is not the room. It's the structure.
