The Arthurian link is not lost on me either. It is evident from Holdstocks text here that he is drawing upon his own mythology, that of talk of ‘Otherworlds’, ‘Edens’ and yes too ‘King Arthur’.

Lest we forgot of the Lost Realms in game, and the various systems named after Avalon and so forth.

The Lost Realms of Robert Holdstock

The Lost Realms zone has more to it then simply being an Easter Egg, this Holdstock reference is reflected within the Codex.

So the question is, do these potential clues point someplace else or something specific, or is their purpose simply reiterating what the Codex already alludes and their intent is to emphasise the Lost Realms?
