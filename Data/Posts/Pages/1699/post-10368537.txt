Searching those 3 systems in game brings up a peculiar coincidence - all 3 are in close proximity to a nebula - the Seagull, the Crescent, and Iris nebulae.
Seagull Sector - Hell Port is technically "south-southeast" of Achenar, but that's a stretch considering they likely mean downward below the galactic plane.

Another thought: the name Beaumont derived from French means "Beautiful Mountain" so perhaps that could refine the names to look for.
