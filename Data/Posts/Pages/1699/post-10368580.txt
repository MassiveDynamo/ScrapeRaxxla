As for mountains or hills, I can create a string of grade AA tinfoil with some kind of mountain (or hill) in it:

0) Codex points to Tau Ceti
1) Tau Ceti points to Pink Floyd
2) Pink Floyd provides a tenuous connection to the song "Vagabond Ways" by Marianne Faithfull
3) Which provides another tenuous connection to a station with an odd name "Marianne's Journey to Arcadia" in system LTT 606
4) Which happens to orbit a planet with an odd name "Moel Lefn"
5) "Moel Lefn" could be translated as "smooth hill"
6) The "smooth hill" might point toward Barnard's Loop
7) Barnard's Loop looks like an eye with a brow
8) When viewed from LTT 606, the Lost Jewel of Orion (Hatysa / 44 Iota Orionis) could be considered to be on that brow.
9) Also in that general direction is PMD2009-48 which mentions the "golden chain".
10) A golden spiral would match "golden chain" and "spiralling stars"
11) The vector between LTT 606 and 44 Iota Orionis has got some funny prime factors:
2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 | 5 x 7 x 7 x 89 | 3 x 20333
12) The prime factors 89 and 233 appear quite often in the coordinates of a golden spiral
