Just to emphasize that when I mentioned the engineer's bases being visible for you only after receiving information about it or getting invited is a way of pointing out that the same game mechanics may also be applicable to the hidden Dark Wheel Station, which we won't get any signal source to lock-to-drop until someone actually finds it (then shares its location) or gets a formal in-game invitation...
