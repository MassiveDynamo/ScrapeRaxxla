Why not?

I wouldn't say I believe this but I certainly wouldn't rule it out whatsoever. Think about some of the engineers. We have a Jameson, a Ryder, Felicity Farseer. I would assume it's obvious that Liz Ryder is a member. I also wouldn't bat an eyelash to find out Lori Jameson was a member too and Farseer definitely knows something she isn't telling. Not to mention the rest. They are all essentially the best of the best at what they do.

But I think ruling something out completely without verifiable proof of the contrary is a very bad idea
Maybe "believe" TDW would simply just be more engineers was the wrong word - "hope not" perhaps?

I could see some (or even all) of them being TDW members, but I really hope that TDW as an organisation/station etc just doesn't turn out to be more engineers that unlock each other along the way. Because that would suck.
