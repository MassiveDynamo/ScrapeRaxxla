Why not?

I wouldn't say I believe this but I certainly wouldn't rule it out whatsoever. Think about some of the engineers. We have a Jameson, a Ryder, Felicity Farseer. I would assume it's obvious that Liz Ryder is a member. I also wouldn't bat an eyelash to find out Lori Jameson was a member too and Farseer definitely knows something she isn't telling. Not to mention the rest. They are all essentially the best of the best at what they do.

But I think ruling something out completely without verifiable proof of the contrary is a very bad idea
I know what you mean. But I think because of the translation you didn't quite understand me.
About engineers I wrote in the sense that above was suggested the idea that you can not find a station without getting an invitation ...
That the engineers (some of them) can be members of the Dark Wheel is a good idea. But I say that even if it is true, we will not get direct evidence of it ! Otherwise the mystery of the Dark Wheel will be known all over the Internet.
