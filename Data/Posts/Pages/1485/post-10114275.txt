There is a permit locked system attributable to CQC but that is just ‘an award’ it unlocks some module or other, cant say I’m bothered to look it up. I do recall some implication lore-wise that CQC might be linked to military subscription?!

But to my knowledge that was not openly advertised as such…it might have originated via Braben, so take that with a huge lump of industrial salt.

CQC is (was) in its true nature, an attempt by FD to entice the console market to buy into ED, by trying to corner the ‘quck-play-kill’ twitch market (ahem Odyssey). So much so they threw in a real-world cash prize at launch.

The DLC was obviously too costly to just drop when it didn’t go as intended (!) so like everything else in ED it got incorporated.. then we get a new Elite rank, again as a bait-switch tactic, again to entice those ‘completionists’ to engage with it.

I would be rather annoyed if it was a progress gate to Raxxla. I highly doubt it, if Elite is required to unlock Raxxla then it’s more practical to utilise only 1 rank, as it’s against FD own ethos of ‘blaze your own trail’…
