Just to add wasnt it implied in 'Reclamation' that mind transfer was possible when the pirate queen (sorry forgot her name and the books on a shelf in the other room!) wanted Salome's body?

Consciousness transfer was heavily implied very early on in ED, I feel it’s just narrative foreshadowing.

Pranayama Antal and Utopias Sim-Archive ambition was to digitize the human consciousness and thereby transcend our physical selves.

I recall at the time wondering what the point of all this was - then much later we see the Guardian network, now Salvation etc… it’s a narrative arc to prepare the reader for this fork in the narrative.

The lights in the witch space references, the dreams of caretakers etc and the electrical anomalies found in deep space Lagrange clouds, might all be interconnected and represent the ‘physical’ appearance of a digital sentient race upon our limited dimension of comprehension.

It’s possible old Salvation will herald in a new chapter of the narrative where he either intentionally or unintentionally alerts said entities to our existence… a little like an ant colony suddenly able to operate light switches and cook breakfast…

Is it about Raxxla? I doubt it, but I imagine we’ll start to see a new entity enter the narrative ‘Soon TM’… the Thargoids are looking for something… maybe this might culminate in a Raxxla hunt… who knows?
