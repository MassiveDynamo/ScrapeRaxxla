Not so long ago I wrote somewhere on the forum that ED is the most peaceful game because it is impossible to kill anyone.
Destroy his ship, he will pay the insurance and fly on ...
Read Pranav Antal's Codex. It heavily implied consciousness transfer to a clone and similar cases for CMDRs in the case of Rescue Rangers and your CMDR's body being horribly mangled. Salvation isn't the only one that uses this. Also, Pilot's Federation and Universal Cartographics codex implies we depend on something very similar if not identical to the Monolith Network.
