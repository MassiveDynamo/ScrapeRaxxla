I hope Cmdrs aren’t clones, oh how original (Eve), I hope Cmdrs (and galaxy) aren’t part of some Matrix VR reality, again how original (NMS)… be better ED!

Personally I feel it lessens the whole endeavour, why explore if we’re clones, just send a telepresence probe; why fight or kill or defend or explore, if it’s not actually real (in the not real real sense).

I think there is enough in the lore to hint that this is not applicable, but…it’s the easy way out.

Ultimately I don’t think these apply in the bigger picture, I suspect it’s just background flavouring.
