The lights in the witch space references, the dreams of caretakers etc and the electrical anomalies found in deep space Lagrange clouds, might all be interconnected and represent the ‘physical’ appearance of a digital sentient race upon our limited dimension of comprehension.
This is heavily covered in Tour of the Universe by Robert Holdstock and Malcolm Edwards. It released before the first game, has a map of the Galactic Cooperative with the 3 major stargates (there are multiple sub-branches from these with one lurking in Sol), features travel to other galaxies, and time travel. I don't remember if consciousness uploads were part of it.
