I don't see it mentioned much here, but some commanders are publishing their findings in Inara Logbooks.
See for instance CMDR VClara & her researches on Guardians. https://inara.cz/elite/cmdr-logbook/396397/
I'm sure others exists on TDW or Raxxla (and I don't talk about my own ramblings!)
I don't use Inara but its good to talk
