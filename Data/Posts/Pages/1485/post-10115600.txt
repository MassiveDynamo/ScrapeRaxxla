I don't see it mentioned much here, but some commanders are publishing their findings in Inara Logbooks.
See for instance CMDR VClara & her researches on Guardians. https://inara.cz/elite/cmdr-logbook/396397/
I'm sure others exists on TDW or Raxxla (and I don't talk about my own ramblings!)
Clara was also posting in the Guardians thread
Guardians Discussions
Pretty sure Ram Tah mentioned some of our current ship tech was better than theirs. Despite them having 8,000 years of space travel. I'd have to search for it, but 80% positive on that. Also is reckon I'd be easier to get information across faster than it is to get a spaceship to move faster.
