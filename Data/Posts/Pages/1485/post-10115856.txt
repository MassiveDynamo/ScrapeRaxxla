CMDR VClara has extensive documented her work on YouTube at https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIAU1J4knQGgU3sADsAaXkztBSQ36ubtO . She is part of the Independent Raxxla Hunters discord (invite link: https://discord.gg/r4WGd85r )*. I'll be honest, the reason why so few of us are in Canonn Science is were made feel unwelcome based on how much the Raxxla search must be based on consequences of it being found.

* - Not my discord but very active there.
