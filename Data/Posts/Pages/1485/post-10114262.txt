If i remember CQC was only in Premonition as a back story for one of the characters (Raan?), Elite rank, even single, is always described as a bit of a god like status.
By the way not only that CQC ranking is only in the main game, if I'm not mistaken CQC Elite gives access to somewhere in the main game.
