P.S. By the way do you know in which world the AI can be banned?
I thought every single superpower banned AI? Also, looking more deeply into Achilles Corporation and they appear to have started in Alioth but have been relocated to Thule at present. The Alliance had quite the robust robotics industry then found reason work with Walden during last 35 years of his reign (or at least it was strongly implied by Drew Wager and Allen Stroud) to retool to genetics, cloning, and similar technologies. Then there's that beacon in Facece implying the same thing:

"Military Base Established" at Peter's Wreck:
In 3104 a permanent military training base was established on Peter's Wreck in the Facece system. Facece had always been known for its strong support and commitment to training the Empire's finest, but the dedicated base signalled a new fervour for military renewal. This renewal was tested when in 3114, the scientists of Nesbitt Landing in Alioth began demonstrating substantial innovations in robotic manufacture and production.
