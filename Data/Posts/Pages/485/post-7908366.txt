Interesting theory. Your a good detective as well. Examine the crime scene and the likely suspects.

The Raxxlan Robot looks like the "Borg". I pointed out in earlier threads that the Raxxla symbol looks like the symbols we use for radiation warnings.

But none of this will help us with the location of Raxxla, what it may be, or whether it is a trap.
Along similar lines I've been looking into phenomena (mathematical mostly) that could help explain Raxxla.

What I was looking for.
SPOILER







So, Raxxla is a hidden Einstein-Rosen bridgelike thing with multiple entranceways/exits! Specifically the bridge itself. Neither the entrance, nor the exit. In between two points in space in time exists Raxxla.

However, this isn't the same as Witchspace. Nor is it what we see between jumps. It's its own thing.

Sadly, this doesn't narrow down our search much. We'd be looking for a wormhole entryway which would look like a massive (or not?) black hole with a toroidal singularity (or so states a possibly outdated theory on wormholes)...

Also, wormholes connect only two places in spacetime. However the theory behind wormholes could be bent quite a bit by a imaginative writer.
