Mmmhh... it seems that red dot "not visited" thing doesn't take account of visited systems prior to some patch.. I have a lot of them on systems I discovered, tagged and sold the data. I assume that red/blue dot patch wasn't retroactive.

SNIPPED

Doesn't explain the bookmark thing, though, but it must be related.
Anyway, a not very reliable feature for old Explorers... cough..

did you perhaps play beta and these are systems you visited then that were not deleted on going to the released version?

As well as the bookmark issue, if galmap is also not reporting previously visited systems then you should most definitely raise a bug report!
Sounds like your database has become corrupted somehow.
