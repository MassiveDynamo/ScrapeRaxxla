This makes some sense, especially considering that Vega is a previous and future pole star, from Earth.
That would imply that the mention of Princess Astrophel and the Spiralling Stars in the Codex is just to get us to recognise the significance of Vega and that analysis of the poem itself is not relevant to the Quest for Raxxla.

If the above is true, then there are two systems that have a clear significance to the Quest. Tau Ceti, where the first recorded mention of Raxxla originated, and now Vega. Are there any others? If not, is there anything en route between them? If there is, do they form a pattern (not in-game to answer this this evening)?
I think the Dark Wheel toast may have a different reference point.
I have some tests to do, to confirmed that this isnâ€™t pure nonsence.
If there is something to this, the two lines should cross somwhere.
