If I were a betting man I'd put my money on that theory. In fact ... I have a very specific theory on that.

Spiraling stars: Point a camera at Polaris and leave it on time lapse. What do you get?
SPOILER

Polaris, which is permit locked in Elite: Dangerous, played a key role in Frontier First Encounters (aka Elite: 3) in regards to the Thargoid story. When the player encounters the Thargoids at Polaris they use some kind of technology to create a portal to send the player a great distance away to the Thargoid homeworld. This portal is the closest thing in any of the Elite games that ever came close to matching the description Rafe Zetter gave of Raxxla. So, from my perspective, the key to finding Raxxla is unlocking Polaris.

Not only does that look like somewhere you'd hear the whisperer in witchspace, I'd bet if you tilted the view toward Zeta Cass, the circles might look a bit more spiral-ier
