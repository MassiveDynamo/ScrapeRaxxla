Saw a post a few back that reminded me of 'Spiraling Stars' and it got me thinking; maybe they're referencing a Spiral Galaxy. After all, that would mean trillions of Stars, spiraling around a central point.
Also, anyone think that Thargoid ships look very similar to pin-wheels?

(Please note, I'm just piecing together parts of the last 10 pages or so, so this might be a bit tinfoil hat-esque. All if not most of the points to follow are from their respective wikipedia pages).

Pinwheel Galaxy - Wikipedia
en.m.wikipedia.org

The Pinwheel Galaxy is part of the constellation Ursa Major, (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major) and one of the brighter Stars in said constellation is Alioth. Also in the constellation, the two supposed brightest Stars, are Dubhe and Merak which can be used as a navigational pointer towards another Star previously mentioned in this thread: Polaris (similar to the Thargoid Probe and Sensor pointing to an unknown system) This Star is a part of the constellation Ursa Minor. Ursa Major is noted to have over 20 Stars with planets.

Ursa Minor (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Minor), the beholder of Polaris, has two Stars called 'The Guardians of The Pole Star'. These are Kochab and Pherkad. Taking the 'Pole Star' to be Polaris this would again be eerily similar to the Thargoid Probe and Sensor pointing to an unknown system with Polaris being involved somehow. Ursa Minor is noted to have only four Stars with planets.

Might be worth checking out if it hasn't already been done.

There are several other Spiral Galaxies mentioned online, but the pinwheel caught my attention because of Thargoid ship structure similarities to a 'pinwheel'.

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
