Edit: That is, if I manage to hit anything with these fixed weapons.

I've started another approach to finding Raxxla. If it is in the game... then someone must of made it right? Let's look at their lead technical artists "Max Centra" to be specific, and his finest work, around the time Elite was released... that he cannot talk about because of NDA. I present to you the exploding Raxxlan robotics. I suspect the green cylinders in the back of the robots head are the bombs the lore talks about. If so, the Raxxla symbol is a warning sign. Raxxla is a trap.
