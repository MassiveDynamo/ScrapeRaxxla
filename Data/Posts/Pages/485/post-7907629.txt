Mmmhh... it seems that red dot "not visited" thing doesn't take account of visited systems prior to some patch.. I have a lot of them on systems I discovered, tagged and sold the data. I assume that red/blue dot patch wasn't retroactive.
SPOILER

Doesn't explain the bookmark thing, though, but it must be related.
Anyway, a not very reliable feature for old Explorers... cough..
