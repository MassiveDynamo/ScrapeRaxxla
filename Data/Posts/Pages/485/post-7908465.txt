Haven't tried to jump through the Maia system BH, but did play with the lensing effect on nearby Nebulas to see if anything would be unveiled.

Same result, everytime, unfortunately.

I'd give it a go, but I'm about 3-4hrs travel time from the bubble ATM.
I visited the bh in maia yesterday - nothing of special interest.
