@GURU-951 All good mate, no need to apologise, this is a free space for any discussion.

I was recently in Ithaca system but never looked around Dahan. There was something curious about Ithaca besides the obvious ties to Odyssey (which I personally prefer over Iliad) that I could not put my finger on. Probably nothing but it is bookmarked as a favourite system in my list, definitely going to poke around there a bit more when I have time. Let’s just hope it doesn’t take me as long as it took Odysseus to get back

As a side note, whilst looking into Dahan I found an old newsletter that mentioned the system. This same newsletter has some interesting information about The Pilots Federation. It specifically states that The Dark Wheel is a “clique” of the Pilots Federation, which is probably old news for some of you guys. I had heard this before but had never found anything official that said as much until just now.
