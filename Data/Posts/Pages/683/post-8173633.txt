Spent a bit of time messing around Pluto again, but as I am I’m currently in an unarmed paper thin exploration Asp (Triffidus Celestus) I don’t really have the means to hack the Delphi Control Chapter. I must remember to bring the Python (Aurelia) out next time, when I have a day off work next maybe.

Dropped in to New Horizons this evening, so cool! I have been meaning to visit it and also the two Voyager probes, never got around to it before and since I was in Sol I figured it is as good a time as any.

Have to finish up for the night but trying to decide which direction to cruise in from Pluto after I am done sight seeing. Any suggestions?

Edit: I am leaning towards Tau Ceti but I can’t recall if anyone has tried heading that way from Sol yet?
