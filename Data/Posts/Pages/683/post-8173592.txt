Text from BluWolve link above. So good Ive copied it here, to me it clears up what DB was talking about in that video from some pages back where he mentioned the 'defaced' British Standard flag. Also puts the DW where I thought they were, separate group inside the PF & the EPF. EPF are described as having FW 'run exclusively for the benefit of their members' which links in to the old lore about a group finding and exploiting Raxxla for their own ends and the DW rising to try and stop them. (hence the killing of Alex father and the rest, I think they just tied the 2 lores together and moved Raxxla, unless it is in FW somehow which I doubt) If true it could mean the DW in FW is trying to oppose the EPF and overthrow them somehow....its a long shot.

SPOILER: PF TEXT




















But why is TDW “infamous”? The codex description of them doesn’t give that impression. I think FD have confused themselves in retconning the lore; they’ve certainly confused me!
