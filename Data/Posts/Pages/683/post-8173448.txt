You're deep in the rabbit-hole there Guruâ€¦.leave some breadcrumbs back to reality just in case

Been wondering, if I was DB or MB and I was placing Raxxla in the game in the first place...would I place it somewhere specific with lore meaning or would I just let It be generated randomly somewhere and then know where it is?

If lore related would I just set a distance say 1KLY radius and put it in there? How much would I 'bend' the lore as was...near Soontil for example not near Lave?

I think we have all the in-game mechanics needed and can work out how the DW contacts us....if they do or have yet or if they are waiting for a certain date is debateable.....and hopefully how to find Raxxla when we are in system if we can get into the system.
