But why is TDW “infamous”? The codex description of them doesn’t give that impression. I think FD have confused themselves in retconning the lore; they’ve certainly confused me!
Just speculating here, but it could be that since the Codex is created by the PF, they could paint TDW in a favourable light if it suited them. Especially if TDW is really part of the PF.

Is there any mention of the EFP in the codex at all? The EFP sound like they are more secretive than TDW which is interesting in my opinion. The only mention of them in game I know of is from Tourist Beacons.

Edit: Could it be possible that TDW minor faction we have in game is a smokescreen created by the PF, designed to throw people of the trail of the real Dark Wheel, aka the EFP?

Or, The actual Dark Wheel is known these days as the Pilots Federation, with the Circle of Independent Elite Pilots now being the known as Elite Federation of Pilots?

Or am I over thinking and over complicating? Probably...

Head spinning trying to wrap my head around the ifs and buts, gotta give this some more thought.
