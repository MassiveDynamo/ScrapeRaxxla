Yes of course but that would take an extremely long time. Weeks, months even. This is why we are trying to utilise potential clues to help direct our searches.

For example, some of us have been recently looking at the Dark Wheel’s (Alleged) toast;

“To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies!

To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void!

The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts.

To Raxxla!”

We have put together a hypothesis that is as follows;

SPOILER: SOL HYPOTHESIS









Now Raxxla may not be at the end of the path. The interpretation of the clues could be wrong as there are other potential interpretations (I have been looking into Pluto as a matter of fact, more on that later). The Toast itself could even be a red herring that serves no purpose but to send us on a wild goose chase.

But hey, regardless of the outcome, trying to puzzle it all out by researching these things and discussing them is a lot of fun and we get to learn a lot along the way.
