it does appear that there is no reference to jason ryder as having flown a cobra when supposedly discovering raxxla, or that he even did discover raxxla rather than just be the only named canonical member of the dark wheel (at least used to be canon)... Though this book that features all this talk has a cobra on the cover, so readers may have assumed that the go-to ship when venturing out into the unknown would be a cobra ...and that's what would have been flown when discovering raxxla. But yea, looks like mixing stories.

the last thing mentioned above about raxxla not being part of the current biggest discovery may have to do with refuting the other ex-canon book that mentioned that raxxla was instead Soontil and it's just been exaggerated and changed via word of mouth retellings. It's a shame this is not what is actually being acknowledged by fdev as it would make the most sense and be the most believable option.
