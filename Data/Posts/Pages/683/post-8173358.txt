They just pop up randomly right? Nothing to note with the offering faction or anything? Seems like a weird place to get a mission. Even though it is likely completely random it would be nice if it were a covert initiation mission of some kind for TDW. However a massacre of helpless civilians doesn’t seem like something one would have to do to prove their integrity or skills.

I agree, massacre & assassination missions don’t fit their description in the codex. Yes, these missions are random after you’ve been in-system for about 30 minutes or more; as is the mission-related uss/trading beacon. Had two of those pop up when I was more than 0.75 ly out from Sol. Just reduces the immersion for me...

I was pushing Hutton Orbital Truckers in Alpha Centauri, and the mission giver woman said something like” blah blah...We hope one day you will come to share our values”, which seems like a possible clue. However I may have backed the wrong horse since I didn’t get any likely test offered (other than the strangely bugged “recover structural regulators” missions. I’m wondering if it is Eden etc, whether TDW is one of the other factions there, or whether there is another possible interpretation of the toast. If the Sol hypothesis is correct then might be that the Triton permit is preventing us from finding Raxxla?
