the unmodified cobra thing is under the assumption that it was placed in a system that corresponds to the lore of the actual original discoverer. since that was the type of ship he flew.

However, since we dont know the means of what makes it so hard to find compared to everything else. .. and that misjumps are a thing but not in the game. It could be that the orginal discovery was made via a misjump and thus, once he made it out back to civilized space, he was unable to figure out just which system he was in...maybe due to a navigation computer error. As opposed to just willingly keeping it secret and never telling anyone. So it could be further than an unmodified cobra ... The cobra thing is fan theory.
