Thank you for your reply.
But I didn't mean a specific thing, but a way to achieve it.
The translation must have distorted everything.
For example, this is a portal, I am a newcomer to play a little, I go to the wiki, read that this portal is there, and fly there. Finish.
And then I think about what this entry in the codex ?
By understanding this we can get closer to the solution!
But my point is it is (hopefully) not finished just by finding it, if it opens up other game content, that may be ermergent and ever-changing in itself. Or, if as Darth Ender pointed out, the location constantly shifts as well every time someone finds it/accesses that content. I'm trusting (perhaps foolishly) that FD are smart enough not to make it a one-off after the Formidine Rift, etc., and likely have been adding content to it over the past years as well, and may have plans for additional content for it once it is first discovered also, that they may have already developed.
