First of all, there are whole sectors locked so no one can know all the game content. I am 39. This is my first Elite series game and I started playing several years after the Kickstarter. The things that allowed me to come up with my theory is I have been interested in astronomy since I was young, took four years worth of Latin, have a fairly solid understanding of equivalent mythologies of Rome/Greece/Egypt/Crete, read both the Latin and English versions of Homer's Illiad and Odyssey, read some of the Elite novels, I am an Elite explorer in-game and have absorbed lots of lore, and I know how to find information and connect dots. Nothing is stopping you, but be prepared to show your work. Griping solves nothing. In spite of not having the same background as those who played the entire series, I still posted a theory that is heavily cited. No matter your background anyone can contribute and even post a totally serious theory on April 1st. Have a little bit of confidence. My theory could be wrong but at least I had the guts to post it. I put it out there because I want it challenged. We grow and advance from learning. No one grows by hiding behind well you should have to experience everything. I had plenty going against me here. Yet, I still did it because this puzzle won't solve itself if assumptions aren't questioned.
