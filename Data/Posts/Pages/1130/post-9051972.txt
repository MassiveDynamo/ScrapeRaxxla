But my point is it is (hopefully) not finished just by finding it, if it opens up other game content, that may be ermergent and ever-changing in itself. Or, if as Darth Ender pointed out, the location constantly shifts as well every time someone finds it/accesses that content. I'm trusting (perhaps foolishly) that FD are smart enough not to make it a one-off after the Formidine Rift, etc., and likely have been adding content to it over the past years as well, and may have plans for additional content for it once it is first discovered also, that they may have already developed.


Look up the number of locked sectors and their spread across the galaxy. I assure you this game easily has another 15 - 20 years of life left in it easily.
