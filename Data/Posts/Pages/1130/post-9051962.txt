1.2 Something prevents me from writing about it.
2. I found it. What will prevent me from writing about it?
3. what can it do for me at all?
Money ? All the materials ?
Sorry, I'm not sure what you are getting at. We don't know what it is or what it can do, it's a mystery. Nothing will prevent you from writing about Raxxla or anything else on the Internet if you find it, which is no different than any other game. It's up to you as a player whether you read anything outside of the game (and trust its accuracy)., and that applies to the official forums also. My point is that it is very likely not to be a one-off find and done, but something that will change or evolve in some way., or open up additional, new gameplay for those who have found it.

It's up to you as a player to decide whether you want to take the time to look for that based on the information available. If you don't, there is not much point harping on about whether it is worth doing or not, move on and find something that you think is worth doing for you as a player, and that you find interesting, there are lots of options.
