They exist but they are either sub-stellar objects or true dwarfs .. nearly all these are in the game. There are a ton of brown dwarfs and sub-stellar objects as the primary body (meaning too big to be a standard gas giant but too small to fuse hydrogen - in game classes L,T, and Y). You can normally jump to all of them. Any discoveries prior to the game release is in the game generally. I think some have been added.

Yay, more lists to check, err, for simulacrae to check against Simbad... ;-)
