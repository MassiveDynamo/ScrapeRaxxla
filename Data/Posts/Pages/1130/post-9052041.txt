I'm writing this to show that one of the conditions for finding Raxla should be the discovery of all the content of the game.
4 elites, all ranks, all engineers, all ships, aviation, all resolutions, etc. And no one knows all the conditions.

And it does not give an understanding of why I will not write about it in this forum, but it gives an understanding that it is quite difficult to achieve.
That's certainly possible, but I think it would be silly of them to implement it that way, given that those conditions would make it near impossible, (which would upset a lot of people, esp. casual players) and.given the gameplay elements it can introduce over time if the conditions to find it aren't those ones and are "simpler". Plus the whole ethos of Elite since the first game has been to play the games the way you want to play, so in theory your commander might not want to do some or all of those things, and Raxxla might still be accessible to you. Or there may be multiple ways of solving the mystery/different condition locks and paths to opening them.
