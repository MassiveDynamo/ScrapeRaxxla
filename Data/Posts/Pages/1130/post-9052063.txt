As I remember the original novel, the Dark Wheel league of elite explorers was looking for Raxxla, and when Ryder found him, someone killed him immediately.
It didn't say who was in the Cobra that killed Jason Ryder. However, Jason Ryder did say the word "Raxxla" to his son Alex before Alex was jettisoned from the exploding Avalonia. Raxxla was known about somehow (my suspicion is hyperspace probes) by the time humanity colonized it's first system outside of Sol (Tau Ceti). Jason Ryder was killed because he knew about Raxxla.
