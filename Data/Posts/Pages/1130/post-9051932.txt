Sooo... that's completely speculative as well. Why/how do you know the Dark Wheel hasn't found it? Are you one of them?!?

Also: Raxxla symbol in the Codex... that's not a clue?

Also: (and I say this in the nicest way possible) I think you may be in the wrong channel? I will respectfully retract that if I have misunderstood something....
The Official authors were informed by FD, that the Dark Wheel never found Raxxla.
