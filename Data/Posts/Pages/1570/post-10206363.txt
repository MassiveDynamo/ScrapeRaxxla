From the passages attached above about the Oisir-Raxxlans, the mistake they made with the pyramids was to not build them upside-down, at least that is how I read it.
If we can find a surface feature like that, then it would have to be constructed, as the terrain procedural generation does not make overhangs.
I remember the effort it took to find the Project Dynasty bases in the Formidine Rift, the Conflux and Hawking's gap: they had to found by MkI eyeball flying low over the planet the beacons said they were on. It was neither fast nor easy and quite mind-numbing (I tried it myself at the time). We would need to know the correct body to search to be able to find it this way.
