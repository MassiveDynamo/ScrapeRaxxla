An interesting find in RH texts… he talks a fair amount about the number seven of being of importance; apart from grammatical pacing I always thought it odd why the codex had so many references implying the use of the word ‘seven’ and RH also utilities in the same instance, the phrase ‘as above so below’, attributing it to Apollo and Artemis out of Hyperborea and links in Ursa Major.

I don’t believe it means anything particularly, as RH doesn’t contextualise this importance, as it’s actually rather a wide subject; rather it might just be another hint to look at this particular text, and it identifies a certain correlation.

In a classical sense this might relate to a reference to the Apollo / Greek philosophy of the heavens / astronomy (as above) being applicable to the everyday / earth (as below) and Apollo and Artemis being polemical.

RH seems only to attribute the number seven to Artemis by the number of stars in Ursa Major, the constellation is actually linked to Callisto, a companion of Artemis. So ultimately I don’t believe RH is intentionally delving too deep into this mythology, but rather the ‘magical’ / ‘occult’ aesthetics.

I do suspect it’s still important in relation to Raxxla because I feel it’s yet another hint to simply read this text, the author is highlighting the text and giving it significance.

I am currently slowly breaking this text down and building various spacial layers, these I hope to publish soon.

At most I believe it will concrete the underworld sector as the prime location set out in the Codex, and that it clearly identifies it as an Easter egg homage to Holdstock…but certainly there is more here to find… mountains have some significance!
