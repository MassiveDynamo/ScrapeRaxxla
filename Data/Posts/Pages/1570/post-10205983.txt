Mmm, I see where you're coming from...
But if Raxxla isn't the destination, but just the location of the Rift which takes us to the destination, then how will we know when we find it? It cannot be named “Raxxla” in-game as per the previous file-dipping argument. Unless it’s a moon with a tourist beacon saying “this is Raxxla”... doesn't sound likely to me.

We have no evidence that Holdstock’s book influenced the implementation of Raxxla in-game; in fact DB said we don’t know what Raxxla is, but Holdstock told us, ergo it cannot be implemented as per Holdstock.

Gotta disagree with you on the veracity of stories though...a story is a story...it’s age has no logical link to its veracity. In fact it could be argued that more evidence would lead to later stories being closer to the truth. It’s not a sound basis for reasoning.
The age a the story has no impact. I agee with that. When it comes to myths with roots in reality, they will usually evovle further away from reality.
I don’t there is any new evidence since day one for this myth
