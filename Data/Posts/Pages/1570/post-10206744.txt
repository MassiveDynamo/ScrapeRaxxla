For those Celts out there; Robert Holdstock talks of a Water Goddess ‘Brigga’. Linking her to Arthurian legend.

I can’t find any reference on-line to a ‘Brigga’ - I am finding other goddesses, but I wonder if those only appear due to the search algorithm.

Is Brigga a real deity, is it actually Brigid?

The only sources I could find were:
Brig-O (not in game).
Brígh (in game) but too far removed.
Brighid (not in game).
Brigid (in game) and in the correct location
Brighid (and there are many spellings) is a Celtic goddess linked with Imbolc (Midwinter).
She is one of the few gods with a symbol - Brighids Cross which is traditionally made out of reeds or in modern times grass or corn stems.
Im not at home atm but i think its detailed in 'The Mysteries of Druidry' by Brendon Myers, someone i had the privilege to meet many moons ago.
Theres a definite connection with Arthurian legend im sure shes mentioned by Taliesin or Geoffrey Ash (Albion) but would have to riffle through my library to find the quotes.
Will look tonight when im home from the Footy.
