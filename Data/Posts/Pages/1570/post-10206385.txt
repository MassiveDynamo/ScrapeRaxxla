This is my personal interpretation of "as above, so below" combined with how the equatorial coordinates of both capitals are strangely close.
In case it helps anyone, here's the full thing. It is something pre-Holdstock, even. So, these kind of ideas have been floating around a very long time:

As above,
so below,
as within,
so without,
as the universe,
so the soul…”

Hermes Trismegistus

Note the religious connotations of both terms.
