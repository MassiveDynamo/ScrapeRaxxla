Let's be clear: All are welcome here. But, if you want this found, do some damn investigation of your own. The story starts off in a system known for propaganda. By the time we got to Elite Dangerous, the propaganda is so thick you can practically see it hanging in the air. This requires personal effort, not just armchair theorycrafting. Ideas need to be testable. Though, that means you need to factor in details we have relative certainty on given what we know.

What we know:
Raxxla mythos originated from (a ship based out of) Tau Ceti based on writings of Art Tornvquist in 2296. This is first written attestation.
Marlin Duval dies in 2296. Empire is founded in 2296 in Achenar. It was pre-dated by Marlin's Republic.
There must have been some degree of colonization done by Marlin Duval and her supporters.
Marlin Duval fled the Federation trying to get as far away as possible.
We have the "Early Colonies" beacon indicate an era of rapid expansion started in 2230 -- 66 years prior to Raxxla mythos.
Most of the the earliest colonies were those of the Federation (oldest of the superpowers).
We have fuel scoops as far back as the invasion of Achenar following the Mudlark extinction in 2411.
Supercruise is invented at some point in the generation ship era (see Venusian logs). This could have been as recent as several hundred years ago based upon Phekda.
Lave is not colonized until 2412.
