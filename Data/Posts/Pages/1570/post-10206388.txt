There's a star itching in my brain right now: Theta Bootis, at the top of the Bootes constellation. The reasons are, it's:
not far from Alioth in the galactic plane, at +51Â° and almost touching Ursa Major
directly controlled by the Pilots Federation
heavily access restricted for an inconspicuous reason
It's not known as Theta Bootis in the GalMap, however, but under its traditional name of... Asellus Primus. In the Noobula.

In case it helps anyone, here's the full thing. It is something pre-Holdstock, even. So, these kind of ideas have been floating around a very long time:



Given Hermes Trismegistus connection to the Hermetica, I suppose it is important to point out one of the INRA sites is in Hermitage and the asteroid bases used to known as Hermit Rocks.

Note the religious connotations of both terms.


Seems like the Hermetica includes a bunch of astrological stuff as well...
