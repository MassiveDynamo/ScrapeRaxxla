the ultimate clue to its location is a mirror in the heart of the Empire
"a mirror according to what?" Sol
Quick question:
Is this just interpretation or is there some text that lead you to this particular train of thought? Even on it's own, the idea is actually pretty interesting given a system named "Gateway" and Alioth being referenced as "a stellar El Dorado". Clearly, the Alliance is important in some fashion that we don't fully understand. Also notable that currently the protector of the Old Worlds region is the Alliance.
