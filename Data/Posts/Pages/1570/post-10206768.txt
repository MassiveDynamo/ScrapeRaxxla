Brighid (and there are many spellings) is a Celtic goddess linked with Imbolc (Midwinter).
She is one of the few gods with a symbol - Brighids Cross which is traditionally made out of reeds or in modern times grass or corn stems.
Im not at home atm but i think its detailed in 'The Mysteries of Druidry' by Brendon Myers, someone i had the privilege to meet many moons ago.
Theres a definite connection with Arthurian legend im sure shes mentioned by Taliesin or Geoffrey Ash (Albion) but would have to riffle through my library to find the quotes.
Will look tonight when im home from the Footy.

Cool.

I’m sold on Brigid, as it’s very close to Avalon, which ties to RH’s text. Here’s a short extract from my current notes (to be published soon).

‘Avalon - RH p18 vale of. RH talks of a Moon goddess associated with horses (Epona p27) p22 and a mystic earth goddess, naming Morgan La Fay as a possible link with the triad Celtic goddess ‘The Morrigan’, a fertility and war goddess p23. With Excalibur - Lady of the lake RH attributes with ‘Brigga’ p25 a water goddess. RH identifies here how water is a barrier between the real and these ‘otherworlds’. Morgan La Fay is mentioned again on p25 accompanying Arthur on his death barge with three hooded women or three queens, RH calls these the tri-partite goddess’ - Robert Holdstock Lost Realms.
