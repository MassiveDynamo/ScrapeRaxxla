I donâ€™t there is any new evidence since day one for this myth
It's called people failed to investigate. The blame lays solely at the feet of those who blindly accepted this was a separate universe. No one went looking for where the Veliaze myths came from. No one looked for Essafa. Both are there but under new names. No one read descriptions. Let's just complain. Meanwhile, the people who do the work aren't given any credit and are actively shunned. Pick a side: separate universe or same universe?

They gave you hints EVERYWHERE. I just am at a loss for words that the people who played the older games somehow find it impossible that it is the same universe.
