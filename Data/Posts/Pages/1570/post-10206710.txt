For those Celts out there; Robert Holdstock talks of a Water Goddess ‘Brigga’. Linking her to Arthurian legend.

I can’t find any reference on-line to a ‘Brigga’ - I am finding other goddesses, but I wonder if those only appear due to the search algorithm.

Is Brigga a real deity, is it actually Brigid?

The only sources I could find were:
Brig-O (not in game).
Brígh (in game) but too far removed.
Brighid (not in game).
Brigid (in game) and in the correct location
