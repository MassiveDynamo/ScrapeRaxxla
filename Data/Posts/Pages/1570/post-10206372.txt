Quick question: Is this just interpretation or is there some text that lead to this. Even on it's own the idea is actually pretty interesting given a system named "Gateway" and Alioth being referenced as "a stellar El Dorado". Clearly, the Alliance is important in some fashion that we don't fully understand. Also notable that currently the protector of the Old Worlds region is the Alliance.
This is my personal interpretation of "as above, so below" combined with how the equatorial coordinates of both capitals are strangely close.
