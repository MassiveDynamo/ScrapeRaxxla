Some theorycrafting here:
Raxxla is somewhere in the heart of the Alliance, or maybe the nearby Old Worlds
the ultimate clue to its location is a mirror in the heart of the Empire
"a mirror according to what?" Sol
A lesser conjecture: What if the Raxxlans of Holdstock failed because they were looking from the wrong side of the Earth?
An even lesser conjecture: The ultimate clue mentioned above is the false lead they, or whatever equivalent there is in the Elite verse, found
24-carat tinfoil conjecture: Marlin Duval's expedition followed such false lead, and they settled on Achenar with Raxxla as the ultimate goal; the Old Worlds became a hotspot of conflict when the powers figured out its actual location, until the Pilots Federation's tentacles grew enough to shush the whole thing
