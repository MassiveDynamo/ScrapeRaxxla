Yeah ! I like it. I hope they have nothing to do with that boring Bilderberg-like Club.. We already have that IRL..

If we assume they conform to the concept of the original novella, the Dark Wheel is not a powerful organisation.
But the problem is.. Premonition, where TDW is described as a pretty powerful and widespread large organisation...
Again, what FD have done with the original concepts of TDW and Raxxla ? I fear the answer: 'They evolved'...

What are the exact requisites to get tested by TDW ? I think we'll never know.
But we do know that this test will be discreet and demands skill and courage.
I assume everybody is focusing on missions and tip-offs of that kind. The less known the mission giver is, the better.
Of course, anyone who would receive a delicate/difficult tip-off from a "Mysterious Benefactor" (the one who paid your first Sidey) would be touching Heaven !
