Yeah ! I like it. I hope they have nothing to do with that boring Bilderberg-like Club.. We already have that IRL..

But the problem is.. Premonition, where TDW is described as a pretty powerful and widespread large organisation...
Again, what FD have done with the original concepts of TDW and Raxxla ? I fear the answer: 'They evolved'...

What are the exact requisites to get tested by TDW ? I think we'll never know.
But we do know that this test will be discreet and demands skill and courage.
I assume everybody is focusing on missions and tip-offs of that kind. The less known the mission giver is, the better.
Of course, anyone who would receive a delicate/difficult tip-off from a "Mysterious Benefactor" (the one who paid your first Sidey) would be touching Heaven !

They maybe widespread - possibly large, but not necessarily dominantly powerful.

There is a slight contradiction here between what Drew W. has intimated about his ignorance of the R. storyline and its ring fencing by FDev, and the fact that his books, which are considered canon, touch upon the subject in a few places. We should probably ask Drew about this - I don't know the stories well enough to frame the question, but one of us surely does:

Is DW info in Drew's storline to be taken as canon in the game?
Does the information in Premonition concerning DW come only from DW or was it added by FD?
Is DW's influence considerable or is it a weak and cladestine operation?
Can we bring it up on Drew's lore thread?
