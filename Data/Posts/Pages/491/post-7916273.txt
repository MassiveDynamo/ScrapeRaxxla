The next question is: As a FD developer. Would you place Raxxla within reach of the bubble or not?
What about the lore if Raxxls is xKLY away from Sol? How could the TDW know about this place, when ships could only jump a few LYs?
Many possible answers depend on if the E/F missions "little bit obvious" things must be considered as retconned or not.
The Myth is obfuscated in the outer rim, what has been lost will soon be recovered, etc... These would point to a distant planet which needs some sort of map (route across a sparse region ?) to be reached. Some sort of intricate route which needs multiple long range jumps ?
Original lore says Jason Ryder needed "to prepare an expedition" to go to Raxxla. Why did he need to prepare ? Why not just fly there ?
Romero, if related to Raxxla, also seemed to need a high range vessel...

There is a slight contradiction here between what Drew W. has intimated about his ignorance of the R. storyline and its ring fencing by FDev, and the fact that his books, which are considered canon, touch upon the subject in a few places.
In one of his live streams about writing, he actually shows some emails on how MB used to revise his writings before giving him a go. He seemed to be closely monitored.
