Hey, @Scytale , on the visited systems thing, apparently the info is stored locally not on the server: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/visited-systems-not-showing-as-such.517856/post-7911857
Would that explain why you’ve got all those systems which don’t show as visited?
Yes ! I think you have found where the problem is ! Thx !

^ Awarded best joke of the week !
I'd put my bet on Planet Coaster for TDW station and Jurassic Park for Raxxla.
(Oops ! You wanted it In Elite, Dave? You mean that Raksla thing is not a dino ??)
