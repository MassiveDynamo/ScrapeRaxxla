They maybe widespread - possibly large, but not necessarily dominantly powerful.
I agree. I have the feeling they are overwhelming powerful (unknown alien tech/knowledge?) but don't use that power to dominate. That's not their goal.
They are Explorers, after all...
But who knows if some Engineers who are helping against the Thargs or investigating the Guardians are not secretly assisted by TDW or even are "of theirs" ? Ryder ? Codex speaks about familial lineage...
Subversive? I think yes, up to a point. But only in benefice of Humanity. Example is they helped CoR to unveil The Club.
