I’m beginning to think you’re right, though there is the very woolly codex hint that it’s orbiting 8th moon of a gas giant somewhere. It does seem that this “treasure hunt” has no real clues. I have one Raxxla hypothesis left for Tyko to test, then don’t know what I’ll do.

Don’t fancy the look of any of the other games around, including Dual Universe...

I'll be offline the next two weeks. If you run out of ideas do what would be my next move and check Helix Sector Systems.
