Yeah ! I like it. I hope they have nothing to do with that boring Bilderberg-like Club.. We already have that IRL..

But the problem is.. Premonition, where TDW is described as a pretty powerful and widespread large organisation...
Again, what FD have done with the original concepts of TDW and Raxxla ? I fear the answer: 'They evolved'...

What are the exact requisites to get tested by TDW ? I think we'll never know.
But we do know that this test will be discreet and demands skill and courage.
I assume everybody is focusing on missions and tip-offs of that kind. The less known the mission giver is, the better.
Of course, anyone who would receive a delicate/difficult tip-off from a "Mysterious Benefactor" (the one who paid your first Sidey) would be touching Heaven !

My apologies again for the long text: I'll spoiler out the longer paragraphs (more than 2 lines).

I think the discreet aspect is important and, in this context, it means that TDW can give someone the mission without their identity being discovered. The Premonition quote also says that they don't advertise on the mission board in plain sight.

SPOILER

The Codex entry says that the TDW only approach people with a mission once the criteria have been met but there is a flaw in TDW's reasoning in using a 'normal' mission, even of the above types, as a test of skill and courage. This is that the above missions can all be completed without skill or courage.

There is also the problem of what happens when someone is invited and puts video of it all, and TDW archive on their station, up online. What is the point then of joining them?

Ultimately, The Dark Wheel's biggest problem is that of any player group: why do you want to join up with these people?
