An undetectable station as suggests the Codex (SC). Which doesn't mean "invisible" (normal flight).
Finding it will automatically grant you an invite... into their jails, at best, but most certainly to instantaneous vaporization.

Yes, they're not going to say ' hey you found us - well done ! Come in and have a nice cup of tea! '

If we assume they conform to the concept of the original novella, the Dark Wheel is not a powerful organisation. They are clandestine and would be on the run from the powers of the galaxy that they threaten. In the original novella, they are victims of persecution and hide in the shadows, steal ships, and fear attack. People seem to think they are a super-power with invisible influence - I think its quite the opposite. They've stumbled on a secret (existence of Raxxla) and are trying to gather evidence to make an expose.
