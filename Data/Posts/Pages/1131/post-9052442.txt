Except if you look at the FR Gamma mission excerpts in the spoiler, they clearly identify the signal as non-human (at least at rumour level, that could just be more Wagar misdirection, tm). And they seem to have made it home without getting killed (or if they were killed off by their "guards" there seems to be no record of it?). And the signals are clearly separate from the witchspace phenonmena.
hmmmmm interesting - Ya will have to go over this evening
