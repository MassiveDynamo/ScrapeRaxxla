Maybe both the FR and Thetis signals were the "kill them all" message to some or all of the three Dynasty projects for their "guards", and for some reason it affected the passengers on the Thetis (proximity to the moon broadcasting it?). Which means might be looking for a Dynasty installation there... Thetis actually uses that phrasing in the logs.

Ya i do like that - It would give a date for the Thetis crossing the moon. I just seem to remember the [HEXEDIT="Golconda"] Zurara [/HEXEDIT]saying they were going to send a message to all the dynasty projects on that same day and I only saw the one message being received... so I assumed it was the [HEXEDIT="Golconda"] Zurara [/HEXEDIT] one.... but I like your idea much better
