I want to clarify.
Did I understand correctly that those people who went crazy heard the sirens mentioned in the toast?

Wait.
What I do not understand, that planet that the signal scanner on top, where there are 2 thargoids on the sides, is that a planet in the Delphi System?
There like the write in codex is just this device.
So it turns out that the planet with the unknown device is the end point and it is shown in the figure above?
This is where you need to deliver all 3 objects and activate the device.
What is the planet below?

SPOILER
