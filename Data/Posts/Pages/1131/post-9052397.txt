At the risk of flogging a very dead horse, just saying... ;-)


Other Dynasty log entries strongly hint that this was all Thargoids (hyperdiction, strange power failiures/malfunctions followed by at least one attack from an unknown non-human ship, but who knows? Perhaps the siren song/whispers/lights in witchspace are Thargoid, but the signals are something else entirely? There are also references to the type/number of lights and their frequencies changing in witch space as well as the siren song and unknown signals.

Ya i looked kind hard into this because of my interest in the confluence- but I think the "Signal" that everyone heard was the signal from the [HEXEDIT="Golconda"] Zurara [/HEXEDIT] warning the other sites that they were about to be attacked by their supposed "guards". I will have to dig it out later - But ya the thing about witchspace being "different" there i still need to follow up on
