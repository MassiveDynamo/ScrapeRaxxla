Wait.
What I do not understand, that planet that the signal scanner on top, where there are 2 thargoids on the sides, is that a planet in the Delphi System?
There like the write in codex is just this device.
So it turns out that the planet with the unknown device is the end point and it is shown in the figure above?
This is where you need to deliver all 3 objects and activate the device.
What is the planet below?

The Thargoid signal depends on the system you are in. It has nothing to do with Delphi.
If i got this right (its been a while) - It triangluates your position based off of Merope and Col 70 Sector FY-N c21-3 ... (Those are the systems to the right and left in the picture) and gives you the next system to go to that has a thargoid base .... might check this out better explanation:

I just like the Merope/Col 70 Sector FY-N c21-3 line because it is an example of what i think is the Thargoid Celestial Axis ... so to speak
