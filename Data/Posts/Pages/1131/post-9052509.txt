hmmmmm interesting - Ya will have to go over this evening
Maybe both the FR and Thetis signals were the "kill them all" message to some or all of the three Dynasty projects for their "guards", and for some reason it affected the passengers on the Thetis (proximity to the moon broadcasting it?). Which means might be looking for a Dynasty installation there... Thetis actually uses that phrasing in the logs.
