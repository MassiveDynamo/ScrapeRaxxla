I want to clarify.
Did I understand correctly that those people who went crazy heard the sirens mentioned in the toast?


I don't think so. The first mentions are in Holdstock's "The Dark Wheel" in Chapter 1 (this was included with the original game):

It seems to indicate the reference is the spooky sounds and the fact that in the early days of hyperspace it was dangerous and some ships jumped never to return. As far as the Alleged Toast, it is more a reference to the excitement of exploration and the dangers of hyperspace travel. In addition, mythologically the Sirens were a yearning that if acted on would almost certainly lead to death. On the flip side of this, the Sirens were condemned to live forever luring men to their deaths until such time a man could resist their song and pass safely. I take this more to mean exploration is inherently dangerous. CMDRs are likened to the only man who heard their song and survived (Odysseus from Homer's Odyssey who plugged his men's ears with wax and bound their heads with cloth while he remained bound to the mast of the ship). Odysseus' safe passage resulted in the death of the Sirens.
