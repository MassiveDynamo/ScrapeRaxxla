The Thetis never traveled in Witchspace. All generation ships travelled at sub-lightspeed velocities.
Exactly why i called it a little bit different... Edit - Ya I just dont rule them out as not being related - They are both described as whispers and even if the Thetis wasnt traveling in witchspace - i think the Void between Systems could be described as deep.... just not enought to go on either way really.
