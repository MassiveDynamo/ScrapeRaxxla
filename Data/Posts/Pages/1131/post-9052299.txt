I want to clarify.
Did I understand correctly that those people who went crazy heard the sirens mentioned in the toast?
I think its unclear but possible.

Frontier itself calls the noises we hear in witchspace "whispers" in their own patch notes

From the Thetis: "Theyâ€™ve heard some kind of strange whispering sound coming from their apartment comms unit." - when the signal starts affecting people.
The Thetis said it came from a signal though - from a moon they passed. So it seems a little different than what we call witchspace "whispers"
