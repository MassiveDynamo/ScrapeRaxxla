Ya i looked kind hard into this because of my interest in the confluence- but I think the "Signal" that everyone heard was the signal from the Galconda warning the other sites that they were about to be attacked by their supposed "guards". I will have to dig it out later - But ya the thing about witchspace being "different" there i still need to follow up on
Except if you look at the FR Gamma mission excerpts in the spoiler, they clearly identify the signal as non-human (at least at rumour level, that could just be more Wagar misdirection, tm). And they seem to have made it home without getting killed (or if they were killed off by their "guards" there seems to be no record of it?). And the signals are clearly separate from the witchspace phenonmena.
