The Thargoid signal depends on the system you are in. It has nothing to do with Delphi.
If i got this right (its been a while) - It triangluates your position based off of Merope and Col 70 Sector FY-N c21-3 ... (Those are the systems to the right and left in the picture) and gives you the next system to go to that has a thargoid base .... might check this out better explanation:

https://canonn.science/codex/the-unknown-link/

I just like the Merope/Col 70 Sector FY-N c21-3 line because it is an example of what i think is the Thargoid Celestial Axis ... so to speak
I have already written above that I do not agree with this explanation.
So far it does not matter what is on the left or right, the main thing is that on top there is just a system with the final unknown device.

Look at my pictures. Why do I click on this in the codex to get to the delphi system?

And the 2 targoid signs on the sides show that this system is where a lot of interceptors are.

P.S. Example: System HIP 14909 its UP, no down
Thargoid Map Theory
Soooo, this is my contribution to the tin-foil-hattery, i have decided to put this up here as i have been exploring for 2 days now and found absolutely nothing :D :'( Im presuming that pretty much all of you are familiar with the map you can decode with a spectral analyiser from the audio clip...
