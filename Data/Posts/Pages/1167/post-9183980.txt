Align your ship nose with the main dish as it points directly at Polaris (this is only true of New Horizons and Voyager 1 - Voyager 2 cannot point at anything as it had a real-life gyro failure right before the game released). I had numerous people double-check just to make sure I was seeing things right and at the time vetted it with Stellarium for Android and aligned everything exactly using Cassiopeia and Ursa Major as reference points. Multiple CMDRs have confirmed the observations.
Well I'll be..... Made my way to Sol in Odyssey and sure enough - they are pointing their dishes at Polaris (and not near the sun or earth). They put effort into the details of these craft and situating them... the pointing must be by design. Tried looking at spectrogram of New Horizons noises... didn't see anything interesting... also asteroids still firmly entrenched in the center of the sun.
