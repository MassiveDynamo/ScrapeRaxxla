Well, Jorki had a happy morning getting First Footfall on most of the planets in my demesne! (Mu Leonis, aka Ras Elased Borealis, hence Rasalas).
However then switched back to Horizons to continue progressing my young clone towards his very own Fed Corvette. Had reached Post Captain on 18th and done quite a few Rep++++ missions since then. Unfortunately this afternoon realised his Fed & Imp ranks were not being displayed in the right panel Status tab, nor was the level increasing. Same thing was displayed in EDD, so suspect a problem with the Player Journal files today! Raised a ticket, but.....
