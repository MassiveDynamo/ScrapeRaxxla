I'll try to argue that Raxxla is located in the direction Ra: 13h 37m Dec: -10째 0' 0"

Lave is located at Right ascension: 13h 37m 12.643s / Declination: -36째 46' 56.659''. The declination is made up of the number sequence 36, 46,56, 66. That could be an indication of steps of 10째. At Dec -10, we get this point:

SPOILER

It's the crossing point of Ra: 13h 37m, Dec: -10째 and the ecliptic. Three lines crossing, like the Raxxla symbol.

This in the Virgo constellation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(constellation)

Virgo is connected to several godesses, like Demeter and Persephone and a few other mythological maidens.
Astraea is also seen as Virgo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astraea
She is interesting as she was the last immortal to leave Earth, in Greek mythology.

Virgo is the sixth star sign in the Zodiac and the birth sign of Elite (Released 20th September 1984).

This position in the sky gives just an arrow into space, but I think it could be a nice one.
