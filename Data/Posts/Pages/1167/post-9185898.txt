someone thought about such a theory:
Let's say it's 729952 and we just need to make 6 jumps? let's say the starting point of the salt or tau tset and simply select through the left panel of the system by number, the first system where you need to jump will be at number 7 in the list
upd:
in this theory, everything is fine - there is a certain mechanism that may reveal something secret. The method is also very simple.
