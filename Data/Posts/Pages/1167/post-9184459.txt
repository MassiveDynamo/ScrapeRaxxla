Align your ship nose with the main dish as it points directly at Polaris (this is only true of New Horizons and Voyager 1 - Voyager 2 cannot point at anything as it had a real-life gyro failure right before the game released). I had numerous people double-check just to make sure I was seeing things right and at the time vetted it with Stellarium for Android and aligned everything exactly using Cassiopeia and Ursa Major as reference points. Multiple CMDRs have confirmed the observations.
I think you’re overthinking things. This is a game, not reality. I’ve checked a few LP , and the beacons in the Conflux while I was in DW2. Dont think any of the antennae pointed somewhere sensible. Same with those comms dishes at surface bases.
