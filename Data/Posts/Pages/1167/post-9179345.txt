I believe it was added as a tribute to the New Horizons team at the time, and was found shortly after as it was put out on social media IIRC.
Here's why I think it was there in the beginning. Mission launch was January 19th, 2006. They just waited until the flyby of Pluto and the investigations had started on the outer Solar system to announce it. Technically, it is the only craft in the game that could have relayed whatever was detected from Polaris back to Earth. New Horizons has enough power to keep transmitting back to Earth until 2040. Both Voyager probes won't have enough power to relay anything back to Earth within 3-4 years but their sensors will keep working for a few decades longer. Both New Horizons and Voyager 1 point at Polaris. Voyager 2 experienced a catastrophic gyroscope failure so is currently spinning kind of aimlessly.
