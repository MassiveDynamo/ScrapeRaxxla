I'll try to argue that Raxxla is located in the direction Ra: 13h 37m Dec: -10째 0' 0"

Lave is located at Right ascension: 13h 37m 12.643s / Declination: -36째 46' 56.659''. The declination is made up of the number sequence 36, 46,56, 66. That could be an indication of steps of 10째. At Dec -10, we get this point:

SPOILER

It's the crossing point of Ra: 13h 37m, Dec: -10째 and the ecliptic. Three lines crossing, like the Raxxla symbol.

This in the Virgo constellation:

Virgo is connected to several godesses, like Demeter and Persephone and a few other mythological maidens.
Astraea is also seen as Virgo:
She is interesting as she was the last immortal to leave Earth, in Greek mythology.

Virgo is the sixth star sign in the Zodiac and the birth sign of Elite (Released 20th September 1984).

This position in the sky gives just an arrow into space, but I think it could be a nice one.

Hi Sorry I was going to post my declination findings - just slow to get around to it - My attempt earlier gave me a declination of -36.7 degrees Which puts it near Iota Centauri in the head of Centaurus - part of my visiting sol was to check that .

Just a looking at the stars from Sol (overlays)

SPOILER: LAVE-SPICA

SPOILER: LAVE-IOTA CENTAURI

Seems to match up better with Centaur.

edit- ahh i see u have a -36 declination too.... missed the 10 degree steps argument
