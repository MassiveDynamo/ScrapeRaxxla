If you liked the approach, or find it false please do comment. [/SPOILER]
I like it - I spent some time looking at Auriga during my attempt at following the "Tour of the Galaxy" - was looking specifically for the Spider Nebula - doesn't seem to exist in Elite. The Fly does ... Also liked the Flaming Star Nebula and AE Auriga - went for a visit. Ya Auriga being connected to Birth of Zeus / Omphalos as well as the Aegis... and the Winter Hexagram make it an interesting target. I think Delta Aurigae might just be mislocated on the Uranographia but ya there doesnt seem to be alot of good choices at RA 5 10 Declination 50. I like that Delta Aurigae is associated with Prajipati though
