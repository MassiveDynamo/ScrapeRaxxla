Casually watching Odyssey vids on YT as I’m not going to touch it until it’s patched / optimised better.

Been seeing a fair few station adds saying ‘visit the voyage probes’. Has this always been a thing as I’ve not seen these on my travels, but then again I have stopped playing since Odyssey alpha.
Yea, I've been noticing them for a little while right up there with 'don't forget your limpets' and buckyball races advert
