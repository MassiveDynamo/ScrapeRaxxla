You've all done phenomenal work trying to sort out a lead from the Codex offering.
Take the last letter of the spiral of stars, the R from Castor, the A from Capella , the X from Pollux, the L from Sol, and lastly the A from Vega. Notice there's an X missing.
X marks the spot... Of something.

I can do one out of CMDRGuru951's 3 steps:

Cupid's Arrow = Cupid's "R"
Maia = My "A"
Chi Orionis = Orion's "X" (look up how chi is written in Greek).

So he's got RAX, and needs to continue with XLA.
