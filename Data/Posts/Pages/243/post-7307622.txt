You've all done phenomenal work trying to sort out a lead from the Codex offering.

Now I will give you my Bazooka Joe wrapper analysis:
On Gal map, center on Sol
Tilt map south/down as far as possible and zoom into Sol.
Slowly zoom out
The labelled major systems begin to appear as the minor system names disappear.
Take the last letter of the spiral of stars, the R from Castor, the A from Capella , the X from Pollux, the L from Sol, and lastly the A from Vega. Notice there's an X missing.
X marks the spot... Of something.

Happy New Year!

Looks to be an Archimedean spiral, not a golden spiral... apologise for the rough edit (image link below) a simple spiral in Photoshop, if anyone can create a true spiral that matches those stars it would be more accurate, but there does seem to be RAX LA spelt out, how bizarre.

Weirdly Rax.la is spelt within equal triangles (bookmarked) maybe the missing one is within that same pattern close to sol?

It really canâ€™t be that obvious can it, it could or maybe its just pareidolia.

Only last year I did a short exploration trip within the bubble to find un-scanned systems and there were rather a few...not sure what the state of affairs are today.

"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth" or likely not...
