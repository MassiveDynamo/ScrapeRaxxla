Looks to be an Archimedean spiral, not a golden spiral... apologise for the rough edit (image link below) a simple spiral in Photoshop, if anyone can create a true spiral that matches those stars it would be more accurate, but there does seem to be RAX LA spelt out, how bizarre.

Weirdly Rax.la is spelt within equal triangles (bookmarked) maybe the missing one is within that same pattern close to sol?

It really canâ€™t be that obvious can it, it could or maybe its just pareidolia.

Only last year I did a short exploration trip within the bubble to find un-scanned systems and there were rather a few...not sure what the state of affairs are today.

"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth" or likely not...


Oh yes, I am quite sure it's pareidolia regarding this approach. Nice work with the image. Curious that it forms a W asterism like Cass, minus a vertex system.

Definitely not it, and I'll head out to that region to rule it out!
