You've all done phenomenal work trying to sort out a lead from the Codex offering.

Now I will give you my Bazooka Joe wrapper analysis:
On Gal map, center on Sol
Tilt map south/down as far as possible and zoom into Sol.
Slowly zoom out
The labelled major systems begin to appear as the minor system names disappear.
Take the last letter of the spiral of stars, the R from Castor, the A from Capella , the X from Pollux, the L from Sol, and lastly the A from Vega. Notice there's an X missing.
X marks the spot... Of something.

Happy New Year!
