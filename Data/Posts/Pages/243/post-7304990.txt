In page 3 of the "Lore Questions" thread with Drew, he is asked if there is a way for players to interact with TDW and/or The Club. His answer is to wait for Q4 updates, as there may be progress with The Codex implementation.

Low key saying those missions are back and/or there is a way to trigger their (TDW or The Club) heads to look our way for another clue/hint?
