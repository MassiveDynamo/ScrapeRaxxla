I think, the dark wheel, is over everyone and the club is part of tdw, same as the pilots federation, universal cartographic and leaders of the superpowers are controlled by them etc. So first we need to find out more about tdw, then we might be able to find raxxla. It's maybe ingame, but not reachable for players I think.
