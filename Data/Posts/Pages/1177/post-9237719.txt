I personaly think Communications Array Delta 69 doesn't have any connection to The formidine Rift. It is so unique and is not mentioned in the same way in any other log. This is the only time an event like this is described.
I would agree... that event described there is pretty wild. And to be honest, I can't quite make sense of it. But it is indeed unlike all the other PoIs found so far. So far the only thing I got about that anomaly is that it might be a reference to a book from 1969: Spencer, John Wallace (1969). Limbo Of The Lost. That book is about the Bermuda Triangle, which is a Delta. And considering that there has been a lot of weird stuff in the COL 285 region near that PoI, we probably have something equivalent to the Bermuda Triangle, just in space.
