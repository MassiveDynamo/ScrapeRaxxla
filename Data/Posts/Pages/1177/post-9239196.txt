the problem with using anything that was written before or even in early elite dangerous times is that fdev has retconned almost all of elite's canon. only the content made for the game is real, and even that is suspect if it contradicts what fdev is currently saying.

the retconning of their own lore even post ED is so bad that we can't really trust anything. they've even hinted that what we know of the guardians and thargoids from ram tah can't be trusted.

it's all rather depressing when you think about it and are involved in these kind of lore mysteries and role playing.
Old games and books have legend status, not canon status. It's been that way since releeace There was minimal connection between Elite 1 and FE2, so any continuity was impossible. Almost all the events from FFE has be reconfirmed in ED, in Tourist Beacons.
All the ED books are still canon. The only exception are the descriptions of the Alliance having meetings with Thargoids in the 3250s. That probably never happened and is the only thing that has been retconned.

Everything written for Oolite is fan fiction and has never been lore.

The Dark Wheel is the only official book that has any form of description of Raxxla. That book is not canon, but can be considered a legend within the ED universe. As the codex mentions that even fiction can contain valid hints of Raxxla's locale, we can not scratch TDW from our reading list.
