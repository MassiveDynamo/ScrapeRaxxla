I am pretty new to this, so I am reading up a lot on what has already been found out and what events the community triggered.

Whether this is also related to Raxxla somehow remains to be seen. The Exodus, and that's just a guess, is just a signature fitting to the whole theme that past myth had, which is basically the exodus of humanity to the rift, in case the thargoids force everyone to flee the bubble.

The whole Formidine Rift mystery was tied into Drew Wagars books Reclamation and Premonition and a series of posts and interactive stuff that happened in game. Was alot of fun but the general consensus is it was tied to that storyline and (probably) not raxxla related... although it is tied in with the "Club" who do have an interest in raxxla... so who knows.

But id suggest reading his books before delving too much - if you like a good story
