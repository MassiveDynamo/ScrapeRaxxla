I just picked what MrShinyTorterra pointed out as systems in which interesting things had been found that could be related to the Raxxla myth. Then I roughly estimated the center between those 3 points as a starting point to just look around within that zone for any listening posts. It is pretty random, but this area when looking at the list where most listening posts had been found or were pointing to, the whole COL 285 area there has had a lot of these abandoned settlements and PoIs in the past, so who knows, might find some more in that general area.
