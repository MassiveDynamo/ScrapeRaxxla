I think I might found a possible location for Raxxla theoreticly. It's in sol on planet 9 (Persephone). The planet itself was only detected later. It sais in the codex:
"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witch-
space, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of
our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!"

Ignore the most part of that except The parent's grief, the lover's woe.
In mythology she gets kidnapped by Hades and her mother is super sad, parents grief. She has her history of bringing sorrow to her lovers, the lover's woe. So checks out. Might be at the poles or something.
I don't have a Sol permit. Also would explain the dude looking away when showing sol on a stream. Don't know what stream tho so if someone has a link to that let me know.

Also it is the only planet within Sol that doesnt really exit in real life (Only hmmms and mehhhs and maybes about a huge planet we cant detect yet)
