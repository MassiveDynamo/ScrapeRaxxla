I dont have faith that Raxxla isn't bugged out, broken and unobtainable due to regularly occurring game problems.
I'm becoming convinced Raxxla is just the name of a cocktail served only to certain people by Jaques, and because they don't have the Coriolis force drinks pouring issue sorted out in Odyssey yet it is currently unaccessible.
