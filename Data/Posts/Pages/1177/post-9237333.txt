I just picked what MrShinyTorterra pointed out as systems in which interesting things had been found that could be related to the Raxxla myth. Then I roughly estimated the center between those 3 points as a starting point to just look around within that zone for any listening posts. It is pretty random, but this area when looking at the list where most listening posts had been found or were pointing to, the whole COL 285 area there has had a lot of these abandoned settlements and PoIs in the past, so who knows, might find some more in that general area.
too true. the canonn research articles alluding to any sort of non human/non thargoid signal and any type of gravity anomaly are very interesting. particularly the ones about people disappearing or memory loss. seems a lot of them also refer to the pharmasapiens too. the evil corp that infiltrated the hesperus/alabaster to take it over/steal the artifacts. they dont always specificaly mention them but they have the same story line. the research group was infiltrated or people "went mad" and started killing eachother. the base and its research are lost.

An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Eafots GL-Y e2 system, orbiting body 1.

any idea what 'exodus' is?

there are atleast 3 articles i have found of similar stories. ventures out into the formadine rift to deploy secret beacons. then the crew is usualy killed.
