All the ED books are still canon.

they had content retconned regarding the rift in the sense that they started deus ex machining anything they no longer wanted to be true with the hexedit drug and unreliable narrators.

they even did that kind of thing to their own in game stories involving abandoned plots around voices and songs in hyperspace related to misjumps.

plenty has been retconned since ED launch this way.

The Dark Wheel is the only official book that has any form of description of Raxxla. That book is not canon, but can be considered a legend within the ED universe. As the codex mentions that even fiction can contain valid hints of Raxxla's locale, we can not scratch TDW from our reading list.

yea, but at that point you can believe and make up anything and it is just as likely to be true.
