Jumped couple scoopables except Ms there... well, because on that "photoshoped" screenshot rings are shiny white with shadow which means it must be K /A/B/O/F somewhere close as main star (and if to trust that picture, then should not go that another small sector, as It has only 1 M star) ... Most are empties - stars only, others have 2-3-4 terra/water planets. Landable are mostly on dwarfs as main.
Somewhere right before that cluster had intresting system ... gas giant with 2 another smaller giants as minors + 2 terraformable minors. Never seen such before
