Hmm ... I feel like i'm in wrong one. There is another in Acheron. Contains 1 M and like 30-40 Y/T. And matches to his post acutaly, he said fly top from deep void, There is sector "Abyss" which means deep void. But it seems i will have to use jumponium to get there alot.

And here begins the re-interpretation which happens a lot in hoaxes... maybe its this, maybe its that instead. Mathmoss instructions are still up in one of the videos and there doesn't seem to have any ambiguity. If its not there then perhaps there simply never was.
