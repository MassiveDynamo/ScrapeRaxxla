That title is hugely misleading.
There are only a handful of original Elite star names that are also found in E: D.
The list (Googe Sheet) seems legit though, mirroring the effort we made of G1 & G2 system/star names when E: D 1.0 was released.
I'm not the author, I just copied the title and the link...
