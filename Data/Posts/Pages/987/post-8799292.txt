this is genius!
I took the word Raxxla, split it into three chemical elements, took ordinal numbers, it turned out 88 20 57, for each digit I assigned a letter from the alphabet, it turned out hhb _ EG
after that I again turned to the chemical table - it turned out like this O2 He B N
and again turned to the alphabet ... it turned out so 151585214 or 151/585/214.
dead end again, but it was interesting)
