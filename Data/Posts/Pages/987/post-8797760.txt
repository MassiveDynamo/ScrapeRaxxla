I have been looking into finding new/undiscovered tourist beacons with possible lore/hints. (passenger missions like sight seeing missions seem to be how the game intended player to find lore stuff if they did not already know where to look.) Not certain if these are new, but the Beacon in Gabraceni (0323) seems to be broken (no text). The system has an 8th moon, and is basically 70 ly directly below the old worlds. The lack of text makes me think this TB should not have been spawning as a mission target, or is meant to reference something as yet undiscovered. ( it seems odd only this and the elephant trunk (invalid destination) mission target are bugged)

Tourist Spot 366 in HIP 90246 mentions both luck (possible indirect reference to trinkets?) and sinister black ships ( TDW or Inra?) operating nearby. (300k ls to the visitor beacon). There seems to be a persistant poi (blue circle) in the canyon, but landing a ship reasonably nearby was a pain. (I plan to go back latter in a smaller ship to look into it more).

Tourist Spot 127 in Olgrea mentions Mic Turner, and also has an 8th moon of a gas giant. (deep in Alliance space)
