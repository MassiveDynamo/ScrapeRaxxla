@ Macros: Thanks but no, that’s in-game exploration. There used to be “other” “non-game” sections for IRL astronomy discussion, items for sale, hardware (that’s where all the joystick/hotas discussions were), etc.

I’ve got a Celestron telescope that I haven’t used for a few years that I ought to sell as well as the VKB dual joysticks, and also four glass mirror blanks (with a free “mirror-o-matic” mirror-grinding machine that I constructed & never used & want to see go to a good home). I just need to declutter my life!! (Got rid of the wife 30 years ago, so nobody to nag me until I do so myself).
