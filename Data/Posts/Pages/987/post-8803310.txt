Genius? Space Madness? Mmmmm

So, 22 jumps from Sag A*, logged on late yesterday afternoon for half an hour before G&T Time to get a bit closer, found there’s a game update, just because it’s now for sale via Epic??????
Methinks more mysteries have been added!!!!

And by the time EDD had finished updating 4 days of travel history so could then complete game update .....
G&T stopped play!
