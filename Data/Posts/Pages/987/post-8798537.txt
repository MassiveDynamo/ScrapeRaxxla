Tourist Beacons have been bugged but not heard missing text before so may be a new one. Traditionally they just so fast you cant catch them even if you try an ambush and wait for them.

Whats everyone else doing? Whats your latest mad idea or 3am enlightenment that made so much sense at the time?

Jorki’s having a rest. Tyko’s mission is to travel slowly to Sag A* (told him to send a postcard when he gets there), and make his way up to Goliath’s Rest (one of the three highest Carbon Stars in EDSM) and then investigate BH and NS in the vicinity in an attempt to reach TDW recognition (possible interpretation of the Toast). Travel is slow because he has inherited Jorki’s genetic condition-arthritic thumbs/wrists and RSI. I blame those clone masters on Teorge!

Plus I’ve got some jobs to do IRL......

Played a couple of hours with the CH hotas so far. Decided to put the VKB dual sticks up for sale (a fair bargain at £500), but there seems to be no “for sale” section in the forum now. And also what happened to the astronomy section??
