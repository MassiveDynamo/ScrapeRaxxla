This has probably already been discussed, but I noticed that Shinrarta has a gas giant, and the 8th moon orbiting it has a base controlled by The Dark Wheel faction. Coincidence? Also there's a tourist beacon nearby that talks about the Pilot Federation and mentions The Dark Wheel as an unofficial group inside of it.

Maybe their orbital station is orbiting that moon, but we just aren't able to see it until we unlock it?
I think it is digged many times. Somewhere on pages 300-400 people was flying around. On 1st pages it was screens of old quests from DW there (now removed) etc.
Also, I think, we COULD not see ... that was before FSS introduced. Now we have FSS/DSS which show many old hidden things immediately.
For example you can google old videos of how to catch Voyager. Now it is shown by FSS right away.
