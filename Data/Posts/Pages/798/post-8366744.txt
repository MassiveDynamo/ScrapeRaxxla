might have been written about before, i dont know. has anyone noticed that the dark wheel logo looks a bit like the Barbury castle crop circle.
i mean the lines in the background. i cant make much from it as my eyes are bad and im not that technically minded to remove most of teh image and just leave the background lines.
the lines on the crop circle is the number for PI so i hope someone can figure out the number on TDW logo if it means anything.
Well ... if u look at Barnard loop from other side (from crab nebula side) u may imagine it fits dragon
