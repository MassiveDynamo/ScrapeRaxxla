A Anaconda setup with long distance jump and necessary equipment plus a fighter hangar, so the crew can scout a specific location easier. Sounds fun and less dull than doing it alone.
better do not use fighter ... it is 20tonns, strips down 2ly from jump. You can put some better things, like extra scanner, or small guardian module to boost shield.
