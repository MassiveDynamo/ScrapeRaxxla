There's something odd with the tourist beacons in Shin: two of them are called "Pilot's federation secrecy". They don't have the same content nor spot number. Yet both contents fits the title, guess that the writer ran out of ideas.

Otherwise, nothing to report about Neumann Camp (owned by TDW). No unusual passenger missions, no unusual missions.

Edit: on the system's description, it is mentioned "Achieving a high rank with the pilot's federation is the most common way to earn such an invitation, more secretive methods are also know to exist."
If I remember well, one method is to have financed the game on Kickstarter. Anyone heard about a commander getting the permit another way? Such as being allied with the pilots' federation before being Elite?

Do you remember the spot numbers?
I have the tourist beacons noted here https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-quest-to-find-raxxla.168253/page-98#post-6528445 and will update if anything is missing.
