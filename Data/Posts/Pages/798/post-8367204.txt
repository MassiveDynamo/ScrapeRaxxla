I think it is digged many times. Somewhere on pages 300-400 people was flying around. On 1st pages it was screens of old quests from DW there (now removed) etc.
Also, I think, we COULD not see ... that was before FSS introduced. Now we have FSS/DSS which show many old hidden things immediately.
For example you can google old videos of how to catch Voyager. Now it is shown by FSS right away.
I'm there and don't notice anything unusual on the FSS.
