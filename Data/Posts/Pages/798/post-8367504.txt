There's something odd with the tourist beacons in Shin: two of them are called "Pilot's federation secrecy". They don't have the same content nor spot number. Yet both contents fits the title, guess that the writer ran out of ideas.

Otherwise, nothing to report about Neumann Camp (owned by TDW). No unusual passenger missions, no unusual missions.

Edit: on the system's description, it is mentioned "Achieving a high rank with the pilot's federation is the most common way to earn such an invitation, more secretive methods are also know to exist."
If I remember well, one method is to have financed the game on Kickstarter. Anyone heard about a commander getting the permit another way? Such as being allied with the pilots' federation before being Elite?

I think the only ways to get allied with the Pilots Federation is to rescue passengers from burning stations &/or kill thargoids.
Edit: I also ran lots of missions for the PF Training Academy (actually, now I come to think of it this might have been my second account), & rescued a lot of passengers (around 3000) during the last incursion, and as Jorki am currently killing goid scouts to increase combat rank. I got the message “allied with Pilot’sFederation” a few days ago after I’d turned in my first load of combat bonds. I find it interesting that the “PF rank” doesn’t appear to be accessible, also that there are 4 different spellings of PF.
Also tourist beacons 0247 and 0251 differ in their spelling:
Pilots Federation Secrecy versus Pilots Federation’s Secrecy
