Welcome and Welcome Back respectively

DW - someone has suggested that the 'mysterious benefactor' who gives you the ship with a message may actually be the DW in the first place and the whole game is our chance, there isnt a specific invitee as we already got it. Its a theory.

Elite - yes a few have quad Elite inc CQC, some on more than one acct as well, nothing so far.

Rares delivery - nothing to report...yet? You never know if what you have done is the trigger or part of a checklist to get noticed.

DW - by all current accounts havent found Raxxla at all, no current mention of them 'losing it' again so logically they cant point you to Raxxla but may have some information that hasnt been decoded / solved that may help.
