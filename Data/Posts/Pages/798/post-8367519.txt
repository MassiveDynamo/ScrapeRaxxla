This has probably already been discussed, but I noticed that Shinrarta has a gas giant, and the 8th moon orbiting it has a base controlled by The Dark Wheel faction. Coincidence? Also there's a tourist beacon nearby that talks about the Pilot Federation and mentions The Dark Wheel as an unofficial group inside of it.

Maybe their orbital station is orbiting that moon, but we just aren't able to see it until we unlock it?

I think this is perhaps an indication that Lyta Crane’s “knowledge” of TDW (as stated in the codex) is hearsay/misinformation/false news. The codex phrasing does say “rival experts have accused Crane of forging her evidence in order to maintain the revenue from her billions of followers”

Also “It is futile to attemp to contact the Dark Wheel on one's own initiative, however - it is always they who initiate
contact, initially in disguise, revealing their true identity only once a suitable test of courage and skill has been discreetly administered, and passed.” And I think this is hinted at in the DB video “ED has a story that "embraces all the players" where he talks about possibly getting an invitation to join a secret organisation.
