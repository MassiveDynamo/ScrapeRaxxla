might have been written about before, i dont know. has anyone noticed that the dark wheel logo looks a bit like the Barbury castle crop circle.
i mean the lines in the background. i cant make much from it as my eyes are bad and im not that technically minded to remove most of teh image and just leave the background lines.
the lines on the crop circle is the number for PI so i hope someone can figure out the number on TDW logo if it means anything.
It has been written about a few times.
The main problem with the idea, is that the pic is not the Dark Wheel logo. It’s some fan art, made six years ago.
It’s quite nice, so it sort of stuck.
