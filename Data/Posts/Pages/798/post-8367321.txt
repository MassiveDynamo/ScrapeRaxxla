This has probably already been discussed, but I noticed that Shinrarta has a gas giant, and the 8th moon orbiting it has a base controlled by The Dark Wheel faction. Coincidence? Also there's a tourist beacon nearby that talks about the Pilot Federation and mentions The Dark Wheel as an unofficial group inside of it.

Maybe their orbital station is orbiting that moon, but we just aren't able to see it until we unlock it?
I checked on that just a few weeks ago. Did a few missions for them from Neumann Camp. Found nothing.
It certainly doesn't look like coincidence. Also that 8th moon is a very dark place, as it's far from the star. TDW station may be in orbit of that moon (or not), but can't be found by normal means.
