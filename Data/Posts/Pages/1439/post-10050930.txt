I’m not sure if that was just a general observation or if it was about my posts.

If it’s the latter, then you are imagining and projecting something that isn’t actually there.

If it was the former, I’m not sure to what extent I would agree whether it happens generally or not.


FWIW, this is absolutely not something I have never said. I like the mysteries, the myths and the legends, and I like them because that’s what they are and what they bring to the game. What I don’t agree with is us as players having (or being given) what is effectively preternatural knowledge (or GM / god level knowledge).

Quite general actually. This is a running theme in the larger Elite community. The older lore tends to make people anxious for reasons unknown. Multiple groups IRH, Canonn, CoR, and discussions on forums provoked the exact same response with multiple parts of the older lore. It apparently may be a certain uneasiness with the idea that this series is actually a series and the lore is actually fairly unified despite being exceptionally long lasting as series go. It isn't specific to one particular part, either. Though, I first noticed it when I was able to prove Earth was in all parts of the lore. Additionally, the fact that system names have changed due to politics, disasters, wars, etc seems to be a considerable source of unease in the community. It is like partly the community wants a unified lore but at the same time fundamentally distrusts that is the case. Lastly, there is the ongoing tension of whether to take the books as canon. The community seems to love the idea of retconns despite there being zero evidence for that occurring.
