Mmm, IIRC some of those old E/F missions appeared to be given by the Pilot’s Federation (or perhaps a faction therein?) against the SD_TDW. So a possibility is that those missions were supposed to make the point that SD_TDW weren’t pukka, but people weren’t realising that and the Codex’s Farseer statement was inserted to make the point crystal clear. ...We know from TB that TDW is a faction within PF, so it is logical that we need to find the genuine DW within the PF..
Sorry to drop back somewhat...

If you examine the early posts in the thread, it seems th E/F missions were handed out by any faction. I got the impression this too was a bug and they were only meant to handed out in Shindez. When they then updated the mission system, they vanished completely, so it seems there have been fumbles on fumbles.

Rather than fix something they probably had no solution to, they just cut them out and tried to give the wink in the Codex. I just hope they tested anything they put in to replace it..
