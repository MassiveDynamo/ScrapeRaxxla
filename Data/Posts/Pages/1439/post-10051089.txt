@Thatchinho since you mention Gan Romero - obviously he was very much experiencing fernweh, while Fdev made it clear that we weren't supposed to go off looking for him specifically, I can't help but think that storyline was intended as a narrative clue - at least in the sense that "there's something more going on". What do you think it was?
This Galnet articles pretty much sums it up: https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/25-MAY-3305

It pretty much covers the discussions that were had at the time. Whether the article was pre-written or was done as a summary of the discussions I've never known.
