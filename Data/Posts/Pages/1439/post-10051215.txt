No maybe about Halsleys visions. Her story was meant to be the hint to go look for the Guardians . But when the trailer ran, before the storyvwas released, some enterprising CMDRs reverse engineered the trailer and found the guardian site. FDs response was to go la la la and run the story as if nothing had happened.
I'm not sure it's quite like that. The Halsey story was happening for a while, and the vision stuff was in the build up to the Guardians update.

26th May 2015 - Starship One lost
23rd Feb 2016 - Galactic News: Former Federal President Found
4th Apr 2016 - Galactic News: Halsey Talks to the Media
20th Sep 2016 - Galactic News: Halsey Shares Her Vision
25th Oct 2016 - ED 2.2 The Guardians Trailer
26th Oct 2016 - Site from trailer found.
The Halsey stuff went quiet after that. IIRC the visions only came up again around three years later as part of the Gan Romero story (and again I don't know if that was a prewritten article or FD just putting some of the out of game discussions into Galnet).

It was only after we started getting the info from Ram Tah's Decoding the Ancient Ruins mission in early 2017, that some started to draw a potential connection between the Guardians and what Halsey had encountered.
