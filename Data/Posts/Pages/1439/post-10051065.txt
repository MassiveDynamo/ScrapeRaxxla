No maybe about Halsleys visions. Her story was meant to be the hint to go look for the Guardians . But when the trailer ran, before the storyvwas released, some enterprising CMDRs reverse engineered the trailer and found the guardian site. FDs response was to go la la la and run the story as if nothing had happened.
I recall, I did an article on Halsey at the time for Sagittarius Eye so I was super into it

I see the confusion though, my fault, my "(Maybe ?!?!)" was relating to the idea of her seeing the Guardians in the past.

It's still unclear whether she did, it's assumed she did (says in the Codex), but with a lot of permit locked areas near the few and oddly-shaped Guardian areas we've found (Regor specifically) it could be there's a thriving isolationist Guardian civilisation there, some sort of descendants of the originals ofc. Or giant boltzman-brain star systems where the constructs run ancestor simulations If we got to those we'd defo shoot them for engineering mats, I can understand the permit locks. Zoo hypothesis in action.
