That's a good point (and your original post on this). Thanks for pointing that out I think it's important to get the details right so I appreciate being corrected!

I suppose rather than saying that Halsey and Jaques experienced similar misjump phenomena, they experienced different types of misjumps that gave them both (in different ways) glimpses of non-local things in the galaxy.

Jaques claims that for a few seconds he appeared in different places before he manually dropped out of witchspace. Halsey sort of exploded into witchspace and seems to have been visited by a god-being that gave her glimpses of the Guardian-past (maybe?!?!).
No maybe about Halsleys visions. Her story was meant to be the hint to go look for the Guardians . But when the trailer ran, before the storyvwas released, some enterprising CMDRs reverse engineered the trailer and found the guardian site. FDs response was to go la la la and run the story as if nothing had happened.
