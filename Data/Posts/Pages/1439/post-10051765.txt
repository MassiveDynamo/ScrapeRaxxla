Ps, hence why I'm already back at the Proteus (Trapezium Sector YU-X C1-2) site, to sniff out the only place we know of where Goids & Guardians met up. Already had a classic crash of "oh noes, POI is broken, ED don't know what to do - let's crash"
Can't visit Proteus nor the nearby Thargoid & Guardian site in Odyssey. Constant crashes, reported using the crash-reporter.
Was able to revisit the other Ancient Site. Obelisk strangely required Orb+Orb. All of them. I wonder whether that's a broken thing as well.
Was hopeing to see if we had some new clues now. Will try Horizon instead. (EDIT, nope. Same broken stuff, crashes)
