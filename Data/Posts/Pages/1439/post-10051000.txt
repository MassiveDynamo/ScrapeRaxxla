It would not surprise me if Raxxla or it's active part (Omphalos rift?) has been updated, as the game has expanded. As long as no one finds Raxxla FD can fiddle with it, as they like. It would at least be risky to assume it works in the same way as when the game was released.
Yep, used to be a mythical planet that wandered through hyperspace carrying an alien gateway to other universes...
Now itâ€™s a bowl of petunias!
