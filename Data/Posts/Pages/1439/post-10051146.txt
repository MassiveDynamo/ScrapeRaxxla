Went to 30 Comae Berenices to scout for VIP Passenger missions in near by Tourist systems. No luck.

It then occurred to me that a mission giver could have an Allied requirement attached to a pretty solid lead on the location of Raxxla, so I'll be headed back to regions where I'm Allied with all factions.
