Sorry to drop back somewhat...

If you examine the early posts in the thread, it seems th E/F missions were handed out by any faction. I got the impression this too was a bug and they were only meant to handed out in Shindez. When they then updated the mission system, they vanished completely, so it seems there have been fumbles on fumbles.

Rather than fix something they probably had no solution to, they just cut them out and tried to give the wink in the Codex. I just hope they tested anything they put in to replace it..
Ah yes. Only the “Discrete Redistribution” mission is targeted against Dark Wheel ships...thought there were more.

I did hear the missions cropped up outside SD, so it could well be the old mission system was badly flawed and FD just decided to redo the whole thing and delete these flawed E/F missions...shame they seem to have been the only thing at all relevant to DW and a possible Raxxla storyline!
