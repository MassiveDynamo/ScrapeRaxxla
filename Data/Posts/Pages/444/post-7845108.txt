Ok so I'm back in the bubble. Hate to be THAT guy, but, almost ZERO spinning during fsd jumps. Lots of spinning out near Orion nebula.

Just to clarify, that's normal according to whom?

Just saying, that poopoo ain't normal on my game. No spinning â‰  lots of spinning

IF hyperspace spinning is a thing near the Orion nebula, then I'd put money on the effect being centered on the system in Col 70 that was identified years ago as the target for the Thargoid probes. We know Thargoids can do weird stuff in witchspace (hyperdictions) so it would make sense.

This is where we're back to assuming that every weirdness is related to Raxxla. In a galaxy of 400,000,000 systems I think that FDev could manage to put Raxxla somewhere other than Thargoid space.
