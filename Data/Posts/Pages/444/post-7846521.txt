Quick question: How is your internet speed? Witchspace is basically a load screen. If you've got really great bandwidth then you might be loading the instance and dropping out of witchspace before the spin sequence begins. Meanwhile folks with poor bandwidth are familiar with the spinning because we spend a lot more time staring at the load screen. A good way to test this would be to get a timer and time exactly how long, from the moment the ship's voice begins the FSD countdown sequence and until you drop out, you spend in Witchspace. Other CMDRs can perform the same test and we can probably even determine exactly how many seconds it takes before the spin sequence begins.

And for this to be a truly scientific test it should be done by a range of pilots with a range of internet connection speeds jumping between the same two systems and at a range of times of day to check FD server loading effects. I have said a few posts earlier I have seen occasionally a minor amount of rotation recently when out in vicinity of Heart nebula, nowhere near any permit locks. I have 100mbit/s optical fibre internet connection.
