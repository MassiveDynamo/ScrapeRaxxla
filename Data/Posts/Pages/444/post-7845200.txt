Ok so I'm back in the bubble. Hate to be THAT guy, but, almost ZERO spinning during fsd jumps. Lots of spinning out near Orion nebula.

Just to clarify, that's normal according to whom?

Just saying, that poopoo ain't normal on my game. No spinning ≠ lots of spinning
What makes you think that it’s not no spinning which is the abnormality?
