Until were given some official form of how to tell raxxla weirdness from non-raxxla related weirdness, what exactly are we supposed to assume? But if there are so many other super mysterious hidden secrets scattered acrossed a googol stars, it be nice for some clarification on how to tell the difference.

Well we can't tell definitively, but if it's in Thargoid space, then I'd assume it's Thargoid-related. Similarly, I wouldn't expect Raxxla to have a Guardian Structure on it.

Have you tried posting in the Thargoids/Guardian forum regarding the hyperspace spinning? They may already have done some investigation, and if they haven't, they may start now
