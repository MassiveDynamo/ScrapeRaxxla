Ok so I'm back in the bubble. Hate to be THAT guy, but, almost ZERO spinning during fsd jumps. Lots of spinning out near Orion nebula.

Just to clarify, that's normal according to whom?

Just saying, that poopoo ain't normal on my game. No spinning â‰  lots of spinning
Quick question: How is your internet speed? Witchspace is basically a load screen. If you've got really great bandwidth then you might be loading the instance and dropping out of witchspace before the spin sequence begins. Meanwhile folks with poor bandwidth are familiar with the spinning because we spend a lot more time staring at the load screen. A good way to test this would be to get a timer and time exactly how long, from the moment the ship's voice begins the FSD countdown sequence and until you drop out, you spend in Witchspace. Other CMDRs can perform the same test and we can probably even determine exactly how many seconds it takes before the spin sequence begins.
