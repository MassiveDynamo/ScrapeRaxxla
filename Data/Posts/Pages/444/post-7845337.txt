Can anybody tell me if the Dixon FSS signal is different from other station signals, and if the other stations commonly have unique signals, or is there a "stock" orbital station sound?

Again, too far away to check myself. Headed home but it's gonna take the better part of a week.

I was there two nights ago and Macros last night. I had double checked the signal with another Installation in Vega and thought to hear „Lakon“ from Dixon. Macros proved me wrong. So no.
