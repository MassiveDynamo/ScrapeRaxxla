Just to toss my two cents in about witchspace animations.... While im not sure about spin, I have noticed differences in the witchspace... whether they are cycling through a variety of animations ... or as i suspect they might be tied to different areas of space.. not really sure.. The fact that there are cut-scenes for thargoid interdictions makes it entirely possible that they would make other special ones... I admit i am paying extra attention to the nebulous things between the stars these days...

on a side note - They seem to have added interesting noises to let you know "hey you need to stop and scan here"
SPOILER: AFTER SCAN NOISE

Why not whispers in witchspace?
