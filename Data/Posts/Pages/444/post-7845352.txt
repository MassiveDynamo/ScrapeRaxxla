Can anybody tell me if the Dixon FSS signal is different from other station signals, and if the other stations commonly have unique signals, or is there a "stock" orbital station sound?

Again, too far away to check myself. Headed home but it's gonna take the better part of a week.

Q
From what I recall of zooming in on stations you hear indiatinct random comms chatter from them. Docking instructions to ships, warnings, that type of thing. I would expect, that given enough time youâ€™ll be able to make out all of the ship manufacturers being said.
