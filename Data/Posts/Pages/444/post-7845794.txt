So couple things about Sag A*

You can't fly inside it.. drops you out ~50Ls, >1 Year to get to it with thrusters lol.

But if you just sit in front of it looking right at it, you hear a few interesting sounds. The pitching down sound you hear while in a glide can be heard. Also, the thunderclap sounds you hear in SC can be heard...along with a bunch of other weird sounds.

But hey the stars are spiraling and it's bright like the heavens lol.
