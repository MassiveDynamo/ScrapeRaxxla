Ok so I'm back in the bubble. Hate to be THAT guy, but, almost ZERO spinning during fsd jumps. Lots of spinning out near Orion nebula.

Just to clarify, that's normal according to whom?

Just saying, that poopoo ain't normal on my game. No spinning â‰  lots of spinning
I get spinning everywhere. More on long jumps than short jumps, but it always some spin.

Ship spins anti clockwise, so the stars appear to rotate counter clockwise. The spinning only starts in the last part of the jump sequence. I've always figured it was some small effect to wake us up before drop out.
