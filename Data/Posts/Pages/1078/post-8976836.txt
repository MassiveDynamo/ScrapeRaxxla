I probably missed it (or just plain forgot it) and MBs Drabble and Image were connected before... but the drabble is making me look at the cthonic side of things again - as well as gives me hopes for seeing Lovecraftian Horrors .. speaking of which some of those Lagrange Anomalies look awesome - I need to go check those out.

I like Mattius's take on the "temple" found at Site 94. What if the temple was aimed at one of the Cthonic Gods.. or are they the Far God ? And the Thargoids are sent (I see them as the dogs of some kind of mother goddess) to destroy it and those who opened it.

Personally looking forward to an Odyssey where - We are at a base when some impenetrable blackness descends and strange 4th dimensional glowing tentacle things start ripping us to shreds.
