Mmm

Very perplexing...

Seems to have been collated around the same time as Elite Legacy, I would say the mention of Dragons, Tau Ceti and a Childrenâ€™s story are far too coincidental...




Here is MB Pinterest posts around that time too, interesting, but be warned however the actual home site for the Tau Ceti Mission is offline and the links are broken / liable to take you someplace not so trustworthy.

But its all very interesting.

Ya I used the Wayback Machine to access the Tau Ceti Mission Website.. the link it takes you to now is a little risque...

I was waiting to see if the Tau Ceti Mission ever materalized... Its funny reading the tau ceti mission stuff again - im seeing things.

Ah ya i forgot alot of this - would be worth starting at the beginning in Dec2015 and jumping forward through the wayback machine archives.
some of the logs seem to get deleted so better to start at beginning and move through it...

Edit - ya i wont give any spoilers - but look at the so called source of the Sun Dragons
