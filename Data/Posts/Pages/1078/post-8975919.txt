Reminds me - If you get Sun Dragon. There was a reference in MBs book Elite Legacy to a... childrens book about a Princess and an Alien Dragon
I think it was a reference to the Sun Dragon book, however I wasnt able to get much from that - except for the Tau Ceti Expedition - which wasnt part of the book - just that extra website with a few blog posts. I did get the impression that some of that related to stuff he was probably working on relating to the alien life forms living in the void as well as possibly the thargoid probes and their means of communicating with us... but beyond that ?
Mmm

Very perplexing...

Seems to have been collated around the same time as Elite Legacy, I would say the mention of Dragons, Tau Ceti and a Childrenâ€™s story are far too coincidental...

Here is MB Pinterest posts around that time too, interesting, but be warned however the actual home site for the Tau Ceti Mission is offline and the links are broken / liable to take you someplace not so trustworthy.

But its all very interesting.
