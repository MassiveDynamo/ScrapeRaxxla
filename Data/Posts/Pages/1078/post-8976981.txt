Within Elite Legacy, do we recall any ship or faction names? I have the digital copy, currently ‘keyword’ skimming it...

Its just, the ship on the book cover has some markings or something else which looks like a serpent or a dragon.
I dont remember any "factions" just the Laphrian Navy... But the Cavus family I think owned some "legitimate" businesses... Cavus ... latin for cave or hollow .... Holloway Bioscience ?
