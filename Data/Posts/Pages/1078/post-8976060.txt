About to start my journey to skull and crossbones nebula, this nebula in real life is home to a group of stars that are actually a dwarf galaxy separate from the Milky way known as Canis Major Dwarf, the H18 region is the extra galatic group that isnt our galaxy and i noticed only 1 star in that area just behind the nebula is a H18 as opposed to the other H19 and a few others, long shot but last i was out there a few months ago many of the systems wernt fully scanned either
