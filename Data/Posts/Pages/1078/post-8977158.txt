Looking at it now, I would probably say it's 2 intertwined serpents.
Ya I think its the "Twin Vipers" ship that gets attacked at the beginning of the book. But ya its in a Caduceus and the system is Artemis .... Also I like how the head is in the rough shape of a viper ship as well as reminiscent of the shapes on the outer ring of the Raxxla symbol...
