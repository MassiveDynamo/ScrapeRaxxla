Ya I think its the "Twin Vipers" ship that gets attacked at the beginning of the book. But ya its in a Caduceus and the system is Artemis .... Also I like how the head is in the rough shape of a viper ship as well as reminiscent of the shapes on the outer ring of the Raxxla symbol...
Yeah ‘twin vipers’. Just checked, shame they weren’t ‘dragons’ or even ‘python’, always thought it a long shot and too obvious, but you never know, always worth a look, like how the book does make a point of a children’s book:

“I had no form of entertainment except for a book, a single book about a young man’s quest to save a princess from an alien dragon. My father must have bought it on the black market. He couldn’t have got it from anywhere else.“I still have that book.”

Who knows maybe this is the book references in the codex! Any references to dragons at Freeholm in game or a black market in books!?
