Nice.

I'd prefer to see this!

Then I'd be more inclined to trust FDev's in-game information on other stuff that comes out, leading to a rich and better game across a wide variety of scenarios.

I doubt very much that you would see exactly this. It is clear that in many of their visual posts like this FD have introduced distortions. I first observed that while investigating the old start up movie which turned out to be several camera angles all merged together, plus some other manipulations which disguised Barnard’s Loop. This Codex shot of TDW station (which it may or may not be, they aren’t saying it is, it just exists in that post, there’s no confirmation that is what it represents, could be just flavoured fluff!) has definitely been manipulated for colour balance. You can test that for yourself by comparing this shot against the lights colouron back of a similar old type Orbis (I used Aulin Enterprise). You can rebalance the shot’s colour to get something a little more realistic, when the star turns out to be an M subdwarf (M VI, if I remember correctly). However the distances are still likely to be distorted-I don’t think a moon/planet would be that close to even a cool subdwarf & strongly suspect the moon is shown too far away.
So the camera can lie!
