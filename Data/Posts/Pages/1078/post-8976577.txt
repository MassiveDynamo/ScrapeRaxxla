Within Elite Legacy, do we recall any ship or faction names? I have the digital copy, currently ‘keyword’ skimming it...

Its just, the ship on the book cover has some markings or something else which looks like a serpent or a dragon.

On my hard copy the wrecked Asp Explorer has a decal which looks like a white snake carried by two orange bands which might be another snake.
