And thus the mad tea party continues.

Btw what is an Odyssey? It's not about exploring the unknown. The Odyssey is about getting home, but always being side tracked and turned away from home.

The dog has retired and it has turned into stone, into history.

For the dog was tempted with the offers of the gods, joining the Olymp. But there is no glory in being the mover, no more than being the moved. There is glory in refusing the temptation of being a mover. Indeed, the movers are the friends you made along the journey. The friends that are not directly visible to your eyes. The friends influencing your fate. The friends playing a prank on you. The friends making you missjump and make you find that which you didn't know you were looking for. A missjump where the destination might occur outside the mirror.

The song of the sirens is over and so this one shall become the one who honked Raxxla. Then passed by. The myth. The Legend.

Fin.
