I think if you drill down you will get better results - What I did was go to the borders and zoom all the way in and then move the cursor till the text changes from one galactic sector to another... there is your line - then try to find a system that straddles that border (or gets pretty close) - thats what I was doing. Also the lines do not match up with the grid lines - the lines that define the galactic sectors are related to the galaxy map in the codex ... which is not the grid map. It has the zero point where we are looking - not at sol.

I do like that they came out pretty close either way though - just a matter of moving around in that column - maybe we will find something

hmmm other thing that bothers me about the codex map is - Why is it divided into 93 slices.... three 'quarters' of 23 and one of 24 slices.... very annoying. Unless it was just a way to convey the numbers 23 / 46 / 69 ?

Alrai Sector JR-V b2-4 is the nearest (6.52 ly) from this coordinates. Somebody checked it out?
