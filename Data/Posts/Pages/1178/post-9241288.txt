I’ve hypothesised that Raxxla is in Sol for some time now, based on the existence of an alien artefact on Mars. I believe Raxxla to be one of the Guardian arkships; and, as Han Zen says, think Guardians are the basis for the Greek creation myths and thats behind the frequency of their appearance throughout ED. However I dont think Raxxla has anything to do with Persephone. We know Raxxla has been in-game since the gamma (2014?). Persephone is the newest “outer rim” of the solar system - The Guardians 2.2 update (25Oct2016) added Persephone (Planet Nine), Haumea, Makemake, Eris, Orcus, 2002 MS4, Salacia, Quaoar, 2007 OR10 and Sedna to Sol.

A valid hypothesis has to address all parts of the evidence we have (the toast in this case).
Neptune can be seen as the original 'obfuscated on the outer rim'. Neptune and Uranus were unknown in classical times. The were only discovered after good telescopes were developed. Neptune was discovered last of them and still mark the outer rim of planets, in our solar system.
