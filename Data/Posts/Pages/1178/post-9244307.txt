Speaking of Spica... when looking up Spica (Virgo's brightest star) and surrounding stars and constellations, it made me wonder if that first line of the alleged toast, if it is indeed a clue, might be referring not to Cassiopeia, who would only be mother of one galaxy if we take the mythological angle... but instead referring to the Virgo constellation which contains a galaxy cluster and is also part of the Virgo Super Cluster. Hundreds of galaxies, basically. That sure would qualify as the mother of all galaxies.

There is also this asterism with Spica at its southern end, called the Great Diamond. Won't help us much narrowing it down, but if we try and assign the lines of the toast to a stellar object, Virgo as the mother of galaxies makes more sense, astronomically speaking.
