I think I might found a possible location for Raxxla theoreticly. It's in sol on planet 9 (Persephone). The planet itself was only detected later. It sais in the codex:
"To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witch-
space, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of
our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!"

Ignore the most part of that except The parent's grief, the lover's woe.
In mythology she gets kidnapped by Hades and her mother is super sad, parents grief. She has her history of bringing sorrow to her lovers, the lover's woe. So checks out. Might be at the poles or something.
I don't have a Sol permit. Also would explain the dude looking away when showing sol on a stream. Don't know what stream tho so if someone has a link to that let me know.

I came to that conclusion three years ago and went there. Searched it good. Landed and stayed there for a few days looking at alignment of stars and earth from that vantage point. Found nothing unique or worth reporting. Not to say Odyssey did not click something on, so it may be worth another visit. I doubt it, as this search has been going on since the birth of Elite. If Fdev put it in, they did it long ago and the location would not have changed. We only have two clues:, "There will be no clues" and "its in the game".

At this time, there seems to be no point in pursuing it. Some newbie will stumble upon it, report it, get credit for it, and the search will be over.
