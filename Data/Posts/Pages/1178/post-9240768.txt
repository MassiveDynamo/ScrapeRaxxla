I’ve hypothesised that Raxxla is in Sol for some time now, based on the existence of an alien artefact on Mars. I believe Raxxla to be one of the Guardian arkships; and, as Han Zen says, think Guardians are the basis for the Greek creation myths and thats behind the frequency of their appearance throughout ED. However I dont think Raxxla has anything to do with Persephone. We know Raxxla has been in-game since the gamma (2014?). Persephone is the newest “outer rim” of the solar system - The Guardians 2.2 update (25Oct2016) added Persephone (Planet Nine), Haumea, Makemake, Eris, Orcus, 2002 MS4, Salacia, Quaoar, 2007 OR10 and Sedna to Sol.

A valid hypothesis has to address all parts of the evidence we have (the toast in this case).
