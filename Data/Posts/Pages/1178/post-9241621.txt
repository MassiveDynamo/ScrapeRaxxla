Yes indeed, I think Raxxla is connected to the Guardians. Or at least the Guardians play a bigger part in the upcoming lore, like Halseys vision. Maybe Raxxla isn't a timemachine but rather let's people view the past/future. Anyhow I think the Guardians are still alive in some way or form.
Well, I suspect Raxxla may be a time machine,
in that if you find it you might find yourself transported to a World of Dinosaurs,
and The Dark Wheel did find it-
theyâ€™re the zookeepers!
P.S. if do you find it do not hide out in the toilets!
