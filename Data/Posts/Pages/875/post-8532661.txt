Whether it is on a planet or not has nothing to do with horizons.. you wouldn't need to interact with it to discover it.

Also, any conclusion that leaves raxxla intact requires a lot of changes and content from fdev... Which doesn't seem like a logical option for them... So it is most likely something that can be discovered but no longer a factor in the game universe.
Yes, you could discover a planet before horizons, but how would you know it was Raxxla from orbit, unless it said so (which would be boring af). Also imagine the outcry if someone had found it before Horizons and you couldn't do anything with it because the gameplay doesn't allow it yet.
I think it being not a planet but some other thing in orbit/space somewhere makes a lot of sense from that perspective. You don't need Horizons for those Guardian Installations for example. Could also be something big along those lines.

Programming wise Raxxla could be created as some kind of instanced discovery, like we can discover it, but it is closed or whatever and you couldn't interact with it. Then after some time the narrative goes on and on and step for step we uncover more of its secrets... just an idea how it COULD be planned by FDev... Wouldn't be the first time new discoveries went down that way.
