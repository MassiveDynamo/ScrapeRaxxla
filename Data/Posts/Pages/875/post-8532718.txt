My theory - raxxla is a planet in witchspace.
To get to that planet you have to bring some artifacts, drop in a particular system/coordinates, scan/honk/destroy those artifacts.
You obviously know what you are doing.
I think thargoid portal or something similar will open, and there you have it - a door that is also the key.

Easy to hide, cannot be found by accident, not possible to find by data - minig.

I was testing that mechanics too. System is just invisible, same as the starports in supercruise.
