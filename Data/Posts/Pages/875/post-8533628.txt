Here's using the galaxy map on PS4 for LFT 509 / ROSS 59 / HIP 34104. Cannot buy the system via exploration data, but you can buy trade data (for a population of zero?!), so not sure when that was patched.

re: DSS/FSS how does something like Voyager resolve now?
As it used to be only seeable when within 2000Ls, which was kinda tricky even with a direction and distance, and impossible without. I've always thought Raxxla / DW station could be hidden like that (or the comets which presumably still dont show).
