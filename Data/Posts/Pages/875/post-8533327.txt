Traveling by carrier is fun actually. Redesigning my Anaconda on the go, fighter/extra fuel/extra range - just for what region I've landed.
Until comes to tritium ...best my was 600t I could mine, took half of day Then I recharged from cargo and went back. But something like 10000 in any direction from bubble and back seems viable.
