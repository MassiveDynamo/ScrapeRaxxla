Mmm
“several conspiracy theories” makes me doubt that, but I’ll tell you when I find it!
True. But we seem to be running with "an alien artifact, the Omphalos rift", when that is only the account of "several versions of the Raxxla story" ;-)

Edit: I hope there is a sinister cabal. Would be pretty cool to know your onto something because your 50k ly away from home in a "gank magnet" ASP when you suddenly get attacked by 500 NPCs!
