Hello guys,

So, i've been working on the hypothesis of range limitation on DS/FSS and here's what i've found:

I went into Zeta Reticuli and started SCing towards LHS 160 (2.36ly away). As i gathered distance from the bodies in Zeta i've tested both DS and FSS detection many times. During this period i also kept my sensors activated to check for anything out of regular.

My intent was to do a FSS at 1ly range from the main star but since i left the ship steering while i was working i managed to reach a little further than this. Currently i'm at 1.69ly from Zeta-2 Reticuli.

My conclusion is, both DS/FSS work within the system that have been loaded into the game engine, no matter what distance you're from the bodies (max distance tested 1.69ly). If something is hidden +2ly (considering this as the range limit for DS/FSS) from the main star it will be simply impossible for anyone to find without a significant clue, coordinates or different equipment.

Here is the evidence:









Do any of you want me to try anything while i'm still steering far away from this system? I plan to jump out of this soon.

Travel the high path of the Krios Khrysopokos! I guess it makes sense not to have shields on a ship that is named after a cloud nymph.
