This is a really, really, really stupid question, but I'm going to ask it anyways. Has anyone ever tried supercruising into a permit locked system?

I really doubt it would actually do anything, since mechanics for taking over your ship and moving you back into the accepting boundaries exist in the game (like in tutorials and certain areas of outposts like restricted docking zones), but do we know for sure that it stops you? Obviously, this would take a long- time, but I just wonder what would happen.
1.st u will get out of fuel
2.nd between some stars it is possible. However, u will stick into invisible wall, like 30ls prior destination until you do jump which is location loading screen. That was tested on utube.
