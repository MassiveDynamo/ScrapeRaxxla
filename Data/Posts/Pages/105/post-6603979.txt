Perhaps the hint that it can be discovered using a MkIII implies that it is much closer to the bubble than we think

Before I put bank on that as a clue I need to know where that hint comes from and what context it was given. If David Braben ever said anything about Raxxla being within discovery range of a Cobra Mk III then that is totally news to me. I have a sneaking suspicion that hints from the Formidine Rift mystery may once again be mingling with the quest for Raxxla.
