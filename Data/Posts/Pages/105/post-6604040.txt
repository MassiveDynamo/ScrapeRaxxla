Actually, I am wondering if it's in a video as being as text search are not coming up with anything.

I don't know. I'd think that if DBOBE had mentioned anything about Raxxla it would have been pretty well documented. The only thing I've ever heard about him even mentioning Raxxla has been when Drew Wagar related his conversation with David in which he was told, "Itâ€™s out there and we (FD) know where it is." If there is something else out there then it is very imperative that we find it along with the exact words he used and the context of the conversation.
