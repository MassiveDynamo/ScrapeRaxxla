Before I put bank on that as a clue I need to know where that hint comes from and what context it was given. If David Braben ever said anything about Raxxla being within discovery range of a Cobra Mk III then that is totally news to me. I have a sneaking suspicion that hints from the Formidine Rift mystery may once again be mingling with the quest for Raxxla.

I am 99% sure there was a Q&A between at least DB and some other developers about such things; it's related to a previous post I made here, but can't seem to find any links to it now. It's not the talk with MB that is well documented, but way back in time to that event ("the interview"). I've had no success with searches.
