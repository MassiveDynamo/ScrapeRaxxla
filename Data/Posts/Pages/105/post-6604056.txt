Indeed the cobra reference was a part of some interview. My brain may be playing tricks on me but I would say that interview had both Sando and David in it whatever it was.

My autistic "pattern detector sense" also picked up that Alioth bay be an important part to the puzzle. It may actually contain a hint or straight up way to open Polaris. Bifrost reference and the Golden Gate in the same system that supposedly has a crashed vessel that was able to bypass permits.

So, we now have Alioth and Sirius, both having almost exactly same gas giants - one named Waypoint other called Bifrost https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifr√∂st

If that is a coincidence It would be a massive one.

So we have the Gate (Raxxla in Polaris), the Bridge (Bifrost in Alioth) and the Way (Waypoint in Sirius).
