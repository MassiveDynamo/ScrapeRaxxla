Ended up leaving Pluto and surrounds for the time being, was just getting too frustrated with the Horizons content not working consistently.

So many other new things for me to check out, I was easily distracted and soon forgot my irritations. I spent a bunch of time messing around with mining mechanics and taking a look through a lot of the QoL improvements in general. The codex for example is absolutely awesome!

Just for starters, I am super impressed all the generation ship logs I have scanned (among other things) are readily available in-game now.

What sort of problems are you having with Horizons? Have you run an install verification?
