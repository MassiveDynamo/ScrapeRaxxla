Its not the Anemoi nor the Tower of the winds, but its still a little bit curious...

In Greek myth the Anemoi (Greek Ἄνεμοι, "Winds") were wind gods each ascribed a cardinal direction from which the respective winds originated.

Boreas - north wind (in game)
Kaikias - north east
Euros - east wind (in game)
Apeliotes - south east wind
Notos - south wind (in game)
Lips- south west (in game)
Zephyros - west wind (in game)
Skiron - north west wind

The tower of the winds was an Pentelic clocktower in the Roman Agora in Athens, obviously not related to Raxxla as thats a hexagon, but the above gods do appear within the game, but only: north, south, east, west, but none of the others (except Lips, but that could just be because its named Lips and its just one of those odd named systems).

Does this mean something? Likely it doesnt as in game these compass points dont line up in relation to each other let alone anything else I could find. The Raxxla logo doesnt seem to use any compass points (unless its north, south, SW, SE, NW and NE.

Anyway I thought it odd they are in game, but dont seem to line up correctly, nice that their there after all.

There is a certain journey during Masonic initiation you do (at least symbolcally) all by yourself involving cardinal directions. you travel as follows:

West - North - East - South
West - South - East - North
West - North - East - South

Meanings of the directions are as follows:
West - The direction you come from
North - The domain of Death though also the hope for rebirth
East - The domain of "God"/Eternity/Afterlife
South - The domain of life

Might be worth a try, travelling that way.
