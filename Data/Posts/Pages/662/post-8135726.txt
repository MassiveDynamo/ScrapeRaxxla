What if the jewel that burns on the brow is Life perhaps sol and the whisperer in witch-space is the frameshift drive. I may be far off here but when it says... "To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witch-space, the siren of the deepest void!" it could be saying we need to go to the whisperer and point towards the jewel. Sirius manufacture the frameshift drive so perhaps go to Sirius and fly towards Sol. maybe the siren is the neutron star in Sirius (Sirius b) . well anyway it's something to look into perhaps
