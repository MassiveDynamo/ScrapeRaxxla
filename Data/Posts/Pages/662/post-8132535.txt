Its not the Anemoi nor the Tower of the winds, but its still a little bit curious...

In Greek myth the Anemoi (Greek Ἄνεμοι, "Winds") were wind gods each ascribed a cardinal direction from which the respective winds originated.

Boreas - north wind (in game as a system and body)
Kaikias - north east
Euros - east wind (in game)
Apeliotes - south east wind
Notos - south wind (in game)
Lips- south west (in game)
Zephyros - west wind (in game)
Skiron - north west wind

The tower of the winds was an octagonal Pentelic clocktower in the Roman Agora in Athens, obviously not related to Raxxla as thats a hexagon, but the above gods do appear within the game, but only: north, south, east, west, but none of the others (except Lips, but that could just be because its named Lips and its just one of those odd named systems).

Does this mean something? Likely it doesnt as in game these compass points dont line up in relation to each other let alone anything else I could find. The Raxxla logo doesnt seem to use any compass points (unless its north, south, SW, SE, NW and NE.

Anyway I thought it odd they are in game, but dont seem to line up correctly, nice that their there after all.

There are also the four winds of Norse mythology as well https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norðri,_Suðri,_Austri_and_Vestri

Boreas is also a body in the system ‘Hyperborea’, in mythology is was the mythic theocratic land beyond the far north, home of the founders of shrines of Apollo at Delos and at Delphi.

In game Hyperborea is very close to the system Axis Mundi. Hyperborea 5 is also a gas giant with 8 moons!

Boreas is the only named body in that system, in Greek mythology Boreas was the personification of the north wind; this I feel is intentional and identifies this system has being hand placed.
