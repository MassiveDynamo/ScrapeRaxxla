Basically my game is not registering that I have Horizons, although it randomly will allow me to do something like land on a planet but it doesnâ€™t last very long. Few people experiencing the issue on Xbox, as mentioned here.


have you tried saving your controller settings... uninstall the game and reinstalling? Ive had to do this twice in the last four years.
