Flight log is just that, a list of systems the Megaship will jump to every few weeks, just may help if for few weeks its in a lawless or Anarchy. Easier to steal from them there. think Canonn has the full data on most/all of them. Analysis of jump routes I think seems to have gone nowhere and seems to be nothing meaningful.

Be interesting to see if the Galaxy is more 'dynamic' than it used to be as stuff like this has been added in since you last played. Bits of life here and there doing things probably within their own self-contained story.
