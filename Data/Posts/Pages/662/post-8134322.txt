Novice: What is the path to Raxxla?
Elite: Everyday life is the path. No clues...

Novice: Can it be studied?
Elite: The more you study it, the more it will slip away.

Novice: If I don't study and there aren't clues, how can I know there is a Raxxla?
Elite: Raxxla does not belong to the perception world, neither does it belong to the nonperception world.
Knowledge of Raxxla is a delusion and ignorance of it is senseless. If you want to reach the true path, place yourself in the void.


Then to the rolling Heav’n itself I cried,
Asking, “What Lamp had Destiny to guide
Her little Children stumbling in the Dark?”
And—“A blind Understanding!” Heav’n replied.
