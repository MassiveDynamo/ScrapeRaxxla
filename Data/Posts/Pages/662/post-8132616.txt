Flight log is just that, a list of systems the Megaship will jump to every few weeks, just may help if for few weeks its in a lawless or Anarchy. Easier to steal from them there. think Canonn has the full data on most/all of them. Analysis of jump routes I think seems to have gone nowhere and seems to be nothing meaningful.

Be interesting to see if the Galaxy is more 'dynamic' than it used to be as stuff like this has been added in since you last played. Bits of life here and there doing things probably within their own self-contained story.
Ended up leaving Pluto and surrounds for the time being, was just getting too frustrated with the Horizons content not working consistently.

So many other new things for me to check out, I was easily distracted and soon forgot my irritations. I spent a bunch of time messing around with mining mechanics and taking a look through a lot of the QoL improvements in general. The codex for example is absolutely awesome!

Just for starters, I am super impressed all the generation ship logs I have scanned (among other things) are readily available in-game now.
