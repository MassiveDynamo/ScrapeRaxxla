I shall simply thank you for that amazing post, I now have much to think about in addition to the Raxxla mystery! I shall start by watching the Goats movie, the title always put me off previously. And yes, whilst never a great fan of Roland Rat, (no risk of conflating him with any ancient deities I hope,) I do consider this thread a treasure. 07 CMDR.

You're welcome

Rumour has it that close adherence to the mathematical anomalies surrounding the number 6 (3 and 9), has been known to create a temporal bubble of illogical superstition around any ship in the squadron, translating into a zen state loop of shame immunity...

As a consequence, lower level members are known as "Loopers".
