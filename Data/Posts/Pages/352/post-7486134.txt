So I created a "best estimate" version of the Dark Wheel logo from the Codex. Since the left/right of the logo is not visible I had to extrapolate that the logo is circular - I think that's a safe bet.

Possibly the only interesting thing is the fact that the small emblem in the centre of the logo is used on the little book icon (Codex), the Squadron icon and the ship-panel icon (all shown). Is this the logo of the Pilots Federation and, if so, why is it on the Dark Wheel logo in the Codex?

Certainly looks like a Toroid station doesn't it.

With the logo, it might be that it is (or was) actually a logo that indicates independent pilots, rather than it being specifically the logo of the PF. When the founders banded together to form the PF, they may have simply adopted the independent pilots symbol, given that that's what they were.
