One thing that concerned me a little when going to an INRA site to get pictures of the two logo variants was that the site showed up on my Nav panel as Geological Site (5) out of 14. Didn’t show as an installation. Imagine mapping a planet holding a real clue like a new alien site but it shows as a geological site while in SC. Impossible to find at that point.

*correction* that was when going to Jamison’s Cobra. It was “Jamison Crash Site” if I looked for it on the planet itself but “Geological Site (5)” on the Nav Panel

The ship crash site is close to the geological site. They are two separate things.
