So I created a "best estimate" version of the Dark Wheel logo from the Codex. Since the left/right of the logo is not visible I had to extrapolate that the logo is circular - I think that's a safe bet.

Possibly the only interesting thing is the fact that the small emblem in the centre of the logo is used on the little book icon (Codex), the Squadron icon and the ship-panel icon (all shown). Is this the logo of the Pilots Federation and, if so, why is it on the Dark Wheel logo in the Codex?

Disclaimer: Remember there's a possibility that the UI department at Frontier has a butt-tonne of spare logos and just"picked one that looked cool"

Tourist beacon says DW is a clique in Pilots Federation. Small logo is from the ranking insignias.
There is a ranking animation somewhere on the net (will search for it). What Thachinho said have sense.

Great job, btw! I played also, and triangles turned out in pentagon parts (have pic somewhere).

EDIT: from CMDR Mobius



We can see the evolution of rankings, ergo I will buy Indepenedent Pilots origin theory.
