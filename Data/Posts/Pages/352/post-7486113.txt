So I created a "best estimate" version of the Dark Wheel logo from the Codex. Since the left/right of the logo is not visible I had to extrapolate that the logo is circular - I think that's a safe bet.

Possibly the only interesting thing is the fact that the small emblem in the centre of the logo is used on the little book icon (Codex), the Squadron icon and the ship-panel icon (all shown). Is this the logo of the Pilots Federation and, if so, why is it on the Dark Wheel logo in the Codex?



Disclaimer: Remember there's a possibility that the UI department at Frontier has a butt-tonne of spare logos and just"picked one that looked cool"

The logo looks like a orbis starport and center logo is the mailslot
