It is pretty close, couple hundred kilos or so, but the site, when highlighted manually by targeting it with the ship itself showed the targeted area on the Nav Panel as Geological Site 5.

thatâ€™s odd. When I visited I lost the site on entry to glide but reacquired it & then onwards it showed as crash site . Geological site was always visible (after the dss scan).
