It must be pareidolia but I found something very like the Raxxla Codex symbol here (at about 1:57):

This Obsidian Ant video is from 3301 and I just happened to watch it last night because whatever algorithm YouTube uses to recommend content seems to think anything Thargoids-related is good and I didn't realise it was so old at first. What struck me was the layout of the roads and buildings around the captured Thargoid ship (this was from Frontier: Elite 2) and its similarity to the Codex symbol. I'm not sure if this is even helpful (the location is on Capitol, so this was at the heart of the Empire - a strange place to conduct secret research with a ship like that out in the open!). Does anyone who played/is familiar with FE2 know anything more about the location?

It's a standard outdoor landing pad layout, in Fe:2 and FFe.

I'll make a full picture, when I have the time. It's very similar.
