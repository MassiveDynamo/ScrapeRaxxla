Quickly, look under 'R'! Any Raxxlans?


Btw,

while looking for EDRPG: "Elite: Dangerous Role Playing Game (ED RPG) is the subject of an intellectual property dispute and is currently unavailable."

And here's some info that might be canon: https://www.edrpg.co.uk/free-stuff/


I also found this on wikipedia (no source):

"Elite Plus had a ninth galaxy that can only be reached by hyperspacing into Witch Space"
