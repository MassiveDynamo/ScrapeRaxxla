Connie knew about Polyakov, the mole leader, for months while George was moaning about Ann ...
Sorry for the off-topic ...

For all the information we have on the Raxxla mystery Connie may well know the location, bring her a bottle of whisky!
But Polyakov was the go-between, the mole worked for Karla..

must watch that series again, but first The Lotus Eaters!

edit: feel mole hysteria coming on, probably a mild dose of space madness after all those jumps to Canonnia. 509, still 50 odd to go. Then sideycide back for some DW mission running I think.
