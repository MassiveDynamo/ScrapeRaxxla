I'm curious as to who made that map. A lot of those system wouldn't make my list of "The Old Worlds" as they didn't appear in the original Elite.

I picked the map from:

- Old Worlds Page: https://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/Old_Worlds
- wikia image url: https://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/File:Old-Worlds-EDRPG-Map.png

Apparently, its from 'EDRPG' and a good portion of those systems can also be found in 'The Dark Wheel', see my other post for relevant info. I'm gonna take that tour soon-ish to see if I can find more info.
