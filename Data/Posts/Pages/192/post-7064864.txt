Can you please look up:

Dironothaxaurian (some sort of fossil mentioned in Dark Wheel story)
Mymurths (Mymurth = home to the turtle-like creatures that later in the DW story are revealed to be Tharg larvae)
Oresrians (look like and don't want to be confused with Thargs apparently)
Tionisla (is the system, but are there inhabitants called Tionislans or any other reference to it?)
Cirag, Ciragians: they -- as may have been part of the lie -- worship the Tharg larvae, any information might help though

If any of these species' systems are found under other names and subsequently ingame, they might help find Raxxla.

I also invite everyone here to for finding/eliminating Raxxla candidates and any and all relevant systems/regions.
Not sure if that was just quick typing, but Mymurths arenâ€™t Thargoid larvae. The Mymurths being transported by Alex and Elyssia were being parasited by Tharglets. It was the actual Mymurths that Alex was told the Ciragians worship, not the Tharglets.
