I picked the map from:

- Old Worlds Page: https://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/Old_Worlds
- wikia image url: https://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/File:Old-Worlds-EDRPG-Map.png

Apparently, its from 'EDRPG' and a good portion of those systems can also be found in 'The Dark Wheel', see my other post for relevant info. I'm gonna take that tour soon-ish to see if I can find more info.

AFAIK, all games prior to Elite: Dangerous do not have any place in the canon of lore for the game. Certainly, Jameson, Lave (et al), and many of the system 'shapes' (like Sirius etc.) have made it across (as well as TDW and the 'name' Raxxla), but apart from that, all 'information' about history is either dealt to us via the latest game, or is not considered canon.

Others here might have a better slant on that, but I didn't play Frontier or First Encounters; only the original '84 Elite.
