It was a case of scanning the short story for locations and misreading the tharglet bit. Anyway, on the Sap 8 containers: Sap 8 core containers could be core samples from the eighth planet in a system starting with 'Sap'. Since there's only one system with an eighth planet on a star, I thought I'd include it: Sapiticus (8, landable)
