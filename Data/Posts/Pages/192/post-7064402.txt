AFAIK, all games prior to Elite: Dangerous do not have any place in the canon of lore for the game. Certainly, Jameson, Lave (et al), and many of the system 'shapes' (like Sirius etc.) have made it across (as well as TDW and the 'name' Raxxla), but apart from that, all 'information' about history is either dealt to us via the latest game, or is not considered canon.

Others here might have a better slant on that, but I didn't play Frontier or First Encounters; only the original '84 Elite.

Sure, but since we have so little to go on, we're pulling at all the straws here, canon or not. Even if its pure myth (or a disappointing conclusion), the search matters more for me. It's a way to familiarize myself with the (original) lore and mystery of Elite and it is in no small part driving my exploration. Still, considering it is in the galaxy, I think we can find it by looking at it from all the angles, regardless of how close the FDEV Raxxla is to the original idea of Raxxla.
