I smell fish!! See Galnet freelance report 20May3302 Attempt to Sabotage Jaques Station Thwarted. Attempt by members of “The Hands of the Architects” to sabotage Jaques’ fsd in order to cause a misjump on his journey from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point so they might meet Halsey’s “Architects”. And who was this article submitted by? Our very own Jaiotu! Do we have a Dark Wheel mole (or perhaps the founding member of “The Hands of the Architects”? he obviously has inside information!) in our band of merry Rifters Raxxlers??? Clearly this was the inspiration if not the direct cause of the misjump! calling George Smiley, paging Mr Smiley!

No inside information. Just a hunch. Back when we used to get to submit user-created content to Galnet I'd often post articles to try and confirm my theories. Frontier usually wouldn't publish an article if it predicted something that they were planning to do themselves. When they published that one I took it to mean that Jaques was going to make the jump just fine without any interference. I was wrong.
