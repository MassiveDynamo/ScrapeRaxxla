Ive tried to: misjump there,
How can we missjump? With a damaged FSD drive?
I always thought it is a pity the ships don't need to be serviced to function properly like in FE2.
That would have limited exploration in the early days but the star density is adequate anyway and if the ship has a capacity of, say, 200 jumps before needing servicing it would have given a true role for longer jump ships, and now to mobile repair station aka Fleet Carriers).
Or maybe that is the true role of some ship logs/nav computer I have seen mentioned, and about which no function have been found. They embed a false certificate that allow a jump to be done, a faked permit.
