It says the system is locked by the PF, needs a permit, but that PF does not deliver permits for this system.
Does it mean someone outside PF does or that it can be accessed by other means??
No idea, I’ve had no tea so the gray cells aren’t firing properly. But I would presume logically if a ‘faction’ is named that permit can be accessed.

Then we have to consider the narratively locked areas, those large bubbles of space locked by FD at launch and presumably linked to their ongoing narrative.

Now for in-game context, I think (don’t quote me) that the PF locks these areas for ‘safety’ reasons.

Look at those, if the permit description is identical then that permit is in my opinion unavailable and more likely narratively gated.
