It’s been a real while since I looked at permits. But for clarity what does the Galnet textual description say regards the permit status?

For instance from memory I believe if it says ‘permit required’ or the like it likely can be unlocked. If it were to say ‘unknown permit’ then there is no permit that can be activated.

This is what led me to investigate the Polaris permit via support some time ago, to seek clarification about these various descriptions, to which FD stated the Polaris permit was not currently accessible to players and might become accessible in the future (ergo narrative) so logically any similar written description I would accept means that permit can’t be found by us at this moment in time…
It says the system is locked by the PF, needs a permit, but that PF does not deliver permits for this system.
Does it mean someone outside PF does or that it can be accessed by other means??
