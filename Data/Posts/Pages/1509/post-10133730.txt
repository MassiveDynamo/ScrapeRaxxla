Could someone fill me in on what these Trinkets are in reference too and the importance of the Pilot Federation?
Trinkets : https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Trinkets_of_Hidden_Fortune
Once upon a time, it was an item requested by The Dark Wheel (the faction in Shindarta Dhezra, which is not necessarily the fabled inner cicle of the Pilot Federation) in a quest offered to players, that has been removed (inactivated) from the game. Maybe the quest has fulfilled its role so it was closed, maybe it is for other reasons we don't really know.
The Pilot Federation controls everything behind the scenes. They don't have an army or a public political representation but they deliver ranks to pilots, can close off systems completely and grant permits. They have a big influence on the Powers and Superpowers, some believe an inner circle of the Pilot federation is the true force driving events in the galaxy aka The Club.
The Dark Wheel may or may not be part of the club, it is a secretive group of highly skilled pilots looking for Raxxla.
In my opinion TDW oppose The Club, which controls Raxxla.
But this is speculation only. What we know for sure is what is written in the Codex (right panel inside your ship), even if the content may have been intended to mislead us....
