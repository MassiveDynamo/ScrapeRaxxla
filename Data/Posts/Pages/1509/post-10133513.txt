Ever noticed Witch's Reach ?
The system description says the Pilot Federation forbid access and that no authorization are delivered and yet it is a Federation system.
In comparison Polaris doesn't say anything, only permit required and no other information.
Polaris, according to reported system data gleaned from the Fleet Carrier bug, seems to be unpopulated so the permit lock might be a future storyline development &/or just a nod to its role in one of the previous games.

Witches Reach is interesting, since PF here is IMHO TDW (we are told in TB theyâ€™re a faction if PF). Ive tried to: misjump there, follow an npc there, worked in the area to try & get the permit. Many have tried to crack that nut. Of the unknown permit locks that seems to me to be the most intriguing.

Try taking Trinkets and jumping there!
