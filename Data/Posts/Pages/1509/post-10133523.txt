Polaris, according to reported system data gleaned from the Fleet Carrier bug, seems to be unpopulated so the permit lock might be a future storyline development &/or just a nod to its role in one of the previous games.

Witches Reach is interesting, since PF here is IMHO TDW (we are told in TB they’re a faction if PF). Ive tried to: misjump there, follow an npc there, worked in the area to try & get the permit. Many have tried to crack that nut. Of the unknown permit locks that seems to me to be the most intriguing.

Try taking Trinkets and jumping there!

It’s been a real while since I looked at permits. But for clarity what does the Galnet textual description say regards the permit status?

For instance from memory I believe if it says ‘permit required’ or the like it likely can be unlocked. If it were to say ‘unknown permit’ then there is no permit that can be activated.

This is what led me to investigate the Polaris permit via support some time ago, to seek clarification about these various descriptions, to which FD stated the Polaris permit was not currently accessible to players and might become accessible in the future (ergo narrative) so logically any similar written description I would accept means that permit can’t be found by us at this moment in time…
