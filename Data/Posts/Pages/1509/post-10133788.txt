Awesome thank you.

Was reading the Raxxla codex entry again and was thinking about the 'whisperer in witch-space...' line. Has anyone ever encountered a longer than usually FSD jump? There are times where it takes 5x longer to arrive at my targeted system. I wonder if there's something we would need to do while in 'witch-space' that triggers an event. OR maybe what I'm simply experiencing is just latency issues...
