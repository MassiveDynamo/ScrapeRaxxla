PF control the nav computer and thereby implement all system permit locks. So I dont think the descroption means the Witches Reach permit cannot be obtained; we just dont know how or where or from whom. It may be linked to a TDW storyline that nobody has found yet, or maybe itâ€™s a later storyline...

I did try misjumping in the early days, because it features heavily in the books, but 5en someone reported that FD had said it wasnt implemented...
I think Witches Reach is some Fed navy thing. At least there were Fed Navy convoys with UAs onboard, entring and leaving Witches Reach on mai 4th 3301. The first or second UA were liberated close by.
