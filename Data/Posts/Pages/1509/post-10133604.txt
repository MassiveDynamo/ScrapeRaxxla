That would be a valid reason for its galactic-wide ban. If it contains something that allow to bypass certain PF made limitations.
Who else has the power to forbid it everywhere, if not PF ?
Not even slaves are forbiden everywhere!
PF control the nav computer and thereby implement all system permit locks. So I dont think the descroption means the Witches Reach permit cannot be obtained; we just dont know how or where or from whom. It may be linked to a TDW storyline that nobody has found yet, or maybe itâ€™s a later storyline...

I did try misjumping in the early days, because it features heavily in the books, but 5en someone reported that FD had said it wasnt implemented...
