How can we missjump? With a damaged FSD drive?
I always thought it is a pity the ships don't need to be serviced to function properly like in FE2.
That would have limited exploration in the early days but the star density is adequate anyway and if the ship has a capacity of, say, 200 jumps before needing servicing it would have given a true role for longer jump ships, and now to mobile repair station aka Fleet Carriers).
Or maybe that is the true role of some ship logs/nav computer I have seen mentioned, and about which no function have been found. They embed a false certificate that allow a jump to be done, a faked permit.
Unfortunately this amazing concept has never made it into game, it did form part of the very early mechanics for Exploration but FD dropped them all for this vanilla version we have now.

Mis-jumps should have been one method for us to randomly find dark systems. And, applicable mysteries which were we presume hidden within them.

Sadly FD threw away these mechanisms and I feel it significantly impacted how this game is played and perceived, I don’t know if this was intentional because FD want it to be more accessible or if it was more of a quick-fix, let’s look at it later… hang on wait what’s that over there… dinosaurs?
