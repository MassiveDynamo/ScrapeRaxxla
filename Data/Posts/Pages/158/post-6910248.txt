Waiting for the Perseids shower peak next week here on La Isla Bonita (La Palma), decided to look for Raxxla IRL in the meanwhile (http://www.iac.es/divulgacion.php?op1=16&id=1349&lang=en). A star almost as old as the universe.
La Palma Skybox right now:
SPOILER
Tomorrow, going to climb to the GTC (http://www.gtc.iac.es/) in order to use the big means.
SPOILER
Also, some news from Tabby's Star, an iconic candidate for Raxxla:http://www.iac.es/divulgacion.php?op1=16&id=1332&lang=en
