As I always say, IMHO, this Quest line involving TDW was MB's baby (..the sequel will be played out in the game...). He left, so did the last crumbs of fantasy in this game, leaving us with SS's "creativity". (NaCl is cheap)

If they really stopped the Raxxla mystery plot line, but left the items in game it would hopefully be an level of crazy beyond SS or even Space Loarch. Fdev typically try to protect their image, and consumer friendly. The potential PR backlash if it ever got out that they had pulled Raxxla complely while still claiming it is in the game could hardly be worth it. It seems more likely something was changed or gated in a way we have not figured out yet. Sap 8's were back in the game aparrently a long while before players at large became aware.(Same goes for the thargoid worshiper missons that ref UAs rather than sensors.) This is supposed to be like the end game mystery so it seems reasonable that it would be hard to solve. Remember the community was able find surface sites from a few frames in a trailer, and figured out the UA/UP morse ship images so any big mystery need to be well hidden/gated to avoid being solved in a week.
