Colonia crash site is most likely a reference to current alien story, similar to comms beacon in Nommai, Communication Hub Zeta, etc. Canonn website is correctly tagged as "Private military outfit" concerning these. Important clue here is: "Not Fed or Imperial".

My last visit to Nommai made me realize that "Private military outfit" is one actually transporting meta-alloys and UA's into human inhabited space. "Scan them". It would seem that one very famous and prestigious organization concerned with defending humanity from the threat of thargoids found out they liked having a monopoly in the business, and it would be a very lucrative one. Seeds of their return. A Great betrayal, and there is a league that already found out about it. There is a story in this game when you go looking for it.

I don't have anything new on Raxxla, not sure if there ever was anything at all. You could see subtle hints anywhere if you wanted to, and it's fine.

Adding all those mysterious salvage items in market screen was bad taste from Fdev though. Like "Mysterious Idol". There is no confirmation whether those items could be found, none have been found, and it still looks like a bug. This game can be all sorts of things you want it to be, and it's beautiful, but sometimes it's just cheating, when there is nothing to be found. Still the same post-formidine rift apathy. The great beauty and tragedy of Elite: Dangerous. Similar in weight to the fact that you should never use a flight stick in this game if a mouse is available.
