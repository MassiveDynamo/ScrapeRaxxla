Assuming you meant Asellus Primus. That is a starting system option with Horizons thus why the PF own it / have a pressence in the system. It was not always like this. IIRC it was one of the systems back in the very first beta bubble (i bootis and aulin being two others that come to mind) Cmdrs have been all up and down that system from the very start. (Unless something new has been added)
