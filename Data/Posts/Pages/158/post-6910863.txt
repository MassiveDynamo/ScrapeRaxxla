Asellus Primus is one of the traditional names for the star Theta Bootis.
Asellus was one of the old constellations that didn't make the cut when the 88 modern constellations were defined in the 1920s.

Why would they bother renaming constellations?! Do they lack lives. I get tired of organization changing things like this. I guarantee you they don't fully know the reason behind why they were chosen originally. Even if they are in the field appropriate for it. People in certain areas are way too arrogant.
