Did you check system description and ages of those suns?

Assuming you meant Asellus Primus. That is a starting system option with Horizons thus why the PF own it / have a pressence in the system. It was not always like this. IIRC it was one of the systems back in the very first beta bubble (i bootis and aulin being two others that come to mind) Cmdrs have been all up and down that system from the very start. (Unless something new has been added)

Mmm, no I didn't...but it in my defence it was 30C+ sat at my PC, and I had had a large Italian meal with wine [blah]

yes, that’s the one. It struck me that Asellus is a genus of marine creature & so is the barnacle.......and Primus seems to suggest some importance.
wasn’t aware it’s a starting system & was suspicious of PF involvement. It strikes me that PF are related to the Guardians, witness the common use of the triangle/hexagon motif. I suspect the PF are a better bet to follow for clues than the DW, but there doesn’t seem much to go on.
