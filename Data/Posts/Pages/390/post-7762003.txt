Suspicious isn’t it! And you’re other half would be Three, and there are a lot of triangles in ED, including the basis for the rotating hexagons in the HUD. Admit it, youre a Raxxlan in disguise adding to the obfuscation to keep us from finding the goal!
Good point.

I would like to point out to anyone finding triangles / patterns to go have a look at this quite funny and interesting watch on youtube, about 1 hour of your time.
Science 101 by Matt Parker from 2010.
Altough a bit low quality (DVD) this is still one of the best summaries I've seen from Mr. Parker, the later one's are just excerpts from this one.

From 5-6:00 minutes he'll be hammering your mind with what we humans are wired to do.
Pattern analytics is a quite tough challenge.
