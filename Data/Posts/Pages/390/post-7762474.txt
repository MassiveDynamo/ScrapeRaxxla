I kind of doubt that Raxxla will reveal it self from regular scanning and probing. 20 000 years is probably a bit low.
Well, I hope to last long enough to find it, but as a pensioner 20,000+ years is pushing it a bit...
Even with my current strategy of preservation in alcohol (lavian brandy, naturally )
