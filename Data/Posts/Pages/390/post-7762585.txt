DW just posted this to his twitter and Website on the second anniversery of the Salome event! Not the text. Apparently no one noticed it last year. Maybe it is dark wheel related? (Premonition has a lot of what appear to possibly be Dark Wheel characters in it.)

Best first guess at the left side text: (looks to be a calligraphy font)
ZL/YNFG/ERDHRFG/VF/GUNG/LBH/NYJNLF/.../ERZRZORE
VIA CANONN DECRYPTOR (That thing is awesome!!!!)
My Last Request is that you always ...Remember

So Remeber is likely the key for the text on the right?
