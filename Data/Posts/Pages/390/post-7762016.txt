Do we know, roughly how much of the galaxy has been explored now? I was a little stunned to see in the Codex that I had visited 3000 systems, without exploring too much, mostly inside the Bubble. I consider myself a newbie. I know the galaxy is huge, but how many systems are accessible? Is it literally hundreds of billions?

In that case, if Raxxla was located at the far side of the galaxy, it seems that it would take some time to find it, unless someone was very lucky?
Accordingly to EDSM:
0.009639% of the galaxy has been discovered on EDSM, it will take 39,934 years, 8 months, 9 days to discover it entirely.
EDSM listed only stars reported by 3d party software directly from commanders who use it, but this is exactly that rough estimate you wanted to see.
So, if we exclude all permit-locked regions, we can estimate roughly 20 000 years to find Raxxla by brute-force exploring
