Accordingly to EDSM:
0.009639% of the galaxy has been discovered on EDSM, it will take 39,934 years, 8 months, 9 days to discover it entirely.
EDSM listed only stars reported by 3d party software directly from commanders who use it, but this is exactly that rough estimate you wanted to see.
So, if we exclude all permit-locked regions, we can estimate roughly 20 000 years to find Raxxla by brute-force exploring
I'm entirely certain someone could easily write a program that would essentially find raxxla.
