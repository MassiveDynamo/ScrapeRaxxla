Well, I'm not even sure we're any closer to finding Raxxla than when this thread was created. But so far the journey's been fun, tho.
And even though I've never tried to hunt Raxxla, nor do I understand half the stuff that's said here, I've always enjoyed reading about it. Keep up the good work everyone (however many forum pages it takes).
