What if ciphers like that are what they use in their name generation systems. Did anyone every figure out the name generation for the different elite games?
Sort of, all I can say without breaking any copyrights, the name-generation is based on a carefully constructed string. It should be the same as used in early Elite games. However it changes depending on version/edition.

You can get the source for the name-generation in several online repositories for the Oolite universe.
One place is the "Oolite interactive map":
Oolite Interactive Map

Via 3dOoliteGals.js you can read & reconstruct the name-generation from the "function getSystemName(w0, w1, w2)"

If you wish to play the Oolite edition (sorry, getting offtopic) have a look here: http://www.oolite.org/download/

Sorry, I thought it would be nice to share this, but I'll stay away from responding anything that goes offtopic Raxxla from here on.
