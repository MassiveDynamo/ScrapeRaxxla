What if ciphers like that are what they use in their name generation systems. Did anyone every figure out the name generation for the different elite games?
Did the live stream video D2EA made give any results? He ended up with a list that was pretty narrowed down.

Do we know, roughly how much of the galaxy has been explored now? I was a little stunned to see in the Codex that I had visited 3000 systems, without exploring too much, mostly inside the Bubble. I consider myself a newbie. I know the galaxy is huge, but how many systems are accessible? Is it literally hundreds of billions?

In that case, if Raxxla was located at the far side of the galaxy, it seems that it would take some time to find it, unless someone was very lucky?
