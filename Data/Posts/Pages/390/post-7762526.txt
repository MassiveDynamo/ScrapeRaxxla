I kind of doubt that Raxxla will reveal it self from regular scanning and probing. 20 000 years is probably a bit low.
Most probably you are correct. I think it behaves like Voyagers and will reveal itself in contacts in close proximity only. In this case it can be in any system, even in the Bubble or nearby.
