RAXXLA DREAM ABOUT.

This will not help in the quest but thought I would share it anyway.

Last night I dreamt I found a thing floating in space called raxxla, it was a yellow cube with a black line grid pattern over it. I scanned it and it unfolded to be like a map grid, in each grid there were black spots with swirly white spirals around them, some elipictal some circular. I pointed my nose at the biggest black spot (hole ?) in the top left corner and then after a swoosh through space and steering to avoid star as useal I found my self in a galaxy where the stars had no names, deciding I should retrace my steps I turned my ship looking for one of those cube things and as the local star came into view on my left, well that was when I woke up.

Went to bed 11.30 pm,ish bst after ED session, woke up 5.10 am my bedroom window faces South so plenty sun in the morning.
