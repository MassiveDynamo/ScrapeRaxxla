The bubble I am referring to i discovered on EDSM. Here is the description:
"The Local Bubble is a cavity in the interstellar medium thought to be the result of a supernova explosion within the past ten to twenty million years. Hundreds of light years across, the bubble was created by gas blown into the interstellar medium by stellar winds and eventually expanded even further by the blast waves of a supernova.

The interstellar gas swept up by the expansion of the bubble has later cooled, forming a (relatively) dense shell of gas and dust around the cavity. The Solar System lies near the center of this old supershell, whose boundaries can be traced by a sudden rise in dust extinction of stars at distances greater than a few hundred light years.

The Local Bubble interstellar cavity does not coincide entirely with 'the inhabited bubble' - the vast sphere of star systems centered on the Sol system, that has been settled by humanity. Even so the two regions are in fact close enough to avoid most misunderstandings when referring to 'the bubble'.

The Local Bubble should however not to be confused with the very small spherical volume of unrestricted space that was opened for independent pilots in early 3300, following an extended period of severe restrictions to independent space travel. This small sector of space is also sometimes refered to as ´The Bubble´."

The lore I am referencing about the age of Raxxla I read on the forums somewhere.

The discovery of Raxxla by humanity if it is in the "Local Bubble" (per EDSM) would put it close enough to Sol to be discovered early in the days of exploration (I think)

The transmissions I refer to come from INRA locations:

While looking into these (as they are referenced as a possible link to Raxxla) I found that someone had charted some(or all?) of them on EDSM and they almost all reside within the same "Local Bubble"(See above)

I'm probably connecting dots with non existent string, but I'm having a good time doing so.
Hope that helps!
