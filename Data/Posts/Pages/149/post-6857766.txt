A few days ago I thought there was something irregular in the witch space jump, like second star hovering next to destination star, but it is entirely plausible I was just a bit tired. Raxxla being in a fixed location only determinable by seeing something in witch space jump is interesting idea though.

In this same line, I have always been interested by the star cluster, always the same, we can see passing again and again... It reminds me one I've seen in the Rift region.
