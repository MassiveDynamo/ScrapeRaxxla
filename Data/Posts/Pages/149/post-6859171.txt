I suppose for FDev this whole Raxxla thing is a game they simply can't win at. They have very little control how it would turn out once it gets put there. It might only exist as some sort of background thing in developers mind, or something like that, like it has been in previous games. Generating questions in livestreams could be as good as it gets. It's also possible they just took that risk and had the effort of creating something that nobody likely ever would see. Content like generation ships are quite the opposite, it's been made certain they will be found out swiftly, and I would believe there are none hidden anywhere until they add a new one.

It's interesting thing really, I think in many ways Elite : Dangerous has been "intended" as different game compared to the game many players are playing. I think it's a very common thing for game developers. Cobra engine does pretty accurate simulation, even in supercruise your ship "really" is there, it's not just magic. Procedural generation creates very "real" places. It all has to work in VR. BGS system + mission board can be quite complex affair. The coffee machine in that Krait mkII is there even if you've never looked at it. They have to somehow keep things functioning properly in 2P2 enviroment. Plenty of stuff, or coherence, like this gets unnoticed. In it's own way CQC is perfect, yet it's a bit of a horrible disaster too. Scanning thousands of icy rocks, eyeballing planets, interacting with megaships and structures, it's all also quite pointless and yealds very little reward.

Creatures that would even be capable of surviving ammonia worlds, ammonia gas giants, or the void, would pretty much look like Tardigrades, or Thargoid Sensors. Yet we are saying these were things created by thargoids.

I think the star cluster in witch space animation looks like density of B class stars in IC 1805 Sector.
