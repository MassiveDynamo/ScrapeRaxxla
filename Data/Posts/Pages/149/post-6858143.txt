Would be too obvious...[haha]. This one (NGC 1502 iirc) was my first hype when I first left the Bubble... Like many others Commanders I guess.

Mine was when I set off Riftwards, and somewhere in the area of the California Nebula, spotted a group of stars in a similar shape to the layout of the first Guardian Ruins. Permit Locked as it turns out. And shape changes depending on where viewed from obviously!
