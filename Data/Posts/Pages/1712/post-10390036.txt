Some of those missions were by Pilots Federation apparently actively against the Dark Wheel faction! Which is interesting since TDW is a faction within PF (according to a TB somewhere, probably in Shinrarta-remember the TB in SD originally had around 5 different spellings for PF!). Which made me think that storyline was based on internecine conflict within PF, & I suspect lore will eventually be revealed that one PF faction (probably the one that controls cartography data and implements the sector permit locks!) is controlled by Guardian AI/descendents. But I suspect FD decided that storyline was all too complex and decided to concentrate on Thargoid War pew pew....
Itâ€™s just game mechanics. They are both factions in the same system. The game just takes random factions as mission giver and target as long as there is influence conflict. For special missions, like E/F the available giver factions are limited.
