Case in point the DW missions… FD NEVER admitted these were removed. They ALLOWED customers to engage actions which had ZERO applications in game…. Because as they admitted (granted via an interrogation via customer support) to have REMOVED said content…to have in their word paused that story…
Anyone who engaged with The Dark Wheel in Shinrarta Dezhra when they were told repeatedly that they were a sham should be ashamed. It wasn't like the books, the game, and the codex (added later) didn't make it abundantly clear that were a complete and utter sham. That isn't on FDev. That's on the CMDRs. It is on the CMDRs for not taking this whole thing as a series when there clear evidence of continuity and the credits themselves (and the Guiness Book of World Records says as much). Don't blame FDev. The CMDRs themselves put themselves into this mess on their own. We had some CMDRs loudly proclaiming this couldn't even be the same universe. The CMDRs didn't investigate, they blindly believed whatever they were told when the series started in system with a leader that was known propagandist. That isn't on FDev. The CMDRs were openly informed about misinformation and ran with it anyways.
