. I honestly believe if Raxxla is in game, then FD turned off all mechanisms engineered to finding it,
Why would they ( Frontier ) just do such a thing and then sit by idle twisting their evil mustache just watching the playerbase posting everyday in this nearly 2000 page thread?

Seems like that would be an extremely cruel thing to do toward your own playerbase, no?

I've worked with many DEVS ( coders ) over the years and while yes there are sometimes 1 or 2 workers who have palpable contempt for their "customers" , i find it very hard to believe in this particular case & game that Frontier would allow such a blatant dangling-of-the-ultimate-carrot whilst knowing all along the proverbial carrot was rotten ( or fake ) .

Let the search continue imo , unless/until such time as someone OFFICIAL says/proves otherwise.
