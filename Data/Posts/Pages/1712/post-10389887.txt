Going back to the thargoid map, I wanted to see if I could get it to show on my spec app I have.

I was plesantly surprised seeing a second half of the map.

below is the screen grab.

Note - I ripped the audio from "Thargoid map - Elite Dangerous" vid on youtube and literally had my phone by the speaker.

The top (left side) is cut off a bit on my device but you can see it has almost a mirror image below (right) that lines up with the images.

I can't play with it on the app as it only does a live image.

Let me know if you have an audio feed that I can test on this.
