Some of those missions were by Pilots Federation apparently actively against the Dark Wheel faction! Which is interesting since TDW is a faction within PF (according to a TB somewhere, probably in Shinrarta-remember the TB in SD originally had around 5 different spellings for PF!). Which made me think that storyline was based on internecine conflict within PF, & I suspect lore will eventually be revealed that one PF faction (probably the one that controls cartography data and implements the sector permit locks!) is controlled by Guardian AI/descendents. But I suspect FD decided that storyline was all too complex and decided to concentrate on Thargoid War pew pew....
