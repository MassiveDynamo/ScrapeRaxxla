Well…. The missions did not necessarily advocate the faction was legitimate, some of the missions were actually from the PF to investigate the DW…so the implication was there from the outset, so that’s a moot point.

Irrespective those missions were promoted by being included (at that time) and potentially hidden by a (broken mechanism) as a series of actions to undertake, asking players to engage…irrespective of the outcome with unique content directly likened to Raxxla.

The point was - FD did not communicate they changed this, they did not officially confirm those missions were actually removed!

By not doing so they advocate such actions or mechanisms persist. Irrespective its poor communication on their part, and evidence they change things and bend the rules to suit their objectives, they are the dungeon master, if they said Raxxla now is a made out of solid gold and is in the shape of a 100 foot long human leg, that’s evidently their prerogative, we don’t control the story, the science does not matter.

The lore and what is in game ‘might’ but nothing is certain.
