Honestly I can believe it.

But my ramblings are purely speculative, they are not aimed towards injecting doubt. Only to apply clinical discipline, the absence of which I feel sometimes clouds our understanding.

We have gone over this hundreds of times, and with experience it’s wise to advise we keep the following in mind.

We don’t know why FD do things, it’s their game not ours, they are not a AAA company, they probably make decisions based upon practical economics not our satisfaction nor desires.

If a narrative is not working or gets made redundant, they will and ‘have’ altered things.

Nevertheless, the Codex I now believe is ultimately the key.

Everything else; yes it gives context and weight, and yes possibly even direct insight into the wider picture or architecture, but we don’t know really what works and what doesn’t, but it’s evident FD change things, it’s possible not everything is connected, or exists only separate, but linked indirectly via an environmental connection.

Nevertheless I do however believe we are very close to deciphering the Codex, I really do, we’re close.
