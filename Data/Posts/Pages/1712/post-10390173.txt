Itâ€™s just game mechanics. They are both factions in the same system. The game just takes random factions as mission giver and target as long as there is influence conflict. For special missions, like E/F the available giver factions are limited.
I think it went deeper than that. There were definitely 5 different original spellings (recently corrected) of PF in the SD tourist beacons (I posted a few times on that), it was possible (I did it) to get Allied with at least two of those factions (and I think it was @davanix who Allied to a third)- one by completing normal missions in SD and another by Thargoid scout bashing/Rescueing passengers from damaged stations. That fitted with the hypothesis that one of those factions was the "real" TDW and that fitted with a "TDW storyline", which may (or may not) have led to a disused and hidden space station...but I suspect that whole gameplay was deemed too obscure and FD decided to concentrate on solely the Thargoid War storyline. In response to @ Rochester's queries FD did eventually say they had "paused" something, so I guess it is possible that storyline might be resurrected at a later date (possibly after the Thargoids have been defeated).

P.S.
Have changed my signature avatar- it's an alien dragon!!
