Brilliant. I have been looking for that story. Haven't read it in about 30 years. I did not remember the name Links Hammer.

I'm also missing:
Genuine Thargoid by Moira Sheehan
Ruined Blood by Jude Jones
Invisible Enemy by Kathy Braben
Lucifer Falling by Julian Flood
If you have them by any chance, please post them.

One might assume that the techniques of DNA synthesis have in fact improved, by 3300 and our Commander is rebuilt from the ground up, every time we die.
This story has the best explanation of why we have magic escape pods. Something we didn't have in the old games.

Julian Flood has his short stories published on Amazon - i found versions of Lucifer falling and Children of a Greater God there… I say versions because it looks like he kept the story the same but changed the location - well atleast in the case of Children… dont know about Lucifer. Children of a greater god takes place on a planet called Dub in his short story - he expands it into a larger story -making the bit used in elite - the first chapter. Lucifer falling is a short story about diving to earth as a sport…. Oh and interesting coincidence with name Julian and character of Julia in MBs book…. Oh also Hammer in JFs book is always getting resurrected…
