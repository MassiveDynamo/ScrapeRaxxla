I can only speculate that it’s possible there could have existed various unknown aspects, which are no longer active.

I can attest to two at best. The DW missions were removed; the Trinkets were linked and that story was paused.

We can be relatively certain then that FD do change direction and do amend the narrative to suit themselves or pause storylines outright.

This was the basis of my initial research, as I wanted to identify areas where energy was not needed for investment.

Ultimately I believe the Codex is the key, any ‘historical’ information simply adds weight or context. I honestly believe if Raxxla is in game, then FD turned off all mechanisms engineered to finding it, and that it (and equally likely) and the DW station are in game, but one can only find them by stumbling over them.

The Codex I speculate might be then a redux of this original concept and retelling of the story albeit in a truncated format, I think they are telling us where to go certainly, but we need eyes to see to understand the destination.
