Which made me think that storyline was based on internecine conflict within PF, & I suspect lore will eventually be revealed that one PF faction (probably the one that controls cartography data and implements the sector permit locks!) is controlled by Guardian AI/descendents.
May I suggest doing some light reading on Augustus Brenquith. If you want to know where Pilot's Federation got the source of its data to launch Omphalos Infotech Universal Cartographics look no further than Jaques and Augustus Brenquith (Brenquith is mentioned in "...All that Glisters"). There are reasons the Big Three of the BigSix of corporations for the Club conspiracy is Saud Kruger, The Sirius Corporation, and The Achilles Corporation.

Jaques' "glistering legacy"
Brenquith's "glistening legacy"

That was absolutely intentional.

Also, it is no mistake that Jaques is old enough to have founded Pilots' Federation, setup shop in Shinrarta Dezhra, built the first Coriolis, built a personal army out of Lave, and been the first Elite Commander. See the whole faked death of Peter Jameson in Riedquat followed curiously by Facece containing Peter's Wreck (planet) and Peter's Base (first Coriolis built by Jaques).

At this point, the only real outstanding question is whether Jaques is the Guardian Military Construct or the Civilian Construct?

Pray this isn't the Civilian Construct because the Federal vs Imperial conflict has all the signs of a continuation of Guardian Traditionalists vs Progressives (up to and including orbital bombardments). Humanity is fighting a proxy war for another species. I am also not sold on the fact that Guardians and Thargoids are well and truly separate species. If they aren't, this conflict is millions of years old. The Club conspiracy may well be progressive branch and The Dark Wheel the traditional branch. It would explain a whole lot.
