My point entirely. Much of what made it to game may not have an applicable real life explanation, and probably won’t make sense. It is a game after all, and people seem overly expectant that ‘everything’ makes logical sense in game - it evident does not, for various reasons, but likely because FD just made it up so it could work…

Eg in the start if you ran out of fuel in deep space, a random text based cut scene occurred that said a passing NPC gave you a bit of fuel…
Counterpoint: David Braben explicitly called this "dystopian, hard science ficition". That means there is scientific basis for things being the way they are in the game.

"Obviously the previous games have been big influences, but I've been a science fiction fan for a very long time and I've always liked the harder end of science fiction where there's a lot more justification behind the way things happen."
-David Braben

Also, a pertinent reminder from the in-game credits. Frontier Developments considers this the 4th game of the Elite series.
