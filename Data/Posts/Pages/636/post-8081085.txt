either way, it's been stated since the beginning that there will be no in-game or out of game clues in regards to raxxla. So there's no point in looking for any unless that situation has changed (it hasn't).
Now now, don’t spread false news. “there will be no in-game or out of game clues” isn’t what was said.

DJT: Where is Raxxla? MB: Where is Raxxla? ”Well, It's in the Milky Way, but I can't tell you where at this stage, it's a journey that everyone has to travel for themselves". DJT: You have always said there will be no clues. MB: "that is true, but I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious just so that people know what they are doing, there is nothing to be revealed at this stage"

“tiny little bit obvious” suggests there are some clues, the Codex being an obvious example, but I suspect there are others.
