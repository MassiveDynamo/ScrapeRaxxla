There is one more possibility - if the barcode changed depending on the ship's name, then we'd have been given a key to decode that type of barcode. Is it the same on all ships? (seriously clutching at straws though..)


Heres my nameplate from a different ship - (apologies as taken both by and on a potato) It looks to be the same as "deep fernweh", so I suspect it is fluff.
