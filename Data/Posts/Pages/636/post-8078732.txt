Nice, Pa ! Old SciFi classics seem to have no secret for you ! Lynch's wasn't bad... for that time. Villeneuve's, next year part 1 of 2, currently being edited, is very promising. I like what he did with the Blade Runner sequel. Wasn't easy to match Ridley Scott's overwhelming work and keep the mood of the original movie.
@simulacrae, nicely done ! I like it, Thx !
