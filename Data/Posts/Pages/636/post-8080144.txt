Barcodes have a start sequence and a stop sequence and a character set for encoded characters in between . The width numbers carry no more information than the image, so your statement is empty.

Either:
The sequence fits a code-set I haven't come across
The start/stop isn't present, making identifying the code-set harder
It uses a non-standard format ( which is tough without a key as it were)
Its just eye candy and carries no information of use (most likely)
But I learnt a bit more about bar-codes on the way so that was cool

There is one more possibility - if the barcode changed depending on the ship's name, then we'd have been given a key to decode that type of barcode. Is it the same on all ships? (seriously clutching at straws though..)
