What does "A Certain celestial body. Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key. The myth." really mean?

IMO:

A Certain celestial body = It's actually a celestial body. i.e. a planet/moon - not a "state of being" or a "higher vibration" or "witchspace", etc.

Place that isn't a place = Raxxla isn't called Raxxla (because Raxxla doesn't exist, it's just a name).

door that is also the key = Raxxla is the starting point to finding the thing that we're really looking for, it's just the "key" to locating it. (i.e. it's not actually "the portal*", but it's how to get to the portal*)

The myth = "Raxxla" is the myth. The reality is the planet itself, and whatever it contains.

So: "It's a planet, not called Raxxla, that contains info (or a map, or another portal) on how to reach the inter-dimensional portal*."

* when I've mentioned "portal", insert whatever amazing thing it's about here. I just put portal since that's the primary Myth, that there's a portal to another reality/galaxy containing treasure and cool things.
