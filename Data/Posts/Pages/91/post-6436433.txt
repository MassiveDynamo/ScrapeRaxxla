Ha! Interestingly both your answers are very cool, and similar to what I was thinking. Based on this tiny sample size, I don't think it's impossible that if someone had found Raxxla and been asked by Fdev, DB, or maybe offered a special reward if they kept it secret, or even defend that secret, they would have done - at least for a while.

I kinda love that idea!
