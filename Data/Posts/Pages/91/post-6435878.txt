Hanerib, JulesD, madbilly, dizzoballs you've all expanded on the concept of Raxxla/discovery in a really interesting way there. I'm not sure if that angle has been suggested before but it's new to me.

I really like the concept of it being some sort of social experiment by Fdev combined with an emergent gameplay angle.

dizzoballs what would Raxxla have to be to be worth you doing as JulesD suggested and keeping it to yourself or even trying to actively stop others finding it?

As madbilly said, could you trust anyone in the game at all? But what if it was something you couldn't do alone?

I mean - this could lead to some really innovative emergent gameplay, you might even get a small group of trusted people to (for example) move TDW faction out of power in SD so they stop giving out the mission you used as part of the clue to find Raxxla, you might post on the forums and reddit and the like in such a way as to sidetrack anyone who is getting close - etc. You might even derail the Rift thread (another place you found some clues), pulling it off-topic and getting it locked - for example.

All of that kind of thing is pretty interesting, and would potentially create enough build-up to make Raxxla more interesting that just something someone found by honking a system.

There is only one thing that could stop me from screaming from mountaintops that I had found it.
Being asked by FD not to.
