This is stupid, but is anyone near: brairaae ag-w d2-852

It appears unexplored. I randomly ran across it on the galmap. It's a lonely red star in the middle of a giant field of yellow, blue, and purple!

Edit: OOOHH, it's a proto star field. It's a sequence of proto stars. All names with brairaae ag-w d2-# are proto stars by the looks of it. Ok, maybe not all, but there are a bunch. And there are several other values that have them.. Might not be as unique as I thought though. Must have been my map not loading everything.
