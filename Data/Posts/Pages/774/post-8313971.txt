Maybe it's an addition to the 32 from that constelation.

And has anyone done the 1rxs systems clustered in guardian space area?

The muse of memory... Wasn't there a remember raxxla as well as remember for the salome event?! She is also the mother of the 9 muses.

Could the lovers woe and whatnot rever to drama and other things in a more general sense and be related to the muses?

If you type in this: HD 224572

You get two locations right next to each other.

And what if Raxxla is related to colony ships. All other info seems to fit something in the codex. And it was around the time of expansion. Maybe it's a lost colony ship.

Edit: I've been looking at spirograph sector ED-Y D# system. 9 and 12 are both col 70 sectors and off limits. I wonder if they were originally col 70 and the other renamed to spirgraph sectors or was spirograph sector first and they were named to col 70 and locked off.
