The white dot near Sol - its a planetary nebula, should have system inside it if all filters are off. That's what it would be in the black but will have to check this one.

System Map ghost - WHAT? Since when, whats the theories on it? Must be a bug or something just graphical surely? I never spend long enough in the system map to see them or never noticed them. Is it a mountain range?

Someone has a thread somewhere Im sure where they try to catalogue stars based on names, its over my head mostly.
If the white dot near sol is reference to me. It's a background object above the galaxy. I wasn't sure if we knew what they were by name. If you look at sole and look towards polaris it's right between them.
