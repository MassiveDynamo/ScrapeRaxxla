Yes.

They are most evident in Alpha Cygni and Star of India system maps. They pop up after a minute or two, watching the map. They are dynamic objects that grow and morph for a few minutes and then starts to fade. They are quite small. The image is a zoomed hi-res cut out.

Both Alpha Cygni and Star of India have two of them. I have seen one similar in Alpha Centauri as well, but that one is hard to find.

You don't have to be in the system to see them, as long as you have explored the system at some point.

Sounds like a subject worthy of sciencing! Has there been a thread on this phenomenon?
