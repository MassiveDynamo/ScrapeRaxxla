I see that you have a very interesting conversation, but why was my question so harshly ignored?
I can try to answer your third question.

I don't think The Dark Wheel was founded in the 22. century. I suspect it was much later. There is no info on this at all, but I would guess between 2800-3000.

The legend of Raxxla is old. At least 22. century, but it may even pre-date interstellar space flight. My suspicion is that the discovery of the Mars relic gave info on Raxxla and that lead to the start of the mystery.

We don't know if Raxxla has been discovered at all. The Dark Wheel(the book) suggests it has, but we don't know when. All we get is that it wasn't discovered by The Dark Wheel.

Limiting our search distance for the TDW station or Raxxla, based on uncertain dates is probably not wise.
