I'm sorry for this question. Has anyone tried to find origin of the exploration picture? That one on the first post about Raxxla obfuscation. I found only this

SPOILER
The picture is from the Codex(exploration). Like all the other Codex and start screen pictures, it's probably not a real screen shot.
I just found that image interesting, as it's the only example I've seen of a veiled or or obfuscated planet.

It sort of reminds me of these strange objects, that pop up in the system map of a few systems.
