Does this technique also give you the stations within system?

And does it only work by scanning the nav beacon? Does it also apply using fss?
Go to C:/%userprofile%/Saved Games/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous/ and you can find station names in files "Journal.xxxxxxx.log" (dont know what xxxxx are for but there are number. I just pick the last file modified).
In the example below, there are 2 keys: "StationName" and "StationType".

SPOILER: CODE

PS: it's the first time i use beacons so i'm sorry if used them wrong.
