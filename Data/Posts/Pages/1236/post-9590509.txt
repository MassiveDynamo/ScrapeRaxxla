Halley's Comet can be searched for in the EDO galaxy map, and is shows as being in Sol. In Horizons it can be searched for, and after showing a ton of other stuff in other systems it eventually shows that something in Sol has something with Halley in the name present.
Ooo, interesting! Never tried that!
