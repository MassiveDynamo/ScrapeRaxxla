Hi,

I made a complete list of bodies in the Sol system. This was done by scanning the nav. beacon and taking the data from the Journal log file.

BodyID Body Ring ParentID
BodyID:0 Sol Asteroid Belt
BodyID:1 Mercury
0

Interesting to see that asteroid belts and planet rings are the same thing.
As you can see there are some bodyIDs missing. BodyID: 6 seem to be the asteroid belt (between Mars and Jupiter). BodyIDs 8, 14, 23 and 29 correspond to the rings of the Gas giants.

BodyID: 21 is unknown. It's an orbit between Saturn and Uranus. It could be the fabeled Halley's comet? I would have to do a similar check in Pareco, to get a better idea on how the comets are implemented.

Does this technique also give you the stations within system?

And does it only work by scanning the nav beacon? Does it also apply using fss?
