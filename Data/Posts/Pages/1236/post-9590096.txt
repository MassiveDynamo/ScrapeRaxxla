An unknown body orbiting between Saturn and Uranus???????


Mmmmmmm!!!

“2060 Chiron /ˈkaɪərɒn/ is a small Solar System body in the outer Solar System, orbiting the Sun between Saturn and Uranus.” https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2060_Chiron


I’ve already posited that Chiron might be , but then why doesnt it show on scans? Maybe its the Omphalos Rift?
