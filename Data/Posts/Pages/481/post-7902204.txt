Ship Outfitting And Super Power Weapons

In the very long list of stuff, tips, and tricks I don't know about ED, I can now cross one trick off. Besides working on Operation Less Than Three, I've also been working on my combat Krait Mk II.

You'll notice the Super Power weapons which requires at least 4 weeks signup and rating 3 as minimum to acquire the Super Power specific weapons. Usually I've gone to the Super Power specific CZ's and slowly ranked up with 10 merits per kill. No more of that slow grinding.

Recently I read about the trick and have now tried it successfully, and here it is:
Bonus: Scoop the mats, rank up your NPC crew member and scan the high wakes of the the ones that escapes.
Warning: Do not destroy allied Super Power forces, if you do, merits will be deducted from you.
