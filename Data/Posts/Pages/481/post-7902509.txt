Is it no longer possible to get a van maanen permit? I just turned in some exploration data and achieved allied. Did not get a permit mission or anything..
I just did this a few nights ago. Once allied, pick up the permit from the mission board. I thought at one point they were granted automatically but maybe I've been out in the black too long...
