Was waiting on some item to respawn in the market for a mission, got bored and pulled up the codex for The Federation. For the first time I noticed the first colonies list, Tau Ceti (knew that), (can't remember this one), Beta Hydri, and finally Altair. Did Guru fly this path and try it out, or has it been done? You know, follow in the footsteps of the original vagabonds?
