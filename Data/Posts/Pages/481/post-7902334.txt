Do these weapons/loadout etc. fit the 'in from Beta' criteria?

Are these still regarded as touchstones or do we think the retconning is total - to be more clear: should we filter ideas based on whether they were available in the non Horizons Beta? (Which rules out platentary POIs and a whole load of other things..)
