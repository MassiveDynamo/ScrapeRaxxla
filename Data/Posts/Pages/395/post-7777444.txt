Raxxla is nothing but a myth, a legend, a lie, maybe not started by Fdev but they're certainly using it(codex entry) to keep you in the game especially us Raxxla hunters, as long as we're in game we might spend cash in the store. This is Fdev since when don't they want to show off content they've created, the reason we'll get no clues is because there are none to give. My biggest hint that it's bogus is that comment "It's in the game and we know where it is" Of course they know where it is they put it in the game, why not "It's in the game but we won't tell you where it is" Maybe Raxxla is the realisation that's its all a lie. Sorry to drone on
