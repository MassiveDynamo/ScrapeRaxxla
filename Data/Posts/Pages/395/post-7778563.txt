Hi Raxxla hunters. I have a question.

This stuff about eighth moon of an unnamed gas giant. Is there a log somewhere of gas giants with eight moons? Or any further information by which you can rule out an eighth moon? I ask purely because I've just found a hitherto unknown eight moon gas giant. And I'm probably not the guy you want studying it for clues because I don't know anything.

The Dark Wheel has somewhere, according to the Codex, a stealthed toroidal space station orbiting the eighth moon of a gas giant; they claim to have lost Raxxla in the past-pretty careless if you ask me. Thereâ€™s nothing much to miss out on lore wise -it may/may not show up on fss/dss & possibly has to be found visually. So fly over to any eighth moon you come across, turn on night vision, have a look around, and tell us if you find it.

I checked a couple of systems out towards Beagle Point on DW2, needless to say I have nothing to report!

Some people have compiled a list of such systems from EDSM & are searching in the bubble. Of course it may not be in the bubble......or it may be....
