Something practical to work on.

Can we locate GAl 1-8 based on known info involving the in game planets from elite?

I've gone over Gal maps 1-4.

1 has around 31 instances. It's in an obvious area around lave.
2 has 1 system. Atius.

So far the other galaxies don't appear to have actual instances. But they do get odd search results. Ones I haven't gone over yet. (because of PC problems.)

Does anyone have any idea how to find these gal map grid locations on the modnern map. I bet they could be put into cubes.

As I haven't played the originals I wouldn't know this, but are there other landmarks besides system names usable to find the other system and identify them in ED? Assuming there is anything.
