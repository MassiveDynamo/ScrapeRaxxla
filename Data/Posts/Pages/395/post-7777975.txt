Hi Raxxla hunters. I have a question.

This stuff about eighth moon of an unnamed gas giant. Is there a log somewhere of gas giants with eight moons? Or any further information by which you can rule out an eighth moon? I ask purely because I've just found a hitherto unknown eight moon gas giant. And I'm probably not the guy you want studying it for clues because I don't know anything.
