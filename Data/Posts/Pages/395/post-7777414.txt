From a Lore perspective it must be obscure enough to go undetected for a thousand years. It's hard to make something obvious if it has been the inspiration of explorers and conspiracy theorists for centuries. The Dark Wheel probably have fare more info than than we have, and even they haven't found it.
I'm not convinced that The Dark Wheel have a lot more information than we have, maybe just one or two small clues. The fact that they haven't found it in over a thousand years of exploration tells me that they are probably as much in the dark (sry for the pun) as we are.

The origin of their alleged toast might suggest Raxxla was found and lost, or at least obfuscated, but I would be very interested to find out if that is their real toast: it could just as easily be something to bring the best explorers and mystery hunters to their hidden station, where they can bring them up to speed on the current situation.

As yelboc has said, we first need to pin down the first line of the toast: 'To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies'. I think 'jewel that burns on the brow' is suggestive of a star system and prefacing it with 'To' suggests that we have to go there for ourselves. The big problem with interpreting this first part is the meaning of 'the mother of galaxies'. Ancient myths do not have the modern concept of galaxies, which dates from only the 20th Century (it was still a couple of decades after Hubble's discovery of the extragalactic nature of Andromeda before people stopped regularly referring to them as nebulae, or extragalactic nebulae). That suggests the term has a meaning from Elite Dangerous lore, i.e. who or what would the spacefarers and explorers consider to be 'the mother of galaxies'?
