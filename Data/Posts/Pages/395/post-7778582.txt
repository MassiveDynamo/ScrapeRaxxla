The Dark Wheel has somewhere, according to the Codex, a stealthed toroidal space station orbiting the eighth moon of a gas giant; they claim to have lost Raxxla in the past-pretty careless if you ask me. Thereâ€™s nothing much to miss out on lore wise -it may/may not show up on fss/dss & possibly has to be found visually. So fly over to any eighth moon you come across, turn on night vision, have a look around, and tell us if you find it.

I checked a couple of systems out towards Beagle Point on DW2, needless to say I have nothing to report!

Some people have compiled a list of such systems from EDSM & are searching in the bubble. Of course it may not be in the bubble......or it may be....

I had a bit of a look round - it's the first eight moon gas giant I've found since becoming aware that eight moon gas giants were the thing - but didn't see anything. It's entirely possible, of course, that the big secret dark wheel base is fiendishly disguised as an utterly unremarkable ice moon 60000Ly from Sol.
