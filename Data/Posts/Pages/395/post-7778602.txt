I had a bit of a look round - it's the first eight moon gas giant I've found since becoming aware that eight moon gas giants were the thing - but didn't see anything. It's entirely possible, of course, that the big secret dark wheel base is fiendishly disguised as an utterly unremarkable ice moon 60000Ly from Sol.

Although it would be one heck of a trek to catch a Rohan's Real Earth Ale with the other TDW'ers...
