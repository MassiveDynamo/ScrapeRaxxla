Yes, that's correct - various things there are named as references to Chambers and later authors.

As for Carcosa.
Recently did a deep dive into economies and found some interesting things. far too many to list here really, but to start there are only five anarchist service economy stations and megaships. Carcosa happens to be one of them. Pretty sure you'd all be amazed at what can be found by looking at economies deeply enough.
