It may be time to start working on the idea it is deep space. From the TDW novella:

‘Jason Ryder was convinced that Raxxla existed. That’s why he trained for, and became a part of, the Dark Wheel, the legend-seekers. I hadn’t heard much from him or about him for some time until just before he died, when he told me he’d found evidence for the real existence of Raxxla. He came back from Deep Space to get a proper team together… ‘ Rafe smiled bitterly. ‘But just before he was due to go back, he decided to take a safe-worlds holiday jaunt with his son… and an assassin was waiting for him.’

‘But why?’ Alex asked. ‘Why kill him for finding Raxxla?’

‘Because there are people on Raxxla already. This is only a guess, mind you, but from what happened to Jason I’d say it was close to being right. We’ve long suspected that a corps of Elites lives there, and are exploiting the gateway. They’re powerful, twisted men. Powerful enough to hire an assassin to kill the threat to their dominance.’

I still maintain Raffe Zetter had Jason Ryder killed. He had means, motive, and opportunity. Anyway, more news will be coming in a few hours once I can get a post together on socials (and the forums) on the conversion to deep space research. It is going to be related ultimately to the FFE lore for Thargoids fact and fiction, Dr. Joreb Innitu, and the mysterious 3rd species in the journals. I am convinced that the truth lays somewhere between what went down with Thargoids and Guardians. I plan on announcing a proper framework for the Peacer Movement of Elite Dangerous and plan to organize the the playerbase (and those interested) in something that will create proper game loops for CMDRs like myself. I honestly believe Raxxla must be in deep space.
