What’s the probability this is a graphical anomaly from lensing? Isn’t the sky box just a low res 2D graphic of a starfield plotted by the Stella forge, relative to your position in game around a 3D mesh (still impressive), lensing is just that backdrop being magnified and distorted relative to the BH in that instance.

Could one presume it’s a blocky graphic being magnified?

I generally have an issue with how BH are so poorly replicated in game, eg how stars or bodies in a system with a powerful BH don’t likewise have their graphics warped, let alone Earth like worlds with habitable temps etc, hardly scientific.. so there’s room for random graphical glitches? I don’t understand why this is so important!

What would such an effect look like in video, or image colour saturation filtering?

I’m all for literal doors in space… or monoliths…

The last GIF does hint of a graphical artifact... which is sad as one of the Orion's Belt stars feels like a very auspicious place for such a thing.

Now that I'm back home (not to ED, however, as one of my RAM sticks is gone), I need to copy my Blender model to the desktop and resume the triangulation work...
