I'm pondering whether the logo is an instruction on what to do to find/activate Raxxla/Omphalos.
The central circle and dot could be targeting reticle, and I think I remember the three arcs being the reticle for ship beam laser in the early days (can anyone confirm that?). It would fit ED's palette of interaction tools! however what could it be shooting at? I thought maybe a cargo container (specifically Trinkets of Hidden Fortune), in a dodecahedral station, but I've got three TOHF in the hold and dropped one to check - they're octagonal not hexagonal. Any hexagonal objects??
