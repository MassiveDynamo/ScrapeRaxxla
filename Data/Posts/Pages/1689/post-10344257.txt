Honest question because I frustrated that we still really haven't made much progress:

Are there any waypoints on the way to Achenar we can prove humans actually traversed? Empire is founded in 2296. Sol obviously was the origin point of colonists staking claims across what becomes the Bubble. The things we have that are fairly solid:

- 2097: Departure of first generation ship.
STATUS: CONFIRMED
Location of Mayflower 97: UNKNOWN
Source: Galactic News: Generation Ships

Arrival at Achenar (1st time): DATE UNCERTAIN
Must be between: 2097 - 2296
Details: Marlin Duval known to die in 2296. Empire founded same year. First Emperor doesn't happen until 2320 per "The Line of the Duvals" (TB#159 @ Achenar)

Potential complication w/ 1st trip: Capella (yes it is Federal)
Locations: Duval's Grave, Lawrence's Grave, Gold, Molotov's Claim, Nobleworld, and surface site Dedman Holdings on Nobleworld. There are suspect Coriolis present but these are built much later (e.g. Darkesport).

Secondary complication: era of rapid expansion (TB#168) at Delta Pavonis. This starts in 2230. There is a 66 year gap until 2296. Next major event: settlement of Arcturus in 2304 (system description per GalMap). Home of planet Discovery.

- 2nd trip to Achenar departs from Beta Hydri in Fall 2323 with ships with fuel scoops per Logistical Nightmare in Beta Hydri (TB#177). The Federal battle group arrives about 6 months later. Distance from Beta Hydri to Achenar 117.05 LY. Distance of Sol to Achenar assuming optimal routing 139.45 LY.
