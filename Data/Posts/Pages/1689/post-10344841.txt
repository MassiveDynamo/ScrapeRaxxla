Just updated my Empyrean hypothesis with - Jotnar, associated with the realm of the ‘other’ also known as Mount Jotnar in relation to the tale of Heimdall, which sat on what was described as the edge of heaven.

Heimdall (not in game), lived in Himinbjǫrg "heaven's castle" and he also guarded the Bifrost, it has one station called Crown and was described as ‘having the finest mead’.
