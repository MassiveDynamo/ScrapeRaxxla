What’s the probability this is a graphical anomaly from lensing? Isn’t the sky box just a low res 2D graphic of a starfield plotted by the Stella forge, relative to your position in game around a 3D mesh (still impressive), lensing is just that backdrop being magnified and distorted relative to the BH in that instance.

Could one presume it’s a blocky graphic being magnified?

I generally have an issue with how BH are so poorly replicated in game, eg how stars or bodies in a system with a powerful BH don’t likewise have their graphics warped, let alone Earth like worlds with habitable temps etc, hardly scientific.. so there’s room for random graphical glitches? I don’t understand why this is so important!

What would such an effect look like in video, or image colour saturation filtering?

I’m all for literal doors in space… or monoliths…
