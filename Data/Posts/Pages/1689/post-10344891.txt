I kid you not: Venusian is less than 10 LY from Fortuna. Also, there are some interesting anarchies in that immediate region. I suspect Venusian is connected to the FFE journals and a system referenced by several names New Australia and New Lenin. Communist utopia.

Go to Exbeur (Federal permit). It is about 31 LY from Kitae. It is New Australia. From the Frontier gazateer for Exbeur:

The most successful animals imported to the planet have come from the antipodes of Earth, with kangaroos, duck-billed platypuses and wombats providing a peculiar set of creatures to exploit a foreign ecology. The success of the duck-billed platypus is especially remarkable considering its own precarious existence on Earth itself, where the animal is mainly confined to zoos and breeding laboratories. An ironic turn-about is provided by the rabbit, which wreaked such havoc when it was introduced to Australia on Earth; it completely failed to find a foothold on Sheehanworld. In fact, the Sheehanworld parasite which killed most of the rabbits introduced is now used on Earth to control the population back in Australia.
