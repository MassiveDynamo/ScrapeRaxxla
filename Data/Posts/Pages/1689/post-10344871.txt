Yes I’ve noted all the elements above about Bifrost etc, it’s evident they - and other systems all share this commonality.

The additional mapping I’ve recently applied makes it pretty evident to my perception there is an ‘Empyrean’ layer in game and it has an edge. The localities are striking - once you see them.

I believe its now a certainty in my opinion. The Miltonian model in game is real, and I feel that Jotnar and Fall identity the edge of this Empyrean.

My logic is, if this cosmological construct is real, and not just biased perception of random data, then it’s too complex and too big not to have a meaningful relationship to the position of Raxxla.

In Paradise Lost - John Milton mapped everything out, locations were not abstract, they had orientation in relation to each other, and Eden had a fixed location.

If the Empyrean is certain then the Pendant Globe hangs from one of its wall. One interpretation says its West wall, or North wall, another the East wall, the vertical is an open debate, but I suspect it’s between the area denoted by the Morrigan’s and the outer layer of the zone of Chaos…

The gen-ship link to pirates, I suspect is what the codex might be alluding to about a pirates map…it’s not necessarily an actual reference to a pirates map, just a metaphorical reference that - like other aspects of the codex - there is a location and it’s linked to pirates… it’s just too much of a coincidence to be a coincidence..
