I have a general suspicion that when they set the galaxy spinning it was in tune (as much as it could be)… but with each update, patch, downtime etc... some slippage may have occurred.

But ya i do like comparing against stelarium and seeing if there is a regular difference…. Then we could apply a correction and look for things like hilda/chiron with possibly better accuracy
It’s never been quite i tune, I think. They never reseeded the galaxy after gamma. I think that is why Sol is not in synk.
The easiest check is to fly to earth an see where the Sun alignes. I think it’s quite a bit outside Virgo, at the moment. At least a few months of.
