Ok, still suffering RSI and not fit to fly so going to throw a new variant hypothesis into the arena for someone else to check out.

Dont know where he got that snippet from, but it does suggest Raxxla is a wandering/orbiting body with a period of approximately 50 years. Still favour my “Raxxla in Sol” hypothesis, so are there any bodies in Sol with a period of ~50 years? Yep! ‘2060 Chiron’ () is a 200Km diameter “Centaur” asteroid, which orbits between the outer planets and the Kuiper belt (reminiscent of “obfuscated on the outer rim”?) that may be a minor planet &/or a comet (comet designation 95P/Chiron) with an orbital period of 50 years with perihelion of 8.4311 AU, just inside Saturn’s orbit. Its astronomical symbol () strongly resembles a key (“Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key”?).

It was discovered in 1977, is the first of the Centaur class asteroids, was even claimed by the press at the time to be the tenth planet, and there is a mission proposed for NASA.

So sounds like a good candidate for investigation!

It feels to be in the right ball park. I know there's a rabbit hole here by I'm struck by some of the frankly dreadful English in the Raxxla Codex entry. And yes, perhaps it is that they didn't hire very good copywriters. But I feel that the author is levering in some ungainly phrases in there. The whole Greek myth thing, I think is pointing at Persephone and Demeter and the Eleusinian mysteries. The point being that Persephone disappears for part of the year and reappears for the spring and summer.
