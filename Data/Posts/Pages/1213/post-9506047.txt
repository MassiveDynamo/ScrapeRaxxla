In E: D it isn't visited much, if at all - the permit lock.
What happened in ELITE / FE2 / FFE doesn't matter, just some retconning. :/
It's possible. I just doubt it. FD has basically copied every news article from the Thargoid story in FFE and put them on Galnet or in tourist beacons. They seem to stick to that story (up until it branches).
