Surely Fdev wouldn't require odyssey to find Raxlaa? Actually they probably would...
I would be surprised if they put Raxxla in Polaris. The system had such a prominent role in FFE. It's tied to the thargoid story line.
It would just feel weird. Technically it's no problem, but historically it is a system that has been visited a lot.
