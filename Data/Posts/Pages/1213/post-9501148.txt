It wont be Stellarium - having spoken to the creators, the model of the sky is highly accurate, as best as we have knowledge to make.

Regarding order, yes you are correct - their relative positions should tally. So maybe that makes it easier.

I suspect its more likely that if they are modelled with care, that its based on 2014 or 2000 positions or something like that. Nothing else has been wound forward to 33xx

Given we have the option to talk to 'god' here perhaps we should ask @Kay Ross
Well volounteered!
Didnt Dr Ross leave FD? Do you still have contact details?
