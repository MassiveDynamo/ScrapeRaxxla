Interestingâ€¦ seem to remember her on a FD stream this year talking about Odyssey planets.
Yeah, I'm a little confused, as well. Because her bio on Twitter still says she is at Frontier. And I remember that stream very well, as well as the kerfuffle that prompted Arf to post the "stop harassing people" because people were @'ing her on Twitter. And that was well past 2/2020.
