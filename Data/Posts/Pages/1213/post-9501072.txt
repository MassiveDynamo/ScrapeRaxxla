It’s never been quite i tune, I think. They never reseeded the galaxy after gamma. I think that is why Sol is not in synk.
The easiest check is to fly to earth an see where the Sun alignes. I think it’s quite a bit outside Virgo, at the moment. At least a few months of.

Ya always been impressed with the galaxy generation and how so many stars match up and the alignments... Its probably a bit much to hope that the solar system matches up in its orbits I do remember many moons back there was a plantary alignment of some kind in reality and I went to see if it was the same in elites sol... it wasnt. But ya still fun to play with.
