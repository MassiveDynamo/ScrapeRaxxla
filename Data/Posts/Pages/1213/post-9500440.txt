The difficulty is that stellarium gives the view from a spot on earth's surface, and gives locations in RA/Dec - these then have to be compared with view from a ship which has to be aligned in 3d. So first assumption will be that Earth is in the right place to judge Right Ascension
But if i use earth as center point then the locations for the planets should be the same.
The order of uranus , jupiter and saturn on a straight line should be the same. Not in another order
Edit: My bad missread Chirons orbit
