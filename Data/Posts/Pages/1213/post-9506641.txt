So on my was back from SagA* where I got very excited by the landscape signal. Until I realised I hadn't turned off the background music. I then downloaded audacity and ran a sonic visualiser, looked at whether there was something around 1,420 hz, until finally changing the filter to red/blue...was there something there...yes...obscured faces perhaps? it was definitely reminiscent of the cover of Talking Heads magnum opus Remain in Light album. Hmmm. Back to the bubble to chase up some other leads.
