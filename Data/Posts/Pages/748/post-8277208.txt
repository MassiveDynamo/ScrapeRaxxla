My interpretation from reading was that the twisted men were already there inhabiting it. Also that the guy who killed Jason may also have been part of the dark wheel at one time. the dark wheel and the circle were initially the same organization that split up because Oberon and Neptune had different ideas of what to search for. But I suspect the schism had been building up for a long time. it's too bad there isn't really further detail into the backstory on these organizations.

Now im wondering, is there a Circle (ceip)* minor faction somewhere? Perhaps secretly? And if so maybe we need to work against them

* Circle of elite independent pilots for newcomers to the lore

One thing I learn about story building with most games is there is always conflict. Humanity has Thargoids, The Club will be fighting another shadow organization. Considering the history lore of elite conflict reigns supreme.
