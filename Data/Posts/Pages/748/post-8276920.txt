Good work.

Lyta Crane and the toast are plain DW, so don't expect Raxxla. Look for cold stations at the 8th moons (2F and 6H).

Finished my search of HIP 90883 (T Lyrae A ...), nothing to report!! 6H had already been mapped but did it again just to check. No TDW station appeared at either 2F or 6 H (or any other moon). I’m now thinking TDW and their station aren’t going appear to us until the rep “personal journey” has been completed. The question is who do we have to get allied with to achieve that???

Just been mooching some nearby F & A type systems, just in case the Horizons Start Screen was realistic

Will finish off tomorrow & head back to Sol. Currently on a Lavian brandy break!
