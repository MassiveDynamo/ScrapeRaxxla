True, but does it ever say that the assassin, or “the evil men inhabiting Raxxla” are TDW? The book title perhaps implies that, but since then FD have retconned everything to the point of utter confusion (for me!)
My interpretation from reading was that the twisted men were already there inhabiting it. Also that the guy who killed Jason may also have been part of the dark wheel at one time. the dark wheel and the circle were initially the same organization that split up because Oberon and Neptune had different ideas of what to search for. But I suspect the schism had been building up for a long time. it's too bad there isn't really further detail into the backstory on these organizations.

Now im wondering, is there a Circle (ceip)* minor faction somewhere? Perhaps secretly? And if so maybe we need to work against them

* Circle of elite independent pilots for newcomers to the lore
