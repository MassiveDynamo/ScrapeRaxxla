I'm curious about one thing about Premonition the part where Salome left an emblem in the Seven Veils. It described the one side described it as an Ancient Symbol.

Did we thoroughly look into possibility that the Ancient Symbol is apart of Earth history?

It was only the Imperial/Galnet news that said Salomé left the medallion. I believe later on the book said it was Luko, or perhaps that came out in Drew Wagar’s lore thread (https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/lore-questions.459433/). Luko was a member of TDW, as was Rebecca & Elyssia Fields (spiky haired woman).
