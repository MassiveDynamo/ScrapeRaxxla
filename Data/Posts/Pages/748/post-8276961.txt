Finished my search of HIP 90883 (T Lyrae A ...), nothing to report!! 6H had already been mapped but did it again just to check. No TDW station appeared at either 2F or 6 H (or any other moon). I’m now thinking TDW and their station aren’t going appear to us until the rep “personal journey” has been completed. The question is who do we have to get allied with to achieve that???

Just been mooching some nearby F & A type systems, just in case the Horizons Start Screen was realistic

Will finish off tomorrow & head back to Sol. Currently on a Lavian brandy break!
I have been wondering myself about who to be allied to in order to get the DW to acknowledge me. But the trigger might be that you have to be allied with several factions and once that number is reached you get a call up. Only problem with that is how many faction need to be allied? And I can't believe that trigger has not been reach yet by anyone by now though.
