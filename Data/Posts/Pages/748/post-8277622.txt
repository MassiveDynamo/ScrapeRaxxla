Ok this is just getting silly, we are now 755 pages into this thread and we haven't found a damn thing except friendship, laughter, learning, knowledge, more laughter and lots of silliness, are we trying hard enough I ask myself? Can't one of us just go, 'Oh I know where it is, yes its there just follow me' and be right for once, just once!

According to EDSM it will take approx. 30,000 years to visit every system let alone actually explore or search at our current rate, that's just daft, I cant wait that long. Someone find it will you!

Ah, don’t forget all the lavian brandy!
And the biscuits!!

I suspect someone has found it but it is a secret organisation!
Now who do we know that we haven’t heard from recently? Anyone seen the ninja penguin??
