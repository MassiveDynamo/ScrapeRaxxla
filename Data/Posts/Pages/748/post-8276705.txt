Concecaled? Your proofing mechanism had a glitch there buddy!

I, like many people I think, have always interpreted the codex Raxxla image as a station; however seeing the image again in your dit above, and the reference to trinkets and SAP8 caused me a mental hiccup. Could it be one of the Guardian objects end-on? Can’t remember, it’s so long since I did anything Guardian related, but I’m sure one of those has a hexagonal cross section?

Im going to go with "Concecaled " as one of those fancy future words created after the English language underwent the "Great Consonant Addition" of the 22nd century.

ya while im on my long journey ive beeen thinking about all the possible aretfacts i might need... kicking myself for not atleast flying around with a container of trinkets always.

I half wonder if the sap8 "coordinates" were an early attempt at leading us to the guardians.. was the crystal in the fusion core a compass needle? Cant remember if anyone checked SAP8 canisters for alignments like the UAs...

I like the picture of the back of Jameson Station that looks like the raxxla logo...not sure if it is common to all those types of stations.
