I have been wondering myself about who to be allied to in order to get the DW to acknowledge me. But the trigger might be that you have to be allied with several factions and once that number is reached you get a call up. Only problem with that is how many faction need to be allied? And I can't believe that trigger has not been reach yet by anyone by now though.

I think it has to be the correct allies! Maybe the hint is to take missions from Mother Gaia and see where they take us? Maybe the DW toast is a guide to the factions to get allied with???
