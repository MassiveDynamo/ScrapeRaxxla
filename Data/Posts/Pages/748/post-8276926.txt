The first thing Rafe Zetter does is train Alex to kill the guy that killed his dad. That sounds like an assassination mission to me. In fact correct me if I'm wrong but, isn't that the entire plot of the story? and then the story ends happily ever after when he completes that mission.

True, but does it ever say that the assassin, or “the evil men inhabiting Raxxla” are TDW? The book title perhaps implies that, but since then FD have retconned everything to the point of utter confusion (for me!)
