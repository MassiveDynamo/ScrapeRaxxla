I think it has the be the correct allies! Maybe the hint is to take missions from Mother Gaia and see where they take us? Maybe the DW toast is a guide to the factions to get allied with???

I've been looking into the Standard Missions, but I've also been looking into the Passenger Missions to see what's there, and to see if I can narrow the scope of 'who' might be good candidates to help trigger that elusive invite. There seems to be some commonality between systems/stations. Such as the recent media pass, which seems to have altered most of the factions (Mission and Passenger) contacts to all have sort of 'suits' and then there will be one faction in more casual flight gear or adventure gear per location.

For example, Aegis Core is like that whilst the others are all suits.

Not sure if it means anything, but I think I'll focus on the non-suit people for a bit and see if I can correlate any overlap of allegiance between them.
