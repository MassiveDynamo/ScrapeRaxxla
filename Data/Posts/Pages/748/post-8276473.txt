DW in SD - according to lore its not the real one. But according to FF in Codex any sham DW faction is quickly shut down.

Which leaves that the DW in SD is a front for the real DW elsewhere?

Not sure... But just realized the galactic sectors are numbered, not just named .... so apparently the Elysian Shore is sector 33

Yes there are 42 of them, Meaning of Life, just another homage to sci-fi hidden out there

I’ve said it before, but TDW are supposed to be a band of explorers and adventurers. I can’t see assassination missions being at all their style. Might be we have to refuse such missions to gain weight with them! Anybody explored any possible such refusal mechanism?

This leads onto something Ive been wondering. DW expanded into LFT286 and got a base. Within few weeks they were under attack and in Outbreak, now they are at risk of losing the base. Considering that a lot of players must have supported it in that base, who is pushing them back? Was it a mistake that they expanded and now fdev is pushing them back or is an outside force, player or not. at work? Is someone testing the work against them theory and succeeding in LFT 286?

I think the only 'refusal' mechanism that could be counted is to accept and abandon the mission, not sure if just ignoring something has a counter. Could accept and abandon all assassination missions, see what happens?
