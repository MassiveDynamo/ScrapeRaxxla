Yep. Drew commented about it at some point too, saying that we should remember that the (real) Dark Wheel are masters of obfuscation, IIRC. (My personal take on it is that the Dark Wheel in SD think that theyâ€™re the real Dark Wheel.)

I'm more of a mind to think that the "Dark Wheel" from Premonition think that they are the real Dark Wheel.

The organization has been around for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Spread out across countless light-years. We know that at least one other sect broke away from The Dark Wheel ... The Circle of Independent Elite Pilots. I can imagine that there are numerous groups that claim to be the true descendants of The Dark Wheel. Look at Christianity as an example. At the macro level you have the Catholics, Orthodox and the Protestants. Among the Protestants you have Lutherans, Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Baptists. Throw the Restorationist movements into the mix (Church of Christ, Mormons, Seventh-Day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, etc.) All of whom claim that their tradition represents "true Christianity".

The Dark Wheel of Shinrarta Dhezra are probably one of many expressions of the original Dark Wheel that litter themselves across the galaxy.
