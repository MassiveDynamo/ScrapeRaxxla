Witch-Space



"Witch-Space is haunted. Maybe that's why they call it 'witch'. Time turns all around, and atoms turn inside out, and gravity waves billow up, and things move there, lifeforms, or shadows, or atoms, or galaxies, who knows? No-one has ever stopped and gone outside to find out. Only robot remotes exist there, switching stations, monitors, rescue Droids and the like. Whatever lives in Witch-Space, in the Faraway tunnels, will remain a mystery always."

So we know something is already in witch space, question is how do they get there and how do we get in to it. May be interdiction with Alien ships when they jump. I remember a few years ago getting interdicted by npc outside the bubble, while in witch space and crashing out into normal space, lots of commanders had this done to them at the time, we all thought it was abug at the time, but was it, or was it part of a future planned script. Soon as we mentioned it FD nailed it.

Has anyone broken down the images in witch space frame by frame as it passes the cockpit for clues, to see if any hidden clues lurk there?
