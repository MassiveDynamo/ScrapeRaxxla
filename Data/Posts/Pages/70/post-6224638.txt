Waggar said he received the 'Alien background' writing FD gives to every Elite saga writer and Raxxla was part of it. Waggar wrote Oolite (I know, I know not canon, but ..). Waggar said he doesn't know where Raxxla is. I bet he knows what Raxxla is. Definitely not a planet (not a place), but its access should be on a body (a certain celestial body)
