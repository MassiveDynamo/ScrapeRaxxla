Is there anymore information on Elite Federation anywhere related to ingame activity or locations? Other than the one lore reference and what's in Shinrarta ? As I posted before the lore and Shinrarta both seem to point to obfuscation, an attempt at muddy the waters of their role and place. I don't believe the Founders World in Shinrarta is the Founders World. And my instincts have me believing they relate to the Club or similar.

Another reference for A place that is not a place is the notion of home.

With reference to witch space, that could be a play on words reference to a place that is not a place also. The reference to Raxxla makes mention of a ghost world. It may be a stretch but witch space is spoken of as haunted.

There is an interesting section in Premonition about this
SPOILER




























That is valid lore, but I don't know how much to trust Luko. He isn't the most transparent guy in the galaxy.

Edit: Every h after T seem to have gone missing from the text. Luko doesn't speak that weird.
