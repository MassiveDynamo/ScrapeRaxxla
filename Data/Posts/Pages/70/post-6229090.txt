I've been re-reading from page 1 to see what investigation overlaps I've done, and consolidate my thoughts to do a write up, as i'm going to ease off Elite to catch up with other games.

One thing which I do see circling around every few dozen pages is "Raxxla in Shinrarta", while that's a possibility what about this:

- Elite Federation of Pilots in Jason's time we already powerful
- Raxxla is elsewhere, possibly far away and inconvenient
- shadowy elites that control Raxxla settle somewhere in Shinrarta Dezhra (may not be Founders World), as who wants to base yourself somewhere "on the rim"
- Jason gets his confirmation of Raxxla by raiding / infiltrating said shadowy elite's base
- has trip with Alex, dies

But that allows for Raxxla to be elsewhere, but SD to still be the of the hunt. So your journey is to become Elite, then get the clues in SD to Rax.



This fits how FDev have implemented some other quests too, have the trail start from one place with clues leading you on, but fill in the details when players have actually started.

Is there anymore information on Elite Federation anywhere related to ingame activity or locations? Other than the one lore reference and what's in Shinrarta ? As I posted before the lore and Shinrarta both seem to point to obfuscation, an attempt at muddy the waters of their role and place. I don't believe the Founders World in Shinrarta is the Founders World. And my instincts have me believing they relate to the Club or similar.

Another reference for A place that is not a place is the notion of home.

With reference to witch space, that could be a play on words reference to a place that is not a place also. The reference to Raxxla makes mention of a ghost world. It may be a stretch but witch space is spoken of as haunted.
