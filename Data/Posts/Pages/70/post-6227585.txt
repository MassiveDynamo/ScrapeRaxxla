There's actually a number of Norse mythology system names, I've counted 6 of the 9 realms so far, there may be more. Obviously Jotunheim was recently in a CG, there's also alfheim, niflheimri, muspelheim, midgard, heimr, hel, thor, thors eye, sif.

I was researching something else and this wasn't going where I expected so I stopped there, but I would guess there's a lot more.
