The question is ... FDevs did/kept it unlockable ?

Yeah, I think they did/do...and I think Braben was being cheeky with his "it's out there and we know where it is" comment. I've said this before but I'll say it again....something like Raxxla is virtually no different than any other HMCW, or WW, or ELW, or any other chunk of rock out there..currently. Post 2.4 with new gameplay mechanics or atmospheric landings or whatever, then you can interact with it in a meaningful way....maybe even cross over to Elite: Andromeda. Kind of like Mass Effect did.

Either way...if it's this big bad thing ad they want it to "wow" people, I think it - like most other things in the game - is gated in some way.
