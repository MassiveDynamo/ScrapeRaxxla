To think raxxla requires quad-elite status is utter nonsense, raxxla, and I quote "is a journey we all will take" such requirements would from a developer standpoint would prevent most players from ever finding it, remember it's ultimate goal for straight explorers. Raxxla is more than likely a system that is out of the highest possible jump ranges. It's the only sure-fire way to prevent players from finding it before it is complete. Think like a developer not a commander

Could be. Could be in one of those pulsar system clusters floating in the MW halo... (the very outer rim..)
Could also be a way to reach them through 'exotic' ways ... Oolite-like. A place that isn't a place
