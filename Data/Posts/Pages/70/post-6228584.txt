I've been re-reading from page 1 to see what investigation overlaps I've done, and consolidate my thoughts to do a write up, as i'm going to ease off Elite to catch up with other games.

One thing which I do see circling around every few dozen pages is "Raxxla in Shinrarta", while that's a possibility what about this:

- Elite Federation of Pilots in Jason's time we already powerful
- Raxxla is elsewhere, possibly far away and inconvenient
- shadowy elites that control Raxxla settle somewhere in Shinrarta Dezhra (may not be Founders World), as who wants to base yourself somewhere "on the rim"
- Jason gets his confirmation of Raxxla by raiding / infiltrating said shadowy elite's base
- has trip with Alex, dies

But that allows for Raxxla to be elsewhere, but SD to still be the start of the hunt. So your journey is to become Elite, then get the clues in SD to Rax.

Thatchinho said:
'Because there are people on Raxxla already. This is only a guess, mind you, but from what
happened to Jason I'd say it was close to being right. We've long suspected that a corps of Ã©lites
lives there, and are exploiting the gateway. They're powerful, twisted men. Powerful enough to hire
an assassin to kill the threat to their dominance.'"

This fits how FDev have implemented some other quests too, have the trail start from one place with clues leading you on, but fill in the details when players have actually started.
