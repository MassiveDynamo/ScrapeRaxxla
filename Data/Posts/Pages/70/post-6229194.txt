That is valid lore, but I don't know how much to trust Luko. He isn't the most transparent guy in the galaxy.

Edit: Every h after T seem to have gone missing from the text. Luko doesn't speak that weird.

Yep. Drew commented about it at some point too, saying that we should remember that the (real) Dark Wheel are masters of obfuscation, IIRC. (My personal take on it is that the Dark Wheel in SD think that theyâ€™re the real Dark Wheel.)
