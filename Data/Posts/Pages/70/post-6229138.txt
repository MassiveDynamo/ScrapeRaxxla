Is there anymore information on Elite Federation anywhere related to ingame activity or locations? Other than the one lore reference and what's in Shinrarta ? As I posted before the lore and Shinrarta both seem to point to obfuscation, an attempt at muddy the waters of their role and place. I don't believe the Founders World in Shinrarta is the Founders World. And my instincts have me believing they relate to the Club or similar.

Another reference for A place that is not a place is the notion of home.

With reference to witch space, that could be a play on words reference to a place that is not a place also. The reference to Raxxla makes mention of a ghost world. It may be a stretch but witch space is spoken of as haunted.

Well, some non-canon lore shows Raxxla as sort of actually being witchspace. Non canon but let's remeber MB said the story following the Raxxla writings will be in game.
