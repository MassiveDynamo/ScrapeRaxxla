Isn't that actually two separate missions? Or are you postulating some lore link between SAP8 & AI relics? I can see the logic for trying the SAP8 (as a map container), but not the AI relic.

My imagination wrt to the AI Relics only extends so far as to the AI Relics being a hacking mechanism helping to decrypt the SAP 8 Core container. That being one assumption, other ones are that the Sap 8 Core Container can be decrypted by the Thargoid base map room, and the SAP 8 Core Container crystal shards actually contains pertinent map information.
