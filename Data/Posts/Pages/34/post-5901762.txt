No, there weren't any funky hyperspace conduits in FFE - You docked with a Thargoid transporter ship that took you to Polaris.
I've wondered if it it was a bug (unimplemented behaviour) that it didn't take you back again afterwards, and so you had to find your own way "home"... I think it must have been, as it was one of those things that didn't make a lot of sense when playing the game without foreknowledge of where you'd end up.

Ah. Gotcha. Never got to play through that scenario myself as the flight mechanics of FFE were simply something I never mastered. Even if it isn't a "portal" hitching a ride with a Thargoid might still work.
