I have a mission assignment for anyone interested:

Collect 1 SAP 8 Core Container, last known location: Wolf 903
Collect 1 AI Relics, last spotted in Bunda in Degraded SS, Threat 3. Be very careful, it's a trap with 6+Vultures/Anaconda's. Lost a Python last night.
Collect 1 UA + 1 UP
Transport items to the Thargoid map base and see what happens when a SAP 8 Core container and AI Relics is attempted to be placed along with UA & UP in the placeholders

Theory: Thargoid map base shows a map of Thargoids bases in the Galaxy when a UA, UP & UL is placed in the placeholder. supposedly contains map fragments, the base may be able to decrypt the contents and give leads to the location of Raxxla. As for the AI Relics, well, why not.

As always, it's a Hail Mary Goosechase, Longshot in the dark [smile]

Good luck

An excellent idea, and if I'd had either of them when the bases were discovered I'd have been able to tell you the results!

Well... the results of putting them in individually anyway. Can't say whether I would have actually thought to put them in together.

Anyway, I asked about results with the various esoteric items on the Canonn thread back at the time. I've had a search, but I can only find a specific answer for Soontil Relics (no reaction).

Might be worth someone asking again about the AI relics and SAP8 cores over on the Canonn thread. I'd do it but I'm overdoing it on posts there already and it'd probably stand out more if someone else asks!
