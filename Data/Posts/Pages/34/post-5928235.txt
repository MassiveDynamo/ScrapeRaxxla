Available mission assignment

I have a mission assignment for anyone interested:

Collect 1 SAP 8 Core Container, last known location: Wolf 903
Collect 1 AI Relics, last spotted in Bunda in Degraded SS, Threat 3. Be very careful, it's a trap with 6+Vultures/Anaconda's. Lost a Python last night.
Collect 1 UA + 1 UP
Transport items to the Thargoid map base and see what happens when a SAP 8 Core container and AI Relics is attempted to be placed along with UA & UP in the placeholders

Theory: Thargoid map base shows a map of Thargoids bases in the Galaxy when a UA, UP & UL is placed in the placeholder. SAP 8 Core containers supposedly contains map fragments, the base may be able to decrypt the contents and give leads to the location of Raxxla. As for the AI Relics, well, why not.

As always, it's a Hail Mary Goosechase, Longshot in the dark [smile]

Good luck
