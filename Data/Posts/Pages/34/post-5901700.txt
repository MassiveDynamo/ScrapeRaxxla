No, there weren't any funky hyperspace conduits in FFE - You docked with a Thargoid transporter ship that took you to Polaris.
I've wondered if it it was a bug (unimplemented behaviour) that it didn't take you back again afterwards, and so you had to find your own way "home"... I think it must have been, as it was one of those things that didn't make a lot of sense when playing the game without foreknowledge of where you'd end up.
