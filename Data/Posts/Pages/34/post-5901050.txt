I've re-read the Oolite saga, and it sent my grammar hat spinning. I've yet to read the official stories Drew has done, but considering I've caught up on everything relevant by reading the Raxxla threads on here I'll probably save myself another headache and just flick my tuppence in here.

Sir B said it's in the game, I say it's locked behind one of the exclusions zones. People could find it, *if* they had access to said zones. If I've learnt anything from playing this game, it's that FDev refuses to advance the plot faster or slower than suits their purpouses. Still, I have it on good authority a few Canonn guys have a slight inside scoop where the story is concerned for 2.4, and it's my belief the whole thing is just another thread that'll be tied up when it suits the story anyway.

After spending the better part of a year lurking and waiting to make a "eureka" post, it's kind of sad that this is it. Almost as sad as the day I first logged in and realised the Horsehead Nebula is locked until further notice. I WANT TO BELIEVE that it'll be worth the wait in the end, but i think after all this time it'll be anticlimactic. Heck, even if we get another 7 galaxies to bring us in line with the original it'd basically just be more of the same at this point.

tl;dr - I've stopped dreamin' and decided on hoping against hope season 3 will finally flesh out smugglin' and piracy....and that mebbe Thargoids will have the fun AI we had for a month ere the carebears ruined it.
