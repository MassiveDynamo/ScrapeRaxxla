Sir B said it's in the game, I say it's locked behind one of the exclusions zones. People could find it, *if* they had access to said zones.

I've still got one eye locked on Polaris. Jason Ryder appears to have discovered (rediscovered?) Raxxla around the time of the original first contact with the Thargoids. I think that it is at least possible that Jason managed to get friendly with the Bugs and got their help. One of the possible endings to Frontier: First Encounters had the player traveling to Polaris where the Thargoids open up some kind of hyperspace conduit that sends the player an impossible distance. If it is possible to access this conduit from Polaris then it may be possible that a plethora of destinations could be available and one of them just might be the fabled planet that we're all looking for.
