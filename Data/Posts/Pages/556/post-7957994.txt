LP/UCB link in my signature is now fixed!
(edit: the spreadsheets are Excel & locked; you can take a copy if you want to add changes. I will update the master if anyone notifies me of new data/errors)

Made the mistake of updating to latest Windows10 the other day; since when all sorts of things have gone awry!

Now, can anyone tell me how to change the darned text colour of that darned link in my signature, cos whatever I do seems to be ignored.
Darn new forum infrastructure, darn!!

Filthy windows! <shakes fist at sky>
I dont know if its just me, but in the mobile view for the forums... It seems to drop the signatures.
