I had a similar response to the Formidine Rift - I was so disappointed with the way that it panned out that it made me want to do something else.
I ended up relocating to the opposite side of the Bubble and exploring eastwards - took a 90kLY round trip to the furthest neutron star I could find/reach.

Set yourself some goals that aren't associated with Raxxla and just explore.
Maybe...bit burned out on that, too. With a skosh over 2 million ly's between two different accounts and having just gotten back from DW2...well. I'm currently in a lovely patch of undiscovered on my alt's first proper stay in Colonia. And I foresee being there for awhile.
