I think the thing that bothers me is that FDev didn't apologize for it (that I'm aware of) - they said that the realized that fluff was causing a problem because of Gan, but didn't go as far as saying "Sorry about that guys".

And not only did they not apologize, they doubled down and said the very excitement around the story was the reason it had to die. Victim Blaming 101.

I do appreciate the candor and the clarity, I do...but man...

Anyhow, carry on, CMDR's.
