Right on.

I'll bounce back, I'm sure of it. I was suprisingly gutted when I read the guy's response to the Gan Romero story arc. I thought about all those people that had poured untold hours into looking for him. One chap even has a thread about his search here somewhere. And while(st), in the back of mind, I thought they were foolhardy to do so because surely Ganny Boy was a fluff piece; there was a small part of me that still wanted to believe...that maybe this would be the one story that panned out to having an in game connection....that all those hours wouldn't be for naught. But then to have it so summarily dismissed like it was. 'Twas a right good schawck in the bawbag it was.
