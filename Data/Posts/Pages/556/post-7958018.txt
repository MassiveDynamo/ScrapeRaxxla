I think I'm gonna stop looking. If they actually did want us to find it they wouldn't be silent ASF about it entirely. There would be clues. If it is in game it's probably all glitched out and not supported by ps4 anyways. This is a sad day.
I'll be completely transparent. This whole "Off camera narratives disappearing from galnet" thing has shaken my faith a little bit. Haven't logged on in a week and haven't visited this thread in as much time. I mean, I knew there wasn't going to be an NPC shooting around out in the black named Gan Romero...but for FDev just to admit, so pointedly, that "yeah, just cause it's in Galnet, it doesn't mean it's in the game" has really done my head in. 99% of what is in the Codex is "off-camera." So is it also, like the late, great CMDR Romero, not in the game?

I think I've talked myself into taking a break.
