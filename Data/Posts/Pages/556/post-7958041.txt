I'll be completely transparent. This whole "Off camera narratives disappearing from galnet" thing has shaken my faith a little bit. Haven't logged on in a week and haven't visited this thread in as much time. I mean, I knew there wasn't going to be an NPC shooting around out in the black named Gan Romero...but for FDev just to admit, so pointedly, that "yeah, just cause it's in Galnet, it doesn't mean it's in the game" has really done my head in. 99% of what is in the Codex is "off-camera." So is it also, like the late, great CMDR Romero, not in the game?

I think I've talked myself into taking a break.

I had a similar response to the Formidine Rift - I was so disappointed with the way that it panned out that it made me want to do something else.
I ended up relocating to the opposite side of the Bubble and exploring eastwards - took a 90kLY round trip to the furthest neutron star I could find/reach.

Set yourself some goals that aren't associated with Raxxla and just explore.
