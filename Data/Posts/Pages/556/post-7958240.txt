I felt exactly the same way about the Gan thing. I'm sufficiently jaded that I always assumed that it was fluff, so I wasn't engaged with it, but I can see how it must have sucked for people who did. I think the thing that bothers me is that FDev didn't apologize for it (that I'm aware of) - they said that the realized that fluff was causing a problem because of Gan, but didn't go as far as saying "Sorry about that guys".

They missed a huge opportunity to introduce a new storyline. After seeing the player interest they could have inserted in retrospect a Gan npc, or even an fd player, or just a breadcrumb trail to develop the storyline. Could have led to all sorts of possibilities. The fact that they didn’t, apparently aren’t interested in satisfying their players, is what depresses me.
