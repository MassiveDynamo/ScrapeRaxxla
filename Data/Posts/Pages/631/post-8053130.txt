When, since ED was launched, did constellations be related to any story line ? (I mean a direct relation, not Giraffes and Vain Queens muddying the waters)

Many interpreted the markings that lit up on the UA, as bull heads. When they started to spawn, it was i Taurus. Perhaps it was a constellation hint?
