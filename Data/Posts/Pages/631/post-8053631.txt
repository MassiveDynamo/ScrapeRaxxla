Do we really know?

Many interpreted the markings that lit up on the UA, as bull heads. When they started to spawn, it was i Taurus. Perhaps it was a constellation hint?

Mmm
No, I think the i Taurus is a planned personal mobility vehicle (“car”)
But it will be too big to fit in the garage, and twice as expensive as it should be
But a fantastic user interface!
