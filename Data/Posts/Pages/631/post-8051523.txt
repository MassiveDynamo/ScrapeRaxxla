Depends whether you believe the patronising Empire and the rip-off Federation and the glorious Alliance are really different entities or are basically puppets controlled by the same people / group. If the same then doesnt really matter in the bigger picture that constellations or other bodies arent aligned 'fairly' or 'equally' but may lean towards one or another.

Did read an interesting Canonn thesis once that the Feds are the weapons / army, the Empire are the Medical and the Alliance is Research branch of the same puppet-masters (to be unmasked) so they all serve different roles as such. Anecdotally the Installation mix in these controlled sectors do seem to support this theory but I havent done enough research, if anyone has, to come to a definitive conclusion, but worth keeping in mind I think.

Bias? What bias?
