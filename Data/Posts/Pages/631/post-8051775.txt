Actually the Pleiades is in the Taurus constellation. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades
So in fact one of the biggest mysteries ever was found in one.

Yeah.. Well, you know, we old Rifters spent so much time struggling with constellation tinfoiling for... nothing. (Only relevant stuff were RR-line and EAFOTS, none are constellations)
So, don't struggle, it's easy to understand.
Enjoy your journey !
