Constellations... the thing is, imho, that as most are just "virtual" entities, I mean they "exist" only when someone looks at the Earth skybox, then they appear to me as irrelevant when exploring or tinfoiling in a wider, galactical context. Exceptions: Pleiades and Co.

Thatâ€™s cos the Pleiades is a star cluster not a constellation!
And it has/d goids,
and barnacles
