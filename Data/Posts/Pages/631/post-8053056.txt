Constellations... the thing is, imho, that as most are just "virtual" entities, I mean they "exist" only when someone looks at the Earth skybox, then they appear to me as irrelevant when exploring or tinfoiling in a wider, galactical context. Exceptions: Pleiades and Co.
Constellation are important when myths from earth are interpreted. Otherwise, not so much.

They basically give a vector, without distance.
