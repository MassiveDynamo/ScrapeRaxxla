Do we really know?
Many interpreted the markings that lit up on the UA, as bull heads. When they started to spawn, it was i Taurus. Perhaps it was a constellation hint?
Mmmhhh... When we find Raxxla we will know, then.
But too late.

(Bull heads... Taurus... A human-called constellation as seen from Earth on a Tharg device... meh...)
