Cetus is the proverbial whale, or sea monster, and Tau Ceti is in the stomach of it. Think this was randomly picked as the birthplace for the rumors?

The belly of the whale represents the final separation from the hero's known world and self. By entering this stage, the person shows willingness to undergo a metamorphosis. When first entering the stage the hero may encounter a minor danger or set back.

SPOILER: MINOR DANGER
