When, since ED was launched, did constellations be related to any story line ? (I mean a direct relation, not Giraffes and Vain Queens muddying the waters)
Anyone knows ?

Thargoids dont seem to be too interested in our constellations but in the human created puzzles "Alan Jeffress, Salome, Reynhardt... all used them.

As far as galnet saying something happening in Taurus ... think that would be useless which is why we dont see it happen - but we do get star names from them as well.
