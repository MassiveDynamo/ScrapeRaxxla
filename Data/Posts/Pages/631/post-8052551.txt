There are at least 2 Space Whales mentioned in modern popular science fiction:

1. The one that appeared in mid-air, became conscious and had the moment of enlightenment shortly before going splat. Appeared after the Infinite Probability Drive was engaged along with some geraniums. Technically not a space whale at all but its close - in HHTGG
2. An actual Space Whale that was captured and tortured by HMS Great Britain after the Earth became uninhabitable - In BBC program Dr Who

Yay I contributed something constructive at last!
