If oi waz going to ide a planet I would whack it the middle of a brown dwarf field, only reachable by non-engineered, non Jumponium ships by economic plotting (when the game came out), findable by being next to a fuel star (which could only then be reached by economic plotting, so no one would bother to got here), Col285 Sector maybe? (I fink that is where the Brown Dwarf fields are).
