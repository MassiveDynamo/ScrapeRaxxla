it's not that far, about the same as Jaques' station if I remember.... I guess I could go in my carrier but where would the fun be in that...

When Jaques' station first reappeared I did the journey with a friend he took something sensible... I decided on the ridiculous.... A nice un-engineered Imperial Eagle...Think it was about 8 LY jump range (not in a station to check) and took quite a few jumps and the occasional dead end and range anxiety!

He came back via Sag A*, I used a suisidey....

She's still there as a reminder of the space madness that kicked in about 1/2 way in to the journey ;-)


And ship builds for searching for Raxxla would definitely be within topic...

Out to Jaques in an 8ly Imp Eagle?
You're definitely mad enough to be in this thread!
(Perhaps too much so!! )

Edit
Though it's an interesting thing to mention to people who say Raxxla must be near Sol because of the earliest rumour date and limited early jump range!
