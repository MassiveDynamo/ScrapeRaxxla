Mmm. Does that imply Witch's Reach has Barnacles? Or just a locked off source for early UA gameplay that didnt point to the Pleiades??
I think it pointed to the Feds having some secret research there. There is nothing that suggests that UAs originated anywhere but the Pleiades, at that time. The Wings trailer presents the narrative.
