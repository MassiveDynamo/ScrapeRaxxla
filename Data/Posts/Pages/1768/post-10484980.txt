There are fairly frequent Fleet Carrier trips to Sag A* if you wanted to catch a lift- look on Fleet Carrier discord channel.
OR you could do the trip yourself and hand in your exploration data at the station DW2 built out there:
Explorer's Anchorage
Explorer's Anchorage is an Ocellus Starport located in the Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 system, near Sagittarius A*. It was constructed by the Distant Worlds II expedition and began operation on February 21, 3305. It is the most distant station from Sol, as well as the closest station to both Sagittarius...

If you want I can pm you my Mandalay build. I wont post it here because some newbies view discussion of shipbuilds for Raxxla Questing trips as off-topic

it's not that far, about the same as Jaques' station if I remember.... I guess I could go in my carrier but where would the fun be in that...

When Jaques' station first reappeared I did the journey with a friend he took something sensible... I decided on the ridiculous.... A nice un-engineered Imperial Eagle...Think it was about 8 LY jump range (not in a station to check) and took quite a few jumps and the occasional dead end and range anxiety!

He came back via Sag A*, I used a suisidey....

She's still there as a reminder of the space madness that kicked in about 1/2 way in to the journey ;-)


And ship builds for searching for Raxxla would definitely be within topic...
