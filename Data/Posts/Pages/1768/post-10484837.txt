I haven't tbh, and I'm not really sure they would confirm or deny it anyway, to retain the mystery... I suppose I might as well ask, good idea

I suppose I could at least ask if the images in the Landscape Signal can be resolved further or that's as good as it gets - if Elite were real I'd have leverage my billions of credits to set up a research institute...

Edit: I can't really figure out how to contact support for this, it doesn't really fit into any of the categories. There isn't one for "unresolved mysteries"?
I saw this years ago... don't know if you've watched it...

Whilst I've never ruled it out, it wasn't hugely new to me in terms of linking the landscape signal and Raxxla which is why I didn't get too excited with your hypothesis... Solving the landscape signal would also be cool though....

And at one point playing around with other people's recording of the landscape signal and using various settings I was sure I could see at least one big X, possibly and R and an A and thought it might be a very rough writing of Raxxla, but couldn't get more letters to appear at the time and eventually gave up as I'm not an expert in manipulating audio and spectrographs....

but I am mulling over going to Sag A* for the first time and turning left for the signal and poke about ;-)
