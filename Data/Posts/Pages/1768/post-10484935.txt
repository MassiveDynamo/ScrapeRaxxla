Just dropping in to let you mad lads know that I'm still rooting for you and reading along. o7
I seem to remember many previous posts from you demonstrating that you're as mad as the rest of us! Please feel free to call in sometime for a chat over a glass or three of Lavian brandy; we have biccies (cookies)! Sometimes we even have cake (but not Jaffa, the chocolate melts when we're fuel scooping )
