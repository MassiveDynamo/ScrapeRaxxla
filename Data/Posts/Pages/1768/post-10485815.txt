I don't know about Facece, but there is a link between Witches Reach and Jacques. Witches Reach was one of very few systems that had UA convoys jumping out on UA day (Mai 4. 3301). This was a one day happening, with far more convoys than usual. At least 3 UAs were secured that day.
A large number of UAs was the reason for Jacques miss-jump.

UA= Thargoid sensor.

Augustus Brenquith is as far as I know, just a relic from FE2.
Mmm. Does that imply Witch's Reach has Barnacles? Or just a locked off source for early UA gameplay that didnt point to the Pleiades??
