Yeah, you are right. FDev could have put something in Prism without DW knowing, but that really IS a bit far fetched.

Also the Formidine Rift having anything to do with Raxxla was denied by DW (to his knowing at least), right? They are two separate things?

Edit: Is there a list of handcrafted systems in ED? If we find anything about TDW or Raxxla it must be in those. On the other hand I understand that it's hard to tell which systems have been handcrafted, right?

Exactly, I was just picking up a fault in your logic. I agree it is unlikely that FD have let anything related to Raxxla overlap with the Formidine Rift storyline, but of course it canâ€™t be entirely ruled out.
