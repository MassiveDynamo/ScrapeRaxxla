It is safe to assume there is no connection between DW and FD’s implementation of Raxxla (DW has told us this), but the converse is not proven. FD could have chosen any location in the game, including any of those mentioned in DW’s books, so it is logically not safe to assume the Prism system isn’t involved!

But I’d agree, in my own personal opinion it would seem a bit far fetched.
Yeah, you are right. FDev could have put something in Prism without DW knowing, but that really IS a bit far fetched.

Also the Formidine Rift having anything to do with Raxxla was denied by DW (to his knowing at least), right? They are two separate things?

Edit: Is there a list of handcrafted systems in ED? If we find anything about TDW or Raxxla it must be in those. On the other hand I understand that it's hard to tell which systems have been handcrafted, right?
