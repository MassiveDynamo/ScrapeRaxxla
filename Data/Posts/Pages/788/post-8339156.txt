The Prism system has multiple stars named for jewels, one of which is actually named Diamond. Its also the system in which Lady Kahina Loren/ Salomé's story begins.

Perhaps Sol isnt supposed to be the starting point. In The Dark Wheel novella it starts off above Planet Lave.

V8886 just happens to be one jump away from LFT 926, conveniently the only system where The Dark Wheel minor faction is capable of expanding from. Im not suggesting they know where Raxxla may be, but they could be willing to share some information some of their Elite explorers may have accumulatedsome of which may have clues to chase down for even better information. I understand The Dark Wheel mf has never been expanded since the launch of the game.
Prism system was designed by Drew Wagar and he said in a livestream that his story about Salomé has nothing to do with Raxxla at all. Also the connection between Salomé and The Dark Wheel remain unclear (to me at least. I haven't read his books ...yet). But it's safe to assume that he and thus the Prism system isn't involved in any storytelling concerning The Dark Wheel either.
