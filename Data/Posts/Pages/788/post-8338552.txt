You missed out the best bit on this DAV star! From Wikipedia:
“
In John C. Wright's science fiction novel, "Count to a Trillion" and its sequels, V886 Centauri is called the "Diamond Star", after the crystalline carbon core. In the story of the novel, it becomes the destination of the first human interstellar journey after it is discovered that the star, a ten-decillion-carat diamond of degenerate matter, is not matter at all, but antimatter. An alien artifact called "The Monument" is found orbiting it, which increases human knowledge of mathematics immensely.
In Jim Jarmusch's 2013 film Only Lovers Left Alive, Tilda Swinton's character Eve tells Tom Hiddleston's character Adam about BPM 37093, describing it as a "diamond up there the size of a planet" that "emits the music of a gigantic gong."
”
Raxxla (I’ve said many times I think it’s an alien artefact, probably one of the three Guardian Ark Ships) may not actually be orbiting V886 Cent in-game, but it certainly sounds like a good clue to Raxxla’s location.

Edit: John C. Wright's science fiction novel, "Count to a Trillion" was published in 2011. Just about the right time to impact DB/MB thoughts?

And let's not forget, a "White Point Star" is a type of Diamond found only on the planet Gallifrey.
