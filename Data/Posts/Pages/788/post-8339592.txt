Tin foil hat on:

What if these 33 dots around the Raxxla icon in the Codex is telling us "Region 33", which by the way is where the "Heart & Soul" Nebulae are and it is just before the Formidine Rift.

Also, whenever you enter an Asteroid Station, you'll find those 3 arches from the Raxxla icon glowing a greenish/bluish hue... and there's an Asteroid Station on each of these nebulae.

Adding up on top of it the fact Will (FD Community Manager) said in one of his recent mining live streams: "you're doing it right, looking inside an asteroid".

Tin foil hats for everyone!
