Prism system was designed by Drew Wagar and he said in a livestream that his story about Salomé has nothing to do with Raxxla at all. Also the connection between Salomé and The Dark Wheel remain unclear (to me at least. I haven't read his books ...yet). But it's safe to assume that he and thus the Prism system isn't involved in any storytelling concerning The Dark Wheel either.

It is safe to assume there is no connection between DW and FD’s implementation of Raxxla (DW has told us this), but the converse is not proven. FD could have chosen any location in the game, including any of those mentioned in DW’s books, so it is logically not safe to assume the Prism system isn’t involved!

But I’d agree, in my own personal opinion it would seem a bit far fetched.
