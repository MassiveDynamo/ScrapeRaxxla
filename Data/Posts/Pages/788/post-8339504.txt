Prism system was designed by Drew Wagar and he said in a livestream that his story about Salomé has nothing to do with Raxxla at all. Also the connection between Salomé and The Dark Wheel remain unclear (to me at least. I haven't read his books ...yet). But it's safe to assume that he and thus the Prism system isn't involved in any storytelling concerning The Dark Wheel either.
Salomé was to do with the Formidine Rift Mystery wasn't she?
"and they thought the Thargoids were trouble..."
