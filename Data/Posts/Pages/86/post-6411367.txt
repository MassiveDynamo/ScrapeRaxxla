I don't really think there is enough content in TDW to draw any legitimate conclusions on this quest though.

(Unless of course I read an adjunct version or something - it was the version on the authors website?)

It feels like the idea of the book was to inspire the chase, but give absolutely no legitimate direction to that chase.

If it has been confirmed that Frontier stated Raxxla was in the original game - and then in hindsight this statement has been disproved... I am tempted to err on the side of caution and presume that they lied again about ED. Whilst the galaxy is huge and thus it COULD be there.... it is clear from the manner in which discoveries have happened so close to release that Frontier are drip feeding content into the game at their leisure.

I wish we could get an official statement confirming 100%, in no uncertain terms, that Raxxla can be found in a system, using an Advanced Discovery Scanner, flown up to, scanned using the DSS, and clearly identified as THE Raxxla. @FrontierSupport - any chances of this reassurance?

On a slight tangent - is anyone here contributing to the guardians CG?

EDIT: I have also popped this on Reddit - praying to get enough attention to get some sort of affirmation from Frontier :S
