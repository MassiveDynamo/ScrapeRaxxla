Well all the Thargoids seem to be elite, & nowhere does it say (I think) that those elite pilots have to be human [alien]

As completely implausible as that is, if true it would only lend credence to my theory of Raxxla being near the Bubble, as the Thargoids started appearing relatively nearby in the Pleiades and somewhat close to the Col 70 Sector.
