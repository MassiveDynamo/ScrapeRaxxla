I know, I was attempting to make a joke about using TDW to "prove" anything

Oh sure. Thing is ... TDW proves a whole lot. There are more elements from The Dark Wheel and original game manual that have been confirmed by canonical sources then there are elements that have been dismissed. For instance; the aforementioned Oresrian. We know Oresrians exist and we owe their existence to that passage from Holdstock. The exact circumstance in which the Oresrian was encountered in The Dark Wheel is incongruous but the basic details are spot on.
