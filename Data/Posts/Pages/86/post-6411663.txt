I wish we could get an official statement confirming 100%, in no uncertain terms, that Raxxla can be found in a system, using an Advanced Discovery Scanner, flown up to, scanned using the DSS, and clearly identified as THE Raxxla. @FrontierSupport - any chances of this reassurance?

On a slight tangent - is anyone here contributing to the guardians CG?

EDIT: I have also popped this on Reddit - praying to get enough attention to get some sort of affirmation from Frontier :S

Disagreed.

It's going to be a very disappointing version of Raxxla if it can be found the way you're asking for.

What's supposed to have happened, that the people on Raxxla have decided their 'kill anyone who finds the slightest shred of real evidence that it exists' policy, and changed it to a 'let's actually just register it with UC the PF so we can make sure that it's shown in big bold letters to anyone who stumbles across it"?

Personally I want FD to do something that's in keeping with the myths and legends.
