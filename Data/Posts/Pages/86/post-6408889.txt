Sure but TDW also describes smuggling Tharglets, Thargoids and Oresrians being different (but virtually visually identical species), and loads of crazy Mos Eisley Cantina aliens all over the place. It's entirely possible that those old crazy drunk-on-lavian-brandy inspired tales might have got a few details corrupted in the retellings...

Well ... we have to remember that everything that came after the original Elite and The Dark Wheel has been a retcon or, more correctly, a complete reboot of the Elite universe. The original Elite had a universe populated by all kinds of strange lifeforms.

Our task, when reading The Dark Wheel now, is to read it in light of everything that has come after it ... which means ignoring every reference to Aliens (including the reference to Oresrians hanging out at human starports).

Things we know: Alex Ryder did exist. His existence is confirmed in And Here the Wheel. We also know from that source that The Dark Wheel existed as well and was hell bent on finding Raxxla. Drew Wagar's Premonition hints pretty closely toward Rebecca's companion at the Tionisla Graveyard being the same Elyssia Fields that met Alex at that very same graveyard. I don't think that much else from the Novella has been confirmed by other sources.
