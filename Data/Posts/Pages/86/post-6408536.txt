Give what little we do know, my personal theory is that it’s permit locked somewhere in the COL 70 Sector between the Bubble and Barnards Loop. It wouldn’t make sense for it to be on the other side of the galaxy if a corp of Elite pilots are already on the planet and have been there for hundreds of years before the advent of FSD technology.

Well all the Thargoids seem to be elite, & nowhere does it say (I think) that those elite pilots have to be human [alien]
