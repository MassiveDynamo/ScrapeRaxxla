I'm sorry guys, but I feel sure this is fluff. When ED said no more fluff, they also said....but we will be publishing the rest of the Alliance Festival articles.
Of course it’s fluff. This happened on an ELW. It can’t have any in game representation.
FFE was also full of fluff stories. Even land marks, like streets, parks and castles were stolen.

If there has ever been a hint regarding Raxxla in Galnet, I’m sure it’s in one of the fluff stories.
