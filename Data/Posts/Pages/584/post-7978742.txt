So GalNet leaves at leaswt one more mystery...is the Alliance Festival story just a story finishing off or is it a 'there will be no clues'?

Fernweh - I keep meaning to look into this as a line of enquiry.

Death a journey we all must make - so we have to turn off 'auto-respawn' somehow? I think there's a star system that you have to get to CQC 50 and then reset to 0 to unlock the permit for, don't quote me but do correct me if I'm wrong pls. If so then this M.O. is already in game so not impossible....

cant remember who sorry, said above about DW being able to contact explorers in deep space and needing to leave clues elsewhere to get their attention. Engineers like Palin and Chloe do a pretty good job of knowing when you've crossed 5K LY without needing to get back and sell the data and MB has said that the 'inbox' is specifically for these type of contacts, not specifically DW but other orgs who can contact you without waiting for you to dock somewhere. He also said Engineers are 'monitoring' the pilots and choosing who to send the invite to (that's how it works in MB's mind) so other people can easily monitor the same pilots...
