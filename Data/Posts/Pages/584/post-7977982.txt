Of course it’s fluff. This happened on an ELW. It can’t have any in game representation.
FFE was also full of fluff stories. Even land marks, like streets, parks and castles were stolen.

If there has ever been a hint regarding Raxxla in Galnet, I’m sure it’s in one of the fluff stories.

Yeah, reading that recent Alliance Festival and its Details made me think the same.


I mean they could have come up with any writing and fluff describing the event. So why choose "grand themes of grief"?
Just a keyword match that caught my eye (a bit following "hidden in plain sight" search patterns) but it got me thinking.

Not any smarter than before obviously, but if you were someone overseeing ELITE... wouldn't you get frustrated not a single person ever even came close to finding an exceedingly well-hidden "easter egg" of sorts?

I still go by what the leak said and the official statement and clarification on GALnet vs. fluff vs. in-game content. But yet, these details catch my eye occasionally.

PS.
Disclaimer : currently in Deep Space since weeks, so these kind of thoughts just happen. Blame space madness if you must
