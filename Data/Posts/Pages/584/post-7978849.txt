Why a time machine ? He just could never have spent these suspicious "20 years stranded". Just a lie. Or would it be physically impossible? Can't remember..
Btw, after the December patch, asap depending on my saved money, it will be my pleasure to get you all invited, my excellent fellow-threaders, to visit Raxxla.
SPOILER

because from the evidence re condition of his ship he had arrived there much earlier than she, so how did he know she would misjump there? Could not be predicted since a misjump, hence he must have known after the fact then travelled back in time? Or perhaps a mistake not picked up in proof reading?

or did he really get stranded there for 20 years and then she accidentally arrived? If he was an Elite DW pilot why couldn't he send an emergency rescue message back to his DW pals?

Really must reread all these stories....
