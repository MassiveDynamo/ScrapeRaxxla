I think Luko being a DW recruiter was agreed, and his “stranding” on the cult planet that Salomé misjumped to was fixed (how? Did he have access to a time machine???)
Why a time machine ? He just could never have spent these suspicious "20 years stranded". Just a lie. Or would it be physically impossible? Can't remember..
Btw, after the December patch, asap depending on my saved money, it will be my pleasure to get you all invited, my excellent fellow-threaders, to visit Raxxla.
