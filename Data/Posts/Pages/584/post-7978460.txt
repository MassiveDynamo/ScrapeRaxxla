They didn't say they're suspending Galnet, they're just limiting the content to stuff that can actually be interacted with in game so people don't go chasing fluff pieces and speculation that's totally irrelevant.

Exactly, so since it’s in Galnet means that the Winking Cat is something that can be interacted with.

Though I currently don‘t see how, or why. Good luck in your search Edelgard!
