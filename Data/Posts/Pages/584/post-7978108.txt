Because raxxla is fluff?
There are no articles in Galnet about Raxxla, at all. Potential hints must be hidden inside other stories, If ther are any at all.

I think there are, but not quite the type we are looking for. Take the Tionisla dance show. FD put in words that match up with the Raxxla codex. Iâ€™m sure FD does this on pourpose. Not as a hint of location to us that has read all there is about Raxxla, but as an interest trigger for players that will end up here eventually.

Not everyone knows about the old games and the old books. FD hands out little key words, so they can Google their way down the rabbi hole.
Same as the old Founders missions.
