Wasn't it finally established that the-good-Luko-always-where-and-when-needed, was actually a TDW undercover agent/asset with the task to chaperone the witch?
It's a pity that the conclusion of the FR mYsTerY made him (as well as the other characters created by DW disappear from ED...(or are they back ? The Winking Cat ?)
FD-created characters have not their charism by far, imho.
So flat...

I think Luko being a DW recruiter was agreed, and his “stranding” on the cult planet that Salomé misjumped to was fixed (how? Did he have access to a time machine???), but can’t remember the source-was it hints from DrewW?

(I’m still trying to figure out the giraffe and vain queen clue which I reread on the Tionisla tourist beacon, how did Camelopardis fit into the story?)
