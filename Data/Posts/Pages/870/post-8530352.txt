Hello everyone, first time posting but long time lurker. I'll try to keep this pretty short and straight to the point. Also please do feel free to correct me on anything I may have wrong.

First I believe we've been looking at the toast the wrong way, excluding "To Raxxla" I think we have to complete the toast backwards, first step I believe is reuniting TDW with the lost station. This would be a job requiring the community to do, in my mind this would fulfill the "a journey everyone must take" quote. As well as the part of the toast about yearning and vegabond hearts.

Second the parents grief lovers woe in my opinion just reference the two major factions feds (parents) and empire (lovers). I believe for us to individually gain access to the station we need to raise our standing withing both major factions.

Third I think this would then give us a mission towards either polaris or sagA* fulfilling the siren of the deepest void part of the toast. This would finally lead us to Raxxla the jewel that burns on the brow which in my opinion is the locked system in rykers hope above the galactic core.

I do think there will be a set of missions starting is shindez towards TDW station that will be given out once TDW has regained the station as well as the commander having high status with the 2 original super powers.

I've looked through most of the pages of this thread and don't remember this being a prior theory so do forgive me if this has been brought up before. I hope I'm not wearing too much tinfoil and this doesn't come of as gibberish to you all.

Sorry this ended up so long but for some reason I felt like this time I had to share my idea on Raxxla.
