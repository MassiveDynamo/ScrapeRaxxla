It is VERY easy to missword a question to F Dev. For example the question "Does Raxxla exist in Elite Dangerous" (Sorry if that's a slight misquote - dont have time to look it up again), which prompted DB to say "of course it is"....

Ohhh how I wish the question had been "Is Raxxla currently discoverable and identifiable in Elite Dangerous"

The answer to this, even if "no" or "not yet" would have given us a trail, as the release notes specifically call out "secret added" when appropriate
I've asked FD a couple of times with the following wording during the discussions about the fluff stories and Gan (never had a response):
As you're discussing fluff / non-fluff, could you please confirm the following (in the interest of not wasting players time on non implemented stories) - yes or no will be sufficient - clues not required!:
1. is raxxla currently implemented in game
2. is raxxla reachable (assuming that it is a place) in the current game (1)
3. is the dark wheel station currently implemented in game
4. is the dark wheel station reachable in the current game (1)

(1) i/e it's not in a locked off area that will be accessible in "the future" or not yet considered. It's somewhere that we can somehow gain access to, no matter how obscure, with the game in the current form)

In hindsight there is probably a better way of wording it - perhaps a sub committee needs to be formed to work on the wording in an Adams-esque "deep thought" kind of way
