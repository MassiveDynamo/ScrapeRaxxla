I think you may be correct in that I shouldn't have used the term "currently". Damm it I should've worded my query differently.
It is VERY easy to missword a question to F Dev. For example the question "Does Raxxla exist in Elite Dangerous" (Sorry if that's a slight misquote - dont have time to look it up again), which prompted DB to say "of course it is"....

Ohhh how I wish the question had been "Is Raxxla currently discoverable and identifiable in Elite Dangerous"

The answer to this, even if "no" or "not yet" would have given us a trail, as the release notes specifically call out "secret added" when appropriate
