I've asked FD a couple of times with the following wording during the discussions about the fluff stories and Gan (never had a response):

In hindsight there is probably a better way of wording it - perhaps a sub committee needs to be formed to work on the wording in an Adams-esque "deep thought" kind of way
I wish they would just get on and tell us that the answer to "Raxxla, TDW, and everything" is "42".
At least then we could justify spending the next few years trying to work out what the question should be
