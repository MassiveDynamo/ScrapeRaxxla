I've asked FD a couple of times with the following wording during the discussions about the fluff stories and Gan (never had a response):

In hindsight there is probably a better way of wording it - perhaps a sub committee needs to be formed to work on the wording in an Adams-esque "deep thought" kind of way
I used the following wording myself:

"
I'm sorry for the unsolicited message, but I just really felt I wanted to reach out to a community manager and ask if FDev will/or will ever confirm if any of the following statements are true/false...

Raxxla is currently discoverable
Raxxla is in-game and will be discoverable at some point in the future
It is currently possible to either get an invite from the Dark Wheel / find their station
It will be possible at some point in the future to either get an invite from the Dark Wheel / find their station
Gan Romero story was fluff
Gan Romero story is unimplemented at this point but may be in the future

I'm certainly not asking for clues, but there are a great number of CMDRs who invest a large amount of time in looking for these things (I for one, get up at 4AM every morning, to spend 3-4 hours a day Raxxla hunting), and I think it would be really great if we knew if we should continue to focus our efforts looking for these things, or if we should spend our in-game hours doing some of the other great, fun stuff that is available.

I know you must be busy, but I would be really grateful if you could reply.
"

Just like you, I never got a response, but shortly later, Gan Romero was debunked, if I remember correctly.
