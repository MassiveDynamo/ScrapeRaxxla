Can you explain what you mean?

In codex there is a bit about omphalos rift "Raxxla is said to hold an alien artefact called the Omphalos Rift ".
Said artifact in mythology was used by Zeus to mark exact center of the earth.

So, by reference, raxxla should be where the omphalos rift is.
And omphalos rift is at the exact center.

Center of the galaxy? Center of a star system? Center of a planet?
I don't know.
The easiest center to find is a star system made of two spiralling stars.


I was wondering if that theory was discussed before, that's why I repeated my question.
