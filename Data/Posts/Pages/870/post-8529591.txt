I think DW faction must spread not to LFT509 but to Polaris. If the assume TDW is right faction
In the absense of any other information it seems logical to assume that the DW faction is the key to unlocking the DW station and in turn the mystery of raaxla.
It might be that a different faction in a system surrounding polaris or LFT509 needs to be developed or something different entirely!

I feel that DW & Raaxla are linked, both the DW station and raaxla are hidden behind permits & the SAP8 container has something to do with it however the same bug that has resulted in the loss of the founder / elite missions has prevented the permits from being obtainable. I'm still doing DW missions but haven't seen a founder one for ages (& I'm a founder). Of course I've no proof about any of this, just my theory
