In codex there is a bit about omphalos rift "Raxxla is said to hold an alien artefact called the Omphalos Rift ".
Said artifact in mythology was used by Zeus to mark exact center of the earth.

So, by reference, raxxla should be where the omphalos rift is.
And omphalos rift is at the exact center.

Center of the galaxy? Center of a star system? Center of a planet?
I don't know.
The easiest center to find is a star system made of two spiralling stars.


I was wondering if that theory was discussed before, that's why I repeated my question.

The Omphalos rift of ancient myth could supposedly be the fissure in the earth directly underneath the Oracle of Delphi (later suspected to be an underground stream).

One myth describes it as the location of the rotten corpse of Pytho slain by Apollo, the fettered vapours drifting up to intoxicate the Oracle.

If it were so simple (obvious) then how about a system directly below Delphi...but following the axi mundi, if you were to align Delphi with Polaris?

Not in game for some time, twas an old theory never investigated.
