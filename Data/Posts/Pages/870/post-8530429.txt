Thanks for trying...

Does it "snap to" systems on the PS4 normally to help speed up navigation with a controller?
And did it go close to LFT 509 first each time and then snap to it?


It got close each time, then it snapped. Let me check another system with a secondary star and see if it interacts the same way.
