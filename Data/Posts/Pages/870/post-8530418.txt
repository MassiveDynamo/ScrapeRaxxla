Just tried to recreate on PS4. The Galaxy map goes close to lft 509 point then it auto corrects to the location. Tried multiple times and it always lands on lft 509 from the ps4s Galaxy map.

Thanks for trying...

Does it "snap to" systems on the PS4 normally to help speed up navigation with a controller?
And did it go close to LFT 509 first each time and then snap to it?
