Might be already known by more experienced commanders, but scanning Listening Posts gives hint about things around.
I bumped into this unauthorised installation from a message scanned in Ross 446.
It is an orbital structure.
Couldn't scan it I got attacked by a shield tank elite npc FAS (took his shields down three times, but I couldn't finish the job ^^).
Maybe somewhere in the Bubble some messages are hints toward real TDW, and then Raxxla?
Or is this another worn path?

See my signature links-I keep a summary sheet of all reported LP and UCB. Originally in an attempt (failed!) to predict where they might be located, especially wrt the Thunderchild (GCS Sarasvati) storyline, but also to assist explorers who come across one to see if it is already known.
