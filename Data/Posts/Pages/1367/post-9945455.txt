Might be already known by more experienced commanders, but scanning Listening Posts gives hint about things around.
I bumped into this unauthorised installation from a message scanned in Ross 446.
It is an orbital structure.
Couldn't scan it I got attacked by a shield tank elite npc FAS (took his shields down three times, but I couldn't finish the job ^^).
Maybe somewhere in the Bubble some messages are hints toward real TDW, and then Raxxla?
Or is this another worn path?

I think these are mostly generation ships/megaships and some of the Thargoid/INRA storyline stuff, but there is likely other stuff too, AFAIK nothing TDW or Raxxla related but that doesn't mean it hasn't been found yet or was missed in stuff that was found (or that more have been added). They are generally fun to do, I missed most of them when I stopped playing for about three years. Canonn has good reference sites on them also.
