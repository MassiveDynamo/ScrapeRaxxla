Nope, it is FD! Nothing makes sense!
I’m sure it does make sense to FD, but they are far too inscrutable about some essential details, so it doesn’t make sense to us!
But I still think a Guardian/AI is controlling the PF!

Just wish the Thunderchild storyline had gone a bit further...
Edit: it was the Sarasvati/Thunderchild story that got me trying to predict LP locations & led to my LP/UCB summary spreadsheet
