And as soon as FD turn these permits on, Cmdrs will be quickly notified then flood them in seconds, answering that question and the element of surprise being a moot point.
If I was FD, and in charge of narrative, one of many things I would do is making sure those permits never get completely turned off, and those regions are only ever accessible by commanders who jump through various puzzle hoops to make peaceful alien contact/exploration. Keep all the pew-pew in the open sectors, and let the explorers have their fun. Anyone who ever fought a Thargoid, sorry too bad. Anyone who ever shot a Guardian ruin thing to get a Guardian artifact thing, sorry, too bad. You are never getting those permits.

Saying that as someone who has never shot at a Thargoid of course, and never been hyperdicted. (Was killed by one once when I stupidly got too close, but presumably that wouldn't count).

There are lots of other things I would do too of course.... muah ha ha.
