Mic Turner is a regular player.

Still, there is a tiny possibility that it's an FD controlled player. It's not likely as the Mic Turner from FFE, died more than 50 years ago, but you never know.
Disappeared more than 50 years ago along with the Turner's Quest ship, in FFE they found the black box however in Elite a Galnet article stated he disappeared in it and was presumed dead as never found, Il try dig out the article....actually it was the tourist beacon below

Tourist Beacon 0121, "Mic Turner History"

Mic's explorations had always been in the Northern Edge zones and the development of a number of newly terra formed planets in the region provided the funding necessary for the creation of a Colonising Navy - with Mic, naturally, at the helm. The disputed system of Alioth was ripe for stable government when the Colonists of the new embryonic state moved in and, despite a certain amount of resistance, the fledgling democracy grew and flourished. Alioth developed a solid economy and became the site for the New Rossyth Shipyard, destined to build the Galaxy's greatest ship: the 'Turner's Quest'. This is the ship that broke all the rules and opened new and greater space routes to the dedicated explorer - it is also the ship in which Mic was flying when the final, fatal accident occurred. Details of Turner's death are inexact and the Escape Capsule has yet to be released from custody for full, independent forensic examination. Those of use who knew Mic well do not believe that an asteroid storm would have been fatal to so experienced a pilot. We may never know the real truth of Commander Mic Turner's death - but we are still asking questions.

So they say he died and found the escape capsule however ut was never seen or released
