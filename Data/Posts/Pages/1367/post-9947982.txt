Bill has a something-Quest ship in the cellar. It has caustic damage, so it was probably damaged by Thargoids. The old story had Mic's Quest destroyed by INRA.
There were a few other Quest ships in FFE. None of them seem that relevant to ED. There are no traces of a major Mycoid attack or Mycoid antidote delivery.
It's not unlike FD to retcon things though. Seems if this is the case they want Mic to be goid related in the current lore.
I feel they were doing a lot of discovery themselves with how to tell stories and what their players would do related to those stories, which adds to the whole mess we have of so many routes to choose from.

But if we take Bill's wrecked ship to be indicative of Mic's fate, are we straying from Raxxla?

Jorki - you mentioned a possible (though you think it unlikely) goid - Raxxla angle? What was that exactly?
