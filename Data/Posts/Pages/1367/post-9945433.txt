Might be already known by more experienced commanders, but scanning Listening Posts gives hint about things around.
I bumped into this unauthorised installation from a message scanned in Ross 446.
It is an orbital structure.
Couldn't scan it I got attacked by a shield tank elite npc FAS (took his shields down three times, but I couldn't finish the job ^^).
Maybe somewhere in the Bubble some messages are hints toward real TDW, and then Raxxla?
Or is this another worn path?
