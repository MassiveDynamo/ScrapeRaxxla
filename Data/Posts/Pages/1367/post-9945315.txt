Considering the development evolution of the game, from an audiences perspective, given the various scraps of information, I wonder if FD implemented permit zones with the naive perception that Cmdrs would never bump into them.

This is based upon one or two statements made by DB pre-launch, where it’s assumed Cmdrs wouldn’t / couldn’t explore very far.

I took that from the presumption that early modules would be much poorer, exploration (as described by FD) would be far more complex, and by assumption half the galmap would be missing (dark systems were brown dwarfs)… so most of the mystery was to be in the bubble, which fits with the whole ‘follow the missions’.

Nevertheless that was then, this is now. I just wonder how much that effected their narrative when they realised Cmdrs were willing to circumnavigate the galaxy in a sidewinder.
