Didnt Drew Wagar’s Premonition have a batlle-scarred ship in engineer Bill Turner’s workshop/ship collection covered over but the word “Quest” was visible?
Bill has a something-Quest ship in the cellar. It has caustic damage, so it was probably damaged by Thargoids. The old story had Mic's Quest destroyed by INRA.
There were a few other Quest ships in FFE. None of them seem that relevant to ED. There are no traces of a major Mycoid attack or Mycoid antidote delivery.
