Early morning tea ramblings…

‘Prince Silverwings and Other Stories’ is a 1902 children's book by Edith Ogden Harrison. It’s thought to have inspired the Wizard of Oz…and possibly (can’t find source) is linked to the Pleiades (whose stars I think are referred as spiralling (although I’m likely wrong)).

She also wrote, ‘Princess Sayrane: a romance of the days of Prester John’ - illus. Harold H. Betts (1910)…

Time for another biscuit.
