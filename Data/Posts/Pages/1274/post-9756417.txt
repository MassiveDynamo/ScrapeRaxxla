Cheers! And I agree, a big slice of the fun is the tinfoil-journey



Interesting, I've only read the original The Dark Wheel, so don';t know of the Ryder's extended story.

Sol does keep coming up in my thoughts, and if Shin Dehz turns out to be a bust, that's probably where I'd turn to next!


I've thought that too, but currently discount it as I'm choosing to accept that Raxxla has been in game since launch, or at least fairly soon after.

This is a Commander name, and I think I located the commander, although the commander is no longer using the name.

ANNOUNCEMENT - Game Balancing
It doesn't take skill to find and crack an asteroid, but it does take some skill to do it fast, so the better you're at it the more you earn per hour, at least that's how it should be ideally.. Why this confusion of skill and speed? Elite is more chess than checkers. :D S
