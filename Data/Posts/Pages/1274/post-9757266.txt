The effect is much more noticable on stations that are not palm tree stations or tourist stations.

That was just the image I had in my library (taken because it does look like the Raxxla logo) - where I am right now, there ain't no stations, but I'll take a closer look when I get to the Crab Nebula - Station X

Could you elaborate/annotate the zoomed bit - I get the general gist, but would like to better understand what you interpret each of the markings to mean?
