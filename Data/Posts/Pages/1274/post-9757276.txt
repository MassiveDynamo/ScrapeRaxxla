That was just the image I had in my library (taken because it does look like the Raxxla logo) - where I am right now, there ain't no stations, but I'll take a closer look when I get to the Crab Nebula - Station X

Could you elaborate/annotate the zoomed bit - I get the general gist, but would like to better understand what you interpret each of the markings to mean?
Those things are decorative connections to the inner portion of the rear of the station and they are present on the front but around the ring with toast rack. I think the singular one is the star and the 3 groupings of 3 represents a set of 9 planets. If you start looking at your ship (cockpit and exterior), stations, outposts, etc. You will begin to notice that 6 is repeated a lot. I think the lights at both ends of the stations are important because of this (there are 6 and the form the shape of the Raxxla logo). It's not a name of a system but even something as consequential as which bodies would be landable, total number of bodies, position of the body with Raxxla, etc would be tremendously helpful in narrowing the search.
