The mirroring reinforces the suspicion that they were placed on purpose. The only thing I can think of are Bearing Rate Graphs. However, they are not mirror symmetrical. Also, you don't see any scale. And always only one contact. Maybe its only in Stations were Bugstuff (Targoid sensors etc.) has been sold?
I recorded those signals 6 years ago in v.2.1.0.5 on twitch.
Thargoids had not been revealed, however the UA/UL may have been a reality at that time.

However, I think the signals was detected a bit earlier (I suspect it was with 2.0, in 2015), at the time we were investigating all kind of signals.
The Transmission towers were just one of the cases together with the 'galaxy mountain signal' and some of the others.
