Good luck in your search. A lot of the fun of this Quest is thinking up your own hypotheses and then checking them out.

Cheers! And I agree, a big slice of the fun is the tinfoil-journey

Another interpretation of the 8th moon phrasing is that it’s misdirection, and it could be a moon of the 8th planet, which is a GG. Many people have pointed out that could be Sol’s Neptune (Sol 8), which coincidentally (??) happens to be the name of Alex Ryder’s son & the leader of TDW. His brother Oberon (Uranus IV!) argued with him about the search for Raxxla and formed the splinter group the Circle of Independent Elite Pilots with the goal of using Soontill's power to protect humanity (source: And Here The Wheel). Both names are bodies in Sol, where spaceflight started and since TDW has been in existence since the beginning of spaceflight (Codex) then it is likely that TDW station would be in Sol if it were in-game.

Interesting, I've only read the original The Dark Wheel, so don';t know of the Ryder's extended story.

Sol does keep coming up in my thoughts, and if Shin Dehz turns out to be a bust, that's probably where I'd turn to next!

Another possibility for TDW station is Jacque’s place.

I've thought that too, but currently discount it as I'm choosing to accept that Raxxla has been in game since launch, or at least fairly soon after.

Are they now. I've not heard of them being referred to that way before. Desire to know more intensifies.

Hmm, that makes me reconsider Delphi - I wanted it to be significant because of the Omphalos/centre of the world (universe? galaxy?) connections, but it was renamed to Delphi long after launch, so I've been discounting it for the same reason as Jaques, above.

But I really want it to be significant

Time for another biscuit.

Goes off in search of biscuits.

But before I go, here's a little something I spotted down Pleaides way, en-route to the California Nebula, and beyond:



It's clearly a clue!

And a sign that I'm on the right path!
