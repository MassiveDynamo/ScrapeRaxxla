Spinning / Spiralling / Rotating / Dancing! Just turn of phrase.

Perhaps - but I like that!

I think maybe the Pleiades are my new favourite for 'the spiralling stars' of the Raxxla mystery.

Previously I was thinking it might be Source 2, orbiting Sag A* (CMDR RezaB made a compelling video about that here on yoochoob). - jump to 4:40 for the relevant bit!

I still think that's what the Galnet News Logo is though - Source 2!

The Plieades being 'the spiralling stars' also lets me cling onto the notion that Delphi is somehow relevant for a little bit longer

I've set off on my odyssey (small o! Although I do have Odyssey!), to the Crab Nebula and Rho Casseiopieae! Back in a bit!
