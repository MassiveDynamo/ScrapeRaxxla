Makes me wonder if a bunch of the PVPers already found raxxla or something and are hiding it. Maybe they all ranked up and found this out from all the player killing and bounty hunting.
I think this is likely. There is only one way to find out you know. Also remember when Zarek Null was contacted by the last living Guardian AI or something and declared "the bringer of peace", and then all sorts of stuff happened. Also Deciat in Roman numerals is X.
