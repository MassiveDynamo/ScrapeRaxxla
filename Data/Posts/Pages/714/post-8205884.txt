since raxxla is not going to be hinted at in the game it is highly improbable that any missions or galnet stories etc will provide any clues as to its location.

So it's in an asteroid field. I repeat. It's been (probably unintentionally) confirmed that raxxla exists in an asteroid field.
You know, if memory serves me correctly it’s not the first time I have watched a livestream where someone from FDev has hinted that things may be hidden in asteroid belts. I don’t have time to look up the source video at the moment and I may easily be mistaken.
