it's not easy to keep anything secret in an office. But if they dont know directly, they would know by process of elimination based on how the game generally works internally. There are only certain types of things that wont appear on system maps and the stellar database, and as we've seen in the past it's extremely hard to make exceptions to that behavior (cough*jaques *cough). So in an asteroid field may be as simple as process of elimination. However, i'm pretty sure more than 2 people needed to know where it was to get it in the game and all it takes is dropping a tiny hint to one person for everyone to get the same hint.
