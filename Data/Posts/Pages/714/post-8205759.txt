since raxxla is not going to be hinted at in the game it is highly improbable that any missions or galnet stories etc will provide any clues as to its location.

So it's in an asteroid field. I repeat. It's been (probably unintentionally) confirmed that raxxla exists in an asteroid field.

Hm, very interesting indeed.
I'm back now in very very old Mining Grounds (182.5LY from SOL) and checking old Asteroid Belt Clusters (I remember some of them were huge and not those usual 5-10 Roids).

Looking at the System Map Data of the A Belt Cluster of the System, seems my mind wasn't playing tricks. It seems extremely heavy in total mass when compared to other normal Belt Clusters.

(over 33 Moon Masses, those have to come from somewhere..... )

-- edit --
Hmpf, seems come Client update removed those huge Belt Clusters in the distant past. All are standard vanilla . Those >80km huge Clusters are all gone.
