since raxxla is not going to be hinted at in the game it is highly improbable that any missions or galnet stories etc will provide any clues as to its location.

So it's in an asteroid field. I repeat. It's been (probably unintentionally) confirmed that raxxla exists in an asteroid field.
It’s kinda true that there won’t be hints. In the interview with MB when he said “that’s true” to no hints it’s said in way that says “weelll, that’s kinda technically true yeah”. I’ll have to have a look but there was another interview I had seen where he or DB said some hint had been dropped in GalNet quite a while back but this is when basically nobody read GalNet and he said it went effectively unread and the article isn’t archived. If I can find the interview and it’s date, might take forever and prove fruitless, but maybe the good ole Way Back Machine saved what FDev didnt.
