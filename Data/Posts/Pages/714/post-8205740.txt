since raxxla is not going to be hinted at in the game it is highly improbable that any missions or galnet stories etc will provide any clues as to its location.

So it's in an asteroid field. I repeat. It's been (probably unintentionally) confirmed that raxxla exists in an asteroid field.
Kinky. That or he is trolling us... It would be hilarious if it was in SD! If he's fired in the next few days we may have confirmation! Wait to see if he's silently let go.

That or they pull a star wars with the script leak and give us the back and forth until we find it.

BTW, if true does it mean an asteroid belt like around a gas giant/star or a belt like those little nodes you can jump into in an actual system belt? He's in a planetary belt atm.

Also, I don't think that could be construed as accidental. If that is real it was intended and planned. The guys mentioning raxxla were planned to say that in some way. Depends on the end result. Real or joke. That seems a bit scripted potentially.
