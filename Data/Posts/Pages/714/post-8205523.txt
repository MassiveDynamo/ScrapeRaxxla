I think this is likely. There is only one way to find out you know. Also remember when Zarek Null was contacted by the last living Guardian AI or something and declared "the bringer of peace", and then all sorts of stuff happened. Also Deciat in Roman numerals is X.
Personally I’d be surprised if that was the case. Haven’t read about anyone having higher than friendly yet (but they may exist surly) and the PVP crowd, in my experience anyway, tend to be pirates or gankers which the PF don’t like or theyre “consenting” fighters. Two or more PVPers agreeing to a battle with crimes turned off. Don’t know of any personally who dedicate themselves to finding and fighting wanted pilots.
