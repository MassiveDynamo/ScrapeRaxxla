I wasn't in witchspace.
Really? Interesting - i thought this was a witchspace sound. Ya i have been bouncing around recording witchspace jumps toward and away from galactic center (didnt go all the way there)- also other directions…. Then opening up in Audacity, Spek, and Sonic Visualizer…. So far havent found any strange distinct shapes in the waveform . There have been some faint repeating circular ones…. But everything too faint to make something of. Im heading back to bubble at the moment - will try some more around there.
