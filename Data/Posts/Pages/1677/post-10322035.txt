Ngl I had the feeling that would be the case as soon as this was said and no pics provided. I get the feeling our collective leg is being pulled on this one. Im a little suspicious as to this being why no one else checked until it was brought up lol.

Apologies if this is not the case to the original cmdr to allegedly observe this.
I wasn't trying to pull anyone's leg. I'd take them to dinner first . Seriously though. I never got the 'congratulation' message until a day or two later when I handed in my data. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I can't go back in time. Even in elite.
