Not everything on EDSM is correct.
Certainly, since only about 5-10% of total activity and maybe 33% of long-range exploration activity is fed to it. The first discoverer/mapper on EDSM often will be the second or third or tenth in-game.

You can also get situations where a system was scanned/mapped on EDSM but the CMDR never made it back to sell so it remains unmapped in game. But that's far rarer, of course.

Still, Emperor's screenshots are I think fairly conclusive for "this system has been surveyed extensively".
