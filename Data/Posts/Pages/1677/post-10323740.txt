@Louis Calvert Is it possible what you found is a map based on shapes of the Milky Way's Great Rift? Providing Incan image from the Wikipedia article as reference. There is a serpent and a few other creatures. The idea might still be viable if we can anchor it (besides you do have era of rapid expansion working in your favor with the 66 year gap).

Article reference:
Great Rift (Astronomy)
