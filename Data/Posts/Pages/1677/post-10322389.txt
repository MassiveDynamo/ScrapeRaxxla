Hypothetically, how do we plan to run the Raxxla search if things go sideways? There was a lot of very ominous foreshadowing in the last GalNet. Keep in mind this is coming from the optimist who thought the old lore wasn't incompatible with Elite Dangerous. Should the worse happen, would there be regional (galactic) teams coordinating for specific regions? We still have the gap of 66 years starting in 2230. It could be anywhere.

Aegis has marshalled Allied, Federal and Imperial ships to undertake this mission, but we calculate they will not be enough. Only with the support of independent Commanders can we hope to deliver enough nanites to affect each Titan. This could prove to be the most important victory in humanity’s history… or our most devastating defeat. Now, more than ever, we need you all.”
