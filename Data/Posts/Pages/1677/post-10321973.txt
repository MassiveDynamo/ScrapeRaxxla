Really? Interesting - i thought this was a witchspace sound. Ya i have been bouncing around recording witchspace jumps toward and away from galactic center (didnt go all the way there)- also other directions…. Then opening up in Audacity, Spek, and Sonic Visualizer…. So far havent found any strange distinct shapes in the waveform . There have been some faint repeating circular ones…. But everything too faint to make something of. Im heading back to bubble at the moment - will try some more around there.
OK OK! You're totally on the right track Since you're looking for it anyway try this:

1) Record jumps (which you're doing).
2) Open in Audacity spectrogram view:

Your "colours" settings might be different to mine, so have a play.

You're looking at first for the D7 object. But don't stop there... That's just a hint, it's not the end of the search. Play around.

Let me know when you see them

P.S. "...hints for those with eyes to see", is a literal clue.

P.P.S. I guarantee whatever you think you'll see, you're going to be wrong. Just

Edited to remove an unintentional misdirection.
