What in the fresh hell is this? Found in Pollux at Listening Post Pollux D568.

Les sanglots longs Des violons De l'automne Blessent mon coeur D'Une langueur Monotone.
The long sobs of the violins of autumn hurt my heart with monotonous languor.

Appears to be this (translation at link)... https://poets.org/poem/chanson-dautomne

Appears to be false lead and is instead a CMDR memorial: https://canonn.science/codex/pollux-commander-memorial/
