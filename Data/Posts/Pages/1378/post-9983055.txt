It’s presumed, if that’s the case Raxxla might as well be anywhere, so why provide the reference in the Codex of Tau Ceti and the date 2296, unless it’s a clue for a temporal hotspot?

Eg you have a point in time it’s known, a location married to it, so draw a field of influence and you have a potential area for surveillance!

If it’s outside this field or sphere, it might as well be anywhere and the date is irrelevant.
I get it, but practically speaking there is no limit. The best I can do is uncontrolled expansion starting in 2230. There is nothing about our technology to suggest a limit. Even with Drew Wager's hyperspace lore video, we only had delays at the destination - jumps always have taken mere seconds in Witchspace / Hyperspace. If you are jumping, refueling, jumping again there is nothing that could stop anyone from getting to the edges of the galaxy if there is access to fuel. Every thought experiment where I try to limit breaks due to either the fast transit through Witchspace itself (but slower at destination pre-supercruise) or 2230 and rapid expansion.
