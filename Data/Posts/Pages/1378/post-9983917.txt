Can I just add a little piece of advise...the 8th moon doesn't have to be a planet (or what we are specifying a planet to be) It may also be a gas giant that's the 8th moon of another gas giant, or the 8th star that happens to orbit a gas giant (this ones far fetched but serving a point) There's a reason I say this and I will update with the reason after I check out a location , also note a gas giant is a failed star and also can be thought of as a brown dwarf which are also considered gas giants, we may also perviece this as the 8th moon of a failed star or a now star that was a gas giant it could be the 8th moon of any body

(Update) Checked out hip 1254 due to the presence of Laika, the name of the dog the Russians flew up to space as one of the first animals, I found it weird a gas giant called this so far below the bubble when we already have a system and planet named this in the bubble, no ties of Laika with Raxxla I know however I am and have been checking all of these anomalies over the last 2 years and this had an 8th moon that happened to be a gas giant and no visitors in a long time according to any tools
