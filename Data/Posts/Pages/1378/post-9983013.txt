Per the Codex introduction to Raxxla a shipboard engineer based out of Tau Ceti (as in they probably weren't in Tau Ceti itself) is cited. Additionally, we have mention of a pirate cache. Nearby where we got the HIP 22460 permit there is indeed a "Pirate Cache". Has anyone searched nearby to see if there is something else within 20 LY because logs mentioned coming back in a few days and the loot in question was very valuable. The system Pirate Cache is in was only a single jump from where we got the HIP 22460 permit. Going off the kind of obvious idea, this would seem to fit. Also, per Delta Pavonis "Early Colonies" we started rapid expansion in 2230.
