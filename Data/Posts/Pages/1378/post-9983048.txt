It’s presumed, if that’s the case Raxxla might as well be anywhere, so why provide the reference in the Codex of Tau Ceti and the date 2296, unless it’s a clue for a temporal hotspot?

Eg you have a point in time it’s known, a location married to it, so draw a field of influence from a common centre and you have a potential area for surveillance!

If it’s outside this field or sphere, it might as well be anywhere and the date is irrelevant.

My ramblings are an attempt to draw correlations to support the theory the sphere of influence is potentially correct. The existence of Pandemonium and much if not all of the Yggdrasil tree being in this sphere is I find tantalisingly suspicious.

That’s not to assume said location can’t be on the outside of said sphere, in respect of being ‘on the outer rim’; again another allusion to John Miltons Crystalline Sphere!

Suggestive I grant, but I’m only attempting to draw correlations to either confirm that logic or rule it out…

That’s assuming these things have meaning, they very well might not, and all this is totally unrelated, and revolves around archived content or various Easter eggs…

Pirates stash of course always reminds me of Philip Sidney’s Arcadia and Oak Island, certainly it has some relevance, I don’t discount that at all!
