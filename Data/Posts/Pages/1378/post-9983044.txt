The Synuefe QA-U d4-27 system seems too far to be linked to the sphere of influence prescribed by the 2296 date?

The sphere presumption is based off the in game list of first settled systems. To my knowledge there is no additional in game text which identifies any other systems discovered upto that point.

If the cache in question is real surely it ought to be within this sphere of influence and not outside it?

Just saying we had 66 years of damn near unlimited expansion from 2230. The is pre-Faraway (pre-2280s per GalNet) so the most obvious fuel is Hydrogen fuel. If we have fuel scoops (likely as they are present in all games), there is no limit. Even if jumps could be only done less often, I don't see anything that can restrict well beyond the Bubble. An explorer is only limited by access to fuel.
