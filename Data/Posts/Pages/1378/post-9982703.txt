But if you meant exact opposite coordinates of system Pandemonium (which is roughly at 34; -114; 46), then you get again none, seemingly closest being Ogowenae.
Thank you - yes, my X; Y; Z we’re obtained from very rough guesstimating, currently I’m in transit playing with EDDB points, I’ll utilise your reference in a new map I’m putting together, currently just trying things out to see what may be there… looking for something that might correlate to John Milton, or something which describes a sea (Jasper Sea); a golden stair (Jacobs ladder) or a heavenly gate!

Space madness abounds.
