The Synuefe QA-U d4-27 system seems too far to be linked to the sphere of influence prescribed by the 2296 date?

The sphere presumption is based off the in game list of first settled systems. To my knowledge there is no additional in game text which identifies any other systems discovered upto that point.

If the cache in question is real surely it ought to be within this sphere of influence and not outside it?
