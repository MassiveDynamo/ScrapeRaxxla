Sirius is Big Brother of the 33rd Century!
What they see they can control...The Club!
Let's focus less on the past as it cannot be changed no matter what you do. Remember, your power only comes from perception at the end of the day nothing more and nothing less. They were the ones who forged the first drives in Sol where the corporation was founded which we are told were powered by Hydrogen - the single most abundant element in the Universe (per Antares Incident, Starship One, and our ships). The drives depended on this and planet Lucifer in Sirius is almost purely dedicated to forging fuels (even tritium is just an isotope of Hydrogen). If they also developed the fuel scoops, literally even a basic drive could be to edge of the galaxy within 6 months to a year. We have 66 years from 2230 to rumors being known to exist in 2296. It at least deserves considering. This is just based on Elite Dangerous.

Note: For the record, we may have other leads soon but I am still working out how we can use the information we have (and if there isn't more than realized). The Pirate Cache was brought up because it was an obvious fit to the Codex.
