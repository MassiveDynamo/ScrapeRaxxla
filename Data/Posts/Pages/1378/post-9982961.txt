Thanks, I’ve book-marked that site.

Location at the apex is Ogowenae. No idea if that’s actually relevant, other than helping establish celestial north.

Currently attempting to apply logic to the inclusion of Pandemonium in game, it’s just too close a match to the Tau Ceti 2296 sphere of influence not to be a coincidence.

But coincidences are common, the Northern Crown is in this northern hemisphere, but so are a lot of other things, too much of a stretch to presume M Brookes put Raxxla in game and linked it directly to John Miltons heaven…. It’s just, something clicks, why does pandemonium align with celestial south so well, does it have meaning, is it nothing but an Easter egg?

Yggdrasil’s upper and lower tree hemispheres aligns too…and of course there’s that odd inclusion of Donars Oak when the Codex was inserted… such a coincidence.

Out on this ‘outer rim’…space madness in the paradise of fools.
