Funny old article posted 7 Oct 3302 I'll post the reply made in said article. But mostly about Sirius launching probes into space.

Galactic News: Exploration or Surveillance?
"Human pilots are interested in sightseeing, chasing myths and 'making their mark' on the galactic stage. They get sidetracked. Our probes are immune to such distractions. At present, galactic exploration is conducted in a sporadic and improvisational way. Soon we will have far better coverage of the galaxy."
