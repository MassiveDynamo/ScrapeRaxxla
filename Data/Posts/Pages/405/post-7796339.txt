Has anyone considered that we're all the real dark wheel, vehemently searching for raxxla? I mean everyone else is an NPC just doing what they're programed to do.

Yea, I've wondered that. The pilots federation is in the same system as teh dark wheel. The dark wheel is exploration based and connected to maps and the people who run cartographics etc. It's about the most logical answer. The question would be where and what is raxxla?
