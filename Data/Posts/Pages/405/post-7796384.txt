Idk how big this new patch is, but on my PS4 I need 30+gb free space. It better more than just a bug patch if I have to delete newer games to make room.

Sorry I know this is incredibly off topic. Just pointing out it could(hopefully) be more than just a bug patch

that makes me hopeful. . . but is the patch ever small for PS4 - or do they just do a whole game reinstall every time?
