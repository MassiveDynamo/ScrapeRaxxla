Just wanted to add one thing to the large volume of information here. I'm not so sure about the idea that Cassiopea is the mother of galaxies in question here. Yes, she was the mother of Andromeda, but what is the jewel that burns on her brow?
Hera, on the other hand, was the mother of the Milky Way. In Greek mythology the Milky Way was created when Hera was suckling Hercules. Hercules bit her nipple and a jet of milk spurted out across the sky and thus the milky way was created.
One of the major symbols of Hera is the Diadem, which is like a crown or tiara. This seems, to me at least, to fit better than Cassiopea as an answer to that first line. Hera, a mother of a galaxy, who has a jewel on her brow - the diadem.

I did check out the Diadem system but there is nothing remarkable there, except for an unusual amount of USS for an uninhabited system.

I'm not saying Cassiopea is wrong. I just could not find a reference to any kind of jewel on her brow.

On a sidenote, I am convinced that this puzzle is only solvable once triple elite has been reached so any player checking systems out needs to be triple elite to have a chance of spotting something.

Thoughts?
