Some of the triune god systems are a bit more obscure, but interconnected, eg:

Father - High noon, North, Medium Coeli, Capricorn aka 10th house cusp (career)
Son - Dawn, East, Ascendant, Aries aka 1st house cusp (self and dominant ego)
Holy Ghost - Sunset, West, Descendant, Libra aka 7th house cusp (relationships)

What's not represented in this system is the feminine aspect:
Midnight, South, Imum Coeli, Cancer aka 4th house cusp (home / family / mother)

What we might be looking for is three systems that form a cross to locate a fourth.
