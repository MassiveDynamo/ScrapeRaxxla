How to install ED on Linux using Wine [EXPERIMENTAL, NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED]
I have also seen the face in the target projection. It was like I had been prank hacked by a Sontaran. I've also seen it as the background to the local star system - usually when it appears I can no longer use the local map and have to restart the client.

Glitch, linux glitch, or in game clue. Maybe darkwheel or other contact. It woud fit the dark wheel thing as it would take knowledge to actually figure out the image data. It's a weird hologram that is two faces that make a single face in the middle. This data must be contained in the game code somehow. How could this be a glitch if it's not in the code? Has anyone else seen this?
