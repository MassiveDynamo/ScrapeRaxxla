I see there will be a second patch out today to fix, among other bugs, the fss problem. Thank heavens! because on the last part of Jorki’s DW2 trip, and now Tyko’s Palin 5kly run, it has been impossible to scan some system bodies.
Hope Raxxla/TDW weren’t at one of them...
Idk how big this new patch is, but on my PS4 I need 30+gb free space. It better more than just a bug patch if I have to delete newer games to make room.

Sorry I know this is incredibly off topic. Just pointing out it could(hopefully) be more than just a bug patch
