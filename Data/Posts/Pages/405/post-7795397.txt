Since the bubble's current radius is only about 0.2kLY and the rate of expansion is extremely slow, I don't think it's worth worrying too much exactly where you draw the sphere from. If you search everywhere within 10k of Sol and don't find it, you're probably on the wrong lines anyway.


The Codex entry suggests that Raxxla may be to some extent mobile, though - the original reference to it suggests that something may have been found (and lost?) within a few decades of discovering hyperspace, which suggests it was at the time very close to Sol and probably within the boundary of the modern bubble. It's highly unlikely to still be there.

Whether its mobility is an intrinsic property of itself, or one of its previous discoverers picked it up and moved it somewhere more remote, is very hard to say without knowing what it is.

Probably moves every Thursday morning with server tick.
