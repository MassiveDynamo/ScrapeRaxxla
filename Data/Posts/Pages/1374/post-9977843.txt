My apologies @Allen Stroud; I didn’t construct that ramble well, I meant would you be able to comment on the assumption about FD decisions behind not implementing Dark Systems, and what actually a Dark System consisted, e.g star class, and if they still applied or utilised these systems to hide their mysteries?

Not really interested in assessments about other persons. It’s not relevant, unless said person made statements which can be attributed as false in relation to Raxxla?
