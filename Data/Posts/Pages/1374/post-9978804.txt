I know it is easy to think dismissing me will work, but I actually did do my research. There is very little reason to believe what we thought we knew. Not all humans should be trusted but I am not one of the bad ones. It cost me everything to speak out. I gain literally nothing by speaking out because I am giving you power back while single-handedly risking everything. My ideas were deemed too dangerous for both Canonn Science and Children of Raxxla and I ultimately voluntarily left both because I cannot ignore what I experienced and found via research but was also unwilling to hurt the larger Elite community. I lost many people who I cared about all because I had the audacity to actually go looking myself and investigate claims made. Please at least humor me if want to challenge stuff, and make a case why the narrative we have been told to believe has more merit than what I am proposing when those making the claims were known propagandists or had secrets to hide. I am not asking much, but defaulting to retconned lore is a very poor argument. I have made my case for why we should be skeptical, and you are welcome to look for flaws.
