Strongest route so far that we have ingame and referenced to the codex! nice, also note the brow could mean above the brow "Berenice vowed to sacrifice her hair to Aphrodite"
And the view of the RAXXLA alignment of letters in the Galmap, is best in Coma Berenices. At about 0,300,0 it aligns very well.

This is in the NGP, very close to 30 Comae Berenices.
This system has a gas giant with more than eight moons and as far as I can tell, a bunch of comets.
