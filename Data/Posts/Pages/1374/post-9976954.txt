I see that in a lot of astronomic publications, the term 'parent constellation' is used. This of course made me think of the Mother of galaxies.
If the parent is a constellation, the Mother could be a female constellation.
There aren't a lot of them:

Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Coma Berenices (technically just the hair of a woman) and Virgo.

I think Virgo can be excluded as a potential mother, if we assume that the toast isn't based on christian mythology.

The three other all have valid cases. Cassiopeia is the actual mother of Andromeda and Andromeda is the parent constellation of the Andromeda galaxy.
Coma Berenices is the parent of the Coma supercluster of galaxies.

Coma Berenices may have the strongest case as it has the star Diadem, supposed to reflect the jewel in the crown on the queen's head (Berenice II of Egypt).
The constellation is a direct result of lover woe. Berenice vowed to sacrifice her hair to Aphrodite, for her husbands safe return from war.
Berenice even had a grief with her mother over the rule of Cyrene, after her father died.

Coma Berenices fun facts:
It is the 42nd constellation by area (the answer is always 42).
It contains the galactic north pole. One of several possible Ophalos points.
It contains the Black Eye galaxy. Black eyes are a reoccurring theme in Astrophel and Stella.
