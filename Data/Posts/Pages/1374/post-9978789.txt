Except they stated alot of the old lore was retconned, we don't know what was and wasn't changed but we do know and have seen it is a lot
May I suggest paying close attention to what I posted. Transporter was from the first game and is designed in Sol and we are told rather pointedly there is no claim to accuracy of star charts (since Lavian authorities felt the need to erase Sol from the map). Also, there is no direct conflict with anything else and all can be explained rather simply if you accept Sol is present in the lore of the first game. That PDF that was attached also covered the whole Cerberus Plague/Sohalian Fever/Mycoid debacle and there is no inherent contradiction because the joint superpower initiative (Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm) did not develop Mycoid at all as it was developed by Imperial Naval Reserve Arm. I go though each step and there aren't any conflicts because it is merely different names for the same things. Language is a far more powerful weapon than most physical weapons as it can either free or control an unaware population. This is why "1984" was a warning not an instruction manual. George Orwell stated it best, "The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history." Salomé was warning us to pay attention.
