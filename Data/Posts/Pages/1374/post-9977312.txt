What if Raxxla isnt a place...hence the rumour, what if there's a 1 in billion chance of dropping out of hyperspace into a secret instance managed randomly by an instance algorithm and in this instance it loads custom files only located server side, this would make the place that isnt a place and able to find it more than once together, would also give a previous miss jump request that they backed off from a way of making it a once off addition and not tell anybody mixed with the dark systems they originally planned.....Suspect but likely possible and has been done in other games with event modes etc, Also wouldnt suprise me if its broken lol
