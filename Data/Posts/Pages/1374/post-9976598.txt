Partly true, this was a method used a few years ago when hunting Project Dynasty bases in the Formidine Rift. Depends on your system hardware- possibly true if you have a PC with a mechanical hard disc drive for the game, but an SSD would be too fast for this effect. But I think the loading time can also be dependent on your comms quality, and probably also related to anything else happening on your PC at the time.

Edit:
Thereâ€™s a keyboard combination to pull up an indication of the input data rate which is more reliable, but cant remember what that was.
