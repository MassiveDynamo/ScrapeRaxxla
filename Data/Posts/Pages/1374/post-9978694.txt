Sorry, I don't comment publicly on anything directly related to Drew Wagar. I have him blocked on all of my online profiles, etc. There are good reasons. They are well documented.
Can you please confirm if it has always been intended that Lave was a dictatorship at the time of the first game? If so, that has some rather interesting complications it brings to the lore. I believe "History of Lave" beacon states Dr. Hans Walden does not come to power until 3174. This places events in the first game in the series as post-First Thargoid War which should have ended in 3151. Also, we have Thargoids in the first game but they were supposed to have vanished shortly following the war per GCS Saravasti. This may also mean Quirium really is just hydrogen fuel produced by and large by Sirius Corporation and is no more exotic than the most basic element in the Universe. It also means that weird date conflict regarding development of Mycoid would be solved by INRA being the Imperial Navy Reserve Arm which I believe was hinted at via First Encounters journals.

In other words, the Elite series is one continuous Universe. Also, it would allow for the Holdstock version of Raxxla to be a viable option as "Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide" written under the pseudonym Steven Eisler very much depended on Earth being central to the story. I just don't yet know what the "butterfly effect" of these changes will be but they are fairly non-trivial. Also, @sallymorganmoore , while we are at it can you confirm if Raxxla is the entirety of the Elite Universe (where "definite place" per Michael Brookes is perhaps a loose interpretation)?
