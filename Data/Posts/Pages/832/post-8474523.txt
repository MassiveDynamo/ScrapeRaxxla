SO, I have a stupid question, is anyone on here, thats actively looking for Raxxla, at Elite Combat status?

I only ask becuase its been bugging me for a while, in the Lore it says that Jason Ryden was an Elite Combateer when he was assassinated. Well, maybe, and I hate to say this, just MAYBE, we need Elite Comabt ranking in order to be approched by the Dark Wheel. Now that said, we still have no proof TDW has found Raxxla or anything, but in order to join them, I think it requires elite combat rank and being approached by a member consealing their identy, gives you a mission, and if you complete it, you find out who they are for real.....

Thats jusst a theory ive had for a while, what does everyone else think? Any Elite Combat players on here? I have Elite Trade and Explorer, but not Combat... that ones going to take a while, already took 6 months to get these 2 and these are the easy ones, Combat requires finding ships and beating them, trade and exploration requires nothing but time really...
