Anybody know if the Helix Nebula is in game?
A place that isnt a place = nebula
A door that is also a key = eye

Helix also spiral reference so the stars within it could be classed as starts of the spiral or spiral stars??? - Too far?

Edit - seems it is in game https://wiki.ed-board.net/en/object/helix-nebula has anybody explored this angle?
