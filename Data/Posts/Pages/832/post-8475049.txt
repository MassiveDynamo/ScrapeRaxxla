Yeah i have also stayed away from cassiopeia but i'm interested in looking into little cassiopeia aka lacerta. Not sure how it would relate to andromeda but it's often an overlooked constellation.
If I recall the quote, it was about "The jewel on the brow of the mother of galaxies". If we assume the galaxy referred to is Andromeda, then in mythology, Cassiopea was Andromeda's mother. The constellation of Cassiopea is her crown, leading to the idea that one of the stars would be the jewel. It's not, I have been there to check. There is also a nebula just above the central star as viewed from Earth. It's possible it's there, but it's a long way out for something supposedly reachable in a Cobra.
