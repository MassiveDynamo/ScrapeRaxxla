what do you both talk about Cassiopeia?
I've not done much with it personally but I know it has had a lot of people put a lot of work into it in the past. Including fairly well organized expeditions. There are some spreadsheets online somewhere of the mapped areas. Just like heart and soul however, doesn't mean things were not missed.
For more info look at this thread last year, especially around July/August
