What happened to Mimas?
Maybe its still there, hidden.
We cannot comment on whether or not more moons of Saturn will be made landable in the future.
What if we just can't see it.
At the end of the Salvation Failure the Interceptors fade to black, is this a cloaking device that is able to hide a whole moon that the DW discovered Tech for?
Or as i joked before with the LOTR reference we need the stars to align to see it?
