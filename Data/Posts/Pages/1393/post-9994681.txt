It didn’t have one last I checked.

I added that reference for flavour, I’d like it to be in game, set if they had put it back in, again ‘it wasn’t historically’ so if they corrected that, why haven’t they corrected all the other elements. Again we need to tally all known elements in 2014, 2016 and 2022, what things did they correct and which did they not correct - then we ask them why….the discrepancy.

But don’t ask like a petulant child who’s toy breaks, give them the evidence of absence, advise that it’s cost customer time to verify this info and request acknowledgment that these omissions are to be left out or fixed.

Remember FD has a solid modus operandi of nerfing content. Just because something is broken doesn’t warrant their valuable time to fix it, put it into some context that forces a linguist admission.

They went to the effect to put the Voyager probe in game, yet they omitted a key moon of Saturn which was photographed by one of them!
