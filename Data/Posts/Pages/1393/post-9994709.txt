Saturn Hexagon storm I remember seeing it on Saturn before. I figured everyone else noticed it by now.

Edit: It is gone but I'm curious if it's because it's in the dark part of the Saturn. But if that's the case is the Hexagon the sign of something traveling between space that some how disrupts gas giants environment.
