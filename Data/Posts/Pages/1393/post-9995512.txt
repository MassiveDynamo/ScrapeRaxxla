All systems in game exist within an instance, which have no physical boundaries, that’s a lot of empty space to potentially hide something.

The old (and best) method of scanning using the Mki eye-ball got best results by flying out of the system and catching bodies at high velocity against the static backdrop. Lots of fun.

Likely an inhabited system with lots of traffic will usually be mapped, although there are thousands which were mapped earlier on where very distant bodies were missed, just because a system is mapped doesn’t necessarily mean it is 100% mapped.

I still find the odd one here or there in the bubble, and out in the void, easy to miss these. It’s unlikely FD mapped an accurate Oort cloud structure, the data loading would have alerted someone previously, but there’s still no reason to ignore that expanse, the possibility a long distance body exists on the outer rim of a system is possible, question is is the 100% fallible?

I found two undiscovered ELW yesterday!
