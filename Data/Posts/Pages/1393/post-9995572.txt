Great work.

It is odd.

Another way is to not ask directly…noting the known facts and identifying the obvious omission but give it contexts away from Raxxla.

Eg the name “Herschel" is in the game naming library (whatever that is) and is used for:

*A system: https://eddb.io/system/26294
*About 50 installations!

So FD know the name and have inserted it into game, identifying its historical relevance, however they have omitted it from the Sol system even though he is an historical figure in the discovery of Saturns moons. Why did FD omit such an historical discovery (again the emphasis is not on Raxxla, but on historical accuracy).

The emphasis is not to infuse the question with the allegation of hidddn content, but to advertise an error, and get FD to confirm why this happened?

The incredulity!

It’s on the scale of say, omitting Uranus, because William Herschel identified Uranus!

Caroline and William Herschel: Revealing the invisible
The Herschels were pioneers of the systematic classification and investigation of the heavens. William Herschel was one of the first 'professional' astronomers, and discovered infrared radiation. His sister Caroline helped him to develop the modern mathematical approach to astronomy.
