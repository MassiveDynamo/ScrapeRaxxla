Just saw.... FSS Updates to include "Thargoid Rouge Signal Sources"....

I've said it before, and I'll say it again...

Raxxla is a Rouge planet, we just never had any tools or proof until now to prove that.

We now have the thargoid UA signals moving system to system, and a Rouge signal added to the FSS.... plus Rouge was already a "star" type.

All of the mechanics for Raxxla to be a traveling Rouge.

We have to find the "path", or take the "journey" to find it...
I called this my best, most likely theory like 2 years ago, and it's just being proven more and more now...

So, any thoughts on where the trail might actually begin? Or how we track/find the path Raxxla is on?

It's likely to be similar to the moving UI when it's in a system, moving, but not as fast, and yea... I'm more excited about the hunt for raxxla now then at any point in the last 2 years...

The closest thing we have to rogue planets at the moment are brown dwarfs which are the primary object. But if they are adding something new it may be like a large asteroid or comet. I believe FDev had toyed with comets in the past. I still believe we need that station to get somewhere useful. I was planning to start checking depleted resource systems and/or systems with unusually small populations. In terms of systems with known or rumored disasters (or reasons for humans to have abandoned) we have Jotun (permit), Peregrina (permit), Sohalia, and any systems impacted by Cerberus Plague. May be worth checking Galnet for famines. There is also Alpha Centauri's description and possible beacon about settlement attempt at Eden.
