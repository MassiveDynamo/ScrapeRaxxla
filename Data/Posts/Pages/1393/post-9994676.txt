I didn't realize Saturn's hex was missing in game... interesting.... and it's not like... hmm...

I just recently, like in the last 2 weeks, found a gas giant out in the FRift that had the hex on it in FSS... now I'm wondering if I should have done some sort of additional research in the area... but it's like, wayyy out in the rift, so I didn't think it would be important...
But it means the hex is possible in game, so why doesn't Saturn have its? Interesting
