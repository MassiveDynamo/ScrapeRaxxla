Thanks all for considering this. I do absolutely agree that Fdev didn't "accidentally" forget to add Mimas or the Saturn Hex - if you look at Jupiter it's a beautiful detailed interpretation of the Jupiter we know. Mars' partial terraforming has been lovingly created to look amazing from space, and Earth even has adjusted coastlines to account for climate change flooding and WW3 fallouts. I know some people aren't happy with the fidelity of the texture mapping, but that doesn't change the care Fdev put into them.

I do think it's deliberate, and given the Codex references to Greek Myth that tie in directly with Saturn, I think it's worth looking at.

Just a bit of an update on what I'm calling "the Mimas Conspiracy" (link to my post). The Saturn Hex and Mimas' appearance and weird wobble were both known about way before 2014.

The Cassini mission was the "hot space news" of the early 2000's. If you look at this timeline from NASA the Cassini probe gathered tons of info on Saturn starting in 2004, by 2010 it was getting up-close images of Mimas. This could easily have been in the minds of DBOBE when he was sketching out Elite 4.

Look at this timelapse false-colour of the Saturn Hexagon from 2014. It just looks so much like a portal! More details are available by clicking explore on that section. Interestingly it does say that the hexagon storm may not last more than centuries, so possibly by 3300 it's just blown out.

I wouldn't think it was so weird without all the connections to Saturn in the Codex.
