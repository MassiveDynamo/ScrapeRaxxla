I didn't realize Saturn's hex was missing in game... interesting.... and it's not like... hmm...

I just recently, like in the last 2 weeks, found a gas giant out in the FRift that had the hex on it in FSS... now I'm wondering if I should have done some sort of additional research in the area... but it's like, wayyy out in the rift, so I didn't think it would be important...
But it means the hex is possible in game, so why doesn't Saturn have its? Interesting
You may want to look at the planets for Sol that are cockpit customization DLC. I swear we are looking for something similar to the real planets. The Mars cockpit customization looks like present day Mars not the terraformed version in game. These may actually be intentional design choices to get us looking for a system that looks closer to present era Sol but perhaps simplified. If I had to guess, we'd be looking for single g-class plus 8 planets as Pluto got demoted before Elite Dangerous was made.
