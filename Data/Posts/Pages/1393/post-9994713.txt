You may want to look at the planets for Sol that are cockpit customization DLC. I swear we are looking for something similar to the real planets. The Mars cockpit customization looks like present day Mars not the terraformed version in game. These may actually be intentional design choices to get us looking for a system that looks closer to present era Sol but perhaps simplified. If I had to guess, we'd be looking for single g-class plus 8 planets as Pluto got demoted before Elite Dangerous was made.
They're all called worlds in Elite Dangerous, even moons/satellites.
