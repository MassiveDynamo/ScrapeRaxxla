various people have successfully dropped into the pareco comet instance and shared screenshots, you can find them by searching the forum; i've linked at least one of them above. HOWEVER I will say that I've been trying to do this for the last two years (in Legacy) without any success whatsoever. I can either fly or SC to the position the comet should be (according to screenshots and also the semi orbital radii of the stations) but nothing ever shows up on my scanner. The instance is supposed to be tiny (~50km) so smaller than the gauges show and it would be easy to skim over or under it and never even know, by the gods is it frustrating. Irf anyone at all can help, I will be immensely grateful, even if all we succeed in doing is crossing it off.
Ok, if it's just an empty instance then it's pointless anyway, but I would still like to give it a look. Do you know if anyone spotted it on Odyssey? And anyone reported which kind of signal it was, point of interest, signal source?
