Could you provide some sources for these quotes?
I got into this forum when specifically looking at the random characters present in spectrographs at the end of station antennae, and I had a feeling they may be linked to station numbers in some way, perhaps a key.
These two quotes seem to suggest there is something to be found in stations, or at least a path that starts there.
I'm not specifically looking for Raxxla in these stations, but I do want to figure out the signal being emitted from (some of) their antennae.
