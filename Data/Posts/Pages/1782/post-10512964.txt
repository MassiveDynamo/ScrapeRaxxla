As far as I know there's no such things as comets in Elite Dangerous. There might be mechanics in the foundry which affect orbits but there isn't anything in the game which you can see or interact in any way, related to comets. If anyone has any evidences of comets being in game, or of a colony in one, please by all means share them.
