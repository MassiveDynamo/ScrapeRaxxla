This is taking my comment out of context since I did also offer the full explanation literally one line below.

I'll repost my post here so can you re-read it



They don't show up on scanners, aren't present in the lore and aren't discoverable in any way that counts (unless you count data dumps and the abovementioned effects). Fdev even corrected Tau Ceti's comet so the station didn't orbit it - presumably because in some systems they can do that, whereas Pareco doesn't have any other bodies so there's no easy fix? Something that's invisible in the game and only is present in the effects it has on things that were generated by Stellar Forge as a consequence of having gravity, by any reasonable definition does not exist in the game, as a short explanation I think it's totally reasonable to say they don't exist (while still offering the full explanation). I think that's fine for a thread about Raxxla.

Brookes in 2015 also agrees:
"The comets at the moment - there are no visuals."

Not just visual - they also don't currently show gravity to get a supercruise slowdown, and don't appear as either Body or NonBody contacts in the journal.

That's fine. I disagree though

They don't show up in game visually, but they do have a Sphere of Influence that you can see attributed to an object. An object that has mass and a name.

I will also just say for amusement. I have had the privilege of meeting David Braben at events three times since Elite Dangerous launched (launch party, Planet Coaster launch party and FX17). At every one I asked him when we would get visual representation of Comets in game (he declined to comment) I also asked in the Q&A section of Lavecon 3 years in a row, but I think they started to get annoyed with me
