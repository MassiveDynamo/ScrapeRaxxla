Could you provide some sources for these quotes?
I got into this forum when specifically looking at the random characters present in spectrographs at the end of station antennae, and I had a feeling they may be linked to station numbers in some way, perhaps a key.
These two quotes seem to suggest there is something to be found in stations, or at least a path that starts there.
I'm not specifically looking for Raxxla in these stations, but I do want to figure out the signal being emitted from (some of) their antennae.
See my FD Quotes thread, url in my signature, for the numbers stations discussion, should also be googlable. MB hinting to us to listen to the UA/TS was in the old canonn threads, circa 2016, long since archived. Dont know if Macros put a link on the first page here...did have a bookmark to them but somethings bu*****ed my bookmarks today. Han_Zen might have the links. Search this thread
