That's the flight carrier symbol, I doubt it's anything of note. I was looking in the system map the other day and noticed it.
So there's 4 in the system which I can lock on to..... and there's this floating about way out..... glad you've seen it and it's repeatable... but what is it and why is it not selectable and way out?

or it might be a bug...
