I have some Combat Elite Cmdr's, never saw an apparent TDW invite on any of them. Nevertheless, I suggest you try doing it while recording your progress.

One thing I did see was the invite to Shinrarta Dezhra
Thats what I've seen as well.

One could note that perhaps a requirement is not to be allied with TDW in Shin, but to be at war with them as they may be in fact the red herring (ref farseer).

Still, there are many things we do not know and with the amount of patches I wouldn't be surprised if something was broken.
