So I had a look at a possible path choosing the nearest star with the classification and seemed to be going OK without having to jump an incredible distance...

Looked to be getting a tenuous path once the next star I could find was over 600LY....

A - Alderamin

Degraded emissions on entry
Nothing else unusual

O - HIP 23692

Degraded emissions on entry
Nothing else unusual

G - HIP 22569

48 Degraded emissions on entry
Water world
Nothing else unusual

just curious, what if you started from the O or G star, instead of A...?

"The home of The Link. The Link is All; no above, no bellow, we are One. From the Gate, the Conduit leads One to All. They are Many, but there is One Link. Those who are Not, will Never Be. Down below, the followers of the Link care not of politics, or puny power struggle. The One explores the All from the Conduit. They will open their eyes to Others to trade. But close their fists to Who is Not"

The use of capitalised letters looking out of place is bugging me (Highlighted red above where they are possibly out of place)...
e.g. Assuming "The Link" is correct as a name...
"One Link" - not "One The Link"
"the Link" - not "The Link"
etc....

So we have: A, O, G, C, O, A, M, O, L, N, N, B, L, O, A, C, O, W, N

Directions?....

What if the "All" and "One" words are just to help us notice the odd capitalism...
and the path actually starts from the word FROM and the G star after it?
(just another interpretation of the reading of that passage)
So like, it could be read as, "From the G, the C leads O to A...."
does that make the path any easier to plot ?
