I have absolutely no idea!

Is there a way to find out if there ever was a player faction there?

Would that show on the EDDB/INARA list if there was and they got kicked out or otherwise disabled? If there's never been a player faction there, and there's not one now, and there's no other mechanism by which players/backers could write system descriptions, then yeah, that's a very interesting system description indeed!
