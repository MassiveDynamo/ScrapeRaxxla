Inara usually shows past factions.

One other option: was it once a player faction but is no longer?

I have a player faction and there was a submission process to request them based on a few rules back in the day and FD could reject them for various reasons like being offensive of course or them being related to the lore from memory (I could dig out the emails and check).

I threw in Emperor's Dawn for a laugh as they were in the story line early on and supposedly wiped out by Patreus as a terrorist organisation. They granted the application which I was surprised by as it wasn't long after the story played out.

The first tranche were put in fairly quickly from memory but they got inundated at the time and it was some time before they did more groups.

There is no way of removing them as far as I know.
