"The home of The Link. The Link is All; no above, no bellow, we are One. From the Gate, the Conduit leads One to All. They are Many, but there is One Link. Those who are Not, will Never Be. Down below, the followers of the Link care not of politics, or puny power struggle. The One explores the All from the Conduit. They will open their eyes to Others to trade. But close their fists to Who is Not"

The use of capitalised letters looking out of place is bugging me (Highlighted red above where they are possibly out of place)...
e.g. Assuming "The Link" is correct as a name...
"One Link" - not "One The Link"
"the Link" - not "The Link"
etc....

So we have: A, O, G, C, O, A, M, O, L, N, N, B, L, O, A, C, O, W, N

So I had a look at a possible path choosing the nearest star with the classification and seemed to be going OK without having to jump an incredible distance...

Looked to be getting a tenuous path once the next star I could find was over 600LY....
