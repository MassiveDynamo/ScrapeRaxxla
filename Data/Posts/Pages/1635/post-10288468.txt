questions:
are there any other factions on INARA listed this way? there doesn't seem to be a way to search by this information other than check each one manually . ...
Yep. Checked Sirius Corporation, and they're the same on inara. Flagged as "Related".

As to the mechanisms behind it... Not sure. Might be only those factions supported by commanders in squadrons.
