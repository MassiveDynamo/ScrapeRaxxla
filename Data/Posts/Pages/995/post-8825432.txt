Well, good point, but to me a "definite place" does not necessarily mean a physical one, although I agree it's difficult to justify that any non-physical place is a definite place.

We don't know really. The claim of a definite place comes from 'The earliest documented stories', that we don't have access to.
We can guess that Rafe Zetter had access to some of them and knew what he was taking about.

If so, Raxxla is a Planet of some kind. It could also be a moon, as that is basically the same thing.
It's not a star, a system or a black hole.

Rafe says that on Raxxla there is an alien construct, that's a gateway to other Universes. This may mean that there is nothing special about the planet. It's the construct that is important.

About the location, Rafe only says: 'Raxxla—if it exists—is in another Galaxy'. This would mean, not in any of the original Galaxy 1 systems. That's about 30 systems of the list.

He says one more possibly interesting thing about Jason: 'he'd found evidence for the real existence of Raxxla. He came back from Deep Space to get a proper team together'.
What 'Deep Space' means here is up to debate, but it's at least a term that is used in ED.
