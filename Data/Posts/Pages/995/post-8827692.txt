I like to think the whispers are coming from the murderous Guardian AI who inhabit a secret realm within witchspace.
There at least seem to be some incorporeal intelligence capable of telepathic communication, lurking in the galaxy. Both Halsey and Romero have presented their experience with them, on Galnet.

Guardian AI are a good candidate to have evolved into these 'Caretakers'.
