somewhere in region 35...
deactivating his thrusters, pulse laser, mining laser, drones, pds, heatsinks. cmdr Dr. Lexus prepares for a nap.

...meh and the wake scanner why not? we haven't seen antything out here in months... alrighty then... oh I forgot to turn off the shields, you know maybe the shields are interfering with those "vivid dreams and whisperers coming from the void" (as soon as he ends that phrase, his ship puts on screen a video from 21st century called Dramatic Look) ha ha im telling you! maybe thats why the caretakers arent able to contact our thalamus, or in your case your sensors. wake me in 6 hours. (puts on his Havasupai Dream Catcher)
