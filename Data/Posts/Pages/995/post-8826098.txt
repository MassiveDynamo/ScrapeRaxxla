3.5Km up you say? Id love to drive the SRV that left those tracks

Think its just graphics myself.

The NPC, yeah seen many, the best Ive got is that they are on some pre-determined course and the planet got in the way but I dont think that fits. Saw one flying into a mountain as well once didnt seem to accept it couldnt go forward, at least the ground has some sort of exclusion zone so they just hover.

I say this after many hours of observation and driving round in the SRV trying to find what they are pointing at, looking for caves, hidden doors, hidden bases, the hangar bay that would open up Thunderbirds style, hidden anything or even just a cargo drop. But nothing. Also scanned with every scanner going but nothing. Its why I always fit explo ships out as science vessels, never want to be without the right scanner....just in case but I think Im wasting my time. Those convoy ships carrying UAs seems to have been a on-off so far.

Saw 3 Police ships doing it once, all just hovering pointing at the ground. That was the convincer it was AI flight patterns and an inconveniently placed planet or mountain somehow.
