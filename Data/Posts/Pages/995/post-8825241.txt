Everything is possible but it would contradict the 'that Raxxla is a definite place, and that it holds a mystical secret.' part from the codex, wouldn't it?
Well, good point, but to me a "definite place" does not necessarily mean a physical one, although I agree it's difficult to justify that any non-physical place is a definite place.
