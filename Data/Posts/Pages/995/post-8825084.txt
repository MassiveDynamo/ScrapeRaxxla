The Ancients of Mumu in Phekda are a player faction. The name comes from the KLF song.
The song is a spinn on the lost continent of Mu: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(mythical_lost_continent)

Ah Mu!
Mu worshiped the great god Boid, but a disagreement over interpretation of holy writ caused a sect to arise that maintained there were numerous Boids. This led to an intersectine war. The numerous Boids sect built a magical enclosure to keep the others out of the Holy Places, a maze designed from six circles, since six is a holy number. Unfortunately the resultant high density of muons caused a breakdown in space-time causality and they were sucked into inter-dimensional space. You may be able to see them on occasions during the hyperspace transition, they look like yellow spiderâ€™s webs. Only the magical enclosure was left...
