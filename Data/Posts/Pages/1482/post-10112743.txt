There used to whole communities online solely devoted to expanding the lore (Elite fiction web rings) that have existed since the Internet was a a thing. The concept of the Club was not Braben's. It wasn't even Drew Wager's. It came from stories like "The Price of the Elite" which was written by Simon Challands. About 5% of the lore was official and 95% unofficial. If you ignore the fan-lore, you ignore the bulk of stuff that inspired myths for The Dark Wheel and Raxxla. The official stuff merely hints at the truth of the situation.
