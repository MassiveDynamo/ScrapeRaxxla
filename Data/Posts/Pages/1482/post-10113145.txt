Ariane Key

Strange entry... CMDR Ariane Key? Talk about symbols!

Edit : I'm on my way to Sadr, so if someone wants to have a look...
Will check it just in case it contains a hint of something. In-service date for the Type-9 is 3300, though. I mean wouldn't rule it. There is a lot of not entirely explainable twists in the Elite Universe's history that are hard to explain. May still get you looking at specific events.
