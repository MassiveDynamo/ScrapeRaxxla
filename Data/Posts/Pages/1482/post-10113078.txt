For the records, there was an intentional typo with Anumclaw which was spelled Arumclaw on Galnet.
As we are about to learn for the Nemesis ship, everything has its purpose.
It's an interesting mistake because an "r" before a "u" look a lot like a "n" if you read fast (which is normally the default mode for the brain, unless one still struggles with lecture).
I believe it is intentional.
To make it short. It could highlight a value by which we are to decode something. "r" to "n" is 4 (r=18th, n=14th). 4 is a "d".
Maybe if we trace back all typos in the news (how?) we could have something.
Or maybe this value, "4" is a key by which we can flip letters to obtain something....
Are we talking the whole Salvation/Azimuth Saga or more narrow? That is an interesting observation.
