Now that is interesting…

A seed might still only work against a fixed average, and potentially a fixed sphere of influence, otherwise you would flood the bubble.

That’s a manageable size, if / when I have the capacity I might look to plot these (for fun).

Again it’s more likely an automation, but if it’s not one might see some relation, hotspots etc.

Any grouping might be unintentional - on their own, but when compared with any other data it could identify an involuntary correlation; areas the Devs are avoiding (!). If intentional, it could identify key locations or conjunctions…
