So I googled Arcadia, found a page on top in German language. made a translation through the Google translator in English:

In Greek mythology, Arcadia was transfigured into the place of the "golden age" where people lived in idyllic nature as content and happy shepherds, unencumbered by tedious work and social pressure to adapt.
