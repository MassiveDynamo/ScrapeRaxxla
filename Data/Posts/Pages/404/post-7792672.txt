More Hecate fun

So Hecate being a triple deity... you know who else is? Saraswati - a river goddess sometimes associated with the cosmic river (milky way) and of course the reason Im mentioning her is the Megaship Sarasati which was part of the curiously named Equinox Project.... just find that interesting

Back to Hecate.. and the celestial crossroads... which seem to be a part of the Greater Eleusinian Mysteries celebrated around the equinox where initiates would have a vigil and possibly see the zodiacal light (dust along the ecliptic) pointing up to the milky way at the crossroads ... the crossroads are possibly also related to Ceres/Demeter through the Persephone myth.... Im paraphrasing from that paper on PLATO’S X & HEKATE’S CROSSROADS – Astronomical Links to the Mysteries of Eleusis.

The constellation known as 'The Field" is important in the l ( .. held on the equinox

Could The Field have been reinterpreted as a crossroads / portal ? Incidentally The Field is now part of Pegasus and is also known as the Great Square and yup is part of it.

It's easy to get the feeling that the triple deity concept is somehow central in the Raxxla mystery. The concept is old and predates all the known religions.
Here is a good list and explanation: https://amredeemed.com/sunday-decep...agan-religions-trinity-historical-polytheism/

In general the triple goddess can be seen a the weavers of faith. Those that control our destiny. If there is a common, prehistoric source for all these varieties that could bee seen as extraterrestrial, it would be an interesting connection to Raxxla.
