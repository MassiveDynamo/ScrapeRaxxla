I've been watching this thread for a while now, I believe Raxxla is within 10kly of the bubble (if they found it with Elite 1 tech then it must be within 10k). If you do the math that means there is a surface area of 391kly to cover

10kly of the current bubble, or the bubble back then?

It's expanding, right, as super powers increase their reach?
