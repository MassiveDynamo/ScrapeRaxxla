One of these crosses is near shinatra... Just saying. Did we already post this in here?

Did anyone notice that there are now no thargoid attacked systems... I call shenanigans. Or did they finally get thier lifetimes supply of orange sherbet icecream!?

I forgot if I posted this on here but I’ve always had a sneaking suspicion that thargoids are trying to protect Raxxla. They could have attacked inside the bubble from the start. But they didn’t. And they don’t really attack one place, then attack some random place after. It’s always moving along next to the previous attack’s. If Raxxla is a rogue body, it would make sense.
