The problem would be getting the guardian stuff to settle between the two nodes without the use of an SRV. I think you'd have to be pretty adept at dumping cargo to get it into those goal posts. Maybe its wide enough for a SLF to squeeze in there?
Not necessarily. what if you just have to charge it with laser fire, like the guardian relic in space?
