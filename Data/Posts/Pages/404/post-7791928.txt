Do you realize there is a system called hecate. I just got it in a tourist trip mission. It has multiple water or earth like worlds or something and tourist beacons. I think we need to go over all the tourist beacons and do tourist missions and then look at the clues. That is the other place there are written word clues.

Hecate may have been the one with the lovers destination where people propose. If a person doesn't accept it could be the lovers woe etc. It matches up. I think the hints for the clue are located in all the tourist beacons. It's just a journey to get them all and find the clues. They interestingly enough added the raxxla clues and the ability to see previously scanned tourist beacon and other data in the same patch. I don't think it's a coincidence.

FYI, I think this game was made after braben went on a long holiday and then decided to put it in a game.

Hecate? I'm sure it means nothing, but twice lately I've seen put forward as potentially relevant names that appear in A Midsummer Night's Dream (Oberon being the other one).

(EDIT: Of course, Hecate also appears in a section of Macbeth that is widely believed to have been added later and not actually part of the play. Clearly all a big conspiracy! Or not.)
