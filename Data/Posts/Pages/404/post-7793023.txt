I'm realising something. There are also 3 governments. They are basically like hecate controlling everyones destiny. This could be intentional. Plus there is this:



I know persephone is in empire space. Is there a selene and artemis in fed and alliance spaces? Possibly artemis in fed and selene in alliance.

Might mean something. Or give away the point. Is there an alignment of specific god traits in each empires planets or systems? maybe it tells us something. Plus there is still the oddity of keeping track of fed station numbers. I think there is something to that. We need to find what is and isn't represented and what they mean.
