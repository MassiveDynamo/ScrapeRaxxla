it would be an interesting connection to Raxxla.

True. I guess my thoughts on this are... The Dark Wheel is a secret society dedicated to finding a hidden alien mystery. They are using references from older religions and similar mystery cults as a means of leading potential initiates to them. I dont think they would give away any relevant hints as to raxxla... I think the toast, the omphalos rift, raxxla icon etc are crumbs that might point to the dark wheel station. I suspect that is the only place we will get any true hints as to raxxla. But who knows... Maybe there is a three aspected bloodsucking creature there waiting for us
