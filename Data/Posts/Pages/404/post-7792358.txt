Hecate? I'm sure it means nothing, but twice lately I've seen put forward as potentially relevant names that appear in A Midsummer Night's Dream (Oberon being the other one).

(EDIT: Of course, Hecate also appears in a section of Macbeth that is widely believed to have been added later and not actually part of the play. Clearly all a big conspiracy! Or not.)
If you liked Midsummer Night's Dream, have a look at a list of the moons of Uranus
