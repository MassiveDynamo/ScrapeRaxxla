What is hyperinterdiction. Is that getting pulled from a system to system jump? How and when did that start happening? And if so where did it occur?
Yes. They began almost exactly two years ago. They suddenly just started happening for no apparent reason with cmdrs being pulled out of hyperspace by an Unknown Ship and having their ship be disabled and then scanned before, for reasons as unapparent as those for the initial hyperdiction, the Unknown Ship would simply leave. The first was in Aries Dark Region IIRC.

Of course, the reports of similar sounding occurrences far from human occupied space many years ago were only discovered afterwards...
