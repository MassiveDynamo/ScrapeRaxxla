It's starting to feel like i'm gonna end up being one of those old men at the local starport's pub telling you how everything's connected to Raxxla while emptying bottle after bottle of Lavian Brandy.

It is, all, connected! From the very beginning. Human problems. Escape velocities. Thargoids didn't want a war. It's all so veiled now.. uh... I'm going to need another evil juice.
