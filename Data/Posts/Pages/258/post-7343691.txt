I think 1) is related to Sirius Corp nastiness, politics and/or early/research fsd failures, and 2) is related to Thargoids gathering humans for experiments/training (read T.James’ “Out of the Darkness”)

First is undoubtly related, in a part they their tech is a source of what happens.
But what exactly happens to people during such events is another story. Should look closer at what former president announces at Galnet. Thugh she's been quiet for sometime about her experience.
Also, considering Sirius corp is likely cleaning loose ends after those incidents by silenting people (you know how they do it). They are definitly hiding something. But what exactly?

As for second - Thargoids taking people out of ships or land bases, leaving ships intact? Not exactly the way Thargoids work, but who knows, there are at least 2 factions of thargoids, and we've met only one as of yet.

I'm going about exploring nebulas in my exploration quest to figure out how to figure out where raxxla is. I think I may have stumbled across something odd.(possibly not) I was setting up bookmarks on systems I could travel to to jump straight through nebula to see them in witchspace. I could have missed something, but the bookmarks around one of the nebula are now not on both sides of it. It may be one without a second location to jump through. But is it possible the nebula is moving?
No, they don't.
At least not with speeds you'd notice on galmap.
