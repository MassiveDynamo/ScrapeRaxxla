What is hyperinterdiction. Is that getting pulled from a system to system jump? How and when did that start happening? And if so where did it occur?

1. Yes you‘re being pulled from a system to system jump and no you cannot resist being pulled out.

2. Not sure when it actually started. The forst time I heard about it was when the Gnosis was hyperdicted on its way to Cone Sector.

3. I did scan the wake echoes with my wake scanner. Collected some data but did not get a message about where the Thargs jumped to. They did not attack, just did some scanning. Had no AX weaponry aboard my clipper so didn‘t try shooting them.

4. Happened in Pmeiades Sector two or three jumps out from Delphi.
