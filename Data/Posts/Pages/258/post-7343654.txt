There are 2 separate issues, afaiu.
1. Ships going BOOM entering hyperspace (Like Starship One). That part of a story, as to why that happens and what exactly happens - is one question to explore.
Considering the experience former president had during Starship One incident - might be in some part be connected to RAxxla search. Or at least has some unexplored part.
2. People disappearing, while everything else stays intact. There's one surface site which had that happen, there's that yacht from recent galnet article, and also i've heared that one of generations ships had the same thing happen.
There's no indication as of yet for what happened, how, and how it is connected to anything at all.

I think 1) is related to Sirius Corp nastiness, politics and/or early/research fsd failures, and 2) is related to Thargoids gathering humans for experiments/training (read T.James’ “Out of the Darkness”)
