Has anyone considered raxxla is in a binary star system. That poem says something about lost lover or something potentially implying dual something. Are binary stars rare. What are the rarest things in the game to check. It could simply be in that. The game mechanics in this game are a bit obvious when it comes to purpose. Rare produces better from what I've seen. Might be the easiest way to find it.

And I have yet to get a hyper pull yet. I'm near aries going toward bernard. That is where all the thargoid non human stuff is so far. Tones near maia. BTW, any chance looking through a black hole to something like nebulas might give away secrets. I notced stuff in the system shows up normally through the lense. And stuff outside the galaxy like other galaxies is in another layer that only shows off in a myst looking away from the black hole when near it. Other things do show up in the lense though. Had a weird layout of 4 stars in a box in MAIA, but I couldn't get it to line up with the black hole lensing. Not sure why. I might have done it wrong or it seems to turn into 2 stars. hard to line stuff up. I may have had the wrong objects.

I was wondering if there was a black hole to line up all those nebulas going to bernards nebula. MAybe look at them like a planetary alignment would. Maybe the black hole lets you travel at that point or warp with supercruise.

Has anyone tried to gather the location of these hyperinterdiction and triangulate an origin. Maybe it has a center point.
