I'm going about exploring nebulas in my exploration quest to figure out how to figure out where raxxla is. I think I may have stumbled across something odd.(possibly not) I was setting up bookmarks on systems I could travel to to jump straight through nebula to see them in witchspace. I could have missed something, but the bookmarks around one of the nebula are now not on both sides of it. It may be one without a second location to jump through. But is it possible the nebula is moving?
