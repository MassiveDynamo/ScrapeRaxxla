Concerning the diappearances: Had my first hyperdiction by two Tharg Scouts on saturday night. Got pulled from hyperspace, was treated to a shutdown and then scanned. Could the hyperdictions be somehow linked to the disappearances and are those hyperdicting bugs the same we have been fighting all along or do they believe to the other faction?
