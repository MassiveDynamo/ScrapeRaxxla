Ah, thanks Spock! Might have a go in encoded emissions sources too.

Shame about the DW2 start; got to the first system then kept crashing out......will try again tomorrow to get to Shapley 1

Indeed. I kept getting back in and kicked very quickly afterwards. In solo right now actually. Might try the PG again soon.
