Indeed. I kept getting back in and kicked very quickly afterwards. In solo right now actually. Might try the PG again soon.

I tried several times in vain so gave up & watched the livestream. Even that was having internet problems, as well as OA ‘s game crashing out every few minutes.

And the voice comms were unusable! Couldn’t get the wing voice option up and discord exploration channel had over 80 people, many talking at the same time.
