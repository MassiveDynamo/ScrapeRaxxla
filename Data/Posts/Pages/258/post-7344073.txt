Interesting thing about the Tionisla graveyard ... really the only way that it could always keep itself between the planet and its star would be if the graveyard exists at the L1 Lagrangian point of those two bodies. That means that someone with much better math skills than I could conceivably calculate the precise location of the graveyard.

Well ... I guess there would be ONE other way for the graveyard to always stay between the planet and the star. It could be truly gigantic and form a giant ring around the star that shares an orbital plane with the planet but that would be ridiculously large and would probably require the graveyard to be comprised of more ships then those that conceivably exist within the game universe.

Most probably at the lagrange point and you can find it just aproaching the planet from the star. Itâ€™s not in the game though.
