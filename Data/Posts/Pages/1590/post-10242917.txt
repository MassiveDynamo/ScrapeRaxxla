We know from the Codex and old Lore than Raxxla is guarded by a powerful group - but no-one said it was guarded by humans. Maybe the members of the Dark Wheel needed to be Elite because the Thargoids control whatever Raxxla is, and fighting Thargoids (or surviving against them) is pretty tough for a rookie. Maybe that explains how Raxxla was lost too - Thargoids took it over, or it was theirs anyway and humans accessed it briefly and then lost it.
I suppose this ultimately hinges on whether or not Jaques/Peter Jameson/Raffe Zetter is actually human given he seems to have put a hit on Jason Ryder. If Jaques isn't exactly human, he may be behind humanity losing access to Raxxla.

I should add at this point, the character customization screen strongly suggests that Achilles Corporation built a vast army of robots and cyborgs for The Pilot's Federation based on the eyes section. A number of Engineers also appear to be robots or cyborg based unexplainable lights in their portraits (and Palin getting sick with Cereberus Plague). The Cerberus story is often repeated in Pilot's Lounge profiles.
