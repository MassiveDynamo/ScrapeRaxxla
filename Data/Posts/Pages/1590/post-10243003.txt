In game there are various / sometimes contradictory, systems which depict compasses. It’s my assumption that at least one of these is an accurate reference, and it gives us a shifted axis, a west, east, north and south that’s alternative to that of galactic orientation.

If that’s true, where do certain locations fall in relation to these compass points, what does this say, what does it confirm. Is there the possibility such references if true were entered correctly!

There are some Egyptian god names attributed to the north, south, east and west winds, there are also the Greek winds also in game, and a couple of others… I suspect the Greek winds are accurate, because it makes the alignment of Yggdrasil make some sense sense. But I do feel there might be a level of error in game. Which only makes it more difficult to assign a logical, scientific approach.
Was actually about to suggest this as the Greeks had named the winds in compass directionals:

Boreas (north)
Kaikias (northeast)
Eurus (east)
Apeliotes (southeast)
Notus (south)
Lips (southwest)
Zephyrus (west)
Skiron (northwest)

Given the emphasis of nautical themes the winds make a perfect way to hide in plain sight a compass of sorts. More info plus other names from other cultures (just in case):
