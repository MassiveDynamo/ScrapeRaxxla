We're the only ones with snake ships: Asp, Diamondback, Sidewinder, Adder, Viper, Fer-de-lance, Cobra, Keelback, Krait, Mamba, Python, and Anaconda.




True - the ships are interesting. We have faulcon delacy a bird named (with logo) making snake named ships - and core dynamics (with an egg shaped logo) making bird named ships…. I believe the birds and snakes are a reference to the axis as there is a alot of association there…. Then of course there are the sea mammals…( i think those were just for the special aspect of moving through water)

But we do have an abundance of snake named ships…. Which would lean toward the lower end of our axis… i guess?

And the thargoid ships are all fantastical creatures .. the type a hero would fight…
