I played around with the Greco-Roman Cardinal Points after Rochester brought it up last time. There is a hint of a pattern... however if someone wanted there to be actual directions to them .... they could have done a much better job.... So I am of the opinion that someone just scattered some list of cardinal point systems in game but with no real meaning to it.
