In game there are various / sometimes contradictory, systems which depict compasses. It’s my assumption that at least one of these is an accurate reference, and it gives us a shifted axis, a west, east, north and south that’s alternative to that of galactic orientation.
Do you have some examples? The FFE Journals took quite some liberty with directional hints and quite often it required searching for hints on whereabouts was being discussed. I would still argue Universal Cartographics was not to clarify anything, it was essentially an extra layer of obfuscation. Apparently, the Elite Pilots' Federation is not exactly keen on the lower rank and file members having a clear sense of history. I personally blame the one who founded the organization and became Elite first. Peter Jameson does not appear to want but a select few to know their history. To what ends? I am not sure. Perhaps it is part of the test mentioned on the invitation? Is Peter Jameson a hero? This is also a really big unknown.
