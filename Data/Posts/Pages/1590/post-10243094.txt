This is my point entirely.

How much is accurate, how much is error, how much (if not all) is simply arbitrary, did the author know of this context, did they intentionally place them arbitrarily so as not to make such directions obvious, if so then why even bother!

Normally I would disregard this as arbitrary, but I do suspect some elements are intentionally accurate, because when viewed with other aspects, eg the shape of Yggdrasil, the Greek, and Older god pantheons, there does seem to be a specific alignment, and a division of upper and lower hemispheres, that axis is shifted, and ‘tiered’, it does align with certain compass points, making me suspect that at least one may be correct above all others!

Error in game is a real issue, there are segments of the galaxy with poor implementation.

One potential hypothesis might be certain errors were made and various alignments unintentionally shifted, as various conflicting data was later uploaded, effectively breaking whatever initial design was intended?

Are we looking at a ‘broken’ model?

As someone with experience of GIS mapping, one of my initial skills is being able to instinctually see patterns. Hand made designs usually have some pattern to them. If I were to design such of model, an initial problem would be if said relationships existed, it would actually become very obvious visually what was going in. Personally I would begin to introduce a level of randomness, or intentionally shift various axis so it looked more natural.

In my opinion if this design is intended that only goes further to heap praise on the author’s abilities.
