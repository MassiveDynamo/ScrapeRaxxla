There are some Egyptian god names attributed to the north, south, east and west winds, there are also the Greek winds also in game, and a couple of othersâ€¦ I suspect the Greek winds are accurate, because it makes the alignment of Yggdrasil make some sense. But I do feel there might be a level of error in game. Which only makes it more difficult to assign a logical, scientific approach.
