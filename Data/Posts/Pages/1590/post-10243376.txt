For context: it is actually very important that Sol orbits the galaxy normally but at a sharp tilt of 59Â°. The cultures of Earth would not have developed constellations if Sol's planets were essentially aligned with the galactic disk and north was true north. Between the spinning on its axis and rotating about Sol nearly lined up with the galactic disk the star field would constantly change (the whole of the visible halo would circle every 24 hours). Meanwhile if the equator was nearly lined up to the galactic disk, the spin of the planet alone would have you see a new patch of sky every hour (if in equatorial regions).

We only have long-term visibility to select stars because Sol's planets have a weird angle relative to the disk. As such, the northern and southern skies aren't looking at the halo but specific portions either above or below the disk that change much more slowly because they are perpendicular to rotation of the planet.
