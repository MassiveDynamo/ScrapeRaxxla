Been up and down on Yggdrasil a bit today, as it turns out Askr (I think one of the two first humans), which I expected to find among the roots of Yggdrasil, i.e. the Lost Realms, is up amongst the gods, 300 LY up. I also noted that Frigga (wife of Odin) and Baldr (her son with Odin) seem well off (by 200 LY) to one side - the same side as Zeta Cassiopeia (which is 500-700LY iirc from Axis Mundi). Askr is empty, with stars only (not even belt clusters).
We have this pattern of mythological systems now, so I'm looking out for anything that deviates from that pattern, in the hope of finding a clue... .
