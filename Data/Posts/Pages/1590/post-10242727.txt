This is just my personal opinion. The larger threat is Jaques/Peter Jameson/Raffe Zetter/Augustus Brenquith/Caleb "Salvation" Wycherley. I believe he is the Guardian AI in a humanoid form. Remember, Raffe Zetter appears to have had Jason Ryder killed after he confided in him and asked for a deep space team re: Raxxla. Peter Jameson or whatever you want to call him appears to be voice actor at Klatt Enterprises and may be voice at Stack (Stack is one moon away from J. Jameson crash). This would be during First Thargoid War which is before Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm even exists (founded 3193 but Thargoids gone by 3151 per GCS Saravasti). This means Imperial Navy Research Arm is behind Sohalian Fever.
