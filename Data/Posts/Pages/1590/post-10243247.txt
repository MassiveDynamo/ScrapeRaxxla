This is intentional. Look at the Federal Security Service Compass logo which interestingly sports a very Imperial flair given unification in 3008. It is a compass. I guess old habits die hard. Despite the Alliance being Galactic South (away from the core) it is North. Galactic North (inwards towards the core) is South. Too early to pin down West vs East but I suspect it will be East is the side of Bubble with Orion Molecular Cloud Complex and West is side with Varati (Canonn Science HQ system).

Quit trying to force it to be true Galactic North where North would be above the galaxy directly above the center of the galaxy. Humans did what humans had done for centuries (because again old habits die hard) and anchored the directionals firmly to Sol and our old habitual version of direction vs Earth firmly at dead center. It is somewhat counter-intuitive but it really would have been hard to break what had always worked for us as a species. Sol may orbit the galaxy sanely but our perspective is altered by our home system's tilt relative the ecliptic of like 59 degrees. Going true directionals of galaxy versus its' plane and core would have been disorienting as the Solar System never was aligned to the galactic disk despite orbiting in that plane. Up was never up like it would be if Sol had no tilt vs galactic disk. We never had the benefit of North being true north.

There was even a discussion a few pages down of Sol and somewhere unknown in the lost realms area forming an axis.

In any case, what we're missing after all this time is the sticking end of the thread. After it, things should hopefully begin to unravel.
