Crispy fried whelk, yummy!!


Think Stellarium is fairly good, so use that to check planetsâ€™ 1-8 positions against game positions vs time?
Starting with 2000, then current date then fast forward to 3307...
I have used stellarium to go to 3307 but the planets positions is not the same
Dont know if its ED or stellarium that makes it wrong.
