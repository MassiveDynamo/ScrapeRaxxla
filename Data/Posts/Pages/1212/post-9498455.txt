Working my way up - currently near the center +1927ly... nothing to report. Would be nice to know how they found those thargoid sensors...

By happenstance? one at least in EDOdyssey. Seems to be a random POI, but unusual so far away from Merope. But someone has said these random POI also include Guardian objects, so maybe not unexpected?

Perhaps its just an EDO bug?
