Some of the baetyl were said to be meteorites (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baetylus), so presumably the others weren’t.

We’ve spent quite a few hours exploring for asteroids in Sol but found nothing so far. Since it doesnt show on the FSS it must be located by ship sensors at short range, possibly after sacrificing a bull, turning anticlockwise three times and reciting the Odyssey backwards in the original Greek. The Raxxla logo may show three arcs that are typical of the symbol above the entrance to asteroid bases, &/or it may represent the Hilda asteroids (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_asteroid) that appear to be positioned at three arcs between the main asteroid belt and Jupiter.
Good hunting!
May well do. Just narrowly avoided being sucked into a black hole on way to Sag A*, but when/if I get back I'll have another look.
