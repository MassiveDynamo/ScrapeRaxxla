That would certainly count as hard to find. Its about 220km diameter making it 2/3rds the size of the smallest object in the sol system in game from FSS, which is Hi'iaka (radius 160km according to EDSM). You could have a laugh and practice finding Hi'iaka without orbit lines.

If its a body that reflects light then there should be a spot visible by eye. But the search space is quite big (in the HHGTTG sense of just down the road to the chemist..)





Apparently its currently at apehelion (furthest from Sol) . Now I don't think we ever established:

(1) Are the orbits of the planets accurately modelled?
(2) if accurately modelled, what epoch are they set to? By this I mean - have their positions been projected to in-game time, or are they as current or at some other time?

I think we know that star positions are as per J2000 epoch data, but planet positions in Sol may be another matter.

If we can work out what the planet positions are then we might be able to predict Chiron's position to narrow down the area of search. I give us a whelks chance in a supernova, though..
