By happenstance? one at least in EDOdyssey. Seems to be a random POI, but unusual so far away from Merope. But someone has said these random POI also include Guardian objects, so maybe not unexpected?

Perhaps its just an EDO bug?
This ^.

As buggy and weird as the game is currently, I wouldn't give any credence to anything controversial found. Heck, the game is still rendering "impact sites" incorrectly seven times out of ten.
