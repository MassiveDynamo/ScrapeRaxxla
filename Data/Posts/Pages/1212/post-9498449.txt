Nice Asp
That’s how rumours start!

I had just started to upgrade my AspX “Deep Thought” to use a v1 FSD etc when struck down by the RSI. Thought it would be nice to go planetary exploring again looking down between my legs through the floor. Oh happy days of endless searching for Dynasty and INRA bases by mk1 eyeball!

After a month away from the cockpit I’m feeling bored and restless and suffering fernweh (also the name of one of my exploration Phantoms).
Bah humbug!!
