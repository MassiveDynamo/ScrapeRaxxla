Ok, still suffering RSI and not fit to fly so going to throw a new variant hypothesis into the arena for someone else to check out.

John Harper, author of “And Here The Wheel” said (

) “Raxxla itself, the mystery, who's rumours and sightings seem to ebb and flow on a 50 year cycle and we're approaching that 50-year peak”

Dont know where he got that snippet from, but it does suggest Raxxla is a wandering/orbiting body with a period of approximately 50 years. Still favour my “Raxxla in Sol” hypothesis, so are there any bodies in Sol with a period of ~50 years? Yep! ‘2060 Chiron’ (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2060_Chiron) is a 200Km diameter “Centaur” asteroid, which orbits between the outer planets and the Kuiper belt (reminiscent of “obfuscated on the outer rim”?) that may be a minor planet &/or a comet (comet designation 95P/Chiron) with an orbital period of 50 years with perihelion of 8.4311 AU, just inside Saturn’s orbit. Its astronomical symbol (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_symbols) strongly resembles a key (“Place that isn't a place, door that is also the key”?).

It was discovered in 1977, is the first of the Centaur class asteroids, was even claimed by the press at the time to be the tenth planet, and there is a Chiron Orbiter Mission mission proposed for NASA.

So sounds like a good candidate for investigation!
