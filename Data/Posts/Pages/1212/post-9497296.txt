That’s a Thargoid Sensor, not a Thargoid Probe which has two “bulbs” (https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Thargoid_Probe) not a bulb plus canisters.

Are you sure that the location claimed is the galactic centre? No system name shown in that video clip. Sanguineous Rim is supposed (Codex - objects reported) to have Thargoid objects and (ED Wiki) may be the main (permit locked) region of Thargoid civilisation.

Edit: actually system name might be shown, but is indistinct on my iPad. Centre screen seems to show Osomething HR-W d1-757 B. But it’s definitely a TS not a TP

Edit2: Ogainks HR-W d1-957 ??
That’s definitely near the centre. Perhaps the goids have run their equivalent of Distant Worlds2?
