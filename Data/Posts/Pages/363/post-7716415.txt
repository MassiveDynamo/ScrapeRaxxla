Today I completed an A* Challenge run and flew out to Source 2, which is in the Sagittarius A* system just over 90 Kls away from Sgr A* itself. There is nothing here and the FSS scanner only shows Sgr A*, Source 2 and the Tourist Beacon ('The Centre') in the system. Source 2 was the first thing I thought of when I first read 'the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies' so that is one possibility for what that sentence refers to that I would now rule out.
