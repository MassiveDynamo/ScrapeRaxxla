Completely forgot to elaborate on the r/askastronomy thing! I messaged the mods, explained our situation, and asked them if we should post the question on the subreddit. This was their response:
Go ahead and post it - it's a fun question. I think it's a long shot, though.

The stars won't help much but maybe those smudges could be the magellanic clouds?

I recommend you get SpaceEngine and see if you can get the magellanic clouds to line up like that, or some nebulae perhaps. It might be easier to move around in SpaceEngine than Elite Dangerous because you don't need space ships or fuel or anything, you just go where you please.

Does anyone want to help formulate and compose the Reddit post? Meanwhile, I'm also derping around in Space Engine. Hope I find something!
