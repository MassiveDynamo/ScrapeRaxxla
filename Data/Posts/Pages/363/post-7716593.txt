With regard to Stellarium, I've actually been messaging the mods of r/askastronomy to see if they could help us out with this matter (more on that below), they mentioned using something called SpaceEngine to figure out the location. Apparently it lets you travel the milky way in a manner vaguely similar to the ED galaxy map. I haven't looked into that software myself yet.

With regard to what you said about the title screen image, see my post above. The videoloop clearly was composed by the devs, as evidenced by the physical impossibilities shown and the fact that nothing moves besides the station itself. I think it could still be a representation of an in-game location. To make a pretty (and inconspicuous) title screen, filtering out any red glare from stars outside the picture would make sense.

And even if it doesnt refer to the same location, the location it does (possibly) refer to could hold interesting secrets nonetheless!

I think it is possible this is a picture I took when exploring
