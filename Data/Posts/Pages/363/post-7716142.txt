Yo folks,

I was intrigued by the system names in the image posted earlier. So I got into the Galmap and tried some postions. I don't think that those system names are leading us anywhere. Is there anyone who knows where these come from?

Alnilam is called Epsilon Orionis, in ED.

It's an important star, as it is one of the 'Real name' jewels. Alnilam is derived from Arabic 'Al-nilam', where nilam means sapphire.

I think it has a black hole to.
