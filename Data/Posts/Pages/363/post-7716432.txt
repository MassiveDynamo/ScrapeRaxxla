Sixth, the rest of the Dark Wheel toast (which only makes sense after you've actually unlocked the real Dark Wheel) contains five more clues: the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deeper void, the parents' grief, the lovers' woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. Each of those is a location, giving 6 locations altogether.

I think you're probably on the mark with your sequence of events, however I think this phrase is a single clue, not two clues: "the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void"
