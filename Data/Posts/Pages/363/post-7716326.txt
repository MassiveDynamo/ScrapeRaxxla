Those annotations don't look right to me. I overlaid this from Stellarium, and Betelgeuse and Bellatrix should also be visible and are not... need to look again

I am not so sure if using Stellarium helps. Stellarium shows us the view from Earth. If TDW station isn't really close to Earth, the stars will look different.

My initial thoughts when looking at the main menu screen were:
Star class from the system is a white one. I read that someone found out its probably "A".
The station is an ORBIS one, orbiting an icy moon/planet.
There is another planet/moon really close (too close actually for ingame but might be a hint regardless) in the foregroud with the SRV. This means either a binary moon constellation or really close orbits.
Together with the info that it is thought to be "orbiting the 8th moon of an unnamed gas giant" I assumed this would help to narrow the possible systems down significantly. I furthermore assumed that the system is within 1000ly of the bubble due to the fact that early hyper-drives were not so potent, which means that there is a good chance the system was already scanned by someone.

However, the image from the CODEX shows that the Dark Wheel Orbis station is in close proximity to a red star, which is a contradiction to the main menu. My feeling is that we should give the image in the CODEX more weight, as it was put in later and probably for a reason.
