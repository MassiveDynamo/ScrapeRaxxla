Yo folks,

I was intrigued by the system names in the image posted earlier. So I got into the Galmap and tried some postions. I don't think that those system names are leading us anywhere. Is there anyone who knows where these come from?

Hey! I was linked that image through Reddit and was told it originated from this thread, but due to the forum revamp I was not able to find the original post. On the previous page Jorki Rasalas noted that Cmdr Lachann was involved. Jorki Rasalas also stressed that those markings were vague guestimates -- and hadn't lead to anything conclusive.

That being said, as long as there is a chance this image might contain clues, I think it's worth pursuing.

I wonder if we can ask for help with this externally. For example by approaching r/askastronomy with the image, and hoping one of the subscribers there has access to ED?
