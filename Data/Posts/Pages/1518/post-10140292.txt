I thought it was just Elvira Martuuk & Bill Turner.

P.S. I imagine Liz Ryder will be a supporter/member of TDW, and I think they’re supposed to be enemies of The Club, but don’t recollect what is the basis for that perception. Clearly Salomé was an enemy of The Club, as was (eventually) Rebecca, and by association Alyssia Fields (IIRC the name correctly) and Luko....though I suspect Luko (Luciano "Luko" Prestigio Giovanni) was actually “elder Giovanni” of CIEP (from Legacy).

P.P.S. I find it unlikely that two characters by two independent authors MB’s Legacy and Drew Wagar’s Reclamation & Premonition) are both named Giovanni. Whether that is actually based on background lore that we haven’t seen, whether it will be revealed at some point, or whether it is somehow meaningful in the TDW/Raxxla storyline I have absolutely no idea. I think it’s also interesting (and I suspect corroboration, but does it have deeper meaning??) that “Giovanni” is the Itallian version of “John”, and “Prester John” is named as part of the Codex Raxxla entry....”Prester” meaning “Presbyter” which means “elder”. In Latin “Prester John” was “Presbyter Ioannes”......

It's not clear that all of them are directly sponsored by the Club. They might not even know it them self, but the Club are pulling the threads.

As Infrastructure says:
‘What do you think
all this was about? The clandestine technology acquisition aimed at ensuring
that necessary advances took place according to a certain timetable, fanning
the flames of war between the Federation and the Empire to ensure humanity
has a fleet that has a chance in the coming battle. The encouragement of the
space-faring masses to grow their skills in the Arena and weaponise their ships
courtesy of those oh-so-convenient “Engineers.” We don’t intend to allow
humanity to be cannon fodder in someone else’s war.’
