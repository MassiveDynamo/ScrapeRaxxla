Take caution when investigating Thargoid controlled territory at abandoned settlements...
Mark my words: some of what we thought was long isn't nearly as dead as we would have liked to believe.

We know from Premonition that many (all?) engineers are directly sponsored by "The Club". They are closest to secret cabal, we have in ED. The Club was also reponible for leaking information about the Guardian ruins. Only engineers seem to be able to decode data from the Obelisks.
Other note: The Engineers especially Palin may not be what you think. Palin got with Cereberus Plague. Do realize what that implies?

From "Community Goal: Wilkes Orbital in Need" ( https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/56eaa1569657badd62b3d3d8 ):
The normally peaceful Wilkes Orbital has been the focus of considerable attention in recent weeks. First, the starport was at the centre of a campaign to drive the Blue Hand Gang from the nearby Orulas system. Then authorities at the station announced that the escape pods recovered in the operation contained Professor Ishmael Palin and the other members of his research team. Now it seems that the majority of those recovered from the criminals, including Professor Ishmael Palin, have been infected with a strain of Cerberus Plague, the deadly pathogen that claimed millions of lives last year.

Also, note the criminal reference very close to where Palin is mentioned.
