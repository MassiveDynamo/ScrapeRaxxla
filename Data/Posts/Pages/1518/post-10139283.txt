Are Sirius, Tau Ceti, Reunion, Kameleos, Lynx III, Phoenix, Agara, & Hyperiona all in game ? They kinda look like a wheel. Just saying.
Sirius, Tau Ceti, and Sol are definitely in-game. I suspect the others may be but detective work is involved in teasing out the references. There is plenty with highly detailed descriptions and others that would require guesswork. Fortunately, most of these books by Holdstock and Malcolm Edwards have indexes with page references for key locales. This is also why I think Transport Lakon Baker Gamma Sierra Heavy has a reference to 419 historical novels. It would also be why the Bonespire Publishing GalNets reference trying to revive science fiction. Yes, most is probably in-game. However, I wouldn't rule out needing to read in order to realize a system was important.
