Possibly, although there is some thought that the legends had roots in actual events..Atlantis in the destruction of Santorini, El Dorado (literally “The Golden Man”) from the Aztec king being covered in gold dust and bathing in Lake Titicaca in an annual festival, or perhaps the wealth of the Aztec Kings (El Rey Dorado), and Prester John from the Ethiopian Orthodox Empire (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Empire) when the Crusaders were looking for christian allies.

So perhaps those codex references are also hinting that there is some substance behind the “Raxxla myth”....

Edit
I can’t help feeling we’re missing some information. I suspect in Tourist Beacons, but where might they be?
