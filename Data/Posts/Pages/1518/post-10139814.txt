I am really hoping from some good science fiction horror. That said, my squadron is morally opposed to further inflaming tensions with the aliens (but certainly not opposed to rescue efforts). I am hoping the activists among the CMDRs will be able to source necessary components via ethical means so we can see the inside of Maelstroms.
Utopia has no such morals, been preparing for this for a few days now, heading in!!
