They seemed to make quite a big thing of the Orrery in the video and how you can see weird system layouts as apposed to the older style system map...
I can confirm that DSS scanning bodies with odd orbits relative to the larger system often have much more interesting POIs (also applies to moons with odd orbits). Orbital lines are your friend. My working theory on this is these appear to be former rogue bodies which have been gravitationally captured.
