Yes all very perplexing. Good point, shame we can’t double-rep!

On its own one would likely say it’s just confirmation it’s in game (which I believe), but the Devs insights highlighted there is more to meet the eye (also believe), potentially indicating something had been inserted, that likely enables us to find it (better), or it was expanded upon!
