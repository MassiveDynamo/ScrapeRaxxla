Small correction - Luko as a CIEP elder is in And Here The Wheel, not Legacy.

I think there was collaboration between authors to give their characters cameos in each others novels etc.

If the prester john is a reference to Luko, then it's in the wrong codex entry.

TDW vs The Club - the implication (in Premonition) is that Rebecca was working for the Club at one point, and then something happened to alert her to their manipulations after which they were antagonists.
