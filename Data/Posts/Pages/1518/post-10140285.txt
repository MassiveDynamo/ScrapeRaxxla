Small correction - Luko as a CIEP elder is in And Here The Wheel, not Legacy.

I think there was collaboration between authors to give their characters cameos in each others novels etc.

If the prester john is a reference to Luko, then it's in the wrong codex entry.

TDW vs The Club - the implication (in Premonition) is that Rebecca was working for the Club at one point, and then something happened to alert her to their manipulations after which they were antagonists.

Ah yes, AHTW.....was a bit tired yesterday.
He had another fit at 01:20 this morning

Well, why would the authors “share” characters? Doesn't make sense to me, unless it’s a hint that everything really is related, somehow....
Dont see why you say that reference is in the wrong codex entry. If Prester John is hinting at CIEP elder Giovanni, who is actually Luko Giovanni and who helped Salomé and Rebecca... isnt that implying CIEP, TDW & The Club are all relevant to the Raxxla storyline? CIEP were searching for (and found) Soontill, TDW were/are searching for Raxxla. The Club...who knows?
