I have suspected location in a planetary ring for a while; possibly asteroid cluster after Hesperus storyline highlighted possibility of non-detection by scanners until you drop in, but planetary ring seems more likely. The Beyond new mining gameplay and visual fog effects would be a good improvement on the original implementation.

Edit
Update prevents play today, but copawlot had a fit at 04:30, so an afternoon snooze is on the cards.
