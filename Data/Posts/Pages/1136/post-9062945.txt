Hint: only the most single important technological leap in human history. Also, ask yourself this: is it really a coincidence that Bill Turner (son of Meredith Argent and Mic Turner) specializes in FSD wakes and their analysis and various sensors and things that generally aid in long-haul journeys? You may want to read GalNet on what exactly went down with MetaDrive, Inc.

I like Argent and Turner as our star crossed Lovers - and Turners Quest... And of course Polaris. I think the Martian artefact is most probably tied to if not the omphalos. It also makes sense that Bill Turner would be someone to check out more. All that stuff about children of the dark wheel. As to where to look in Sol I am going off of Holdstocks books - "The Alien World" pointed to mars as the location of a "crystal record" and sites on Mars and Earth. In his book "Tour of the Universe" there are archaeological remains on Pluto with an inscription that mentions "voice mounds" being left on Mars and Earth. Might warrant more Plutonian research. Also we have our new set of star crossed lovers Not quite a prince Hadrian and his gal Astrid....

Oh the Meta Drive stuff reminds me of a pamphlet I ran across a while back :
