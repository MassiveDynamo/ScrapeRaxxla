Hint: only the most single important technological leap in human history. Also, ask yourself this: is it really a coincidence that Bill Turner (son of Meredith Argent and Mic Turner) specializes in FSD wakes and their analysis and various sensors and things that generally aid in long-haul journeys? You may want to read GalNet on what exactly went down with MetaDrive, Inc.

Why would finding an Omphalous Rift / gateway give any more power or money to one person than mining Platinum or LTDs? Taxing or setting a toll for the gateway I can see making money but why keep it secret, what advantage is there to that? Also why would a theory described in the Codex itself as discredited be taken as more important than other things in the Codes that arent described as discredited?
