Ah but they didnt specify which God, maybe it was Annoia the Goddess of things getting stuck in the kitchen drawer and small lost items like car keys.
I hear she magically edits posts and puts them together for you in random order also. And if you upset her you get hexedited.

One other thing as a teaser of where this is headed:

Based on the Mars Artifact tourist beacon in Sol and the early hyperpace tourist beacon in Tau Ceti the discovery of Raxxla happened in Sol but that doesn't mean it is in Sol. Specifically, the Mars Artifact means Thargoids have been in Sol since 2280 and possibly for centuries prior to that.
This assumes the Mars Artefact is Thargoid, and not Guardian or something else entirely. AFAIK there is no strong evidence of it being Thargoid.
