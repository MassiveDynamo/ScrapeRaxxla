Heads up folks: I haven't posted again only because I realized calculations for 3D coordinate grids are much more complicated to calculate with than standard 2D planes. That being said, I determined where things went awry and am adjusting my numbers. Also, figured out a way last night should allow me use several tools that will make the whole thing easier. Hopefully, will have some idea where we are once I have valid calculations.
