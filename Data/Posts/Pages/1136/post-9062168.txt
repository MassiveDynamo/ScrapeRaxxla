To the jewel that burns on the brow of the mother of galaxies! To the whisperer in witchspace, the siren of the deepest void! The parent's grief, the lover's woe, and the yearning of our vagabond hearts. To Raxxla!

Well... In all your posts you say that Raxxla is the thargoid machine but you don't take into account that Raxxla exists since the game's launch. The whole thargoid thing was included in a later update, so this theory doesn't make any sense. The moderators have closed all the posts you have previously made because they were already bordering on madness and now you come to post the same trash here.
