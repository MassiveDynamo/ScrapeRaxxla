This assumes the Mars Artefact is Thargoid, and not Guardian or something else entirely. AFAIK there is no strong evidence of it being Thargoid.
Tell me, then, what terrified humanity so much they threw it in a vault on Mars, prayed its civilization was dead, and vowed never to speak of it again? Do you honestly believe that the Guardians would have provoked such a response from the Sol government? Personally, I'd be overjoyed if as a species the first advanced life detected was intelligent and like the Guardians.
