One other thing as a teaser of where this is headed:

Based on the Mars Artifact tourist beacon in Sol and the early hyperpace tourist beacon in Tau Ceti the discovery of Raxxla happened in Sol but that doesn't mean it is in Sol. Specifically, the Mars Artifact means Thargoids have been in Sol since 2280 and possibly for centuries prior to that. The first colony wasn't founded until 2296. The initial discovery happened via hyperspace probes sent from Sol before the generation ships (which by the way only got to approximately 9% of lightspeed). I suspect that a more thorough investigation of Sol will uncover one or more crashed Thargoid ships in Sol itself. Finally, only two humans have ever been to Raxxla (potentially) and are probably responsible for its permit lock: Mic Turner and Meredith Argent.
