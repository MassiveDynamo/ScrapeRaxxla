I going further in my trying to analyze the Hecate Wheel and it trinity. May something important being in the center of distances from three special systems? For example this three aspects of goddesses who brings light on the crossroads. For example something placed on the same distances from Artemis, Persephone and unknown Eileithyia (or Lucina, or Juno). Or even Shinrarta Dezhra. Probably nothing. Because it is too easy. Not too easy as a calculation, but too easy as an idea. Raxxla or key to it can't hide such oblivious way. I think if I will ready to find Raxxla some day, I should be read main Codex page of it. Not the toast, but facts about Tau Ceti, Art, Cora, Omphalos Rift etc. Ancient goddess is only the spices on this way.
