Yeah the way they managed to pinpoint the signal source made my head hurt trying to understand. Also late time I activated the map room I noticed that the map would drift slowly out the room not sure if it was a bug or not, but to get back on topic I'm not entirely convinced that this is the same route to Raxxla. Do we have any concrete evidence that Thargoids and Raxxla are even connected in a small way?

We don't have any evidence that they are connected. The map has a specific purpose and it's not to find Raxxla.

The spiraling stars in the 'map room' are interesting though.

If anything in the thargoid realm is Raxxla related, I would guess Merope 5C is most likely. It's an unremarkable moon at the center(omphalos) of everything. The only thing interesting about it, is a peculiar orbital inclination.
Merope 5C has been more searched than any planet in the game. If there is something there, we are missing a key ingredient in the search.

Perhaps it's the cosmic enlightenment?
