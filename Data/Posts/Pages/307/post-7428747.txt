This may be known but this whole are is off limits and near thargoid infested space... I like to explore these bright star clusters. Can't even get close to it. This whole region is locked with unknown permits for 1000's of ly!

These images are from the giant space hotdog near california nebula. NGC 1333...

My favorite things to explore are super bright star clusters and giant space weiners.. This upsets my exploration dreams very heavily!

Yeah there’s a number of fairly large swaths of the galaxy locked behind an “unknown permit”. Been waiting to get into the Horsehead Dark Region for what seems like an eternity but apparently FDEV hasn’t finished with whatever it is they’re doing in there yet. Either that there is a way to get the “unknown permit” that no one has figured out for a few years.
