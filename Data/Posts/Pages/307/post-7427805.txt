If Thargs knows Raxxla and it is the place, then using different system as a target (Raxxla) they may found it. Found it using different link. Hmm, no. It is definitely different things. Thargs and Raxxla. Yes, they may to know, but we haven't mechanic to re-turn that unknown machine to find something else except Thargs sites. And second. If Thargs know Raxxla, will they use it? Can they use it? Can we use it?..

And third thoughts... Federation leaders knows what was Martian non-human Artifact. It was not useless. At least as a source of information. No one will hide something like a piece of stone in 3305. So this artifact may be usable. At least as a source of information.
