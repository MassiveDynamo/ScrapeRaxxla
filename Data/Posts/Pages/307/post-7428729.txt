This may be known but this whole are is off limits and near thargoid infested space... I like to explore these bright star clusters. Can't even get close to it. This whole region is locked with unknown permits for 1000's of ly!

These images are from the giant space hotdog near california nebula. NGC 1333...

My favorite things to explore are super bright star clusters and giant space weiners.. This upsets my exploration dreams very heavily!

Here is another one you can go to. I got farther down the california dog and you can start to see another one nearer the loop along with the off limits one. I also found another little beauty!
