We don't have any evidence that they are connected. The map has a specific purpose and it's not to find Raxxla.

The spiraling stars in the 'map room' are interesting though.

If anything in the thargoid realm is Raxxla related, I would guess Merope 5C is most likely. It's an unremarkable moon at the center(omphalos) of everything. The only thing interesting about it, is a peculiar orbital inclination.
Merope 5C has been more searched than any planet in the game. If there is something there, we are missing a key ingredient in the search.

Perhaps it's the cosmic enlightenment?

Donâ€™t forget UAs all point to Merope star/system and UPs all point to Merope 5C.
Maybe we need a tuning fork &/or pendulum?
