Fly a DBX, do you?
Nah, Krait Phantom. It could be something with Cockpit lights so it'd be interesting to see if it can be replicated in other ships.

Looks to me like a reflection from cockpit lights . Maybe look to see if there are overhead lights in a similar configuration? U have the christmas lights up im your cockpit ?
That's a good point actually, I do have the christmas lights mounted in the Krait, when I get to a station next i'll try and remote them and try to replicate. It most likely is a graphics bug but the lights do not look reminiscent of any cockpit or ship light configuration I am aware of.

Thanks for your input guys, I think it is just space madness but now I can't stop staring at them
