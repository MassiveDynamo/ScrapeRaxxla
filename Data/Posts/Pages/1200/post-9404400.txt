Learning more Thargoid history is always good. We only have one of at least three perspectives on the Guardian / Thargoid conflict.
Raxxla feels closer to Guardian than Thargoid, but we may have the history of the wrong group.
Thargoids may know more than us, even about Raxxla.
Let’s face it, that would not be difficult!

ALL we know is that Raxxla is in-game, in the Milky Way, and it may be a definite place, but we don’t know what it is! Yet, we’re still looking for it!

Yes we are space-mad!

If Agatha Christie had written a plotline like that it would have been a flop!
