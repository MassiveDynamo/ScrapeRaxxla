So my attempt to figure out a "y" value was essentially moving up and down in the galaxy map until i didnt see little blue selection dots

SPOILER: SAMPLE DOTS

gave me a rough upper and lower boundary of the thickest part of the galactic "bulge" - I did this highly scientific measurement five times and then took the middle points and averaged them and got a magical number of -113 for my "y"

Therefore my projected center point is: 408 / -113 / 26941

And drum rolll.... I found squat there... so starting a search pattern
