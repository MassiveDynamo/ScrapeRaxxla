Funny - was at that star on Sunday- had a good sniff about, nothing unusual - even 2nd honked - just in case ; nothing. Source 2 - just another star and not much of a jewel..

Now what is unusual is the 2nd star in a system having a name. Mind you Sag A* is also the only black hole you can jump to ? (Unless anyone knows others?)
The Great Annihilator springs to mind!

But there are loads.
