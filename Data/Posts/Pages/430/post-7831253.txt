OK, so what's the Jewel that burns on its brow?

Now the only Jewel that burns is diamond - a carbon star (white dwarf) ?
Funny you say that, I have often wondered if spiralling stars could be a reference to either a neutron star or a white dwarf. I wonder if these non sequence stars could be the path of a Fibonacci sequence?

Sag A is sometimes referred to as the mother of the milky way. Is there a neutron star or white dwarf on its "brow" that could be the first in the sequence.

You know you have the lensing effect through the black hole in Maia....I wonder if something similar in Sag A would point us to this non-sequence star pattern?

I have been out to Sag A, but never with a Raxxla head on. I am all the way out in Lyras Song at the moment, but might head that way before returning to the bubble. I'll have to see how my hull is doing!
