I've been thinking about the following old posts from Michael regarding Raxxla, specifically that Raxxla is "something different" (from a system) & that it is a story to experience in game.

I reckon the story element of Raxxla revolves around the disappearance of president Halsey and we (the players) missed some crucial next step, therefore FD then rebooted the story with Gan and the missing ship. It might be worth taking a fresh look at the disappearing president to see if it brings anything up.

Raxxla is something different.

It was more of a spiritual successor than a direct sequel. We did look at a story involving Raxxla, but felt that was a story that should be played out in game rather than as a novel.

Consensus appears to be that we did miss something in the Halsley story, or rather the Guardian sites were found by triangulating a screenshot instead - the Halsley thing was meant to lead to the Guardians.

The Romero thing may be the next Guardian story element?

Related to Raxxla - who can tell?
