Funny - was at that star on Sunday- had a good sniff about, nothing unusual - even 2nd honked - just in case ; nothing. Source 2 - just another star and not much of a jewel..

Now what is unusual is the 2nd star in a system having a name. Mind you Sag A* is also the only black hole you can jump to ? (Unless anyone knows others?)

You're not wondering why it's called 'Source 2'? Go to Prism system, where all the stars have names, but none of them have additional numbers - so why 'Source 2' and not just 'Source'? Where is 'Source 1'? Is there a 'Destination 2'? That sounds like somewhere interesting to go.

Incidentally, if you go to Prism, don't get over-excited about the star called 'Diamond' - that's definitely a Rift thing.

Edit:
Obviously I mean letters, not numbers, so Source 2 should be Sagittarius A* B, which makes it all the more curious.
