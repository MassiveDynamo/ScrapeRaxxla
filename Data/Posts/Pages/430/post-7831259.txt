Where does this phrase "There will be no clues" originate from specifically? From what I have always understood about this, the person at FDev that said this only intended to say "Nobody at FDev will directly answer Raxxla questions so please don't annoy us on social media about it". In this forum however I frequently see people use this phrase as a hard rule in the game of finding Raxxla, precluding all information that could be considered an official clue.

Surely instead of that the addition of the information in the codex is a sign that FDev has expanded upon the Raxxla mystery from a hunt, across billions of systems to encourage exploration, to a mystery that requires actual investigation. We shouldn't assume the Raxxla mystery as it is today was in the game since the beginning. What started as an Easter egg hunt to add flavor to the Exploration rank has now retroactively gained lore and clues in-game.

Wish I could give this post multiple likes!!!!

This was essentially my whole argument yesterday. We have to assume there is a puzzle for us to solve!
