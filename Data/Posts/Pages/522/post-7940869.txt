The secret is to shoot some spaceships whenever you have a chance. Like today I was killing some passenger liners and cargo haulers, then shot down multiple system authority ships, decided to take a passenger mission and took the follow-up mission to kill the pirate lord threatening said passenger, finished with scanning a few unexplored systems while killing three bounty hunters sent after me. All in the same Asp. I love my holiday in Colonia.
