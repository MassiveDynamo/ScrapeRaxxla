I would love to know what I'm missing. I hear this a lot, (getting 3xElite is quick/easy) but I have spent an average of 3/4 hours a day in game since November last year, when I first started playing. I got Elite explorer in Feb-ish? Beagle Pint and back. Then I got Elite trader 3 days ago, and that was only because I started mining Painite. Now I need to learn to fight...Currently at Novice 59%
Then again, I'm not sure I play the game how it was intended, in that respect. For example, a couple months in Lyra's Song and a lot of time engineering my Exploration ship, etc. Or maybe I'm just a bit rubbish!
Honestly, if you're doing what you want to do and having fun in the process, I suspect you're playing the game exactly as intended.
