The Phoenix, Cygnus, Orion and the Omphalos

Edited

Ok so my stumbling around Signus and then the summer triangle haven't resolved anything, twas a huge long shot and probably just the result of looking for patterns in the sky were there weren't any.

My jumping off point was mount Parnassus, then the song of the spheres and the sweet swan of Avon, but I could have missed something.

I've really enjoyed the ride, its refreshed my love for ED and got me exploring again.

However its probably very likely our ideas are far too overblown, FD's own interpretation could well be very, very pedestrian.

I am healthily sceptical....but time will tell.

Recently I dove into Egyptian gods looking for any simularities to mother of galaxies (Hathor) and the Omphalos...this brought me towards the myth of the phoenix.

The Elite logo is a phoenix. Could it be so simple...?

Then found the following, you will need a fresh roll of tin foil...

The Cygnus blueprint

Probably hogwash, again painting circles in the sand...

For now back to basics and Tau Ceti to pull in missions and looking for treasure maps...
