It's not like we've had much more correlation with anything else we've speculated on. I think it's worth a spending some time investigating once I turned it upside down I saw right away. The empty spaces made me think of the black globs at the edges of the Raxxla image. Now it's haunting me too
The meaning of the Raxxla symbol is a recurring feature of this thread, so I think it a good idea to remind people of a good observation made several times:

This symbol matches with a 2D representation of a tesseract.
I'm not saying other interpretations of the symbol are necessarily wrong, I'm saying that this observation seems accurate to me. Maybe that's a coincidence to the Raxxla quest, maybe not. Maybe we only find out when we find Raxxla. To me, this is a clue as to what Raxxla (or the Omphalos Rift) is, rather than where it is, though it could even be both and it's just how to use the information that we need to work out.
