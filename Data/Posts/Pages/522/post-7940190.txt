In RH's lore, being worth of being "one of ours" seems to be related to be an Elite combat pilot.
Becoming 3 Elite is now so easy (Explo/Trade is ridiculously easy and as soon as you are rich in billions you can have any OP ship you want and be promoted to Elite fighter in no time..) that I fear you now have to be a CQC/PvP ace, just to be remarked among thousands of 3E players... I hope I'll be proven wrong.
Elite fighter in no time? I have three accounts and haven't made combat Elite yet in any of them. You're making me feel like an underachiever! Maybe I shouldn't keep resetting my accounts so often, but I really enjoy playing this game with sparse resources.
