The meaning of the Raxxla symbol is a recurring feature of this thread, so I think it a good idea to remind people of a good observation made several times:

This symbol matches with a 2D representation of a tesseract.
I'm not saying other interpretations of the symbol are necessarily wrong, I'm saying that this observation seems accurate to me. Maybe that's a coincidence to the Raxxla quest, maybe not. Maybe we only find out when we find Raxxla. To me, this is a clue as to what Raxxla (or the Omphalos Rift) is, rather than where it is, though it could even be both and it's just how to use the information that we need to work out.
The Raxxla symbol also match a projection of a normal cuboctahedron. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron

This the shape used by the Coriolis station, so it's a bit more common in ED than 4D cubes.

It also sort of correspond better with the Dark Wheel logo, that represents a toroid station.
