Since we are talking combat I'll also point out that thargoid scouts count as elite ranked pilots, are numerous, and are easy to kill with an AX combat ship build. Basically if you have trader elite you should have the cash to wip up an AX build. Instead of grinding through the ranks killing the small number of high ranked NPCs you have unlimited elite ranked space bugs.
