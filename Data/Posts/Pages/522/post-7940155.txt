SPOILER

On a serious note, I keep wondering if Guardian technology is actually human. We know that time travel exists in the ED universe, so it's not too crazy. Not sure how that would tie in with anything, though.
Considering the things that open up on the guardian vessels are literally large WW2 lugers from germany that is a good theory. I've wondered about that. So, some artists got really unsubtle in his art design or it's a blatant hint.

Maybe it's like the Nazi's escaping to the antarctic or the moon. But with time travel!!

In fact, maybe the guns are a clue if they really were evolved humans. Maybe the story of ED online is a post time travel one with the after effects of that time jump.. Could explain the differences in the game. It's not a retcon. It's a time travel story...
