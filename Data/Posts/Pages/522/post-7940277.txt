I am not sure I would recognize that discreet test if I were contacted to do some apparently difficult and uninteresting tip-off / mission...
Maybe thousands of players like me simply didn't accept the test... Because they just didn't suspect that was THE test...
I’ve considered the same possibility. People ignoring things which they would have been better off paying attention to would be a good reason for putting that line into the Codex. I know I’ve missed or ignored ‘Mysterious Stranger’ messages. Same for Tip-offs.

The worst one was only spotting a Mysterious Stranger mission after it had expired. It was one of those ‘We’ve detected something unusual on the surface of this planet, cmdr, we’d like you to investigate.’ ones.

Thousands might arguably be a bit too high a number of for TDW, but the numbers of people who miss out on stuff in general is likely in the millions.
