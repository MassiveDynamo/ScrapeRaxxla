Mmhh.. Being pedantic, I'd say right name id not Eldorado, the Eldorado and such, but El Dorado.
Watch this, different wordings and translations may help when searching systems and so.

I don't think there is an 'EL Doradus' system. Not in RL and not in ED.
Only 'EL Aquarii'.

As mythology goes, the names El Dorado and Eldorado are both used without any significant distinction.
