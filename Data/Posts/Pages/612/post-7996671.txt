One can get a pattern from almost anything in ED. There are so many names to chose from.

A funny pattern I found when looking at El Dorado, goes as follows:

El Dorado is also a poem by Edgar Allan Poe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado_(poem)

Eldorado
Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,
In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long,
Singing a song,
In search of Eldorado.

But he grew old—
This knight so bold—
And o'er his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado.

And, as his strength
Failed him at length,
He met a pilgrim shadow—
"Shadow," said he,
"Where can it be—
This land of Eldorado?"

"Over the Mountains
Of the Moon,
Down the Valley of the Shadow,
Ride, boldly ride,"
The shade replied—
"If you seek for Eldorado!"

As can bee seen in the Analysis section, the word 'Shadow' is a key as it changes meaning in each section. It ends with the "pilgrim shadow" who points the way through "the Valley of Shadow".

The Valley of the Shadow of death is originally called 'Sheol', in the Hebrew bibel. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheol

Sheol is of course a moon in ED. It's in the DC-65 76 system, orbiting the same ELW (Jessica's Folly, terraformed) as the station 'Alex's Rest'.

It's at least nice to know how far Alex got.
