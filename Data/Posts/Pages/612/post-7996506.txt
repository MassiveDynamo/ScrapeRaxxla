Correct me if Im wrong but the Codex was the first in-game feature to mention Raxxla, all it does is 'maybe' confirm its there, what it actually does is confirm its a myth that many people have wasted their lives searching for...since 1984 approximately....so what it actually does is re-introduce a much loved bit of lore back into the game but in the same mystical sense it always was. It doesn't actually do anything else.

Some things a tiny bit obvious is the quote, not it a tiny bit obvious. Read into that what you will, I certainly do :0

Saw another YT vid recently that I have happily read into, at one point the Q comes up in chat about Raxxla and DB as usual deflects....then takes a drink (and in my mind is thinking, what can I say?....then says 'You don't know what it is yet'....to my mind he has thought while drinking and the only information he can give safely is that. There was no need for that comment, the drinking broke up the flow of that question, in my mind DB decided to give that info.

So we dont know what it is, let alone where it is, but makes me wonder if the 8th moon will mean anything, and theres more than few tidally locked of them Ive found, just mundane now.

Remember Salome? 2 years people spent delving into ancient myths and legends to solve it and it turns out to be a 'print it out, chop it up and move it around a bit' columnar based solution that had nothing to do with any of it, sometimes people miss the obvious looking for the clue.
