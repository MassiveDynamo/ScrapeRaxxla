If there aren't clues why are we ALL treating the toast like a treasure map? A secret map hidden in a few lines of text would be a clue.

This idea makes me ridiculously irritated.

All ? Nope ! I already said that I am sure that the whole text refers directly and only to Raxxla. Besides, I assume TDW doesn't know where Raxxla is.
Only map ever in ED is (was) encrypted inside SAP 8 core containers and Trinkets of Hidden Fortune.
