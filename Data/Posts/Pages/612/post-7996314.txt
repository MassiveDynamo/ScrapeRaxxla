All ? Nope ! I already said that I am sure that the whole text refers directly and only to Raxxla. Besides, I assume TDW doesn't know where Raxxla is.
Only map ever in ED is (was) encrypted inside SAP 8 core containers and Trinkets of Hidden Fortune.

'Raxxla is something different'.
Comet ? Asteroid ?

The thing that intrigues me is why is the “alleged toast” in the Raxxla codex entry, rather then the Dark Wheel codex entry where logically it should reside? Yes, the last two words are “To Raxxla”, but that is contextually insufficient reason for moving it, so I surmise that it is actually a clue. Or rather a hint as to where to look for the start of the journey.

Edit: there’s a comet in van maanen system? Tyko’s currently working for the permit; I’ll have a look, don’t think I’ve visited a comet yet.

Edit2: No comet at Van Maanen Star's Thurston Gateway. It orbits the white dwarf star, with orbital period 2630666 days, semi major axis 32798984192 km.
Still, rescued some poor blighter who'd no fuel on the way there.
