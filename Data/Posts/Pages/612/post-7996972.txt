A thought I had just a moment ago about the possible prerequisites of a dark wheel invitation.

Has anyone achieved all the trophies/achievements in game yet? I'm sure they are the same across all the platforms. It would be useful to confirm this as I've know other games to use something like this. In gta5's story mode if you 100% all the goals you get Easter egg alien space ships around certain parts of the map at certain times.

It would certainly be a test of skill be and courage considering there are quite a few to achievements and it's not something that is usually known to be easy to do in games.

Thoughts?

Edit: nevermind. It seems there isn't really that many and looking at them they don't seem all that difficult. Bummer would've been nice though
There is still one trophy that I think gives me hope

there are no trophies in-game for PC players. There are a load from EDSM but that's not pukka. Might be related to system permits, but there are about half a dozen apparently without a granting authority.
