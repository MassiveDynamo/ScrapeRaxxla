If there aren't clues why are we ALL treating the toast like a treasure map? A secret map hidden in a few lines of text would be a clue.

This idea makes me ridiculously irritated.

Both the 'No clues' and the 'Little bit obvious' comments should just be ignored. They are old and in the context of a specific interview.

There are clues (the Codex) and they are not obvious at all.
