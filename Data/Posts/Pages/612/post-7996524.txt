Correct me if Im wrong but the Codex was the first in-game feature to mention Raxxla,
Codex was the first feature to mention the word "Raxxla", yes. Before that, it had been called " The Myth."
The One Which Has Not To Be Named !

"You don't know what it is, though"... the next incoming question in the chat. Imho.
He was just calming a suddenly very nervous Will, who was fearing that he should have filtered the inconvenient questions that could make his Boss feel uncomfortable.
'What a silly question ! ' . (What a silly answer !) Just look at their faces and body language. They both feel quite annoyed.
This episode is the one which makes me think that, currently, Raxxla is fluff most.

The Floyd thing was easy to tie in because of the themes which they wrote about - once you start with the Dark Side of the Moon album cover and Salome coming from Prism system everything else is just 'join the dots'.
Join the dots to make emerge a... pattern ?
Aaah those patterns ! We can't escape from them ! (As you very well explained..)

"You have to make it a little bit obvious" according to MB. This implies that the clues exist.
No, I don't think so.
There will be no clues you already said, " Mmmh.. that's true. But I think you have to make some of it a tiny little bit obvious, so people know what they are doing ".
Exact wording, I think. So no clues.
The problem is, nobody currently knows what he is doing, so nothing obvious is left (since they took the E/F missions off,) for now.
