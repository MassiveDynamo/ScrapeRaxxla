Is it worth collecting what we think we know has been definitely said by fdev/DB/MB etc and getting them to confirm it. My hopes aint high but if we get together and ask?

Not asking for new information, just clarity on what has been said by who and what has been mis-reported.

eg Did DB say it was in game from the beginning and discoverable? Yes or No will do.
Did DB say he 'knows why people haven't been able to find it' yes or no
Please confirm or deny the 'honk and moved on' rumour as it keeps coming back with no source so a denial would put it to bed.

Just asking, what have you said and what have you not said but has been attributed to you so we can make sure all the info you have already given is correct in our minds, just clarity as theres bits all over and half the time the source has vanished or isn't even on the Frontier YT channel at all. eg DJ interview is on DJ website, not Frontier.

I interpret the defaced flag comment as meaning the EFP are the real elite military outfit, PF is a “subsidiary” of lesser qualified individuals.

And now this above as well, is this correct or has it changed from then? Clarity is all Im asking for as its an evolving game and storyline.
