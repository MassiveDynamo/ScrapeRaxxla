...He implied the EFP can then make that lower rank up to Elite to reduce the time it takes to get Combat Elite. Has anyone come across this gameplay? I suspect Han_Zen is correct and this mechanism was scrapped in favour of the Founder’s World permit to Shin Dez. The one thing that makes me pause here is the realisation that within Shin Dez Lori Jameson will befriend Dangerous, Deadly and Elite combateers, so perhaps there is a test for EFP via her? Either way I don‘t think it’s anything related to TRDW or Raxxla.
Never experienced any fast track to combat Elite in any of my accounts, which was and still is one of the most time consuming of the three Elite's.
