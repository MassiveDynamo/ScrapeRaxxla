I think DB got things a bit mixed up. Flying a defaced ensign sounds a lot like the federal and imperial naval rank system.

Mmm no I don’t think so. He seemed to be implying that there were different flavours of PF, which is true if EFP are a thing in-game. And it’s the EPF which makes ED dangerous (can’t see this), all talking around the subject of an in-game bounty mechanism applied by PF which would naturally control griefing (big fail there!).
