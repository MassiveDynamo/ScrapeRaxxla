Who do you think attacked them in 1984, long before the Club et al? Who are the 'certain parties' if not the only existing organisation at that time, the PF who had supposedly found and exploited Raxxla for their own ends? There may have been more references in later games I cant remember. I also think there may have been more in the actual manual which introduced you to the Elite universe but I lost that long ago. Or may have been in an interview in BBC Micro magazine at the time or a hundred other long lost sources.

Overall though, its not important today as its been ret-conned. My question is who is the DW now, are they protectors or the mafia basically, are they separate to the Club? I don't know whats what any more or how many different groups there are or where they fit in....it used to be so simple.

So it doesnt say that its the PF and therefore this is your conjecture, but you stated it as a fact. Its easy to start rumours this way. Just trying to be clear, before others get the wrong impression.

Like the 'someone honked it' which has never been verified and is therefore as good as untrue.

The known facts are on the front page, and yes I mean all of them.. anything else is hearsay and surmise (I sound like the man in the shack in HHG2G now...)
