You can speed up combat (and crew) rank using compromised nav beacons eg. LTT 4487 (near SD).
Trust me I did, and I still wonder why there's any pirates left

On another note, the installation at LFT 926, Cluster Belt 1, has a Civilian Installation contact that can be scanned. When scanned, a number of Hackable Maintenance Hatch and a Hackable Comms Array appears. The Satelitte contact does not seem to be scannable with the Data Link Scanner. And there's currently a battle going on...
