Can you substantiate that?

Pretty sure it was in the original statement of 'no clues' but cant find that now. Not the one asked by DJ to MB which confirmed the no clues but the original statement where that came from. think it was 'There will be no clues' and also included that it was 'discoverable' by anybody, no permits needed.

Find that original quote if you can and Im sure its there. If not Ive read it off someone else analysis of that quote and will happily accept that.

and can you substatiate that either ?

if not on either place please do not state as fact that which is rumour..

That ones easy, The Dark Wheel novella in 1984 game. PF was exploiting people or seen as corrupt at the top and DW was set up as the protector or good guys and had found and lost Raxxla. think they were protecting Raxxla from the exploitative PF was the idea.
