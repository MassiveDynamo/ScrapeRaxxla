Firstly Id heard DB say that high off the elliptical plane would be a good place to hide things - so that's 3 areas that has been referred to as somewhere to hide stuff. Also DB has specified Raxxla is discoverable and not permit locked. No such mention of the DW so Im separating the two.

Jorki Rasalas said:
Except Jorki is allied with all of them (except t’ young lass that recently appeared & is Palin’s sacrificial offering to t’thargoids (who’s the nearest engineer to Col 70?)), has been for a long time and never got any mission or been offered any other test from them. But yes, that is another example of the in-game test mechanism. So there is a test for engineer acceptance, there may be a similar test for the mysterious Elite Federation of Pilots, and we hope for
a similar test for TRDW so we can get some hints as to Raxxla’s location.

Yes, agreed, don't think its as simple as just getting allied to them all, that may just be a first step or at least some of them will 'trigger' something else at a certain point or achievement. Which makes me worried that this will be a CG type thing and not really a secretive organisation...time will tell. If they are even in the game atm.
