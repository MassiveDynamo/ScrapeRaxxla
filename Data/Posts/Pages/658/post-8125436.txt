Firstly Id heard DB say that high off the elliptical plane would be a good place to hide things - so that's 3 areas that has been referred to as somewhere to hide stuff. Also DB has specified Raxxla is discoverable and not permit locked. No such mention of the DW so Im separating the two.



Yes, agreed, don't think its as simple as just getting allied to them all, that may just be a first step or at least some of them will 'trigger' something else at a certain point or achievement. Which makes me worried that this will be a CG type thing and not really a secretive organisation...time will tell. If they are even in the game atm.

I suspect they’re in-game as a faction, but under a different name. That would allow all the usual mission mechanisms etc to be discretely used for the test. I know reputation has been in-game from the outset, but was wondering in the early hours (insomnia, again!!!) how long influence has been used? Wonder if you’ve got to tip the influence over a certain limit perhaps, or keep on building reputation beyond Allied 100%? It’s possible there’s a hidden tracker that maintains a higher level for this. DBOBE’s Malmo talk did have “stats tracking” on one of the slides....

Getting a bit fed up with my current hypothesis, I’ve been working for this faction for ages without anything out of the ordinary happening (apart from duplicate structural regulators at two sites I had to retrieve them from). It’s getting tedious. Can’t see anything obvious that could be “a suitable test of courage and skill”; don’t think it’s likely to be an assassination mission; they’re supposed to be adventurers not killers.
