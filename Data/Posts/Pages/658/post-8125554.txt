I interpret the defaced flag comment as meaning the EFP are the real elite military outfit, PF is a “subsidiary” of lesser qualified individuals. IRL a white ensign can only be legitimately flown by British Royal Navy ships and shore establishments, members of the Royal Yacht Squadron and by ships of Trinity House escorting the reigning monarch, and a couple of exceptions.
The tourist beacon 0246 in SD says that: 'There was no way they could satisfy anything like all the demands on them, so they formed "The Elite Federation of Pilots". This was a sub-group of the Pilots Federation'
