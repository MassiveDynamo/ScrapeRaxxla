'Twisted men', Could've been the ciep. Im sure in the vastness of space there would be a near unlimited number of unknown and/or unknowable organizations. Who is to say it wasnt a former DW member that started their own group because of differences in ideology of how to find raxxla or what to do once it was found.

The fact that it was never specifically clarified doesnt confirm that it was anyone specific but exactly the opposite. It could be anyone.
