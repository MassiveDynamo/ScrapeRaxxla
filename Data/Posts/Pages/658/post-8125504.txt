That ones easy, The Dark Wheel novella in 1984 game. PF was exploiting people or seen as corrupt at the top and DW was set up as the protector or good guys and had found and lost Raxxla. think they were protecting Raxxla from the exploitative PF was the idea.

I guess that's not how I read it, hence my comment. Unless you can show me where I missed it, nowhere does it identify the PF as the villians, but maybe I missed it. If you can show me the relevant text, I'm happy to be convinced.
