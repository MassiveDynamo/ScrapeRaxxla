Where are you getting 4.3LY from? If its a book most have been ret-conned after being part of the ret-con in the first place....this conspiracy runs deep.
A while back, FD was testing something called "SingleLightTest" which was a system that appeared on the galaxy map about 4.3Ly from Sol. Some players even spawned in-system when they logged in but at the time it was just a copy of another preexisting one.
