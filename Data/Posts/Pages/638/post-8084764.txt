Excuse my ignorance, but I heard there was an update to the Dark Wheel story but I'm not sure what it was or what it means. Could someone catch me up please.

You might need to give us more to go on. I'm not aware of anything new since the codex was introduced into the game. What did you hear, and from where, and maybe we can help
