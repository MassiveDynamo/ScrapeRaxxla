Thanks! Ya was worried about getting out of the station so I slipped the camera in one of the crews bags.. Mars security picked him up.. so I guess that means I dont have to give him his cut on the last job. Might try this void mining thing next... sounds lucrative.

It is, and quite relaxing. Just remember to let the pirates scan you (or successfully hide) before starting to mine. Use Night vision and after finding a potential asteroid (orange/red/green when PWA used) look for deep core asteroid fissures before using prospector limpet to confirm the payload. Split the 'roid, use collector to get loose ones before abrasion blasting the rest. In a Phantom I got 96 in cargo hold plus 8 more in the refinery. Check best sell price location (Inara or EDDB) & Avoid pirates!
