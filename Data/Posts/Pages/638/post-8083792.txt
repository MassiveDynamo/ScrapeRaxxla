Excuse my ignorance, but I heard there was an update to the Dark Wheel story but I'm not sure what it was or what it means. Could someone catch me up please.
Imprint by Andy Redman. Stories of the life on the frontier, two collections of novels. Elite: Legacy
by Michael Brookes. Lots of fan novels and official Elite dangerous novels too.

/apparently there was a sequel planned for The Dark Wheel, but that was not to be.
//of course there are other kinds of outside influences too. This is just a reminder for a certain Twitch streamer interested in lore.
