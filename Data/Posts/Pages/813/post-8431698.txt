Maybe we could make friends with the Thargoids. Let's go gank the Xeno hunters that target the NH signal sources. Anti-Xeno methods are generally set for bug killing only so I don't think they would fair well with the addition of Human ships on the side of the Thargoids.
I guess the true Raxxla was the thargoid friends we could've made along the way
