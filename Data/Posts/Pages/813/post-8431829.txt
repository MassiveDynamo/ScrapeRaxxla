Maybe we could make friends with the Thargoids. Let's go gank the Xeno hunters that target the NH signal sources. Anti-Xeno methods are generally set for bug killing only so I don't think they would fair well with the addition of Human ships on the side of the Thargoids.
Guardian weapons wipe humans so good too.
