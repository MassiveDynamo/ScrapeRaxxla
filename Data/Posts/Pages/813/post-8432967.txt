Found 32 barnacles on one of the Pleiades systems, up from 2 last time I was there. Went back to Celaeno to investigate the Black Flight comms relay station. Swapped exploration Phantom for batle Krait 2, including swapping out all AX weapons for conventional PA + MC & fuel scoop/FSD booster for HRP. Popped over to relay station expecting a dozen angry Elite black ops fighters all intent on terminating me and protecting their secrets. No aggression whatsoever! Admittedly I dropped out of SC almost in the structure so went straight round the shiplog uplink points, grabbed all the logs, went quietly back to Artemis Lodge to regain the exploration ship. Not unhappy, my hands are still hurting!
But there is a logical sequence to some of these in-game things. I think the relay station logs were supposed to reveal a couple of wreck sites and existence of thargoid surface structures (mother ships??). Of course things happen non-sequentially in a game like this (I visited these wreck sites a while ago after seeing the list on the Canonn site), but pondering whether part of the “personal journey” is visiting the relay station, various wrecks, surface sites, etc. DB did intimate in one of the vids that the personal journey was based on following missions around the bubble.
