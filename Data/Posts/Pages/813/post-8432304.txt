Potential spoiler.

Generation Ship Thetis refers to a signal picked up from/around an uninhabited planet and gives an approx. range. Doesn't specify type or whether landable or not.

Currently looking in that range, as expected nothing so far and probably just fluff but maybe that's the DW station and that's a clue or maybe a hint towards Raxxla. Cant find anywhere that anyone has found anything connected and 99% don't expect to find anything but checking just in case....and its fun just to chase a mystery.

If you look closely at the message it is definitely a partial Comms Log picked up so human in origin, but where from? I haven't got all the Comms Log by any means and cant make any I do have fit the message but wondering if that's all it is or something more.

Anybody know if all the Gen Ships left from the same place (Sol, Tau Ceti?) or were they built and launched from all over? Is there one point of origin or more than one? Currently assuming from or near Sol for directional vector but have no idea what the lore is.
