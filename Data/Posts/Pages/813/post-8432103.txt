The war between Thargoids and Guardians started because the Guardians settled on planets that were seeded with Barnacles. We did more or less the same in the Pleiades, so I guess a conflict was unavoidable.
It does however seem that we can work on our personal reputation with the goids, by donating cargo they like or supporting them in AX CZ.
