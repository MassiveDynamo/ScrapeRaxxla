The only choice I've been aware of in game was back when we still had AXCZs. You were able to choose the thargoid side of the fight. Im surprised gankers weren't all over that tbh since ax and guardian are not very effective against human ships.

The choice was supposed to be whether to fight or befriend thargoids. CZ selection of side to fight for would loosely fit, but the fight had already started by then so the choice should have been available long before-around the time when hyperdictions started. Several of us tried flashing lights, etc to try to communicate with thargoids but no result. Might be worth trying this as a tactic if AX CZ ever return to see if you can cuddle up to a goid; seem to remember MB had a plush UA at one time!
OOOOOHH! Actually perhaps that was a hint at the befriending mechanism? Something to do with UAs?? We never did get round to fully solving the UA riddle, but they are thargoid sensors, so perhaps their function was to detect friends as well as enemies?
