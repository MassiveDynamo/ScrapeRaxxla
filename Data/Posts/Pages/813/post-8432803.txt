Mm, interesting and instructive points there! Never heard of "Tour of the Universe” before, but Starfriend for Astrophil seems convincing. I had been wondering where “the childrens story of princess astrophel” came from and fitted in.

The only problem with this hypothesis is that FD (I think both DB and MB) have said they have only implemented one galaxy in-game, so if Raxxla is an intergalactic gateway it can’t have much on the far end. But nice post mate!

Thanks! - Ya still marginally searching for those cunningly concealed facts
