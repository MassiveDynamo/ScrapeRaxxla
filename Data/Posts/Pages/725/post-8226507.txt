As much as I like a conspiracy theory, comparing Nazi gold with real life & death consequences to an riddle in a game with very little real life consequences is a very poor strawman.

Do conspiracies exist? Sure.

Can a secret be kept among many people? Sure.

But only if the consequences are so heavy that leaking the secret is unthinkable or that the conspirators are so vested in the same interest that leaking the secret is unthinkable.

I was just supporting Vetinari's idea by equating the real-life collaboration of a life-long secret ( Nazi gold ) as an example, to the kinda real-life collaboration necessary to create Raxxla. One would think it not possible, but clearly, such collaborations are possible.
