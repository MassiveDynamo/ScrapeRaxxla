Has anyone ever seen a star system that the planets were marked with Roman numerals as opposed to the usual Planet (A) planet (B) ?

the system Isis which I had marked on my Raxxla search had it , thought it was rather strange being first time I saw that, but didn’t do tooo deep of a dive into the system because it didn’t seem to fit my vibe for Raxxla but

Isis had some Egyptian mythology ties (paraphrasing) I think some cosmic goddess status plus depicted with a headdress that looks to have a jewel,

But I just couldn’t really buy the idea the FD would drop Raxxla in a system Isis of all places...but hey she was a thing before the other thing so..
