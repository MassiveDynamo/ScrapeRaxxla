I’ve been thinking about the Astrophel and Spiralling Stars from the codex which I originally discounted but have had a rethink. Well, did a bit more checking of the New Scientist Astrophile (close to “Astrophel”) hypothesis:03Aug 2012: Tale of woe, star-cross’d lovers: The Most Cruel Death of Cupid and Belinda: https://www.newscientist.com/articl...uel-death-of-cupid-and-belinda/#ixzz69cmKCuuI, but searched around there again this afternoon & found nothing, though did get a Search&Rescue AspX named Home which raised my hopes for a short while (“place that is not a place”->”there’s no place like home”). Also checked out the trojan asteroid possibility (28March 2013: mighty Trojan marches with Uranus: A 60-kilometre-wide asteroid 3 billion kilometres ahead of Uranus, in the Uranus-Sun L4 Lagrange point (9590 ls, 19.2184 AU to both Sun & Uranus): https://www.newscientist.com/articl...jan-found-marching-with-uranus/#ixzz69clZ0q1r) and the Mira possibility (14Oct2011: Mira spiral structure: More recent observations by the Herschel space telescope have revealed another curious detail – what appears to be a spiral structure in the head of the comet-like cloud that contains Mira itself and a companion star. The spiral may result from the way the companion disturbs the gas shed by Mira as it moves around in its orbit.
