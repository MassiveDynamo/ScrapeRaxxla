Has anyone ever seen a star system that the planets were marked with Roman numerals as opposed to the usual Planet (A) planet (B) ?

Isis had some Egyptian mythology ties (paraphrasing) I think some cosmic goddess status plus depicted with a headdress that looks to have a jewel,

Elite RA symbol reminded me to that goddess. Maybe the system is not related to Raxxla, but definitely intriguing if there is some story behind.
