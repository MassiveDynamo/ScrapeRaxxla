Whether it is a station or ship or such... I'd say there is a decent chance. It would avoid being listed on maps that way while still being in a fixed position.

But I think it is much more logical for fdev to make it a destroyed planet with its remnants littered as an asteroid field. That makes it very hard to find, explains why nobody has found it in the lore. It also makes it possible for fdev to not have to worry about creating content for it or dealing with its Discovery afterwards in game.... As anything of importance could be shown as destroyed and now useless. Which plays well into their hand as an intact raxxla would have to become a major plot point and raxxla isn't meant to be one... As it's not meant to be found at any given time.
