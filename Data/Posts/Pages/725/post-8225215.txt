Where is all the Nazi gold? The assets of its victims looted, transported, hidden and laundered in collusion with many collaborative institutions, but no one knows where.

As much as I like a conspiracy theory, comparing Nazi gold with real life & death consequences to an riddle in a game with very little real life consequences is a very poor strawman.

Do conspiracies exist? Sure.

Can a secret be kept among many people? Sure.

But only if the consequences are so heavy that leaking the secret is unthinkable or that the conspirators are so vested in the same interest that leaking the secret is unthinkable.
