Hello everyone
I think "raxxla" is the position of the secret but I don't have the knowledge for calculate it... and I'm sorry for make more noise about that.

RA: "right ascension" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension
XX: coordinates (hour and minutes) ??
LA: latitude ??

I think I'm going crazy with this
Sky Maps: RA dec click practice
