That's pretty much where I am. I thought a new player with no previous knowledge of any game or lore must be able to have the right info and the correct lore. Was just unsure where it was apart from the Codex or what was current and not. Before the Codex, was Raxxla or the Dark Wheel mentioned in game and if so how? Im not sure a new player now would even know about the books let alone read them, theres nothing to tell you about them until you search on here.

AFAIK Raxxla had 0 mentions by name in the game itself before the Codex was introduced. There were the E/F missions that started this thread though they only used broad hints to 'that place' etc. Never used the word itself.

The Dark Wheel are mentioned in game only by the name of the minor faction in Sinrarta Dehzra and in the texts of the E/F missions.

However the official novels have plenty. I haven't read all of them yet, but Raxxla is mentioned in And Here The Wheel and in Premonition (apparently in some others too) so the concept of Raxxla was implied in what, at the time, was canon lore.

I would recommend And Here The Wheel to any Raxxla or Dark Wheel hunter - there are some very specific hints. I shan't spoil the novel, but some key facts are mentioned there-in.
