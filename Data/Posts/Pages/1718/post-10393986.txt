A thought about the Axis in the Garden in Tourism Stations. If we are equating that to the Garden of Paradise ( Adam and Eve statues)… maybe there is a Hell station? My first thought would be a Prison Station…. well initially i thought of Blake and his Green and pleasant land vs the Satanic Mills ( so industrial stations)… but if paradise is tourism, i think the opposite would be a Prison… And the best Prison station i think would be the ex prison asteroid base in Artemis… but not seeing any Symbols there….

something ive always found interesting about prisons is the computer screen in the cell - is running the Cobra operating system… EDs proprietary game engine which created the game…. The ghost in the machine?

There might be another prison type or something else that might fit though…
