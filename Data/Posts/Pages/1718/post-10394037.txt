...But in all seriousness, I'm not sure any of you have talked about the reason why a clue to Raxxla would be represented in every Tourist station in the bubble in the form of one specific garden that looks a bit like one specific illustration from an ancient book.

So what's the narrative lore here that makes this garden mak
Because the Empire gave us everything worth a damn or more precisely Jaques did.

Jaques is...
Founder of Pilot's Federation
Peter Jameson
Augustus Brenquith
Timothy Brewer
Jordan-Blakestow (Gutamaya shipwright)
Raffe Zetter
.. The Architect
.. a Construct (but the question is which one)
.. and probably a few others

Coriolis - designed by Jaques
Orbis - designed by Jaques
Ocellus - designed by Jaques

Which means whomever finds it, is going to have some difficult choices to make. Amita Gutamaya died under mysterious circumstances in 3006, much like Jason Ryder. Do you trust Jaques? I sure as hell don't.
