I do agree that more of the tourism stations need checking -- my suggestion would be check tourism for Coriolis (these exist per INARA but are just fairly rare), Orbis, and Ocellus before proceeding to the next step. That said, my gut says we should be searching for either the gate to the sacred grove or the grove itself. Per Milton this contained the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. I would expect this to implemented as a relatively close grouping of systems. I think Rochester's map thus far is for the Tree of Life but we need Tree of Knowledge to get a proper lead on Raxxla. I also suspect we are looking for an agriculture system. The text may give us some waypoints to be on the look out for as we search. That said, Frontier loves alternative names for places so be aware that may muddy the waters here.
