This generally what I have been looking at using the garden axis as a potential guide - possibly a visual path as opposed to the textual one of the Toast.



Possibly a guide in plain sight … for those with eyes to see…

Just looking at this i think it is the pencil trees - in the large scale there is the four trees in the central circle - match the four trees outside the System Level ….
