The varied station interiors were introduced in ... 2.3, I think? Before that there were only the palm-tree (extremely rare) and "industrial/military" default designs.

System economy changes don't affect them - the system economy is only the sum of the station economies anyway.
Station economy changes are incredibly rare (and basically Frontier-only) and I've only seen one be applied to a large orbital station (which was Jaques Station, which is such an anomalous case anyway that it probably can't be used to draw conclusions from)
