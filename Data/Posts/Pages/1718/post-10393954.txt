Next question: Is the layout of the Garden is exactly the same as the common Milton-inspired illustration of the Paradise Lost cosmos? If this has already been checked feel free to point me to the post(s) and I'll read them.

Well like everything here… that would be an ecumenical matter.

The graphic is not ‘identical’ as in not proportional accurate, but there are at most a few different historical illustrations using that layout, these were interpretations - after the fact, from texts that interrogated Milton’s prose, they weren’t technically ‘official’ illustrations but academic maps of linguistics.

But in comparison, it is strikingly similar, and nothing to my awareness looks exactly like it…
