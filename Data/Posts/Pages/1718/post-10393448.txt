The garden is a systemic feature based on the Tourism archetype. So if it relates to the station, then what other aspect of the station might help glean something related?

There is still an unsolved mystery behind the dynamically changing signals emitted from the internal station 'core'. Heard loudest at the central spire directly above the rearmost landing pads.
This recording I took from Donars Oak in Delphi for example.

I know people have scoured these for any method of decoding the shapes, but it might be a wise investigation to isolate / rule out whether this signal is related in any way to the Tourism stations and thus the garden designs.
