Establishing an understanding of what to look for is definitely important.
Back when we were verifying the existence of the gardens pre-2015 I did a quick check of what people understood of these spawn systems so I'll make this a reference point for myself if anyone needs it.

There are six for , , and station variants, which are determined by the star system's , and :

So... all Tourism Stations are the "Milton Garden" types? No exceptions, no variations?

Has anyone been the check Drew's station yet to see if that's the Milton-type interior? If not, that's important because Drew specifically said his was changed by his request - which means we can immediately rule out the relationship between Milton-type interiors and the station location as being important (or his wouldn't have been changed by Brookes himself since it would have messed up whatever theoretical sequence he was doing, and Brookes would have known that obviously).

My assumption right now is that the location of the "Milton Garden" stations isn't relevant until something comes along to prove otherwise (I mean, I know it's not, but you guys are working on your own stuff so let's roll with that).

Therefore, it's either the layout of the Garden itself, or the Sound, as you identified.

Next question: Is the layout of the Garden is exactly the same as the common Milton-inspired illustration of the Paradise Lost cosmos? If this has already been checked feel free to point me to the post(s) and I'll read them.
