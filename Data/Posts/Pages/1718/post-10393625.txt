Do such garden designs spawn constantly in the same stations?

Do such designs spawn constantly in the same location in the same stations?

Are they persistent!

What links these stations or systems together?

They are all supposedly in tourist systems, so do we know where they all ought to be, but do they spawn in every one of these locations - constantly?

As @Louis Calvert points out, what audio is persistent, which types of missions or factions could link these together?

If they are random does this lower the overall reliability; does this lower the likelihood of other elements actually existing?

I accept they could be outright wholly irrelevant, but equally I can entertain they could just be environmental.

That was a concept alien to me until recently. I previously questioned FD Support over something Arthur once said, and they confirmed some things the CM says are hints towards ‘environmental narratives’.

To me that provided an additional dimension to the lore, it can exist in game and have no direct cause and effect, and can also be there to present a concept which alludes to something off stage, or behind the curtain,

There is no true way to know, but like always we must accept there is a likelihood they are false, but we can never truly be certain, only accept that we know nothing.

I may have had wine so my thinking may be somewhat liminal at present.
