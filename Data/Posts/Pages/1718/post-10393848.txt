The varied station interiors were introduced in ... 2.3, I think? Before that there were only the palm-tree (extremely rare) and "industrial/military" default designs.

System economy changes don't affect them - the system economy is only the sum of the station economies anyway.
Station economy changes are incredibly rare (and basically Frontier-only) and I've only seen one be applied to a large orbital station (which was Jaques Station, which is such an anomalous case anyway that it probably can't be used to draw conclusions from)

It's very possible then that Drew was talking about the Palm-tree type since his anecdote seemed to relate to a very early time when he was still actively working communicating with Frontier, and Brookes specifically. Someone should check just to be sure.
